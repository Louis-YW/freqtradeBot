People just believe the next halving event will create another super bullrun.Determined profit will only be obtained if you involved into centralized investment schemes.

But it can be less than that or more depending on if you really monitor it all day.And the trading pair I used there is Btc-usdt, I don't know about other altcoins, because for me it is pretty safe when you do a trading activity with Bitcoin to get a profit every day. To be honest, there is no such thing as a fixed amount of income here in crypto trading.",

Too bad he's dead.Anyway, seriously, if that's your approach with bitcoin or any other type of asset you're going to end up losing all the money in a very short amount of time either doing something risky or getting scammed. You're looking to make 2.5% daily (more with compounding), it's doesn't make any sense, it's not feasible.",

Well whatever value of bitcoin it is, my advise to you is to hodl your worth of bitcoin because you are seeking a specified amount of profit and that is not certain in crypto trading. The certain phenomenon in crypto is that it value fluctuate and that is also how your profit margin can fluctuate and not remain stagnant. Or you can convert your bitcoin to fiat and loan it out on a particular fixed interest by the month end.",

But as your account is new, i don't know how much experience you have in trading but I think you should get familiar with trading fundamentals so that you could achieve your daily target. It's not fixed either in daily trading to book 100$ in only BTC because for that you need years of experience. In order to earn 100$ daily you need to diversify your money so that if one goes down then you could make a profit from another and in this way, you can achieve the target of $100. But still, the market is so unpredictable to make $100 dollars every day. Take an example of the recent down of BTC on 19th April, almost $260 million dollars were liquidated in only 1-hour candle when BTC drops only $1000 dollars. Even though i have seen no news that could cause this trend, instead, all it was doing is unexpected correction still BTC is bleeding but just for the short term, in the long run, their are high chances of BTC to reach around $40k in May.",

You are not good at trading; if you were, that would have been beneficial to you in taking advantage of price volatility, but since you are unskilled about it, it would be a bad idea.",

It is however possible to make such profits sometimes but that doesn't happen everyday, and only those can earn $100 or more per day who have great knowledge about trading. From your asking style I got the idea that you aren't well aware of crypto trading so making that much is not possible for you.Like other respected members have said investing and holding for longer is a safe option for you. But, only invest in Bitcoin do not invest in any other altcoin. I would recommend you to divide your capital into 4 parts and only buy when the market is going down. Do not buy in bull market because you will end up loosing half of your capital.You can't make $100 a day from any other field not even from crypto. In crypto world there were some Dao projects that were promising huge gains but as far as my knowledge everyone who invested in such projects have lost their money. Do not fall into the trap of the influencers, their main intention is to earn from you trough AdSense and other products.",
