  "content": "https://www.blockdata.tech/products/altlayer-platform\"The AltLayer Network is a platform designed to allow application developers to launch highly scalable and disposable optimistic rollup-like execution layers. It can be seen as a system of individual optimistic rollups that derive security from an underlying Layer 1 or Layer 2, with each rollup tailored to a specific application.The system is designed for a multi-chain and a multi-VM world and therefore will have default support for EVM as well as WASM. As a result, AltLayer will not be tied to a single Layer 1 or Layer 2 but can operate as a modular and pluggable scaling solution for all EVM and WASM compatible chains.\"AltLayer Alpha Devnethttps://devnet.altlayer.io/It is possible that users of the test network will receive rewards, but this is not certain",
