  "content": "project stopMy original intention of creating this coin is to hope that the CPU miners who have been in a weak position for a long time can unite and win the round.But then I found out that this is impossible at all, CPU miners have been weak for a long time, this is not caused by external factors, but caused by CPU miners themselves, most CPU miners are like vampires, they just mine and sell immediately, Not to mention the many botnet miners.So, I took the initiative to end it all and join the ranks of anti-CPU mining.",

We will spend 99% of our energy on core development. Next, we will enable seed nodes at a certain block height to achieve better decentralization.Like this new way of seeing things, indeed too much hassle managing a discord channel, a million questions asked a bazillion times. hehe Any peers to put to .conf, have no connections active.",

Less than 40% and it is going down.Why turn on PoS right at the start? This is very unfair to people 2 days into your little pre-mined game let alone 5 days in. PoS should start later. Block 10k or so. This allows a bunch of people to mine a decent amount in a few week's time. Gives ample opportunity for a wide range of people to own the coin to stake with. Now, you watch, the top 5 will have 90% of the coins and the scraps to everyone else (except threadripper people... they will OWN this coin!)Kill it indeed. Release with more decentralization in mind. Eliminate the go'damn pre-mine. What are we, 12? Come on children. Get with the times. MN and Pre-Mine are so 2020.",

That is, until they dump 50K on an exchange to give us an opportunity to compete against the dev staking walletsEDIT: also...with the stated block time of 120 seconds and an emission of 1CMC/block, it would take 1388 days (almost 4 years) for community mined/staked coin count to even match the premine.",
