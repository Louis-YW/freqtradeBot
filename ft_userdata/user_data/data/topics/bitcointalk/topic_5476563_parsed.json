      "body": "I just finished up work and poked around on the internet some. There is no mention of this final sale anywhere that I can find. I searched in Finnish using a VPN as well. Nothing. This great news if true, but it is suspicious that there is no mention of this event on the website or internet that has any announcement or explanation. In 2020 they announced all final sales and auctioned them on Bitcointalk. Seems like they would do something similar. Their website has pretty clear descriptive announcements for all this in 2020. No recent posts. In the small chance this is NOT a big scam, I think we could do a group buy and drop ship with a courier service.",
