By \"real\" crypto casinos, I mean online casinos that operate exclusively using bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies), rather than just allowing players to make deposits and withdrawals using cryptocurrencies. Does anyone have any recommendations or know of any good ones to check out?I have a few that I play regularly that I don't want to mention here, but I'm always on the lookout for new options that are worth exploring. Unfortunately, it seems like most casinos require registration before you can take a look around inside.Thanks in advance for your help!note:* Just because this topic isn't self-moderated doesn't mean you can spam here.

If this kind of casino is what you are looking for then I can help you to find more but most of them is same like this that is not reputable because they are not popular to be tested.The other one is this https://play.zkasino.io/ but still on testnet but this casino is really   promising because it embodies the true decentralized casino.",

If you've exhausted searching for a reputable casino in search engines it might be a good place to start.Make sure you do good research before picking one though (1xbit is a scam and there may be others - especially newer ones) but most of these don't have support and discussion threads on the forum too so that might be one good way of determining if they're reputable or not (as well as checking their trust list) and that a site with one of those threads doesn't have a self moderated warning just above the op.",

I don't have any to recommend because based on my search, it accept also other cryptocurrencies like altcoins. Otherwise, it accepts also fiat through bank or debit card so I don't see such a casino that only focuses on BTC.",

Deposits using Bitcoin are instant, so you get your money into your account even before there is an on-chain confirmation. The coins don't get converted into fiat, and you wager in mBTCs. I would be careful experimenting with new sites despite what anyone says. Stick with what's been around for years and has established a reputation. It's like if a new BTC wallet comes out.
