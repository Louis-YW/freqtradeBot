  "content": "Hi there, I'm hoping someone here can help me as I've obviously made a mistake.The HDD where I keep my wallet was almost full, so I decided to remove the old HDD, install a new larger HDD and go from there.  After starting Bitcoin Core, pointing it at the new HDD and waiting a few days for it to sync, it now appears that my balance has gone to 0.00000 btc.  Where did I go wrong?  I should have .40btc.I'd be really grateful if someone could point out where I made my mistake.Bitcoin Core version v0.15.1 (64-bit)Windows 10 ProAMD Ryzen 7 3700XWallet is emptyhttps://imgur.com/CI44Keh",

If you didn't do that, you should do it before doing anything else.Then, just copy your old wallet.dat.You may want to upgrade your Bitcoin Core version (see News link above this page).
