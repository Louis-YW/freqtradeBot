Even though in this case there are pros and cons, it seems that the response proposed by Kraken has received a positive response from several groups, even though currently the IRS is looking for extensive information regarding the Kraken case, but whatever happens, we will see the next trial, Whether Kraken's lawsuit against the IRS will result in a positive decision for Kraken, of course this will give rise to a lot of certainty from Kraken, an interesting case to monitor.",

It's good to hear that Kraken is going to fight back with a lawsuit to limit the data they are going to share with IRS. However, I doubt if the ruling will be in their favour because from the look of things it's like Kraken is being targeted by the US government.",

It doesn't matter that there is no specific regulation that charges taxes for selling stones that you find in the mountains or dog shit. If you buy a rock or dog shit from me for $1 and sell it for $1K, the IRS is going to want to tax the $999 profit.",

Depends, on how far over the $20k is was, if they did file any paperwork on it and a host of other things.Back when Coinbase sent over a bunch of info (2017? 18? don't remember) there were a lot of people talking gloom and doom about the coming audits. For the most part a lot of people who got letters who could prove that they did not make profits, or at least provided paperwork showing no profit the IRS went away. The people who mined 100BTC back in 2009 and sold it for 17500 a coin in 2017 and didn't report any of it. They got in some trouble. But for the most part, the IRS is easy to deal with.

This may mean that they have to pay large sums of money that may exceed their ability at the present time.The thing that is fundamentally surprising to me is why Kraken agrees to submit to the IRS,  I am really surprised why they are forced to provide such sensitive data about their users to the American IRS???!!!

I can only imagine that they don't report their wealth for so long that the fine is growing rapidly, and the IRS left them so they can just take a ton of money out of them. Sometimes they also deliberately move their wealth overseas to avoid tax, and so on. At least that's what happened in my country. Luckily they don't tax crypto aggressively here.",

The founder Jesse Powell is also an American, I reckon.Kraken used to be based in San Francisco but they pulled out:https://cointelegraph.com/news/kraken-shuts-down-global-headquarters-as-san-francisco-is-not-safe“We shut down Kraken’s global headquarters on Market Street in San Francisco after numerous employees were attacked, harassed and robbed on their way to and from the office.”However they still say they are a US based entity:\"While we [Kraken] have no plans to change our status as a US-based entity, the location of our headquarters doesn’t affect how we run our business.\"If Jesse is American then even if they weren't a US based entity, I think they would be subject to the IRS just because of him. And if he flouted the law then I guess if he stepped on American soil they could arrest him at the airport type of thing.So unless he also relinquished his american citizenship it wouldn't matter what type of entity they were and where they claimed or considered themself to be based.Quote from: dansus021Wait wait wait did IRS want all customer data even tho the customer is not from US? or I am missing something here?that part is not so clear but from the story it sounded like they wanted \"tax ID numbers\" for these people so I think that applies to americans. tax id could be a SSN for example. Kraken said that it must nevertheless provide the IRS with profile information and transaction records for customers who transacted more than $20,000 in any year between 2016 and 2020.
