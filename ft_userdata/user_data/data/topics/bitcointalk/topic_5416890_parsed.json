Outro.I create this guide because i have seen a lot of giveaways in the past selecting the users from random.org or wheelofnames.com, and that isn't a fair way to select a winner because the organizer could roll multiple times the site until he gets the result he wants. So, i highly recommend to always provide a seed or a hash to make the game fair for all.  Update.As some users realize both ways could be rigged with collusion. And the way to make it 100% provably fair is to bring an element from the future, like the hash of the block number 100 from now and add that data to the string before the sha256 encryption.",

I am quite confused if purpose is what I just explained earlier or you share this because you are doing yourself a giveaway which this will be used to determine in your giveaway if I am not wrong.Hello nakamura12, this is just a tutorial for those users who want to make a giveaway in the forum on a fair way for the users.The casinos use a similar logic to prove their fairness and is important to teach people how to use this tools and the logic behind it, i'm not planing to make a giveaway, i just want to show you the right way to do it.",

But my guess is that a crypto casino will lie and say that their games are provably fair but they are actually not. Is that what you mean? We can just say that those casinos are not trusted but we shouldn't put a hate to the word provably fair itself. Provably fair is important in the world of cryptos because it was like its main security or indication to tell if the service is legit or not but no doubt the op's post is great.It will help those giveaway organizers to use it instead of the online tools that they are commonly using. It's kind a weird though if they are dealing with cryptos and then they won't use something which are also related to it.",

Not every time LoyceV is going to get it done freely. I think this method by LoyceV is a fairly enough fair giveaway method when it comes to picking the winner without having any influence. I used to use a centralized system though it was paid where I didn't have influence and every roll would have a link to verify. But still, this seems the best to me.",
