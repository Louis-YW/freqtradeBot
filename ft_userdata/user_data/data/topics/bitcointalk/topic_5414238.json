I hope your replies will help more newbies and junior members like me.I am posting it here because most of senior bitcoiners are regular here and their advices are very precious Thank-you!!!",

It would be better if you can tell us such as the basics (sending/receiving, transaction, security), mining, trading, technical side so people can give you links of articles, videos, etc.What are the outcome of your first research(if you did). Anyway, the links provided can give you knowledge just step by step and understand. Don't make a big step because it will only give you confusions. Good luck.",

      "body": "dumbed down very basic conceptimagine a bitcoin transaction like a bankers chequeit lists the input UTXO(from source of the funds), the output(destination), the value(amount the destination will get) and is signed.the signatures are special because they are unique to the transaction(cheque) using cryptography to produce a signature using a secret key of the source funds address, and signing a message of the transaction contentthus changing the destination address or amount or any detail of the transaction changes the content thus makes the signature not match.. meaning no one can edit a transaction apart from the true owner of the source fundsunlike cheques.. this transaction is given to everyone but only the destination gets the amount to spend. so its safe to give to everyone that wants to see itthere are special cheque clearing houses called mining pools. they collate lots of transactions together into batches called blocksthese blocks include an identity of the previous block of transactions. thus chaining the blocks together..  hense blockchainthe ID is an encrypted hash of the contents. so editing anything in current block or previous blocks changes the ID's which no longer match.. thus easy to spot if anyone tried to send a block with edited content..a blockchain is the mega database that many many people have copies of which means no 1 person can delete/edit the database because everyone has it and compare which versions are correct/unedited/match the hashes and are complete. and ignore/reject any copies that dont meet the rules.. everyone has all transactions in blocks ever made. (all cheques in batches ever made) so everyone has their own copy to reference and not rely on othersthey they can all audit that all values moved correctly and everyone deserves what they got. anyway lets get into how transactions are confirmed(cheques are cleared)the mining pools(clearing houses). double check that all the transactions they collate are valid in their newly collated block. and the format of the block is correct to meet the rules everyone follows when they do their checks.each pool is collting their own transaction lsit. and its a competition of the fasted pool to solve a block gets their block added to the blockchain. so the mining pools add a reward amount that meets rules of reward amounts to that block they made to pay themselves that amount if their block is confirmed into the blockchain... and then.. they create a unique ID for that block. which involves creating a header for that block that contains an merkle rood(id hash) for the transaction list plus the previous block ID and a few other things, and then hashing that block header.. which is ultimately via a couple step process hashing the block datathey work hard changing a given variables allowed to be changed(nonce/extranonce) until they have an ID that matches another rule about difficulty.. where the prefix of the ID has to have a number of zeros.(more zeros is more difficult to achieve)which is a complicated thing to hash lots of times editing the variable to get an ID that meets this difficult to achieve prefix. but if someone gets it its considered a solved block.. they broadcast that block to everyone.. before another mining pools gets a solved blockeveryone sees that it all meets the rules and they keep that block as the latest addition to the blockchain.thus fixing it in and confirming it as valid. thus all transactions listed in the block are validbecause blocks are linked together by an id of previous block. there can only be one winning block per session(as there can only be one block linked to the previous block in the chain). meaning its a competition for the first mining pool to get a solved block and transmit it to the network before others. then once seen by the network. the mining pools use that now confirmed blocks ID as the 'previous id' hash to add into the next block collated transaction list attempt and the next session begins..every 2016 blocks the difficulty adjusts to meet a rule.. if 2016 blocks were made in less than 2 weeks it means they were made too fast so it becomes more diffult for the next blocks(more zeros on ID prefix)this is so, basic math an average block is made hopefully on an average of 10minutes..the reward rule is that fir the first 210,00 blocks each block gets 50btc. rewarded to the block solver. and at each 210,00 block interval (average 4 years) this reward amount halves.  t the time of posting this the reward is only 6.25 as there have been several \"halving\" eventsif you total up how many coins are rewarded and calculate it out over all halving events until no more halvings can happen down to the decimal level.. there will eventually be only ~just short of 21m btc ever made. and this rule is a hard rule no one dares ever to break. which gives bitcoin a hard rule of coins supply limit...as for other security thingsif anyone wanted to randomly remove a confirmed transaction from the blockchain. then the ID of that previous block wont match which means the next block wont calculate to match either. this can easily be spotted if an edit happened if someone was to send you a different blockchain list . because the ID that needed alot of work to find no longer matches the content..this allows people to reject edited blocks easilythus making the data secure because the data has to match the ID and vice versa. protecting the data from edits.where by to even attempt to edit an old block you then have to do the hard work of rehashing a new id that meets the difficulty rule and then the next block to catch up or overtake the height of the blockchain everyone is following to overtake the network to try to make your version the supreme copy to follow.. which costs even more the further back you go to then edit and catch up.. thus. the more blocks back(confirmations) your transaction is the safer it is from ever being editedat currenttime of posting it costs over $100k of just electric (and billions of hardware) to edit 1 block(confirmation) thus not worth editing it to remove a transaction of low value.people spending pocket money mounts dont care much for 1 confirmation payment security... but for mansion amounts people wait until their transaction is 3-6 blocks deep before trusting it wont be edited out. everyone simply follows a chain of blocks that are all valid and had enough work done on the ID's that no small guy can simple edit a block and then hash a new id. thus everyone only follows the blocks with lots of work done,",

The place that they could start is the Beginners & Help section of the forum. They would be able to check How to earn BTC, beginner wallets, and many more basic topics that you might possibly be interested. Anyway, I think the best thing to utilize here is the search function to check different sections on a topic that might be existing already. This is best to keep the forum clean and prevent repetitive topics on the forum. Some resource that you might be interested in: https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/",

Recommending to learn more about bitcoin (specifically, not cryptos!), does sound like a life advice to me now more, though. There's a mountain of information to study. I'd begin with learnmeabitcoin.com as I consider it a treasure for the Bitcoin community. @mk4 also shared some good links. Also: Use this place a lot.
