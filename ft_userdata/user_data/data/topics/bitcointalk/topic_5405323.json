Competitions are not as lopsided as they once were, as there are a lot of good teams now, it is difficult to determine who is the favorite and who is not...Netherlands, Spain, Germany, England, and Sweden are the teams that stand out imo.Anyways, i've got a little teaser for today's opener:I watched highlights from both the Austrian and English teams' most recent friendlies. England scored four goals vs. Switzerland and probably missed at least ten more (i'm not kidding), while Austria had trouble beating Belgium 1-0. The Swiss team is ranked higher than the Austrian with @69 odds to win the competition, while the Austrian squad has odds @79. I anticipate the hosts to dominate from start to finish and put on a show for their fans (btw, the match will be played at Old Trafford).",

However, I think if the media can do a better job of selling women football, many will get to see that the performance in the competition has now improved and interest will be increase, likewise the participation in this thread discussion.England the host have started the competition on a good footing getting all three points from Austria who were not really looking threatening to me (I didn't start the game from kickoff), they will be looking to get to the finals surely. On Friday I'll be looking to see how Denmark who were in the last finals perform against Germany who have recorded more wins in this competition than any other team. After that, I look to Netherlands, the defending champions to see how they will perform against Sweden, a win is most likely what I predict.",

So England can rely on a huge home crowd and the support, and last week they already won 5-1 against the Netherlands. Who is the reigning European champion. There will be matches that will end in 8-0, the difference in level between the top and below is huge. I think the level is low among the women, I will certainly not sit down and watch entire matches. Maybe the final.",

But seriously, it seems that women's soccer continues to increase both in terms of the number of spectators and in terms of the performance shown.In fact, I just saw some information saying that ticket sales have set a new record by spending half a million tickets for the inaugural match which means that the level of love for women's football is also quite the attraction here.",

But I think there is some ''It's coming home'' kind of hype around this team. Spain may be seriously affected by loss of Alexia Putellas, currently best female player in the world who got ACL injury during training. They also won't have Ballon d'Or runner-up Jenni Hermoso.",

I can't wait to watch France vs. Italy today. This tournament seems totally unpredictable to me. The only thing I know is that Germany is supposed to be the big favorite for winning the trophy. I can't bet money on the outcomes, because I can't analyze how strong the teams actually are. I can't analyze their game, because their game looks like chaotic mess, but it's definitely fun to watch.",
