Imagine all the GPUs waiting out there for the next most profitable coin  A new project may make mining on old video cards unprofitable and require a video card with more memory to cut off all the old series. Nvidia can make a new ethereum with a 12 GB DAG file and buy these coins to stimulate sales of new video cards. Asics will not be able to mine such an algorithm, they have no more than 8 GB of memory.",
