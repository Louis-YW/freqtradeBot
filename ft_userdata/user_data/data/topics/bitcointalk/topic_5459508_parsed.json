I think that this POD document is required in your country, but it definitely isn't required in mine.My father died 2 years and I was able to get all his money in his bank account with a death certificate and another certificate of inheritance, which I got from the administration of my local municipality. No \"payable on death\" document was needed.I think that the only way you(and anyone else) would need a lawyer is when you fail to prove that you are the son and heir of your father.I wonder what the process will be, if I had money in a centralized crypto exchange and I die someday. I'm pretty sure that my heirs(if I have any) won't receive any crypto from my accounts and the crypto exchanges will simply find dumb excuses to refuse the withdrawal.",

But aside from this POD, as you call it, which is the next of kin, which is usually listed on the account holder's personal form, if the real owner of the account is deceased, won't the next of KIN automatically gain access to the account by just providing a few documents to prove that the person is really the one listed there?Â That aside, I know that in this present century, those who are exposed to blockchain technology have shared their funds with a few in the banking sector, but some in their self-custodial wallets, where they can be in total control of them. In cases like that, I believe the next KIN kind of thing will serve as the POD since most people usually have a few trustees who are either family members or relatives who they share access to their holdings with. When anything negative happens to them, there is someone available to access it for them.",

I think in my country automatically when the account owner dies, then the ownership of the assets will immediately transfer to the heirs. If in your country you need to make a POD, are there many cases of heirs who cannot take their parents' property?In addition to the assets that will be transferred to the heirs, debt will also be transferred to the heirs. There are documents related to this in the loan agreement with the bank. in terms of debt, in your country will the debt be transferred to the heirs or will it be paid off when they die?I actually think that if we die and no one knows about the bitcoin wallet key then no one can unlock our assets forever, and nothing can be done about it.",

At least the beneficiaries will be free from legal dramas that happen after the death of an account holder. But the main beneficiary of the fund should be a trusted individual because it could trigger greed. Stealing of the banks' savings or deposits of dead customers is becoming rampant. There have been issues of criminal bankers fraudulently withdrawing funds from the account immediately after they get the information that the client is late. I know it is very difficult to trust people but somebody needs to be aware of your financial standings and other vital information to reduce this kind of incident.",

Then, the absence of one of the children, or his lack of consent, or the lack of consent of the mother or wife, means that such funds will remain frozen for many years.the majority here resort to writing the password for bank cards in a separate account on a piece of paper, provided that they take over the money from it until the inheritance is distributed, but there is no system supported by the state or law such as PAYABLE ON DEATH, although it seems like a good idea.",
