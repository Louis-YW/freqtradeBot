I don't think even the government could step in and help the kid. The only way I see that they could be forced to refund is by social media pressure like cancel culture. Although I think it's less likely that the casino would give in but you never know what happens when kids or women starts crying on the internet hehe.",

He thinks the gambling site will give him back the money? That is never going to happen. Only what can now happen is for people to open a lawsuit against the gambling site for allowing underage gambling but I do not think that is going to happen. We saw on this forum too as a young school guy gambled and lost the money and killed himself. In those countries that things like this is happening, gambling is not well regulated and nothing will be done about it.",

So he should be able to handle whatever outcome the result of his action become and leave the casino out of it and I am also sure that from his complain the casino is going to discover his real age and ultimately block or can the account access.",

Is it possible for the company to refund the money to the boy? No and I do not think that his money would ever be given back.When people gamble, they fail to realize that this is also a risk for the gambling company. They either win or lose some money, although they have a slight advantage, depending on the outcome of its games. If you plan to gamble your money, then you should fully understand the risks that are associated with it.With this example, the boy risked his school funds in order to gain some profit for a good cause. But he failed to understand that by risking his money, the gambling company is also risking their money and the result could go either way. This is the reason on why I fully believe that underage teens should be banned from gambling due to incidents such as this one.",

However, there’s a chance to refund this if he will bring this to the court since he is minor which he has an advantage to convince the judge to refund his money. He needs to find a decent lawyer that will do pro bono case for him to make this possible. But I bet someone will be interested to do this trouble just to refund kids money.The guardian who let their kid trick them to verify the casino account should be the one to blame here because he can’t play in the casino if no one will give him the id to verify his account before he can make any deposit.",

Click the picture for more information.Before I give my two cents on this issue lemme ask one question. If the reverse was the case what do you think social media will talk? Let’s say an under aged boy played with his school fees and won a huge amount of money do you think that social medial will pressure the boy to return the money that he won because he’s not up to gambling age? I highly doubt they would, you’ll only hear things like “he’s lucky”, “let him go”, “it’s God’s doing in his life”.No matter what the media will talk in this issue, sportybet will not refund the boy’s money… he did accept the ToS of the casino. The only thing that can happen or that will happen is for social media handlers or celebrities to help the boy pay his school fees I have seen something like that happen before.",

Parents aren't always aware of their kids in and out. kids these days tends to play smarter. As long as they have a mobile phone which is normal, there's nothing impossible for an underage kid even to register on these casino or some adult sites. Restrictions don't hold them anymore. It's funny to see the boy begging the casino to send him back his fund. This typical shows why children shouldn't be allowed to gamble. They will create problems for these casino any time they loss. As Cantsay has said, he won't get the money back, but maybe some celebrities might just be pitiful to assist him with his school fees. I guess that was his plan initially before making his loss a trending story.",

This little kid should know the risk by using his school fees for gambling. The gambling site is not even making a mistake here. I meant if this kid would not gamble his school fees and that's fine, nothing happened with the gambling site. That's pure kid's fault. That kid can try go bet till he will pass 18 years old and he will able to withdraw his money after he will able to fulfill KYC requirement.  Even though if the site was refuding his money and what's gonna happen if the gambling site was forcing him to verify his identity to withdraw his money? The better for him to apologize for his mistake and ask his mom to pay his fees school.  Quote from: Agbe on October 03, 2023, 10:55:01 AMAnd also the boy was too small to gamble because gambling is meant for mature mind because you have you to face things like and when you loss, you have to move on.

I hope this incident becomes a lesson for that teenager, using school tuition for gambling is a huge NO NO! As always, only gamble what you can afford to lose.QuoteMeanwhile, Legit.ng previously reported that a young man encouraged to share his betting experience recounted how he used his school fees to place sports bets. In the viral video, the man said he has not been lucky with bets placed on games and gave a practical example of playing Manchester United which had been on a losing streak for the past two games, only for them to win eventually. He stated that betting has brought him trauma, but he insisted on continuing with the hope that he would recover his money somedaysaw this part in the article, that kid(from what I understand this is a different kid) is going lose more money. A lot of gamblers who think like this will end up with more losses than wins. I just hope he starts to realize when to stop and give up the losses.",

Who knows what will happen when the company refunds his money? What if he gambled it again? I hope he will not bet again and resolve his problem by working or helping his parents pay his tuition.",
