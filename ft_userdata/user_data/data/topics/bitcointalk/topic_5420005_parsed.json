      "body": "FUD is ruthless and enriches various speculators at the expense of ordinary market users, who are most heavily influenced by this hype and uncertainty. Today's panic was no exception. Everything worked out according to the old script. Perhaps someone needed a market collapse and certain low prices to make some deals. The exchanges also made good money on this FUD. According to various estimates, liquidations of traders are already more than half a billion dollars.",

A specific term is being made just for that. FUD is already part of the crypto for a long and depending on how strong that FUD is, it can really trigger something unexpected. However, if there's a FUD that can be considered a big deal, there's also a non-sense FUD that can't even trigger small actions. Such FUDS are being ignored.That's how the market behaves since then. Take it or leave it, you decide.",

Bitcoin crawled very slowly to reach $21,000. It took it forever to conquer that area once more. But all of a sudden everything was lost. All the gains are quickly erased with what's happening in the market. Although it doesn't really have anything to do with Bitcoin itself, it is unfortunate that its ripple effect has affected Bitcoin so much. There are probably a lot of people who are feeling fearful that it will affect Bitcoin's price itself and sold.",

While everyone was expecting a two-month recovery at the end of the year, the market moved in the opposite direction and always has. We are still in bear season and history is repeating itself, during bear season 2018 bitcoin is down more than 83% and for me history will always repeat itself until new history is made. In a bear market if there is no one fud there will be another fud there will always be a reason for the market to fall.",

We've been given signs when centralized exchange owners start behaving like little kids. First of all, mutual sarcasm, mutual acquisition, and mutual showing to the public the superiority of each other's exchanges. But the market responded very quickly, and today's tip of the iceberg is quite worrying. I think that if someone is aware of the start of the dispute then the alternative is to secure their assets as soon as possible and for those who are late there is no other reason than to hold until the situation at the beginning of the year starts to show a price reversal. Although it does not guarantee that it will recover in the near future.",

The daily range is very large when compared to the moving averages, which shows that there's a lot of volatility.This means that traders will play games with each other trying to make money through exponential gains and crashes. The only way to overcome this is by widen the stop losses and cut positions after a big move up or down has been made.",

The news media all carried the Binance vs FTX fight but when there's a positive news they'll all ignore it. This is because humans are drawn to violence instead of Peace as they consider that boring. For some time now, the market has been recovery slowly and then just one negative news and we are down -15% or more and now Bitcoin and only altcoins has tasted some new low which will be very hard to recover from.I don't think we'll recover this year from this crash as we're almost at the last month to end the year and usually times like this people withdraw to spend their money with loves ones. Maybe early next year, the market will get some positive news and turn bullish.",

It's okay if they've been doing that for so long and they can attain to take the high risk but for the newbies, they are doing it very wrong.",
