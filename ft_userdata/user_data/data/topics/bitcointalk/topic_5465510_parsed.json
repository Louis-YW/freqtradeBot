I remember many years ago wetin been dey trend then na say, you wan be doctor, engineer, lawyer. After that one na oil company work come dey trend. Everybody been wan work for oil company. After that one na come government job. Everybody wan get government job. After that one na tech. Everybody one do tech. Now wetin dey trend na Japa. If you don join the Japa trend before, you go Sabi say e dey very expensive and second e dey hard to even secure interview date.For Naija, all of us sabi at least 2 persons wey don Japa. Some sef go tell you when them don reach because say na you be winch wey fit stop them(Sarcasm intended). I nor talk say Japa nor good or bad but we the stories wey dem dey sell give us no complete. Pipo wey dey enjoy this Japa thing na skilled workers o doctors, software engineers, Nurses. Unskilled people na Dem dey suffer pass and na Dem dey sell all their property to take Japa. Only to go there go suffer.

As a human being, we view things differently and what you consider as normal may looks like suffering to others, what you view as simple will sound or looks complex to other, what you consider to be standard of living will look like help to others and that's why you see people live their comfort zone for another country that has high standard of living than their own, na why people they japa be that.Wetin you dy see say na normal, another person fit see as suffer, because you fit endure the hardship no mean say another man go fit do the same na why when people see small opportunity to run comot for the country, them dy quick escape sharp sharp just to get greener pasture for another country to get their life together because some people don believe say them no fit make am for this our county naija.Another thing wey I feel why u no get the feeling to escape this country fit be say you get people wey u dy look up to or may be u sef don get person wey dy support you financially. People dy wey no get family or helper, na them after them na why them dy do anything to run comot.",

You forget to put the entertainment trend when everyone been dey reason to enta the entertainment industry (dat time na when skit making start dey become popular when people's notice say na the easiest way to take become celebrity (like take blow be dat). You dey also forget the personal business era and multi level marketing era when everybody been dey do MLM for the country before dem MMM cum come spoil everybody mind with ponzi scheme as people leave the MLM dey enjoy ponzi schemes businesses.

I for also talk football but people dun see say dat area no be easy oh as I no dey too here people dey talk about am again. My own prediction go be business go be the next new trend, e get when buying of land for estate been dey take over wey be say estate dey advertise land for radio 24/7 but dat one dun reduced too. The country just dey kill any other trend wey get to do with the country so na to japa just dey trend but wetin I think go replace to japa go be japa pro max and that's to marry white woman through arranged marriage to move go outside.
