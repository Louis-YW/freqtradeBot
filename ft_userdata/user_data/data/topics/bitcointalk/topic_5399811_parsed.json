The forum is kinda difficult to take in all at once, so I have been trying to read the rules and regulations of the forum to understand better, but, I have been distracted with my catering business, I guess that is why it has taken me a while to make my first post.I have a major interest in Bitcoin, and the concepts around it like, Blockchain, decentralization, how to transact peer to peer, and how Bitcoin can affect real life financial systems. I understand these concepts to an extent, but there is still a lot I am yet to know.My first question is about resources I can use to learn about Bitcoin; what Bitcoin book can I start with as a newbie?-Soadex",

When you are reading this book, you are \"inventing\" bitcoin from scratch in your head.2) https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861 to get an idea of the economic aspects of bitcoin: this book explains what monetary characteristics bitcoin possesses, what is stock-to-flow, and why it is important for determining the value of bitcoin, what makes bitcoin better than government-issued money, etc.3) https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388 to get the idea of how bitcoin works on a low level: what is a private key, what is a wallet, how transactions propagate over the network, why mining is important for securing the network, how decentralization of consensus emerges, etc.",

It best to read and learn, before replying or posting.There are already lots of links already posted on this thread to cause an information overload, so I would not add more.The forum is not that difficult to understand; avoid plagiarism, spreading malwares and spam. Bitcoin itself is a bit more complex, but if you take it one step at a time, you should get a hang of it.",
