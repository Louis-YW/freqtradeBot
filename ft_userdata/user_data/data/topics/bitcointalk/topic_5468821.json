  "content": "The head of investigations at Chainalysis testified she was “unaware” of scientific evidence for the accuracy of Chainalysis’ Reactor software used by law enforcement.We all know how the technology works -- inputs of a transaction, as well as other characteristics, are assumed to be able to associate the transaction with a specific wallet. However, nobody knows how accurate it is. That nobody includes Chainalysis, who whose whole business is based on it. Coming to a conclusion without being about to show that is correct is a hallmark of junk science.This is all coming to a head in the case against Roman Sterlingov, who is accused of running Bitcoin Fog, because the evidence against him relies almost exclusively on the claims made by Chainalysis.Relevant links:https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/wall-street-backed-crypto-tracer-under-attack-ahead-of-trial-1https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chainalysis-investigations-lead-unaware-scientific-221931194.htmlhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/chainalysis-investigations-lead-is-unaware-of-scientific-evidencehttps://www.whatbitcoindid.com/l0la-l33tz",

      "body": "News says she doesn't know now how the software works internally and that she only uses it. Anyways, the chainanalysis reactor software that is used to trace and investigate Bitcoin transactions was also challenged and criticized CipherTrace, an expert from another blockchain as he revealed its errors and said that it used a flawed method to trace funds on the blockchain.",

      "body": "We have been discussing some of this in another thread here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5464886.0;dtIn summary, Chainalysis is complete bullshit. They have admitted multiple times in court that they have absolutely zero evidence for anything that they do. Their reports make a plethora of very basic mistakes, such as not knowing what a segwit address is, mixing up bits and bytes, and apparently not understanding that multiple users can have the same IP address when using a VPN server. They are using every legal avenue possible to prevent anyone from reviewing their black box source code, because they know that it is complete bullshit. They are making claims such as long time bitcoin contributors are not qualified enough to assess their source code, or that other people are too qualified and will end up stealing their source code.The whole of blockchain analysis basically boils down to \"Trust us, bro\", with absolute zero evidence that any of it is any more than complete guesswork. But this is apparently enough to put potentially innocent people in jail indefinitely. This is absolutely not what bitcoin was designed to be - to have a bunch of untouchable third party companies ruining people's lives based on made up nonsense pulled from the blockchain. Any and all companies or services which support or fund blockchain analysis are anti-bitcoin and should be boycotted.",
