  "content": "I know bitcoin mining is like a lottery - any hash has the same chance of winning a block. But the only way transactions are confirmed is by someone winning a block so that the transactions get added to the chain. At 2M hashes/sec, I can expect to get a block something like every 15 to 30 years at a difficulty of 434883. I am not confirming transactions. I am not winning blocks. Am I contributing anything to the bitcoin network in some other way? I was using a GPU miner (only 20M hashes/sec) in a pool for about 6 weeks and decided it was not worth the heat on the GPU. I like the idea of bitcoin and would be glad to keep the client mining if I thought it was doing anything at all to support the bitcoin concept.If I want bitcoins, I can see it is better for me to buy them given my limited mining power. Thanks for your thoughts.",

If you like the idea and want to support it, buy some bitcoins and spend them, or offer services for Bitcoins and spend your earnings. That will really make a difference.",

Sure, it would technically help, but you could help more by doing something that you're particularly good at and using the money to fund some farmer who's much more efficient than you are. Since CPU mining is so inefficient, if you want to put your CPU to good use you should get some software that will magnify your particular skills and use your computer to help you do something that you're already good at.",

Even better do it on a a regular basis for let us say your weekly/monthly grocery .. etc.3) Buy some bitcoins and hoard them as long as you do not need their value.4) Transfer a portion of your long term investment (like retirement plan money) into bitcoins instead of gold or banks.And Finally,5) Cut a percentage of your weekly, monthly or whatever pay check to buy bitcoins as a long term investment (Hoarding)!.This would Spread the currency and maximize its value.Of course order might be different here for some other opinions, specially about hoarding, but again it is both about spreading teh currency as well as maximizing the demand (need) for it.Couple hundred million users like that and !!Wollah! Bitcoin is major world-class currency.!",
