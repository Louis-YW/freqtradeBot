  "content": "I'll tell you mine. I was 16 on a Royal Caribbean cruise with my parents. I took $10 from dads wallet and went out on the town   I stopped into the casino on deck, worked that $10 in to a $20 in the coin machine. Then I went to the roulette table and doubled my money 3 times and got up to $160, then I bet it all on black and lost it all! Or wait, was it red? Oh I don't remember hahah. They did come around and bring me plenty of drinks. Luckily I looked old enough to be in there, was even 6 feet tall back then, athletic, football player. I made the cut. Fun times! Learned a very valuable lesson there though. This is why I don't gamble. What's a good gambling story that you'd like to share? Hit the comments section! Thanks guys. Cheers, TREAD",

Still very old and I don't remember any free drinks that time, and all the slot machines used to dispensed those huge tokens and then you go to the cashier and cash them out.Unlike in the last 10 years or so wherein there is entertainment, you can have a card inserted to get points and perks while playing. And when you are done and want to exit a game, then you will have that paper that you can used in other games or go directly to the cashiers.",

      "body": "Your story looks more like an adventure to me with so regret of which you would have gone with the $160 you made which you would have used it for something else. Your confidence of playing different kind of games to win .more money makes you to loss all your earning in a single seating. That's a lesson to everyone of us to always leave gambling whenever we win a big money or double our Capital. This had also happen to me before making so much money in different bets I played that particular day. I ended up losing everything thing because of greed. Greed is one of the major problems of gamblers.",

It is just within our community/neighborhood and it's quite common in our country to see a kid doing gambling at that age. Doing flipcoin even in school during break time or before classes in start in Elementary is very common among boys. Most probably, part of our culture.",

      "body": "My earliest gambling story is not with casinos. I cannot recall the exact moment but it must have been at school back in the elementary days when we were 7 or 8 or around that. We used to play with our pocket money. We had coins and they were supposed to be for buying snacks during recess, but we gambled them. Games like tossing your coin to an opponents coin near enough to be reached by the middle finger and the thumb of one of your hands, or bouncing your coin to a wall with the same goal, and some others were the usual games. My mom would usually let me bring food rather than money-- pancakes, sandwich, biscuits, banana, or whatever. But we had a small store back then and I took some coins from the cash box, so I still had money. But they weren't all for gambling. I also bought food with it.",

I still can't forget that first experience since I felt tense and I couldn't keep myself calm when there was a lot of money on the line it's actually not a lot though mostly it's just saved up lunch money.",

Thanks guys.In my country casinos and gambling are prohibited, so I didn't have much contact with them early on.But, I remember very well an afternoon I spent in the company of my uncle and my father... we were in a bar, with many pool tables, foosball, and there was also a \"video game\" with hypnotizing flashing lights I pestered my dad a lot to play there, I think I was like 12, and then he finally bought me some coins.I confess that I was quite frustrated, because the toy seemed to be interesting, but it was very boring, I couldn't understand how to \"play\" and quickly my chips ran out.I never saw that machine again, I think the police seized it, and it took me a few years to understand what a slot machine was.",

Each student who accepted participating the betting pool should give 0,40$ to place a guess (it should be exact final score, not only guessing the winner). Some have accepted the deal, but money wasn't collected in advance. So, after the match only one student (lucky guy) matched the correct result and won the full prize, although at least one of the class mates didn't bring the money, as previously agreed, as far as I remember.",

I started playing poker ( or texas hold'em to be more specific) when I was like 18 years old or so and we of course bet money.  I think my first casino experience was when I was around 18-19 and it was on a river boat lol.  My main first bet though was a super bowl where I bet like 100 bucks on it using an online casino.  Then I found out that when you cash out, you get sent checks and they look shady and take forever to come.  When I found out they started offering bitcoin as a payment option..game changer!",

We didn't have any money so we broke up a match box and divided matches equally among players. After a few games I got good enough to hold the biggest pile of matches at the end. We had so much fun when there was no money on the line.My first real gambling experience was when we started betting on football matches. We'd put our money together on one team and then buy some beers and go watch the match together.",

I remember betting around $20 for the Lakers against the Orland Magic in 2009, I my memory serves me right, it was the game 4 of the Finals. We pooled our money together to place a bet to someone inside a sports bar. That was actually crazy, coz that $20 I've got is part of my tuition fee back in college. That was the betting experience that me and my friends made and call it \"double the risk, double the fun and the reward\".P.s I was turning 20 during that time, so yeah I'm in a legal age to enter a bar and place a bet of course lol.",

Cheers, TREADThis takes me back, my very first experience with gambling was decades ago when video game arcades were everywhere, if someone was good at a particular arcade they literally camped there and waited for anyone else to begin to play the video game.They will watch you and evaluate your skill and if they thought they could beat you they will simply challenge you to a bet, if you did not accepted then not only they will defeat you but anytime you wanted to play at that arcade they will challenge you and not let you play at all until you accepted the bet, this was closer to extortion than a bet as almost no one could beat them, but in one of the fondest memories of my childhood I was able to beat one of those players at my favorite video game several times, so from that moment on not only I could play at my favorite arcade whenever I wanted but I even earned some money out of it.",

I'm sure the casino will not stay silent, seeing you can succeed in getting a lot of money and will prevent you from getting more money and it finally proved. You have lost.I remember I played gambling not in the casino but at my friend's house by playing cards together. Maybe it's not gambling but we use money when playing cards to see who is really an expert among us.

It was more about camaraderie than about winning. Then, we used our limited pocket money($20). And we split it, because we would rather buy fancy sunglasses, cheap wristwatches, to impress the girls than gamble.",
