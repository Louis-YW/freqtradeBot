  "content": "Computers and laptops are one of the work devices that are needed to do work. Almost all work sectors use these two devices as media or tools to get the job done. Starting from making financial reports for offices, businesses, trading to other technical work. Therefore, computers and laptops have become daily necessities like basic needs.I realize that not all of us who are active in the crypto space have a Personal Computer or Laptop due to limited money to be able to get it.Even though as we all know that working with a Personal Computer and with a Laptop will get maximum results starting from creating posts and other activities as I have mentioned.Here, I want to say that without Personal Computers and Laptops we can also be active even easier and more flexible by using work tools such as mobile devices, namely Android, can even be more effective like using a PC or Laptop.With the sophistication of Android or other mobile devices, now their use is like a PC or Laptop. Especially around crypto activities.Simply by using one browser like google, you can do various activities in the crypto space such as trading and bitcointalk forum activities.If you are not a native English speaker like me, you can create a new tab on the google browser and use translation sites such as google translate or other translation sites that suit you by activating desktop mode for maximum results.Likewise, to carry out buying and selling activities, you can also open exchange sites such as Binance.com in the browser in almost the same way as the translation site above. It's just that in crypto trading activities such as Binance exchange, you need to install the mobile version of the application on your mobile device (for those who don't have an account yet).When it comes to wallets, I recommend using Blue Wallet instead of other mobile Bitcoin wallets.You can see and learn how in the link below.[Tutorial] BlueWallet - Bitcoin Wallet DiscussionLikewise, if you want to create images, there are many related applications available on the app store or playstore that we can install on our mobile devices.That is, there is nothing that can make it difficult for us if we are willing to continue to be active even though we have a financial shortage to be able to get a PC or Laptop. But if later our finances are sufficient to get devices such as PCs and Laptops, then working with these devices is much better.This post looks ordinary, but I hope it can provide benefits to everyone who is still constrained by time to activate themselves on the bitcointalk forum.Hopefully it will be useful for all of you.For me, even the smallest amount of information that can be useful to others is a joy in living life.Don't complain. Everything can be active if we want to be active.",

But most mobile users are in bitcointalk forum. And in bitcointalk forum it is never necessary to use Desktop mode. QuoteSimply by using one browser like google, you can do various activities in the crypto space such as trading and bitcointalk forum activities. If you are not a native English speaker like me, you can create a new tab on the google browser and use translation sites such as google translate or other translation sites that suit you by activating desktop mode for maximum results.If someone is not good in English, if he regularly reads all the posts and tries to answer them, he will learn slowly. If he uses google translation, his language will be slightly wrong, because google translation varies a bit. And desktop mode is not needed for google translation.QuoteWhen it comes to wallets, I recommend using Blue Wallet instead of other mobile Bitcoin wallets.You can see and learn how in the link below.[Tutorial] BlueWallet - Bitcoin Wallet DiscussionItâ€™s good iDEA Buddy",

No mobile device can replace all the conveniences of using a normal laptop or computer.Another thing is that you want to encourage users not to turn away from the forum, citing the lack of normal conditions for surfing the forum. I'm not going to argue here.But using the Chrome browser and various extensions is again not a good move.I'll put it simply: start with mobile devices, but aim to buy a laptop or computer. In comparison, after driving a BMW, you no longer want to ride a donkey wagon.",

IMO, I think it is all a matter of preference.

It is true that working with Personal Computers and Laptops is much more effective from typing to other things that are very helpful when we work.However, if these devices are not available due to limited ability to buy, then using mobile devices such as Android can also be helped to activate ourselves here.Maybe those of us who have the best suggestions can also be conveyed so that it can help those who feel limited to activities in the crypto space.",

I usually away from my laptop or desktop since my wok involves travelling and on the road most of the time. The only time I can access my laptop and desktop is during my dayoff or holiday which is not very frequent. I developed the patience on using solely my mobile phone to create threads here that involves lots of bbcode which is hard to do on small screen.My current situation push me to use mobile phone most often rather than the choosing the convenience of using desktop for easy usage of the forum.",
