  "content": "In building a struggling economy at a time of global economic crisis caused by Covid, global inflation etc, some experts have argued that it's sometimes necessary to devalue a country's currency in a bid to keep the country's economy afloat, hoping that this measure would strengthen the currency and subsequently improve their economy. Third world countries are always caught up in this ugly situation. Today, local currencies of Ghana and Zimbabwe, to mention a few, are stock in a familiar terrain of currency devaluation that had adversely shut down some SMEs and impoverished their citizens. Because I believe, in improving an economy of a country, the country must improve on its production base, her export on goods produce locally should improve as well, the ease of doing business within the country play a key factor too, foreign and direct investment plays an important role on the economy of a country. So my question is, how does these particular act of devaluing a country's currency helps in building an economy?",

      "body": "I don't know how the devaluation of a country's currency would help during inflation, it will rather aggravate the problem especially if the country is an importing one. In my experience, you should not use third-world countries as an example, they are still under the slavery of the top world countries and their currency devaluation are not often to help the economy but to submit to the pressure of bodies like IMF, World Bank and other. They often do this because of favours needed from them, like for loans and others, and the bodies might gauge it based on what they believe the currency rate should be, which may or may not be the true reflection.Such happens so much in Nigeria, but has it solved the problem? Certainly No, it rather aggravates it.The only fair reason why sane and working countries devalue their currency without external interference is to encourage cross-border trade. Countries turn to countries with cheap products and services, so it helps the economy by increasing exportation and encouraging trade balance.",

Pretty much the same thing a lot of countries like US are doing starting from last year. The devaluation was the side effect.Some economists will claim that the devaluation of currency will reduce imports and promote export. They claim that it will make the cost of producing cheaper thereby making local goods more acceptable in both local and international markets. Let me speak for my country, this devaluation policy has destroyed our economy totally. Industries in my country depend solely on imported raw materials, machines, and even personnel. Most of these resources are paid for in mostly the US dollar which makes these payments more expensive. So it is useless to devalue our currency because it will increase the cost of production, kill local industries and make locally produced goods less competitive in local and international markets.They also claim that a devalued currency will make debt payments cheaper. This has also destroyed our economy because most of our debts are external debt serviced in stronger foreign currencies. And they will never accept our local currency for repayment. Other nations might have done it and achieved economic prosperity but from my experience, the devaluation of currency is a strategy to make poor nations poorer and rich ones more prosperous. This is because it has caused inflation and an increase in the prices of local goods. Each time our currency is devalued we experience a higher level of suffering and hardship.",

I mean you must be pointing toward Us dollar because they are also devaluing there currency besides that, many other country's money also losing value like the Chinese yuan even my own country's currency is losing its value. Point is, if some country will try to devalue its currency on its own like by own means (manipulation) then things might slip out of hands and it might be the most dangerous strategy ever because what if things turn upside down. Let's say, in devaluation of a currency one could face high inflation rate, debt ceiling causes, many bankruptcies, people might lose trust on that currency and will flight away, besides that there are many other import and export outcomes one have to face. I think instead of adopting this strategy to dwindle the economy they should work on other factors to improve things like the one you already mentioned.",

In general, politicians do not stop increasing public spending, and if they do it for example by giving subsidies for the most disadvantaged or certain sectors to develop, at first those subsidies stimulate those sectors or the economy around those classes disadvantaged by the initial spending. Now, since this is not done with money that they have but that they create out of nothing, what happens is that if a politician distributes $500 a month payments for the underprivileged, after not long those $500 have the purchasing power that $400 had shortly before they started distributing the payments. What does the politician do? Raise the amount of what he gives, and maybe he raises it to $550 or $600, but in terms of purchasing power it ends up being worth less than the $400 it was before. This has been typical in South American economies and other countries, where in the end the bill has many zeros but in reality it has less purchasing power than a $1 bill.This is explained in a general way, because for example the USA also prints money for a lot of incentives, subsidies and payments, but its economy allows it to back it up in a certain way, with a devaluation that compared to that of countries like Venezuela or Argentina is nothing.",

Pretty much the same thing a lot of countries like US are doing starting from last year. The devaluation was the side effect.to clarify a few things...when covid happened china created money. to then buy infrastructure (hospitals) so they had a real GDP increase of new jobs, new equipment, new services.. however this increase in GDP would have caused china to take the top spot in GDP world rankings.. western countries did not like this. so they done 'stimulus cheques' to print money for spending on things. but this spending is temporary as they did not create any physical infrastructure of new jobs, new servicesso the western stimulus /QE money did keep western countries in the rankings to prevent china and russia from being top superpowers in statistics.. but.. that ranking hold was temporary. and then after the QE/stimulus funds 'trickled-up' to off shore funds and tax exempt loopholes, things went badyep when US paid other countries for vaccine research and manufacturing. and paid international companies for the medical care insurance/hospital care.. the US print money moved offshore thus not circulating to benefit/sustain the domestic economy.meaning due to having stimulus/QE DEBT on US numbers but no domestic infrastructure increase to offset it. things started to go negative in real world GDP stats for US.. so more was needed to be done. in conjunction with the cut-off of russian oil, and removing the reliance of chinese produce. the next step was to try to knock russia and china down a peg in their exports, hoping this will knock their GDP positions down.. however western countries did not invest in new infrastructure/jobs to solidify western positions of self reliance. thus western countries got hit again negativelywestern countries then wanted to reboot domestic infrastructure value by suddenly wanting to build more houses(large value product sales stimulus). by offering low rate mortgages to stimulate a real estate boom.. this too was short lived. because greedflation priced people out of home buying even with low rate loans. this greedflation vs low rate loans caused the deficit between cost of living income amounts vs greedinflation... which due to lack of home purchasing didnt help stimulate the economy.. thus more things negatively happened. where the greedflation became statically inflation.. which then raised mortgage % interest rates. thus again western countries real estate boom has now dropped off and now worse than 3 years ago due to higher interest rates and lower income..all of this saga of the last 3 years all stemmed from the top brass of western countries ruining real world economy to try to falsify a statistic(GDP) of trying to keep the US in position 1 of GDP.. a statistic thats meaningless to average joe citizen. but meant alot to the top tier politicians of western economywhen western countries think the use of DEBT as a asset to pump a GDP stat is good(facepalm). they are not thinking beyond their election cycles tenure. they are just scrambling to not make china/russia be the new worlds superpower during their political tenure",

But you must be careful what and how you sell to certain people with stronger currencies else they take advantage of the country and leave little for you to take care of your needs.

Also, there should be a rise in the quality of production for exportation, which should be very high compared to importations.
