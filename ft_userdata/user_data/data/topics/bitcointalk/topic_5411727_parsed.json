  "content": "Content1) The inspiration2) Planning and Departure3) The meeting4) Practical learning on how to send and receive Bitcoin5) Draft Proposal Committee and Departure6) PicturesThe inspirationWhen I read that Panamanian Gabriel Silva in presented a bill aimed to promote the use of cryptocurrency and other digital assets in the Congress, I was inspired to initiate a bill through my constituency’s representative in the parliament. I had to write a letter and the purpose was to persuade my representative to initiate a Bill for the review of the ban placed on banks from dealing on cryptocurrencies in my country. And I sent the letter.The letterPlanning and DepartureAfter a few days, I got a call from the parliamentarian and he was eager to discuss it with me. He told me his aide would call me later and book an appointment. The next day I got a call that I would be meeting with him face-to-face in three days. Considering the cost, distance, and security, I quickly suggested that we could use zoom, Video calls, or voice calls. He insisted that I should come to the country’s capital which is a distance of about 714.8 Km from my location.Immediately I started planning because since we were meeting face-to-face, I wanted to advertise Bitcoin. I contacted another Bitcoin believer and designed some clothing and the Nigerian national flag with Bitcoin Logo and Bitcointalk website. I also had to prepare for a bitcoin discussion and possible questions that we might be asked. Hence, before I left for Abuja, I itemized some of the reasons the Central Bank gave for the restrictions and searched different threads for possible answers.Using air transport would cost from $150 to 200 but using a bus is cheaper ($20). I and my friend got to Abuja by road a day before the meeting date. We also got good accommodation from a family friend for three night.  The meetingWe met with the parliamentarian the following day wearing our customized polo shirts. Immediately we started that meeting, he began to outline the all the perceived evil of Bitcoin he learnt from the Central Bank Chief. I told him that his questions would be answered but he needs to know the basics of Bitcoin. And I took him briefly throughA brief handout on introduction to bitcoin     His reservations about Bitcoin were:1.   Bitcoin promote fraud2.   Bitcoin promotes the loss in value of naira3.   Bitcoin is used to fund Crime4.   Bitcoin aids tax invasion5.   Bitcoin transactions are anonymous6.   Bitcoin is very volatile I was well aware that he would raise question based on the Central Bank Chief view of Bitcoin. But I was well prepared because I am already familiar with the accusations of government against Bitcoin.  And as I expected he mentioned almost the same perceived pitfalls of Bitcoin that I had itemized and discussed. I used some vital information from these comments to answer most of his questions. Some of the question and the posts that assisted me in the discussion were:Possible answers to his questions.                                     Practical learning on how to send and receive BitcoinAfter our discussion, it was very clear that most of our legislatures know nothing about Bitcoin. They just rely on the information they get mainly from the Central Bank Chiefs. He told me that he wanted to get a wallet and own some Bitcoin. I created a wallet for Honorable and he was ready to receive funds. I told him to keep his private keys very safe. I asked him if he got any cash, so we can sell to him. With few bucks from his wallet, my friend sold Bitcoin to him and he was amazed that we didn’t have to go through any middleman. He was also fascinated that Bitcoin can be gotten in bits because he was wondering how many Nigerians a buying Bitcoin at such high price. Immediately he pleaded that should download wallets for all his aides. And we downloaded Trust wallet for all the staff. I also informed them that for now they can also exchange naira for Bitcoin through Bitcoin exchange platforms since bank or investing firm cannot offer such services currently. They should only use centralized systems as a gateway to access fiat and never use them as a bank where one can keep their investment. I admonished them to keep their funds mainly in decentralized wallets.Mass Downloading of Wallets                                  Draft Proposal Committee and DepartureWe had a good time and he promised to set up a committee to prepare the draft proposal. And he instructed his secretary that some of expenses that the committee would incurred such as wages would be paid with Bitcoin and I and my friend must be part of the committee. I sent two books on Bitcoin to him and he promised to read them.                             We left Abuja the next day and arrived safely. The total cost of the journey and logistics was about $115. It might not be a very big contribution to Bitcoin but I was glad that at least I have done something. Pictures",

What are your plans for using this connection you have or better still working with this representative of your constituency to engage other members of the parliament?Thank you for responding Davidvictorson. We are expecting a positive development from this meeting. My intentions are clear. I want to make this member of the house of Representatives like or love bitcoin. Until he appreciates bitcoin, he might not openheartedly promote it. Proposing a bill for the review of crypto restrictions on commercial banks in Nigeria would be easy if he likes bitcoin.  Quote Do you plan to engage with other like-minded influential individuals, civil societies to organize a townhall meeting in respect to this? The first stage is to produce a document that would giude the bill. Yes we would like to engage individuals, NGOs professional bodies in any form just to ensure we promote bitcoin.  Quote from: Upgrade00 on August 30, 2022, 08:19:19 PMAs a Nigerian, I am mightly inspired by what you did.

You can never go wrong if you have sort of like a coalition of pro-bitcoin folks with you. I have seen bills supported by a coalition Civil Society Organizations, NGOs passed in parliament because they were simply more and their voice were amplified.
