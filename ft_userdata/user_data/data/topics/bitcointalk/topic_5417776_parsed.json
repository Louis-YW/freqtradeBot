It would be easy to have idea of such; quitting once you win a reasonable amount to quit, but that would be hard to be honest. A money earned easily is usually spent quickly as well. But ofcourse if you can simply show discipline, it would be much better . It is not impossible in the first place, it is just that such thing is not present to most of us, let us accept that. Money is too powerful that it can alter our ambitions, plans, and ideas.",

You can use $50000 to establish a business which can bring you more money. Know that gambling is not for making money, it was just an opportunity, and the opportunity may not be more than once as this kind of opportunity can be just once in lifetime, best to grab it by using the money for investment and businesses and just gamble with very low amount of money as usual for you not to go from rich to broke again.",

I would also leave about 5  percentage of my wager from the initial winning. Now I don't even announced to friends if you hit such amount of money because is a huge amount compared to our local currency so I will always play safe and cool, as I always said I do have a charity account maybe I would help from the account.",

If your bankroll would be multiplied x10, then it is a different story. Honestly speaking I do not believe that it that case people stop gambling, as it is just a \"proof\" they may win, so the will do it again and again. And it is a clear way to go back to 0... But if you decide to keep 5-10-15% for gambling and withdraw the rest, to use it in some clever way in real life - then yes, it may bring something good.",

When all the money runs out all people will be laughing and the only one who will be crying is the person who won a lot of money and had no sense.

So his wife created pressure and forced him to buy to land tiles, build a house on one land tile. You know, he did not stop and after 3 years, I am shocked to know he lost all of such and in serious debt.People who are irresponsible gambling or trading are very hard to change themselves.

Not if you live in a developed country at least.
