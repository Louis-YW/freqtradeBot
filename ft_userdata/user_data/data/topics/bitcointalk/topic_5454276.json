If on-chain transactions were free, this means they were shouldering the miner fee, in other words, extra expenses.Quote from: tech30338 on May 28, 2023, 10:05:43 AMthe sad thing is he is throwing all the paper with a qr code, if im not mistaken, and he said that its a lot of papers that he had put in the binwhich makes him a millionaire if he just kept it, he should have use this app.QR code of what? does it contain his private keys? if so, it just means your brother in law is bad at self-custody. The app is custodial so I wouldn't say it should be his \"should have\" for storing decent amounts rather, he should've researched first what he's getting into and practice good self-custody habits.Quote from: tech30338 on May 28, 2023, 10:05:43 AMhere is the link of the news hopes that people who use this app in the forum will see this post and withdraw their funds there.https://www.business-live.co.uk/technology/bottlepay-closing-app-newcastle-bitcoin-26993073Nice to see that they're being respectful to their users. I've no complaints over their offboarding process. 2 months to withdraw bitcoin/cryptos then after that, funds would be converted to fiat and be sent to users nominated bank. It appears continuous notifications would be sent out during the process as well.",

He could just log in and check the account if he still remembers the login credentials",

      "body": "Yeah I saw that and I think it's sad, they had excellent customer support and that's pretty rare in this business. I like the fact that they give users more than a month to withdraw their corner, it's a very honest approach.However, their business model wasn't sustainable in the long term, and this isn't the first time they've been in troubles. They were bought out in 2021 (if I remember correctly), and since then a number of bad decisions have been made, leading to their downfall. For example the almost free on-chain fees for users, their Welcome Bonus and referral policy was generous, and I know that some incredible sums were lost through abuses, they let it go for a lot of time with a lack of reaction at this time. The accumulation of small errors such as these, as well as a slightly too \"old school\" management of their service, will unfortunately have been their undoing... Officially, it was the taxes that sank them, but there had been rumours for some time that the boat was taking on water for them.",

Prices will not appear to you as withdrawal or transfer fees, but they definitely deduct them because the company is not a charitable organization.I've never heard of it, it might be popular in the UK but what happened was it was acquired by a US crypto company so they might come back under another name.If the goal of the app is to allow you to send Bitcoin to friends using social media accounts, why not ask your friends to use the Lightning Network?",
