What are the most reliable ways to check liquidity in one exchange.That exchange is Stormgain...they offer no commission for trading and a profit share of 10% is taken only from profitable trades...Do you think I would have spread/liquidity issues if I trade btc in that exchange? Im not really good at seeing that by reading the order book..also Im not sure if they might have a fake order book?Are there any other exchanges with same business model where they only take fees from profitable trades?",

Well, on Binance inlay commission like in 0.00$ or 0.000$. Means the commission rate is too low so I do not know why you wanted to use that \"stormgain \" exchange.while you have other options available too. And according to the Naada001 information, I can say the exchange has good liquidity but I prefer you to use such exchange on your own as your selection also depends on the amount you are going to trade.",

I'm not quite sure whether zero commission with 10% on profits is really worth it, in the end. Even a trade netting you a mere 10% would set you back 1% in comissions which is already way above the usual rate you'll find elsewhere. So in the end it would only be worth it if you expect to lose money, but where would be the fun in that?",

Perhaps I don't think that's the only exchange you can use there.Also, on CEX, every coin or token has its own liquidity, so if you want to check, you will need to tap on the coin (trading pair: BTC/USD). It could be different for other CEXs.",

Stormgain seem to have a very bad reputation all over internet and suspected to scam their clients with also very bad support service and here is an example from a tester [1].I suggest for you to stick with popular platform as they are all centralized and you are not looking for decentralized ones. Such as binance that offers also low fees comparing to others with lower security.[1]: https://paidfromsurveys.com/stormgain-mining-review#:~:text=However%2C%20as%20you%20can%20see,it%20has%20extremely%20poor%20support.",

Even popular exchanges these days could be also manipulating their numbers, especially on volume so people will tell that they are good enough.So for me, just to beat the odds, go for popular exchanges that is proven already by time, who is already here for the long time.I don't say that these data from exchanges are not 100% legit, but there could be some of it.

I don't see this as an opportunity even for scalping, and before that you also have to make sure how likely you will be an active trader and profit so that you can cover the 10% profit share comparing to trading fee in regular trading in general.",

For example, like you mentioned, but for sure before you enter too deep, you should have already understood the risks trade in a new exchange. I know you expect to get free fee trading and a few profit share, but sometimes is not balanced when you lost the money if the exchange goes bankrupt or if the owner brought your money. So if I were you I will hear several pieces of advice here. You have to not ignore any suggestion, so let's just say you are ready to lose your money.",

I've never heard of Stormgain nor have I ever heard of an exchange that takes no commission on trading or that they only take 10% of profitable trades?This is very strange. I am afraid that it is a scam exchange. You should check the exchange well before you deposit your money there. There are many reliable exchanges, but they take a commission on each trades about 0.1-0.50%. This is a small commission.Also, you should pay attention to some exchanges that do not have liquidity, so if you buy a coin that does not have liquidity, it will be stuck in the coin and you will not be able to sell it.",

Some disreputable exchanges use \"wash trading\" to boost volumes. Stick to trusted exchanges like Binance or Coinbase to avoid this.

But, if your limit is higher in the range of millions then there may be significant risks associated with trading. Firstly, deposit the money you can afford to lose in a smaller exchange such as Stormgain. We never know about their trading practices and trust factors and hence at any point of time, the exchange might fail all of a sudden thereby pulling your funds along with them. One such incident is the failure of QuadrigaCX, which was the largest Canadian exchange to fail when the CEO died all of a sudden. Some exchanges try to lure the traders by offering juicy profit shares just like this but everytime it is up-to the trader to have trust upon the exchange and start trading. It is realistically easier to increase the trading volume to millions so that the scammers can take over a billion or so when traders start depositing. With the recent development in DEXes it is always better to provide liquidity over there and have a safer trade practice rather than trusting CEXes with increased failure ratios.",
