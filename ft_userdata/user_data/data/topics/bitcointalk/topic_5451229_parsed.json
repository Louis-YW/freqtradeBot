Maybe it's only a few that's why you won't be able to get good trade on it. If Coinbase do not charge cheap maybe you need to just sit it there or put it on your personal wallet instead and wait until that amount is good for a trade for good profit plus the trading fee.",

I tried just swapping the pepe for another coin, but even then, it wants to charge half my profit worth of gas fees. Any suggestions?Let's make your statement clear, whether the funds are in exchange or wallet? In past coinbase wallet supported only few cryptocurrencies but not using it anymore so no idea the coin PEPE is existing in their wallet.Let's say if you're talking about exchange then trading fee is not 50% you're supposed to pay 1% as trading fee so either the coin doesn't have volume for the price you're looking to sell or the value of your PEPE is too low which barely meets the minimum trading requirement.",

Any suggestions?Please explain how the coins get to the Coinbase wallet, CoinBase is a centralized exchange, and from what I know Pepe coins don't trade there for now. If you mistakenly sent the tokens to the Coinbase address then you need to take some responsibility. I remember when I mistakenly sent wrong tokens to Binance I was told to pay $300 for the transaction fee to get it back, the funny thing was that the tokens were not up to $300 in value so I just let it go.",

And the only thing you gonna do for now OP is to contact their support system or withdraw your funds but yes, that will incur fees which is a loss on your side. This is why it is very important to check first before sending our funds, awareness is somewhat needed otherwise, we will be wondering why it happens. As this coin is a new coin, you can't really expect it to be listed and traded in major exchanges.",

You can use https://etherscan.io/gastracker to track the fees. It will charge you a lot of money if you are keep trying to swap your pepe to the ethereum.

[1] I think it's should be cheaper.Quote from: aubert on May 05, 2023, 01:19:28 AMYou can use https://etherscan.io/gastracker to track the fees. I checked on Uniswap using their default customization, they're charge $23.27 worth of ETH, it's not ~$3 like etherscan recommendation. This because any swap exchange is usually charge you very high fee, not like when you use non custodial wallet to send your token.[1] https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/markets/",

At least if he trades on Binance, he doesn't pay any fees and the wallet on Binance can be a temporary wallet to store the PEPE tokens until the token fee goes down.If he wants to send PEPE tokens to other exchanges, he has to think about how much it will cost to send, is it worth doing so or is it still on Binance. But if it were me, I would keep it on Binance and continue trading the PEPE token.",

I see there's a coin using PEPE name in pancakeswap, you need to be careful because it's a scam coin since anyone can create their coin and list in swap exchange, those swap exchange don't audit or verify the legitimate of the coin. So make sure you're do your own research first to know if the coin has a side chain. If not really sure you can create a thread in this forum or asking through their active social media.",

But what happened to you will serve as a lesson for you then and have it realized that it was important to get familiar with how the exchanges work and it also needs wide market understanding. But good thing you still manage to do it and the result is great. And talking about meme coins, you don't need to keep them long in your wallet, they easily get hyped and must not miss it to sell, or else, you'll be surprised that your $100 become $10.",
