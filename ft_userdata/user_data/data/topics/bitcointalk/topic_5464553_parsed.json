I personally want a casino site that has live sports 24/7 and their deposit, withdrawal, live support, responds very quickly and without KYC to deposit and withdraw a good amount. There are many casino sites in this forum that provide high facilities and are very trusted so as a new casino site you need to adopt some strategies that will make you stand out from the others and have higher facilities.",

To help players determine whether it would be a good site to put their money with but I hope this would also come with a way to not tamper those comments by both players and the site itself. It would be an interactiion between players and the gambling site to address issues in a faster manner and to avoid things from happening again to both parties.

How long will a casino live like this until the authorities notice it, I wonder.Probably until it becomes big enough, after all governments do not really care if a casino is allowing such a thing for their clients if they are just moving a couple thousand dollars, but if they begin to move millions then that is when they will give them their full attention and close the casino relatively quickly, however if such a casino appeared and became popular then it would not surprise me if many other casinos appeared which performed the same service.",

It’s very easy to answer the question here too and I doubt someone will notice their survey if they post this on their ANN thread since not all players is checking ANN thread of all the casino here.Quote from: dexsport.io on August 25, 2023, 12:30:48 PMWrite your wishes so that we can become better for you!Boosted odds, Better cashback offer and immediately bet settlement when the result is officially announced is what I'm looking for sportsbook.I'm sure some whale players here will really like no bet limitation especially when players is winning too often.",

      "body": "before I say what I would like to see in casinos, I want to talk about something I saw in your casino, see:and to make matters even worse, your casino doesn't have the face of the casino owner, but has the face of the advisors, I was wondering why the owner of the casino keeps hiding but didn't hide the face of the Advisors? when a person creates something, that person should take responsibility for that thing he created, he shouldn't use other people and hide it, that's not a good thing in my opinion. what's the point of the casino owner hiding and using other people's face and reputation? Does the casino owner feel ashamed of himself and his own casino?because from what i see the casino has a good design and there is no reason for the owner of the casino to hide, nowadays the casinos are licensed, which means that they operate in a legal way, therefore there is no reason for someone who is owner of some casino to hide, now when people create casino with bad intentions then it makes perfect sense not to want to show their faces. another thing i could see in your casino is that it has a token, who are the team members for that token? I also saw that the link in your coinmarketcap casino leads to coinmarketcap in Russian, that means your casino is in Russiansince russia has been placed under sanctions, i wonder how your customers will be able to use your casino without feeling afraid that someday the governments will close or punish your casino, i don't know what are all the sanctions that have been placed against russia, i hope your casino is cool. now talking about what I would like to see in the casinos, in my opinion there should be a forum in the casino itself, but that was intended for people to post their withdrawals, complaints and problems solved and how was the customer service, this would bring a lot of transparency to this online casino industry",

The introduction of more games and same bonus parlays wouldn't be so bad either, so that's something you might wanna take a look at as well. Plus more secure ways they can keep their money so we don't have to worry about losing it to hackers. Just make the casino experience safer and more accessible and a lot of people in here would be happy with it already. We're easy to please after all, just make sure that the basic things we want to see from a casino is met and we're over the moon already.",

Adding live streaming is another good idea considering few sport isn't free to watch. If only betting platforms will adopt what you’ve been suggesting, surely the number of bettors will increase at a high speed. But I think they also need bigger capital to make these into reality. And with the tight competition in the betting platforms in the market, it’s hard to take an edge when you’re having a tight budget on running your own platform. However, more promotions and rewards means more potential gamblers will be interested to get in. Especially with free live streaming, this will pave way to make your betting platform becomes more visible especially for those who are still new in betting.",
