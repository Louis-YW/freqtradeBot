      "body": "Well, just by seeing their ads with ROI of 150% in an hour, i can immediately calling that a ponzi site. Doesn't matter they called them legitimate or registered company, because the return is too huge and impossible to do. They can just multiply their own money from their own offer, lol.Just hoping there won't be any victims from this site, especially we are in bear market like now, people like easy way to earn money",

      "body": "Of course, this is a Ponzi project. If we look at the return on investment in an hour, we will find it illogical. I don't know who believes this nonsense. Thank you for exposing them. I hope that no beginner will deposit his funds in their site and fall behind their false temptations. What caught my attention is that their company is registered on GOV.UK with the number 14204462 in the United Kingdom. How does the UK government allow these scammers to carry out their activities and establish an official residence for themselves in the country? Through the certificate that they obtained after registering their company, I see that they take it as a means to deceive people in order to show them a good face.I will report their domain now.",

      "body": "Nice one for snagging yet another Ponzi website. The issue with these Ponzi schemes is that they frequently exit or reopen under different names after being closed. Additionally, there are numerous online Ponzi schemes for a day's worth of exploration in the internet. It also indicates that they are making money. Despite being obvious, it is confusing how people continue to invest in these Ponzi schemes. There are educated people willing to put their money at risk for these Ponzi schemes. The worse thing is when they start recommending it because of the high rewards for doing so.",
