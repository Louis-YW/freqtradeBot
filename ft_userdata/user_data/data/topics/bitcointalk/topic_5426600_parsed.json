The problem is, the wallet is encryptedThere are lots and lots of such \"wallets\" on the internet. The problem usually is not that the wallet is encrypted. The problem usually is that it's a crafted wallet that doesn't actually contain anything meaningful that could get you anywhere near to any private key.So if you bought this wallet, you most probably got scammed.Even more, it's rather uncommon to have email address only 9-10 characters long. My shortest ever email address was 14 characters long.This being said, I'll leave it to the others give you more technical details, since I don't have experience actually decoding / brute forcing wallets (I consider that a waste of time and resources).",

The most you've said is that, you got access to a wallet address and has guessed a build up pattern for the password.The forum might be many things but, they won't be delighted helping you collect that which isn't rightfully yours if it is indeed positive and so, you might want to explain what's up with the address with a little convincing clarity.",

Thanks!Well, you gotta understand a few things:1 - This wallet is publicly available, and cause of that, you are probably not the first one trying to brute force it.2 - The coins are still in the wallet because of two possible options - the wallet file is fake - or the password is too hard to brute force. Say all the chars on the standard english keyboard layout are possibly in the password, and that's easily gets to a huge number of possibilities you can't even think about cracking. If you still wanna try, I can help you out, but don't expect it to work after a day or two letting your compiter run.",

If you want to try all the possible combinations, don't use them.I had an idea for a really long time about creating a software that will split the work between different parties, trying to brute force the password.I just wanna say that it is possible to implement some kind of a brute forcer, that will brute force the ckey/mkey, (these are the encrypted private keys, not the encrypted password) much faster than what Hashcat does for example.By the way, Hashcat will ask you for a hash. Get that using a script named \"bitcoin2john.py\"",

And if you bought the encrypted wallet, you may have been scammed too. In addition, a forgotten key or dormant wallet helps the entire network, that is, we all benefit from the lost bitcoin, so trying to access it and remove the funds will as well affect us all. I think it's better you neglect the funds in the wallet and go work your way to earning 4000BTC. I think its a better way of contributing to the network than wasting time and money on someone else's fortune.",

Is this even worth decrypting? Or it is impossible to get the password just based on this information?Assuming you haven't been scammed (which is unlikely!), it is not possible to brute force a passphrase that is 9-10 characters long since the permutation is just too huge (digit_length9 + digit_length10 = ~4e+18), your knowing 4 characters without knowing their position is not going to change anything.Knowing the email domain (eg. gmail.com) would significantly reduce the size of the password although 9-10 chars total seems too short then.",

Thanks!From my personal assumptions, you bought this wallet, if indeed you bought the wallet, so sorry to say but you've been scammed, without any knowledge of the password, your chances of ever gaining access into a wallet like this is lesser than 0.I will just advice you stop chasing shadows and move on, if someone sold this wallet to you probably for a far lesser amount of what 4000 bitcoins are worth, you should have known its a scam, or if you indeed own this wallet, and you know the wallet password is an email address, this should have been easy for you to remember or atleast have a close guess at what the password is, or can you say you didn't remember an email address you created your self? Not even a close guess at it..? Not possible.",
