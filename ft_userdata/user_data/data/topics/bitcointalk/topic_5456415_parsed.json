And also the network is not cheap to interact.Bridging is expensive and you need to bridge to both the zksync lite and zksync era networks. Also there are fees such as if you want to use Zksync Lite you need to pay to get the account activated to be able to send anything. And after a few times it adds up. The network is not cheap like Polygon.",

The fact that projects have a community approach through some projects such as aptos, sui, blur, arb, ... shows that airdrops are not easy tasks to interact with social networks.Currently, according to my observations, accepting users who have useful interactions with the project will receive rewards in the future, it is really easy to find projects that have a sharing plan. share rewards for the community. But prominent names like zksync, fuse, venom, scroll, starknet, linea, base... are all mentioned by many communities about the opportunity to have an airdrop to the community, and you can completely research and find out ways to participate.",

This may happen once a year, so thinking about alternatives will bring you a better return.",

Using the earning from that you can buy any coin you want or pay for your expenses if your local laws allow it. The bitcoin paying campaigns are like the holy grail of campaigns in this forum, the best side hustles you can get.If you have any other skills use them to provide services, dont run after aidrops, they are not worth your time which I consider is the most precious thing at hand.",

I think you have only engaged in worthless airdrop so far, because from what I recall,  there have been some great and very rewarding airdrop from uni, apt, op, arb, blur, space ID and many more. And we also have some interesting upcoming ones which can definately do airdrop base on the info from the teams. Such includes starknet and sei have been confirmed. All you need to do is position yourself properly. Combo with Polyhedra is also another good one, besides the bounty campaign there is an airdrop for testers of the new combo network.",

That's how every successful airdrops have worked. If they announce airdrop before airdrop, it will get botted out and you most likely won't get anything worth money. In fact you most likely end up spending more then airdrop just by using the product in every way you can think of.That tactic, of actually caring about the project and getting rewarded for it has given me a lots of money via airdrops.",
