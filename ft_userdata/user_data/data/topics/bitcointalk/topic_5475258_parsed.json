Ireland it is a very lovely country, there is no doubt about it, it is sad this is happening there, regardless of the nationality and legal status of those who committed the crime. Though, it is obvious this news will become very relevant since it is going to be pushed forward by certain media within the right political spectrum. I get there could be bad people among immigrant, there is bad people everywhere, but we should not generalize and stigmatize a whole population of people because the actions of a few of them. Just my opinion.",

Some wants to live peacefully following the law of the land while some want to rule and apply their own set of laws.I believe it has much to do with the cultural differences some inmigrants can have when compared to the countries which received them. For example, I recall a couple of years ago when Syrian and other immigrants from the north of Africa arrived to Germany, during the Christmas season they started to harass German women in the streets, to dance around them and chant.I recall it was quite publicited by right wing media outlets as an example of how some cultures cannot co exist. I am rather on the side of believing is a lack of education of those immigrants, who were unaware of the ettiquete and social norms they were supposed to follow there in Germany.",

I am not happy about it if I am honest & my vote will go towards whoever is tougher on immigration & tightening up our borders.Are you from the United States or the European Union? Because I have heard about how Republicans are being disappointed on how immigrants are being treated in comparison to the homeless with American nationality/citizenship. I am not sure it is the same in the European Union, because as far as I see the European Union is rather keeping their immigrants in camps where they are not allowed to leave without saying it to their officials.I believe there should be an equilibrium between taking care of the homeless and the immigrants.",

This is going to start being very clear very soon. Well, perhaps because you are from the United States, you may have more insight about what is going on there, but from the point of view of someone like me who lives outside of the USA, the American dollar seems to continue to be strong enough for it to be universally accepted all around this region.I am aware that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, it was been told the Kremlin and Pekin have been trying to implement menchanisms to get rid of the USD and eventually replace it, perhaps through the BRICS. Though, I am skeptical, something very unusual and negative would need to happen in Washington for the USD to fall off grace internationaly.",

Believe me Conor McGregor DOES NOT speak for the majority of Irish people, he's a big mouth, always has and always will be.Its not just the Ukranian Refugees which has stirred \"some\" Irish people, its the wayit has been handled by the authorities. Accepting so many in such a short space of time without adequate facilities is what has irked so many here.We have been accepting refugees, asylum seekers and migrants from all over the world, Africa, south America for example and by and large there is little or no trouble....except from those who slip through the net so to speak and the same has happened with somefrom Ukraine.It must also be noted that we have PLENTY of scum bags and criminals who are Irishborn and bred.It must also be noted as someone posted already that it was an immigrant whostopped the attack on these 5 people in Dublin, there are many Irish people whowouldnt have!",
