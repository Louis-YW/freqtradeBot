Collecting BTC when it was cheap and holding till bullrun would give them significant amount. Many has got decent amount through this.However, you should never depend on this. This should never be someone's source of income. It's an incentive you are enjoying just because theymos allowed. It may get changed anytime.",

Fishing for something?Also, what's the point of hiding your email in settings when you show it to everyone in your screenshots?You know you're going to get a ton of phishing emails now, especially since you keep posting both the email and exchange you use! You really need to learn more about keeping things private before you experience the disadvantages of not doing so!",

      "body": "I might not ascertain your intention for starting this thread but I want to appreciate you for being truthful. At least you are open to telling us that the income you make from Bitcoinalk is really helpful financially. Some users would usually pretend that their campaign fund is insignificant.But you don't need to announce your financial achievements because it could attract the wrong people to you. Just ensure you change your email and password immediately in all your accounts to avoid the unbelievable.

With time you would get the activity and with quality posts, the other one would come without stress.Good luck and stay safe mate.",
