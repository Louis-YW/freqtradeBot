  "content": "1. Set your bet unit and stick to itThis is a good strategy if you’re starting out with a large bankroll. If you start your sports betting career with $5,000, you may want to stick with a unit. Then you begin to slowly build your bankroll by sticking to a unit bet.We determine our unit bet based on our risk tolerance. The more tolerance for risk, the more we bet. If you’re risk averse, keep your bet unit to a minimum. Sports betting is possible 365 days out of the year. So there’s no reason to cause unwarranted stress.2. Bet a percentage of your bankroll and decrease when you reach a goalIf you start with a smaller bankroll, consider betting a percentage up to a goal. For example, let’s say you start with $300. You bet 20% of your bankroll up until you reach around $1,000.Then, you lower your bet percentage from 20% to 15%. Once you reach $2,000, a huge accomplishment if you started with $300, lower your percentage to 10%. If you’re not risk averse, keep it at 15%.Think of the percentage as the dividends you are making on your sports betting stock portfolio. Doing so allows you to see sports betting in a different light, an investment point of view instead of a gambling point of view.3. Go against the publicYou won’t always win going against the public. You will make smarter bets in the long run if you always lean towards going against the public.By lean, we mean handicapping public choices fully. The public is usually wrong. The public also loves to back chalk. So going against the public in many cases leads to better payouts and plays that have a much better chance of winning.Read more→ https://n2g.io/6e46e60",

It's also like YOLO mentality for your bets. But if it's about the odds and you're into sportsbetting, those odds are like most of the time accurate. Yes, sometimes they don't but they do rarely happen like only a couple of times for most of the bets you do. But, you're the captain your bets and you can go against or be with the public anytime you wish to especially when you're following bet predictions.",

      "body": "Oh, I thought the missing two are 'Do your research' and 'Bankroll Management.'Why?Before making any bets, it is important to do your research and gather information about the teams or players involved. This includes looking at recent statistics, injuries, and trends. By conducting research, you can make more informed decisions and increase your chances of winning.It is important to have bankroll management to ensure that you do not overspend. Set a budget for how much money you can afford to gamble and stick to it. It is also important to take breaks when you are losing and to walk away from a betting session when you have reached your desired profit goal.",

You can not just take your phone or pc, enter casino online and start placing your bet blindly. As a gambler, I believe each and everyone of us know the strategies that some time work for us and the type of game we specialize in, that's also a strategy in gambling.In your second paragraph, you talk about strategy that some time work for you when you want to achieve a bonus in a casino, why? Despite knowing that luck is the major decider but you still apply the strategy and not placing your bet randomly.Although, what OP talk about in this thread are not the basic strategies but a procedure for a successful gambling.",

A good gambler may not check what the public are staking on but instead they analyse and stake on their own. This has been the way that I bet in sport. What that makes most people to lose in gambling is the accumulation bets, but people that accumulate can just use lower amount of money to bet.",

We can also avoid the risk of losing a lot because we can control the amount of money we use for gambling.For number 2, I think if we can win and achieve our goals, we should immediately stop before we have the intention to continue gambling because we want to win more. By stopping gambling, we can prevent the possibility of losing in the next round to enjoy the winning money well. And we can avoid the greed that can arise after winning.I think these two are enough to guide us in gambling and can avoid a lot of losses. What we need is to be able to stay within our limits when gambling so that we don't lose.",

This helps us to manage our gambling duration, by maintaining the daily limits. Atleast playing for 5 days is better than staking all the bank rolls meant for 5 days in one day. Lack of gambling limitations is actually a waste of gambling budget and has some disadvantages on the gambler, but doesn't guarantee winning. It extends the fun, not the fund for inexperienced players, who have no winning strategy. About gambling strategy, I'd say that nobody shares what works in gambling. It's a personal encounter and players or top players may not be able to explain how they actually do it. Most times what others refer as gambling strategy doesn't work for the people who utilize it. The case of, some succeeds and others fail using similar strategy. What works for player A is different for B. Experience, observation and machine malfunctioning can be classified as the best strategy in gambling. Playing with a bad slot machine can improve our wins because it'll be easier to observe how it works. Then milk it for a long time.",

Those above-mentioned strategies for a fact will be very helpful to newbies but I don't think there's any strategy that best works when it comes to gambling. One thing I always tell anyone who wants to gamble is it's either you're emotionally strong enough to lose your stakes and never do anything silly because of your loss or never get involved in gambling. There are people who can't control their gambling habits and such people are not advised to get involved in gambling because it's surely gonna ruin them.",

A friend have said he gambles against what the general people believe to likely be the outcome of the bet and this is especially for soccer bets. To him he feels that some matches are naturally to go against the public opinion so he likes being away from the public opinion and bet on the opposite. He wins some of the games and also lose some like any other bettor.However, I don't know if I would be betting like that, to go against what I'm convinced to be the outcome of the game.

Kidding aside, I don't think the first two matters that much, the 3rd is basically saying everything else doesn't matter, which can be true but it's mostly about just not being peer pressured imo. The only gambling strategy that should be followed imo is having a betting limit, or a set bankroll each session. There isn't exactly a solid strategy for \"winning\", no matter what you do gambling will always exist to be won/lost and a lot of the times, if not all, they're all about luck.",

I started with 20, doubled my balance, and then went lower just to see how much I could get if the winning streak would keep up or will there be a switch to losing more until the gambling site got back everything I won. And that's what happened, they took it all back and more even when I decreased my bet amount. It's not about how much it is when it comes to casino games. There is the system that registers all your winnings and somewhere in the future, it will take it all back even if it means taking a long time because they know we will keep on coming for more.
