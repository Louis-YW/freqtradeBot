  "content": "So a few years ago I got a Ledger, which I then sold afterward (after reformatting) but not without keeping the original seed phrases (card itself is with me).Will I be able to restore the keys anywhere on a decentralized wallet such as Electrum, instead of purchasing another hardware wallet?",

      "body": "Yes, Ledger uses BIP39 for its seed generation which is supported by most wallets including Electrum so you should be able to easily recover your keys with them. You may have to specify the derivation path or the key/address type that your wallet used since BIP39 seed phrases don't have that information in them.P.S. Security-wise it is always a better idea to create a new wallet/seed instead of reusing a seed created by another tool like your old hardware wallet, specially if you have sold that device.",

      "body": "You still can, but it's not recommended.The most recommended approach in restoring your wallet from a lost/broken hardware wallet is again using another hardware wallet given that your previous seed phrase isn't compromised (e.g., uploaded online). The only caveat is that it is an expensive approach.If you're on a tight budget, you can create new a seed phrase using Electrum for optimal security. You'll just need to spend a bit of sats to pay for tx fees.",

Will plan to get one then. Thanks!Quote from: mk4 on July 15, 2022, 03:44:32 AMWhat pooya87 said. But why stop using a hardware wallet? There's no reason to not use one unless you're only planning on holding crypto that's only worth less than probably $200. Don't fall for the \"I can keep my device safe\" excuse, because most people simply aren't capable.I initially thought that as long as one has the seed phrases, it should be safe to \"deploy\" them anywhere.Well after getting burned by the recent Celsius fiasco, I'll take pooya's advice and buy one for a better sense of security.Better not be penny wise, pound foolish",
