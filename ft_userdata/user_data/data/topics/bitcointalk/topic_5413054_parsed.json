Why would you want to invest in it? Do you thini they will get it right this time? What about those who lost their money there? The CEO of this project should be in jail imo. I don’t buy that it was a decentralized project crap neither because it wasn’t.",

If you want to lose money, fall into a psychological crisis, you should invest in luna.We have a lot of potential tokens why people continue to invest in projects that know for sure will scam. With a profit like this, I firmly believe that if you search hard, you will earn a lot in the market.",

It's only worth it for those that have bought it at the lowest and sold for profit but in holding it as an actual investment that has the plan to hold long, not worth it.",

Exchanges sell coins to hamsters and hamsters pay for the burning of the coin, because of the news about which the price of the coin rises. There are no fundamental signs for changing the ecosystem yet, and it will take a long time to burn billions of coins at such a pace.Here are my noteshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5413057.0",

But we are still waiting for the next big surprise because I hope that Luna's price can reach at least $ 1 or lost 3 more zero.What's the big surprise here? you still believe it can hit $1 in the future. Have you looked at the total supply of Lunc right now, or are you hugging it and daydreaming? It would be surprising if the price could continue to rise above this price and then hold above that price for some time to come. But it wouldn't be too surprising if dumping happens and we should soon see a luna3.0 version instead of the current Lunc version.",

Billions went down the drain a few months ago, but still, people are ready to blow their money on something that has already failed (I'm not talking necessarily about the OP). I only have a few thousand LUNC I bought just for the sake of buying for a dollar or two, honestly, I believe that this pump is purely speculative and the risk of it suddenly dumping high.If you're fine with that, go ahead, but I wouldn't take such a risk. I find the developer extremely malicious, failing to inform his investors in time and only posting on Twitter in hopes of keeping the hype going",

Literally has no more use case. Has no utility. As far as I know, all project developers moved on to luna 2.0 or just abandoned their projects. The recent \"pump\" is because of the introduction of staking and the burning mechanism proposal. People are hoping that the burning mechanism will reduce the supply and bring back to the price to where it was before. Hence people are joining the hype train and FOMOing. Look at the market, it is already crashing. Down like 15%+.",

I also don't really know what has caused the recent pump of Terra classic but it really had some incredibly high volume on the exchanges. One reason for that high volume is that most trading bots that are offered by Kucoin and Binance were running on a Terra Classic/stablecoin pair because the votality was high and the volume was also incredibly high which is always good for bots.Now the new Terra Luna started to pump yesterday and i heavily doubt that both Terra versions will pump at the same time. I think Terra Classic will go down again in the next days and weeks.",
