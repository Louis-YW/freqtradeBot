They posit that the change is consistent with efforts by miners to protect profitability by deploying more efficient mining rigs, as opposed to a mass exodus by less efficient miners. They also say it could be seen as an obstacle to price gains.\"",

      "body": "I'm not sure how they came with the statistic and how much more efficient are the new mining rigs, but I doubt that the efficiency grew so much that it beats the heavily inflated energy costs. Even if new, more productive rigs entered the market, it would result in all the operators having access to them --> more competition --> more miners bought --> difficulty increases --> Bitcoin production cost should remain the same or increase. However the cut in production cost could be temporarily caused by the miners who cease operations due to the inability to cover expenses. Capital managemet is key in mining Bitcoin, if you sell the generated BTC below production cost you are in loss. Firms with good capital management can afford to keep BTC for a time to sell at more profitable price levels.",

      "body": "It also might be because difficulty might be starting to go down again, similar to what happened on May to July 2021. There is no other explanation except some of the less competitive miners who cannot maintain a positive cash flow will decide to stop operating. This does not last for a long time, however. Cost of mining will rise again after a few months.",

      "body": "@SFR10. I reckon much of the people get this wrong about bitcoin's pricing. They assume that because the cost of mining a bitcoin is the backing for the price of bitcoin on the market. This is incorrect. The price is dictated by how much demand and leverage is in the market. It is not dictated by how much electricity is used to mine a bitcoin. This is something similar to a stock that has been pumping but the company has a negative book value.",
