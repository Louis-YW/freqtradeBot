  "content": "With technological advancements, a gambler can now enjoy his favorite casino game from the comfort of his home and even on the go. Convenience, accessibility, and expanding selection of online gambling platforms are sure to entice more players in the coming years. What do you think will be the subsequent big adoption in the Gambling industry in the future?According to my understanding, there are two important innovations that will be adopted by the Gambling industry. VR/AR Casinos:Apple is in the process of launching its own VR/AR headset. After the release, I reckon that  Virtual Reality casinos will get a boost and will revolutionize the way we experience the thrill of the game. Imagine being transported to a virtual casino floor. With realistic sights and sounds, and interacting with other players from around the world.  I am assuming that VR technology is poised to create an immersive gambling experience like never before.AI:AI is gaining a lot of momentum in different business sectors. Considering its ability I guess casinos can use AI to monitor, analyze betting patterns, detect fraud, and prevent multiple security issues from AI bots. I do feel this technology might have been already implemented by gambling platforms. If a user can easily create bots to generate profits then casinos can also do the same for security purposes. What do you guys think?",

I don't think they will be viable option unless certain revolutions happen with VR technology. Noone would like headaches. I think AI on the other hand, will be used by all casinos for many different operations. Fraud detection is one simple thing. Think deep. AI can be used to manipulate rewarding systems of games. Casinos can feel lot more optimal for both end users and operators.",

This article will explain a lot. https://www.techopedia.com/cryptocurrency/best-metaverse-casinosPeople can play virtually through metaverse against others. It will be so funny to play poker in the metaverse. I think that metaverse is having huge potential to be adopted by gambling industry. I do like VR/AR casinos but it's not all people will access them easily. It's not all people can afford to buy VR/AR headset.",

      "body": "I don't think that right now we are missing anything while slot machines make the most of revenue for the casinos.Since they are the most played game in every casino I think the casinos if they would want to implement a new technology should implement the VR/AR which would give the gamblers an even more immerse diving into the world of slots.Imagine for example when the cut scenes that some slot games have when you get their bonus round were real and you see angels or daemons with magic wands that near you that it feels surreal,I personally would love such experience from the slot machines and I am sure the time will not be far when we have this implemented.",

      "body": "VR is definitely the next if devices like Occulus etc. become more accessible to mainstream users/gamers. I am still impressed with live games from Evolution, Pragmatic, etc. Can you imagine playing Crazy Time or Sweet Bonanza Candyland in a VR environment? It definitely will challenge land-based casinos. For card games, however, I think it's still better to go to the local casino as not many improvements can be made.For metaverse, things like Meta with cartoon environment are a big no for me. It's kind of like the child's playground. But maybe after the 3d becomes much more realistic, it will be an option.",

It is a business in which huge money is made and they are always ready to invest in something new, and it is no secret that those who enable something new have the chance to attract the most new players and retain those who are already their users.In addition, during the pandemic, online casinos received a large number of new players who discovered some of their advantages compared to physical casinos, and I think that some new technologies will attract even more players of the new digital generation.",

Fraud prevention is still a big topic and I guess AI is already used by many casinos to spot suspicious activities. I wonder what players could do with AI to create an edge for themselves? Find arbitrage opportunities across different casinos? Bugen given how the market grew in recent years, what is even the chance that players find opportunities? It's probably more important that casinos keep reasonable limits in order to not go broke because of extraordinary bet sizes. If they do that and they keep the house edge, what could go wrong for them?",

And both of them can provide a new experience in playing gambling because many people still cannot imagine what it's like to play gambling using these two technologies.Or maybe the VAR technology will be tested first in several trusted casinos so that many people can try it. Of course, this requires tools to play gambling comfortably. But for now, the price is still very expensive. Meanwhile, AI technology is currently still being developed so that it can be even better so that later gamblers can also use it comfortably.",

      "body": "well, of course, having better technology in casinos will always be welcome, but the central problem is that the years go by, technology evolves a lot and casinos implement this technology, but the same problems of years are not solved, I'm talking about problems like: casino accuse the customer of having cheated, but the casino does not show evidence that the customer has cheated, there are also cases where the casino accuses the customer of having too many accounts but again the casino does not show any proof that the customer has many accounts, So I ask myself: would using AI in a casino and the casino have better resources to detect cheating would really solve the core problem? I keep wondering about itbecause it seems to me that the real problem is on the side of many casinos that use arguments of cheating or many accounts to not pay customers who win a lot and in some cases they do this when the customer deposits little and manages to win more than 5x what he deposited in casino. now let's see in such a situation how good would virtual reality be for many casinos? the answer is that it would not be good for many casinos because they would lose opportunities to accuse customers of cheating or having too many accounts, at the end of the day technology can become a big enemy for certain casinos that have shady behaviors",

Just talking about the gambling industry, I'm sure they will use it for fraud control, loss reduction, expense reduction and securityBeing more specific, they can use it to detect suspicious attitudes that nowadays can still go unnoticed, they can use it to replace human attendants, I'm not talking about automatic chat, but an AI that will seem like you are talking to a human and will solve your problem. Maybe with AI and the right prompt, a casino owner can easily know which games are making the most profit, which are worth replacing, which have some likelihood of abuse by users...The last drastic change in the industry that I remember was cryptos and the ease that this brought.The next one like that we probably don't know yet.",

What do you guys think? AI would have much of a place in the industry as the gambling world's already working with it right from the get-go. RNGs, interactions with virtual hostesses that aren't even humans in the first place, and many others are just a good example that AI has the industry in a chokehold. Albeit improvements in the recent renditions are definitely a welcome addition, but it doesn't necessarily equate to it becoming the next big thing because ever since the introduction of digital gambling means AI/computer brains have just been in the background of the success. VR on the other hand is a lost cause. Metaverse died off as fast as it took traction, AR is more of a novelty nowadays to play beat saber more than anything useful really, and people are starting to become more connected with the environment. Plus the industry relishes in its accessibility, if it implements VR it's just another thing that gamblers have to buy and what for? As if that would increase their chances of winning games. If I may, I think the best case scenario is that every advertisement on the internet is going to be from gambling sites. I'm seeing it now, it's growing as we speak, and it's not that much but it's definitely taking over the mainstream social media.",

I'm not familiar though how it works and what specific casino platforms are having that kind of feature. Not wrecking the fun with that innovative technology but I don't think that it's a big deal to consider if it will be adopted in the gambling industry since casino games can be compared to the usual online games where there will be improvement and big development while it progresses.About the integration of a much more powerful and improved AI technology in the gambling industry, I also don't think that it's a big innovation in gambling since it's really a must-have feature to almost entire industries. Integrating that technology into the gambling platform will surely minimize most problems that they faced since then.Looking forward to both innovations being adopted more although I'm pretty sure that there's no big reason to not get there.",
