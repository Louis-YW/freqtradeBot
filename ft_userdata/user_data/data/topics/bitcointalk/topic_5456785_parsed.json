The answer is different for every gambler here.An addicted gambler might not even know that he is an addict because he is so carried away by his emotions on chasing his loss and this will blindfold him when see it. I am no longer an addict anymore and if someone calls me an addict, I will just overlook him because it isn't true.I have a friend that loves gambling on sportbet and anytime you tell him that he is gambling too much and will soon become an addict,he will tell you that he can never be an addict but this person in question does use money given to him by other people to use for the payment of their electricity bills and other important bills to gamble and when they ask him about the payment he will tell them that he used to money to try his luck. At the end he will tell them that by month ending he will payback because he has a job which he uses the income for his gambling activities.",

The answer is different for every gambler here.Yes it's fine no problem with me, as long as it is not true and it not what I am. Many people who denied it became an addict because they are not aware to their situation, they always tell themselves that it is only just they want to get back what they lost something like that and then they didn't know they already lost more, awareness is the good thing in order for you to prevent that thing to happen.",

If a stranger should notice my gambling activities and found out that I'm beginning to show signs of addiction, if they should tell me in a respectful and calm way I will simply thank them and start working on myself, but if they just approach my and start inform me in a rude way or perhaps insult me for engaging in gambling in the first place I will definitely be offended with it, that's very sure.And just as you said, not everyone has the same level of tolerance so some might be able to tolerate it while others like will not be.",

The answer is different for every gambler here.We live in an online era where not even my closest friends know that I gamble,only my wife knows because I have told her and she is OK with it as long as I don't overdo it,she consider that 100 dollars weekly spent gambling as entertaining for me,kinda like going to the movies and every thing is OK within family walls.In my work they don't even remotely know that I can be a gambler let alone an addicted and this because I never talk about gambling at all there even when my colleagues talk about sport games I listen to them when in reality I am the expert that should be talking about them as I have been betting on such games from quite a lot of time  .So for people who feel bad being stereotyped by other people I let them know that as long as you do it online no one can stereotype you at all.",

Do you think identifying as an addicted gambler will make people stereotype you. The answer is different for every gambler here. I don't think the issue of \"will they accept the branding\" is the issue here. The problem is accepting that they have a problem, the branding comes after that. Of course gamblers, addicted or not, will have a negative reaction when you call them addicted gamblers, most especially if you mean the branding. But a responsible gambler will not carry on with his shit upon hearing something like that, he'd assess himself, and would most likely takea break, most definitely a gambler that's spiraled into addiction will see this as something offensive, rant about it/bitch about it elsewhere, and then carry on with his/her unhealthy practices. It's all about self-awareness and the willingness to see the picture from a different angle. Addicted gamblers will have a one-track mind dedicated solely for gambling so you can't reason with them even if your life depended on it, the more desperate they are the harder it will be to convince them they are addicted too. So yeah, to me it's not about if they are offended about being called that, it's about what they do after that matters most.",

Actually some of gamblers are addicted but they keep on claiming they are not addicted but we should know that not all gamblers are addicted.",

Well its a common reaction by these type of people but just let them be because we know that its their money they've been using but there are really moments on which we do really been also hurt on watching our loved ones losing up tons and this is why we could really say up those words.Its true that its none of our business on what they've been  doing into their money but somewhat it cant really be just that able to avoid on not to make some involvement or saying up something into it.",
