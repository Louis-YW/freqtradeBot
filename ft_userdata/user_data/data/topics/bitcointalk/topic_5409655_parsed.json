  "content": "in this poste i would like to discuss immersion cooling for crypto mining , and share some first hand experiences and opinions check out my youtube channel for some videos testing different systems if the last few months : https://www.youtube.com/c/CryptoMininglab/videos a sub to the channel would be great supportFirst let's start with the big question , does immetions cooling actually works ?immersion cooling or liquids cooling technology existed for more than 30 years , used but big tech companies for cooling data servers and supercomputers , so converting that same tech to be used for crypto mining isn't a big dealSo the answer to the question YES immersion cooling works and as long as the system is well designed , dissipating heat generated by electronic component will work as good and even better than any type of traditional coolingimmersion cooling solve a lot of issues that miners are encontrening on a daily basis , i'll mention few for reference- Noise generated by high speed fans- overheating- hardware failure due to water and moisture-short life spend of the silicon chips due to excessive heatnot to forget liquid cooling will offer more overclocking margen to those who want to push their hardware to the limitsNow when it comes to choosing the right system for your needs , there are few things to consider- Design and components quality :the design of any system if as important as its cost , not talking about aesthetics here , but rather the size and the placement of all component within the system , you want to look from a system that is offering all in one solutions , so there are no extra component needed when it comes to setting up the whole thing and start hashing , from power cords , , pdu , ethernet cables and switch .... any kit that requires more than 2 days to set up (including plumbing ) is just too complicated for the varange personquality is another crusel thing when in comes to immersion cooling , all component have to be of a high quality heat exchanger , pumps , pdu , dry cooler... because the system will be running 24/7 in different environment and conditions , so you don't want to have an oil pump of a pdu outlet failure every now and then and having to stop your mining operations , and make sure all compomement are compatible with your local power specs such as voltage (220 V ,380 V single or three phase ) as well as the frequency 50 HZ / 60 HZ- Pricing :Cost would be the number one focus when considering purchasing an immersion cooling systemmake sure you know two things :- The cost of the whole system including shipping , one kit might be cheap to purchase until you get the the quote for shipping cost- All component that comes with the system out of the box , and how easy to install , you don't want purchase a kit that will require a lot of extra spending , from extra parts and having to hire electrician and plumbers to finalize the job , which sometimes cost a lot- Size and customization :Choosing the right size for your mining needs is very important , you want to find a system with a design that is just enough for your needs , because extra size means extra cost when it comes to shipping , and this will require extra fluid which isn't cheap eitherfind a company that can customize the system to suit your needs , because if you stick to whatever options they offer , you will be over spending and run out of space , and multiple systems will create more complication in terms of initial setup and issue diagnosisCooling :always go for a system that offers the cooling side , making your own cooling system based on someone else's kit is just time consuming , and always go for a Dry cooler option , cooling tower (chillers ) not an options in humble opinion , too big for shipping internationally , waste water , not efficient in hot climate , and water will just freeze in a cold one , so a dry cooler is the way to goDielectric fluid :to insure the correct operation and the longevity of the hardware choosing the right fluid is very important , as immersion cooling becoming a trend in the crypto mining world , a lot of companies out there developed specific dielectric fluid for asic miners , so get the right one , not the cheapest oneProduction and shipping time :one week of production time and 30 days of delivery time ( sea freight ) is reasonable for such a system anything longer than that is just too long , you don't want to pay for something to be delivered after two or three months crypto market is volatileany decent company producing this kind of systems should have stock of all needed parts and components , and doesn't require 15 days to put one of these togetherSupport and Communication :it doesn't matter how easy the system is to install , there will be always questions and issue along the way , find a company that understands their product and can offer support and quick responses to your questions , you don't want sit idle waiting for a response to your email you sent couple days ago , communications is key before and after placing your orderHope this will enlighten and give you a better understand of what to look for when you consider switching to immerions coolingany question , leave them in the comment section and i will try to answer to the best of my knowledgeHappy Mining",
