  "content": "24.0.1 Release NotesDue to last-minute issues (#26616), 24.0, although tagged, was never fullyannounced or released.Bitcoin Core version 24.0.1 is now available from:https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-24.0.1/This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performanceimprovements, as well as updated translations.Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issuesTo receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/How to UpgradeIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completelyshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run theinstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL ispossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Oldwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.CompatibilityBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systemsusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  BitcoinCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not asfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core onunsupported systems.Notice of new option for transaction replacement policiesThis version of Bitcoin Core adds a new mempoolfullrbf configurationoption which allows users to change the policy their individual nodewill use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The optiondefaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and nochanges to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of anunconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of thetransaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptancepolicy sometimes called \"first-seen\".The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance thatthe first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particularnode will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multipleversions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the minerwho includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide whichversion of the transaction gets confirmed.Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services todaystill make this assumption.There are several benefits to users from removing this first-seensimplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of atransaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higherfees, was realized in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 (February 2016) with theintroduction of BIP125 opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing thefirst-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of theirolder unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature calledfull-RBF.  This release includes a mempoolfullrbf configurationoption that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off(allowing only opt-in RBF).Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF bydefault for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core areadvocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version ofBitcoin Core.As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enablingfull-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higherfees may rapidly become more reliable.Contributors to this project strongly recommend that merchants and servicesnot accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan forwhen their assumptions do not hold.Notable changesP2P and network changesTo address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peershas been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for thefirst time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is eitherless than the node's -minimumchainwork value or is sufficiently below the work atthe node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download thepeer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storingthose headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up forthe first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effectof a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has lessthan -minimumchainwork), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanismwith the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outboundconnection if -i2pacceptincoming=0. (#25355)Updated RPCsThe -deprecatedrpc=softforks configuration option has been removed.  TheRPC getblockchaininfo no longer returns the softforks field, which waspreviously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status isnow only available via the getdeploymentinfo RPC.The deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase configuration option has been removed.The receivedby RPCs (listreceivedbyaddress, listreceivedbylabel,getreceivedbyaddress and getreceivedbylabel) now always return resultsaccounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option tochange that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.(#25171)The deprecatedrpc=fees configuration option has been removed. The top-levelfee fields fee, modifiedfee, ancestorfees and descendantfees are nolonger returned by RPCs getmempoolentry, getrawmempool(verbose=true),getmempoolancestors(verbose=true) and getmempooldescendants(verbose=true).The same fee fields can be accessed through the fees object in the result.The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)The getpeerinfo RPC has been updated with a new presynced_headers field,indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\"P2P and network changes\" section above.Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.New RPCsThe sendall RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipientswithout creating change. By default, the sendall RPC will spendevery UTXO in the wallet. sendall is useful to empty wallets or tocreate a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a paymentfrom a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transactionfee, continue to use the subtractfeefromamount option via thesend, sendtoaddress, or sendmany RPCs. (#24118)A new gettxspendingprevout RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to findtransactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)The simulaterawtransaction RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the giventransactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can beuseful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpectedinputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)Updated REST APIsThe /headers/ and /blockfilterheaders/ endpoints have been updated to usea query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. Thecount parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The oldendpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.For /headers, useGET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>instead ofGET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json> (deprecated)For /blockfilterheaders/, useGET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>instead ofGET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json> (deprecated)(#24098)Build SystemGuix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 &amp; aarch64). (#21194)New settingsA new mempoolfullrbf option has been added, which enables the mempool toaccept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceabilitysignaling. (#25353)WalletThe -walletrbf startup option will now default to true. Thewallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates. (#25610)The replaceable option for the createrawtransaction andcreatepsbt RPCs will now default to true. Transactions createdwith these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled. (#25610)The wsh() output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscriptdescriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can't spend from them usingthe Bitcoin Core wallet yet.You can find more about Miniscript on the reference website. (#24148)The tr() output descriptor now supports multisig scripts through the multi_a() andsortedmulti_a() functions. (#24043)To help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change outputamounts are now randomized. (#24494)The listtransactions, gettransaction, and listsinceblockRPC methods now include a wtxid field (hash of serialized transaction,including witness data) for each transaction. (#24198)The listsinceblock, listtransactions and gettransaction output now contain a newparent_descs field for every \"receive\" entry. (#25504)A new optional include_change parameter was added to the listsinceblock command.RPC getreceivedbylabel now returns an error, \"Label not foundin wallet\" (-4), if the label is not in the address book. (#25122)Migrating Legacy Wallets to Descriptor WalletsAn experimental RPC migratewallet has been added to migrate Legacy (non-descriptor) wallets toDescriptor wallets. More information about the migration process is available in thedocumentation.GUI changesA new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file has been added (gui#471).Configuration changes made in the bitcoin GUI (such as the pruning setting,proxy settings, UPNP preferences) are now saved to <datadir>/settings.jsonfile rather than to the Qt settings backend (windows registry or unix desktopconfig files), so these settings will now apply to bitcoind, instead of beingignored. (#15936, gui#602)Also, the interaction between GUI settings and bitcoin.conf settings issimplified. Settings from bitcoin.conf are now displayed normally in the GUIsettings dialog, instead of in a separate warning message (\"Options set in thisdialog are overridden by the configuration file: -setting=value\"). And thesesettings can now be edited because settings.json values take precedence overbitcoin.conf values. (#15936)Low-level changesRPCThe deriveaddresses, getdescriptorinfo, importdescriptors and scantxoutset commands nowaccept Miniscript expression within a wsh() descriptor. (#24148)The getaddressinfo, decodescript, listdescriptors and listunspent commands may now outputa Miniscript descriptor inside a wsh() where a wsh(raw()) descriptor was previously returned.

There is nothing any of us can do to reverse course. This is the decentralized consensus after all.As other users have commented, A Fork is not a proper solution for this attack.  Consensus was broken when Core devs decided to go against Bitcoin´s White Paper:   For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend.  Each Attack is an opportunity for Bitcoin and bitcoiners to gain self awareness, this is a perfect example as self awareness is the only posible solution. We need better Bitcoin education.First I'll post my arguments against Full-RBF and then I'll propose a solution: Full-RBF was deliberately included on Core V24.0 without reaching consensus.It opens a door to centralization under Blockstream: Bitcoin is not Lightning. Lighting is a L2 solution for scalability of micropayments. Bitcoin L1 is the truly secure, high value layer.Full-RBF solves NO problem: RBF already existed, there was no reason for Full-RBF to be deployed.Full-RBF enables ANY transaction to be double spendable, any honest transaction could be replaced by a malicious higher fee one. This could result in censorship, seizure of funds by an state actor or theft.For understanding this last argument I´ll explain one of Bitcoins limitations which should be publicly known if we believe in self custody:Because of how Bitcoin's cryptography works, You'll not find substantial attack worthy unspent UTXO. This is because whales know that any pvt key gets easier to extract through brute force if you already use it to sign a transaction. Any system has its limitations and Bitcoin is not the exception. However Bitcoin has been doing great so far with its own. Any transaction awaiting in the mempool is vulnerable due to this same reason.  This is why the first seen rule was included on Bitcoin's white paper. If a state agent is able to extract a PVT key from a transacción on the mempool in less than 10 minutes on 2022, or in X years from now is not an argument. Full-RBF is opening the back door towards censorship and seizure of Bitcoin's transactions.  Now I'll share with you my suggested solution for this attack. It's a multi layer solution and strong community support is required. But bitcoiners are strong, and Bitcoin will came out stronger than ever: Social Layer:Any Bitcoiner that cares for Bitcoin to remain being Bitcoin, and to continue its path towards the wolrd's store of value, must share their disagreement with Core's breach of consensus. I suggest the hashtag #NoFullRBF on every Bitcoin related publication. A campaign for the quick removal of all links to the V24.0 and V24.0.1 Core versions from this and all other sites. A strong educational campaign and continuing program on UTXOs, PVT and Public key's limitations and inner mechanics. Best practices for self custody, unexpended transactions vulnerabilities, etc.  Core Dev Layer:Core must work in a Non Full-RBF V25 client to be released as soon as posible. Bitcoin Core must remove all links to their malicious  Full-RBF code as soon as possible.  Any Dev incapable of summarize, or being concise and clear on their argumentation for Full-RBF must be ignored. It´s a common attack tactic on social layers, to write long speeches with unintelligible language for others to feel dumb. Don't you fall for this tactic. Also personal attacks must be contained from these discussions. I'll take part if it is necessary. Full-RBF Nodes Monitor TeamWe need a new Dev team in charge of creating the tools for Bitcoin's community to be able to follow the number of nodes running Full-RBF in real time. A team Operational for the rest of Bitcoin's History. (Thanks Peter Todd) As the number of Full-RBF Attacker Nodes must never go over 10% of the total node count. Protocol LayerIn case we are unable to contain attacker nodes under 10% we will need to adapt the Timechain. I propose a 5 minute block time with all the necessary adjustments for the monetary policy to remain unchanged. This has profound ramifications in terms of orphan Blocks because of networks latency, propagation and reaction times which needs to be studied further. This is a scenario I prefer to avoid.  #NoFullRBFDo not download Bitcoin Core V24If your are running V24 Uninstall immediately! Security must not be compromised in favor of UX, Scalability, or any other reason unrelated to Bitcoin's value itself.",

But this one that you suggested is an interesting scenario.)Are there people who actively rely on non-RBF transactions to prevent entities such state actors from diverting their transaction? So far, I haven't heard of any instances myself.I think people would be more convinced of any potential dangers if someone engineered an demonstration of extracting a wallet.dat password through some side-channel attack, followed by replacing some existing RBF transaction by another one. Perhaps bumping from 1sat/byte to 2sats/byte to give enough time for experiment setup.",

For a person who was around Bitcoin from early months but now is not too involved in Bitcoin cannot get the software right. Some older machines I own require update because they get alert for unknown rules activated. But I simply cannot trust software that is released by persons who cannot get version numbers right, change domain names and code signing certificates.22.1 and 23.1 are bug fix releases for the previous major versions of 22.0 and 23.0. They contain bug and security fixes that were backported on top of older versions. The purpose of such releases is to allow people to still safely use older versions. Users may still wish to do so because they may still be auditing newer versions, or newer versions contain features that they are not yet comfortable with, or maybe something was deprecated and removed that they are still relying on. In these releases, very little has changed except for some bug fixes that were deemed to be important.Minor releases has nothing to do with \"soy milk drinking wannabe programmers cannot get even the version numbers straight\". It is, in fact, a standard procedure that we do, and is a common practice in the software development industry. Just as an example, the Linux kernel is currently 6.1.2. But there are still releases for 5.x and 4.x kernel versions because they support older major versions. They make bug fix backports to the older versions so that users who wish to still use those older versions are not left out to dry if there are important bugs that are found. This is what Bitcoin Core does as well.Quote from: MysteryMiner on January 02, 2023, 08:47:23 PMThe race to increase major version number like Firefox and Chrome does tells about quality of them as developers.There is no such race, and never has been. The major version number has been incremented periodically, every 6 months or so. That's been the release cadence for the past decade (more than that, actually), and so it's natural that the version number has reached 24 already. Nothing to do with \"race to increase major version\". This would be plainly obvious if you just look at the release history of the software.",

So the there is real base for concerns some users about full RBF feature that developers decided to basically continue to work on older releases?QuoteMinor releases has nothing to do with \"soy milk drinking wannabe programmers cannot get even the version numbers straight\". It is, in fact, a standard procedure that we do, and is a common practice in the software development industry.Standard practice was to release 2.0 version after 1.x is abandoned and in Visual C++ 6.0 New Project menu is selected. I remember Bitcoin always had 0.xx.x versioning schema until someone dropped zero from front and we arrived from pre-1.0 versions to version 22 overnight. If this is not Firefox then what? Also some Intel fanboys decided to rename Bitcoin to Bitcoin Core. And do not tell that Bitcoin and Bitcoin are two different things. The reference implementation of Bitcoin De Facto are Bitcoin. Just like when we are talking about DC++ there is no need to separate DC++ protocol from DC++ client, even if the protocol is compatible with other clients like RevConnect or StrongDC++.QuoteJust as an example, the Linux kernel is currently 6.1.2.

They make bug fix backports to the older versions so that users who wish to still use those older versions are not left out to dry if there are important bugs that are found.If I want to run 2.4 or 2.6 Linux kernel versions, I take out old Slackware or Mandrake CD-ROMs and run them. Also Linux stayed on 2.4 and 2.6 kernel versions for long time. I do not remember 2.8 versions, but probably because I mostly work with embedded systems now. Even Linux kernel development now is infested with soy drinking transvestites messing up version numbers.So where we are now? What is the bestest Bitcoin version?",

You see all those 0.x.1, 0.x.2, and 0.x.3 releases? Those are minor releases, in the same way 22.1 and 23.1 are minor releases.Quote from: MysteryMiner on January 03, 2023, 01:09:53 AMSo the there is real base for concerns some users about full RBF feature that developers decided to basically continue to work on older releases?No, there is no such concern. There were already plans to do 22.1 and 23.1 before that controversy started.Quote from: MysteryMiner on January 03, 2023, 01:09:53 AMStandard practice was to release 2.0 version after 1.x is abandonedA lot of projects maintain older major versions.

If this is not Firefox then what?It was dropped because the 0 wasn't doing anything useful. 0.x releases were referred to as major releases and the x the major version number. The change was to make those two concepts align. It has nothing to do with trying to inflate version numbers. No one gives a shit about that.Quote from: MysteryMiner on January 03, 2023, 01:09:53 AM-snip-At this point, I think you're just trolling. Hurling insults as you are is completely unhelpful.
