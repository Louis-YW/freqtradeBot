  "content": "I would like to know if anyone has MSTR shares. Does it correlate well with BTC? I am considering using Michael Saylor's stock as a way to get into BTC with fiat without being blocked by banks. Trying to buy BTC with exchanges it's becoming annoying, banks block transactions, it's just annoying. Then there's the risk that the exchange fucks up somehow. If they get hacked, now some bastards will be able to buy your dox next to your BTC movements on the darknet, so I was looking at alternatives and only found GBTC, but I don't get how the whole premium stuff works. There's some sort of an ETF in Canada but I have no access to it.The only alternative i've seen is the MSTR shares, I can buy this on my bank right now with no problem, any amount I want, and I would have BTC exposure without risks, other than having to trust Saylor with not screwing up on the custody side, but he seems to know what he is doing. From what I've seen correlation is not 1:1 but close to it. With 150k+ BTC bought, his company is almost a de-facto ETF. In fact I would trust Saylor more than an ETF, since this guy is an actual bitcoiner, unlike Blackrock and co.I know the best thing to do is to be your self custodian, but sometimes you have to be realistic. If you sold a property for like 300k, and you want to buy 300k worth of BTC, you are going to face problems when buying on an exchange, because they'll block your transaction. With MSTR, I've already got the funds ready, just a click away and I've got the BTC exposure I want. It is also not a 10+ year move. I want exposure for like 1 to 2 years, hoping BTC does not disappoint as an hedge during a potential recession.So my question is, does anyone own shares, and has anyone researched this at any serious level to recommend anything I should know before I buy in?",

And I am pretty sure if you want to trade actively there is an leveraged 2x bitcoin etf and also a short bitcoin etf.I think these are better alternatives to MSTR. Sure it follows bitcoins price pretty close but I think buying the Bito shares is more of a legit way of exposure to bitcoin. Or wait 1 month and just buy the bitcoin etf spot based, which everyone thinks it will get approved.",

He's basically got billions worth of fiat at very low interest rates, even 0%, and now he is going to be able to keep buying Bitcoin dips for years to come, he's at 1+ billion profit. I don't know what he did in the past, but so far he is doing great. Even Adam Back is buying MSTR and has praised his company in the way they are delivering a premium. He also has become a hardcore Bitcoiner and knows what he is doing. His company is now profitable and he is managing debt properly so I don't know what else would you ask for as an investor.Also, if you watch any chart of the companies that are doing great nowadays, they all nosedived hardcore on 2000, but those are the winners of today. If he found a way to win by becoming a Bitcoin's holding company then so be it.",

If he found a way to win by becoming a Bitcoin's holding company then so be it.I guess it comes back to your investment goal. If your purpose is not to save BTC/sats, and just want to look for investment return, there is no harm in buying stocks as long as you know the risk. PMost members in this forum probably want long-term exposure though, so I doubt anyone would suggest people buy shares or something similar (wrapped Bitcoin, etc) since the risk is greater compared to buying BTC directly. It can be annoying sometimes, but that is a fair price for most people.I believe 1 or 2 years is still a very long time for crypto exposure. Just take a look at how wild the chart can be. If your goal is to get BTC I believe it is still worth trying to buy them directly instead of looking for exposure through indirect means. Have you tried P2P?",

Saylor's management of his borrowings are exceptionally well placed and the chances of getting liquidated are insanely low that you have to question if you would still hold the underlying if it went that low. There's nothing wrong with debt and leverage as long as it's reasonable. If one is long Bitcoin then the risk:reward that MSTR offers is not something insane to the point you wouldn't sleep at night thinking you would get margin called. His business continues to offer a product that a lot of companies use and he will continue to expand to AI and at the end of the day he has willingly turned his company into a Bitcoin's holding and he is doing it how someone that wanted this proxy would expect. If Bitcoin does not shit the bed I believe Saylor is on track to be remembered for making the most profitable bet ever.https://bitcointreasuries.net/",

ETF are 100% pegged to btc. so ETF shares are 100% operationally exposed to bitcoins price and should match daily(bar the fee) however both micro and ETF's are not allowing users to direct hold/have access to BTC by being a share holder. ..another thing to note. lets use Microstrategies january peak of 699.51lets use bitcoins january peak of 46995.1that puts MS at a 67.18 MS share peg to 1btchowever within a fortnight. the peg does not remainlets use Microstrategies price of 488.30 todaylets use bitcoins january price of 42585.60 todaythat puts MS at a 87.21 MS share peg to 1btcthats a peg drop of 29.81% in a fortnightthus is a show that microstrategy dropped away from bitcoin by 29%and this aint the last time microstrategy can depeg further, especially if its actual business takes a hit for many reasons...wit that said, if i trusted MS the numbers show the share price is undervalued vs assetsMicro strategy supposedly has over 180,000btc ( x $42500=$7,650,000,000 assets)microstrategy has a float of shares of 12.64M ( x488.30 = $6,172,112,000 share cap value)so is showing to have assets of $7.6bill but share value of $6.17billwhere by the shares compared to suggested asset value(189k btc) should be ~$635/share+",

Im up 6 figures on the thing, but I could be 7 figures if I went in with a bigger conviction. I wish I bought more. Now we are getting a lot of tourists that still understand what Saylor is doing. We have idiots claiming the trade is over because MSTR got ahead of itself and will not be able to catch the BTC price on the way up. This is of course nonsense since if BTC doubles, then anyone not expecting an ATH for MSTR needs to explain how. Saylor has been improving the BTC stockpile and now it's up to 400k and he continue to increase it. On the next way up it will eventually hit ATH.The options market for this thing is amazing, rivaling the likes of NVDA and MSFT TSLA for the first place. I believe MSTR will be a trillion dollar company once it's better understood. When the BTC price of 6 figures becomes floor then those expecting lower prices for MSTR will FOMO in. We will see gamma explosions on the options market pushing the price higher. This trade of course depends on what BTC does and it's not for the faint of heart as you are going to need to be able to hold through volatility unless you are a godlike trader that is able to get in and out on profits which I really doubt, so as long as I believe the BTC bull cycle is not over im not going to be getting out of this. We will see retail that jumped on the trade expecting to get rich sell and I may even add more to the position. Adam Back recently agreed with this view and said the mNAV in relation to the current price of the stock and BTC is attractive. I hope someone read this back then and ended up buying. I doubt it tho given the replies this got as you can read above. Luckily I decided to take my own decision and im winning bigly.",
