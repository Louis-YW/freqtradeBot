  "content": "Hey newbies and OGs, just i quick reminder of the current condition of the Bitcoin network and what it is like with the hike in transaction fees and network congestion.First, as the title states clearly that Bitcoin network fees are not high but it is you as a holder who can't afford it, the reason being that many newbies and some few old members have mistaken this current network condition to mean a crisis, the reality of things is that, most Bitcoin old term holder are not complaining because they already have experience of how the Bitcoin networks work per time, and if they want to make a transaction they rather just pay high fees and move on rather than paying low fees with long time of waiting because a lot of transaction volumes that have higher fees than yours are already broadcast into the network so it takes long time before getting your transaction confirm.I hope that a long time from now, most newbies will stop making news from this kind of temporary network congestion, and start focusing more on how to contribute to making the Bitcoin network cleaner and globally adaptable to all, for me I don't see any negativity in bitcoin but rather a lot of opportunity to develop along with Bitcoin as an alternative among another alternatives.",

      "body": "Yes the network congestion itself is just showing a glimpse of probably how the network will be when mining stops and when we have high adoption rate, but the problem remains that people are furious about this high even the longer term holders because this fee is not incurred because of bitcoin alone but because of the shitcoins on the network. It would have been understandable that we are paying this high fees if at all the congestion in the pool is mainly because of high demands of bitcoin but it is not. So I don’t think anyone is happy to pay that amount at this senerio.

In my local currency, you will spend around $0.1 to send that, where then is the advantage of Bitcoin in terms of cost of transaction?The fees haven’t been that too high I will say, the high fees as regularly been hovering around 500sats/vbyte which would amount to around $26 which quite low compare to your estimation. Although I doubt that you can pay $0.1 to transfer an amount worth $1k but it might be your country, even though it is like that it would be internal transaction and not cross boarder transactions because I am sure it will be more than that. As you know bitcoin doesn’t censor between inter or intra transactions that is where the decentralization comes from. It is better to know that using bitcoin transactions now should be when it is at your advantage, if the fiat has better advantage at that certain period of payment then make use of it, that’s why bitcoin is like an alternative to traditional currency",

Not really,  but then Bitcoin transactions have chains and at any time, the sender can adjust the fees just to get his transaction through faster, so that doesn't mean even low Bitcoin holders can't use such a feature but the same rules apply to all of them.Just like flying a first class and economy class, the same Aeroplan but different treatment, Bitcoin have given us a classless network, so for that how can I assume that Bitcoin is meant only for the rich, Bitcoin is a development that anyone who takes the time to study it can adapt to the network on a long term base.I hope this clears things up a little buddy!",

If you agree with me that majority of the times the network fees was lower than fiat, and that the high network fees that happens sometimes is usually caused by something, then you will also agree with me that the post is wrong.

Even some OGs still comfirm that the fee is high as it is impacting negatively on people and those who adopted Bitcoin as means of payment in their businesses.",

It is the uncertainty and the volatile situation in the memepool. If the memepool suggest 37 sat/vB and you process a transaction using it then also there is no guarantee that it will get processed in time. As I said earlier the problem is not high fee the problem is the volatility in transaction fees. You never know when it will straight away jump to 70 sat/vB or 100 sat/vB. I have not seen such amount of volatility in transaction fee until BRC20 came into existence.",

Bitcoin has always been attacked in different forms and bitcoin will still survive. If this was how the fee was initially then I doubt that all us of here will be spreading the good news of bitcoin because so many people will be discouraged to adopt bitcoin.

Yes, the person can afford the fee, but is it really necessary? I consider it a waste of the privilege of holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin.
