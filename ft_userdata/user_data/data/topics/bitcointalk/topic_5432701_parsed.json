      "body": "Do you only have the one channel open too?I think the second message about the fees is because you're sending too small of an amount via too many hops (can you open a channel with the whoever you're sending funds to)?There might be custodial services that work out cheaper too (you could try sending the funds somewhere else first and see if the fee to withdraw from there is cheaper).Also who are you paying and what are you paying for. I don't know if it's likely but I think it's possible you could connect your channel to your own node and then charge high fees to receive transactions through that channel (which could've happened here).",
