I can tell English is not first language OP, but as far as I can understand you are pleading for your red trust to be removed even though admitting to have several accounts (aka ID's) ?I don't quite understand what you are trying to say. Also, I you should be aware that the chances of your red trust being removed are not good OP and you should not blame it on Legendary users, not all of them have the power to tag you the way @lovesmayfamilis did. You may even get more negative tags because this thread, btw. You should have sent a private message to lovesmay before doing this.Merry Christmas.",

You can own 10000 accounts if you wish, although it's pretty ignorant to be that greedy. What is wrong is joining the same bounty with your multiple accounts. That's what is getting you tagged. You can join every single bounty offered by the managers with 1 account. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? You can join with 1 account period. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN JOIN EACH BOUNTY ONCE WITH ALL OF YOUR ACCOUNTS. THAT MEANS YOU CAN ONLY JOIN EACH BOUNTY WITH 1 ACCOUNT. That's why I ask, why be greedy? Why not work fair and earn your tokens? You think you're gaining balance and peace in life by being a cheater? To answer your other question. If you are banned you cannot create a new account. Once your new account is found and connected, you will just be tagged again.",
