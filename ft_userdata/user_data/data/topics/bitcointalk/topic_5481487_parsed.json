Definitely, the Bitcoin community would make adjustments soon, but it seems that awareness regarding the need for this upgrade hasn't fully circulated. I hope necessary actions will be taken for a more effective upgrade.",

      "body": "Bitcoin has gone through a few upgrades in the past to address the issue of higher transaction times and fees. In 2017 there was the SegWit upgrade which shifted the way transactions were structured in the blocks increasing the 'space' or capacity of each block. The Taproot upgrade reduces the size of multisig transactions by combining multiple inputs into one before sending to the blockchain, again improving transaction times.These upgrades both, critically, preserve the PoW architecture of the Bitcoin network which is decentralised and more secure than compared to PoS which is what many altcoins utilise. A notable one is Ethereum which recently changed their PoW to PoS to reduce gas fees. Here is a link for that long-debated topic : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387588.0But you are right further upgrades to improve transaction times and reduce transaction fees can't come quickly enoughQuote from: PX-Z on January 13, 2024, 11:57:12 PMMany will understand your concern of having that 10 minutes confirmation time, but that is just an average before a new block is found and developers won't just update because of this and for a reason of it's actually technically possible (i hope im wrong).

Developers struggle to choose 2 or 3 as their main priorities because they can not maximize all three for a same blockchain.I agree that Bitcoin block time is too long, 10 minutes and current design makes its transaction fee is expensive but one thing I really like about its blockchain, Security. You can not find better blockchain with security like Bitcoin blockchain.https://howmanyconfs.com/",

I think Bitcoin needs to accelerate with increasingly sophisticated technological developments, and transaction speed will probably become a vital need in the futureThe future size of the Bitcoin ledger is too complex to anticipate; in short, making such a prediction is, in my opinion, impossible. Understanding the underlying variables and probable conditions, on the other hand, can help us create more accurate predictions.It is also critical to understand and remember that not every node is required to download the whole Bitcoin blockchain or to participate in the network. Other participants, such as light nodes, merely download transaction headers, lowering storage requirements dramatically.",

Increasing the block size will be a major challenge to running of nodes because the blocks will mostly be filled with spams like ordinals or even dust transactions which will erroneously increase the capacity to store the block chain. One thing I think the devs of bitcoin network will be looking to solve is how to entirely stop or Block the storage of BRC20 tokens on the network.

I don’t think bitcoin cash was any solution to bitcoin, the fork didn’t get the attention they wanted mainly because the scalability problem they tried to solve actually lead to a weaker system than bitcoin it self because of the little power need for mining of block which could actually make threats like 51% attacks much easier",

Reduce the block time will increase the possibility of getting attacked with double spend and 51% attack. That's why there are many people fork Bitcoin e.g. BSV, BCH, BTG etc because they want to create their own Bitcoin which they call it improvisation.It's no longer beta status according to achow101, I believe Bitcoin will always be improved to face or prevent a threat that could harm the ecosystem from time to time.Quote from: achow101 on September 22, 2021, 04:27:09 PMQuote from: vjudeu on September 22, 2021, 12:04:26 PMIt is no longer experimental, because the latest version is \"22.0\" instead of \"0.22.0\", the leading zero is missing The version number is not an indicator of experimental or beta status.Bitcoin Core still (intentionally) contains a line that says \"this software is experimental\". The line saying that Bitcoin Core is beta software was removed in 2014.",
