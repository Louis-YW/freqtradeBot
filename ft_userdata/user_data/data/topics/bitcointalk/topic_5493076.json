I think it is cool to see someone from outside the finance and tech field talk about bitcoin. It might not be groundbreaking but I am going to be cheering on every new person who supports bitcoin.

There have been older reports of US baseball and American football stars taking a part of their pay in BTC. They are thinking long-term, and understand that bitcoin traditionally goes up in the long run.A perfect example of a good strategy is what Michael Jordan did back in his days. This, of course, has nothing to do with bitcoin, but it's just an example what can happen if you have a working brain. He had a contract with Nike, but only a part of it was paid out to him in fiat. He requested the rest to be in Nike stocks. Eventually, the stocks he was given ended up being worth 10 times more than what he would have earned in fiat.",

I am hoping that down the road we'll see more UFC fighters getting paid in bitcoin, either in full or in part.The thing is the recent sports men we have now are not like former athletes who you will see neglect the culture of investing, the athletes now have picked up the ball idea of investing just to have a financial stable retirement not like their predecessors who most at times ends up with nothing later. Am I surprised about the inclination to bitcoin? I will say No because with all that bitcoin possess it will be hard for someone to have a research on it and not pick interest. I even feel like there are more athletes that have invested in this Bitcoin anonymously than they speak about. It’s a good move by Moicano to have treated this as a currency, hopefully he might get his request granted or even go ahead to purchase it himself. $300k worth of bitcoin now is equivalent to almost 5 bitcoin, with the much anticipated bull run if he holds for long might see a 2x return of that amount",

This tweet will get him more interactions on his social media than his previous posts and if his request is granted he will get an easy buy in to thousands of Bitcoin without hassling about where to buy them from.

They are thinking long-term, and understand that bitcoin traditionally goes up in the long run. I think people are gradually beginning to understand what Bitcoin is capable of and it's benefits, also the bitcoin halving have been preached over and over by crypto influencer on the media and based on the benefits that comes with it, i think a lot of people are beginning to buy the idea of investing in it currently before the main halving event starts. And based on the current dip, celebrities, business men, industries would see this as an opportunity to acquire as much Bitcoin as they can to prepare for the halving. Michael Saylor has shown as an example. In one of his interview i came across, he mentioned that he'll buy more Bitcoin instead of selling, which is a very good decision for those who hodl Bitcoin as a long term investment. Although i know that some people out of fear would begin to sell their coins because of the dip, instead of buying more.",

I am hoping that down the road we'll see more UFC fighters getting paid in bitcoin, either in full or in part.That's another great news, but let me confirm you that this is not the first second, or the third fighter asking for a bonus, as I have had a good time here reading a lot of topics, and I saw somewhere some female fighters also demanded funds in the form of BTC, in search of that topic I found many other articles as well which tells us how many fighters have shown interest in BTC. And I will be more glad about them because they adopted it soon as currently, they will be making 2x or 3x already. But that depends on there Buying price. I still hope this dude will also make some good returns from his investment in BTC, besides I think there must be some taxation thing involved here too, like can anyone confirm they have to pay less or more tax in BTC or in Fiat. Brazilian UFC fighter Luana Pinheiro who will receive a full salary in BTC. UFC fighters Khamzat Chimaev, Alex Volkanovski, and Petr Yan won $30,000 for First Place, $20,000 for Second Place, and $10,000 for Third respectively.Top 10 UFC fighter signs Bitcoin payment contract: 'I'm doing it for my future'First Female UFC Fighter Will Be Paid in BitcoinThese all adopted it in around 2022 and now I assume they would be in profits, but I am wondering if they adopted in 2022 then they might have bought high, well, still they be in profit but why they don't buy in bear.",

      "body": "Hmm that's quite interesting!This is what he has demanded from the UFC, if he wins the bonus, then Moicano says that this payment should be given to me in Bitcoin. In fact he did not win. However, this is the best stance on behalf of athletes, those people are completely out of context with this field, i.e., Crypto, but they also know how famous Bitcoin is. And this is what makes people hate Bitcoin.  Seeing similar initiatives, it is great to see that Bitcoin is now at a stage where even strange people are eager to adopt it. But anyway Moicano has thought absolutely right, he knows that Bitcoin has already made its new all-time Time High although Halving has not happened yet. And after barely 3 days, when Halving will happen, the price of Bitcion can easily go from his current price to 180k to 200k at the end of the years, so he can get a good profit margin from bonuses if he is successful in winning bounes.",

This is a good example of advertisement using your influence and this is how it should be for any celebrities that support bitcoins, they need to give it free advertising to increase its price further. But as we all know most of them won't do it because they want their assets as anonymous as they can to avoid some major problems like taxes or any other issues from their government.",

This guy is no exception.He should have asked for a bonus in bitcoin around the end of last year, when BTC was 2 times cheaper.  He would have received a bonus of 10 BTC, not ~5 BTC.Interesting point:How will all these athletes (and others) who receive a salary (or bonus) in bitcoin pay their taxes?",

It is cool to see celebrities show off their wanting and help to advertise Bitcoin more widely.Their adoption is contribution to Bitcoin adoption globally and we don't judge that they do it with other hidden reasons but it's their individual concerns, not ours. We only care about increasing Bitcoin adoption, with time and at global scale.These people are smart enough to say Bitcoin is one of things they accept, not the only option.

According to him, after learning about Bitcoin, he no longer keep his money in the bank, this should explain why he requested his bonus to be paid in Bitcoin. The publicity is really nice for the community, while other crypto projects are paying through their noses to have their shitcoins endorsed by celebrities, Bitcoin is getting a free publicity. What else that needs to be said to convince people that Bitcoin is not a scam?",

However, I think it's much smarter to invest in Bitcoin yourself without raising a lot of dust - because if you get $300k, isn't it easy to transfer that amount to an exchange and buy BTC? From a security perspective, it is not wise to tell anyone that you are your own bank, because thieves rob banks, especially if they are located in private buildings such as houses or apartments. However, perhaps the man is counting on the fact that his martial arts can deter the bad guys with such intentions💪",

He is a fighter, he won the fight and tweets on X that he wants money in Bitcoins. Media will see that tweet and will publish articles about how UFC Fighter demands his prize to be paid in Bitcoins. If you type that you want 300K bonus in cash or on bank account, no media will write an article about you. That's just my personal opinion but I would also love to say that even if he doesn't support Bitcoin (I think so), it still is good for making Bitcoin popular because there might be some of his fans who will hear word Bitcoin from this tweet and will get interested into it.",

Some of them invested in businesses that failed after a few years, while others wasted their flamboyant lifestyles. Renato Moicano's asking to be paid in Bitcoin shows that he is knowledgeable about the prospect of the currency as an investment. The Brazilian has about 79,200 followers on X and 40,000 followers on Facebook. His preference for Bitcoin will be viewed by most of his followers and who knows, some of them might have an interest in Bitcoin. Other sportsmen might also start showing interest in receiving payments in Bitcoin and someday we might have prize money for winning the UEFA Champions League paid in Bitcoin  .",
