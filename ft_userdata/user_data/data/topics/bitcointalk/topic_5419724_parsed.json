  "content": "Hello,Being author of few  programs for restoring partial WIFs or seeds, I am often contacted by people who claim to be owners of damaged paper wallets. In the most cases it is unfortunately not true - I do not know who is the source of that images, but it is surprising for me how that content is circulating and comes back to me (sometimes after several weeks/months). Each time another person assures me about authenticity of treasure and disappear after it appears to be a waste of time. There are always 1-2 photos (always the same) so it is not possible to ask for another photo, with a different angle etc.I have decided to publish some of paper wallets/images which were sent to me more than 2-3 times and which appeared to be emptied log time ago or are forged - their authenticity cannot be confirmed by successful restoration. Maybe it will save other's time (and money).In other words: if someone shows you one of these addresses (or try to sell them to you), you know it is not worth to work on it.(moderator: I try to send each case as a separate post, please do not merge)",

It is either fake story to sell something like this (picture of the key/mnemonic or a wallet file supposedly containing a lot of bitcoin) to them and make money from their naivete. Or a malware embedded in the file they are giving away for free to infect the victim's computer and steal their coins instead.Nobody would bother with such things if there were $10 worth of bitcoin in it",

      "body": "I have seen similar services on a cracking forum where a certain address containing 50btc or more but dormant is sold without a private key and the buyer is expected to crack into the account by different means to get the money. Even, people fall for big offers with narrow retrieval process. This type of scam looks real and victims can easily be convinced to buy at a cheaper rate, without sitting back to think why this seller didn't retrieve the paper wallet himself is he not in need of the money? Just like people that sell a course that'll teach people to earn 10k dollars a week for $100, and greedy people rush to buy. The internet or cryptocurrency market don't favor the greedy people as they'll always fall for, buy 1 btc to get 10 btc, scam. Thank you for exposing these pictures, more are still in circulation you can update the thread too when you have other forged pictures to save members.",

Easier to scam the next bunch of newbies that come in with the same old thing.Even if you tell people it's a scam they still think they know better and will find a way to get the BTC.No different then the posts that still come up that they found a way to get private keys because they know math better then anyone and no matter what every cryptologist has said they are all wrong.....Since here in the US we had a drawing for a $1.9 billion dollar lottery yesterday, my business today.....-Dave",

Many times they do not.The OP seems to be digging into and poking around old addresses for some reason. I think everyone who gets into BTC does that at some point in time.6 months ago discovered the chapter \"lost/damaged wallets/passwords/keys\" in the Bitcoin world. Since then looking for stories, wallets, transactions that are connected with such addresses. So found also this address. But so far no clues whether it's a recovered wallet. I must say there are so many fantastic stories (but also lot of fake wallets, damaged keys). I hope that people who lost their keys can be able to get their coins one day.One of the best stories is a guy who created lots of addresses, printed the screen output for each wallet on paper and stored them years ago. Then transferred over a long period BTC from exchanges to these addresses (The sum is huge). But he thought that a message plus the signature of this message can be used as private key and all of his prints on paper show exactly this. Instead of printing the WIFs, he made a cold wallet storage on paper of the signatures as he never saw a WIF private key before and thought that these are used to create signatures with the Bitcoin GUI. The good part of the story is: one day he will be able to calculate the private keys as each print shows several windows where also the txt window is visible with parts of the WIF. What I want to say: 'Your Keys, Your Coins' but understand exactly what private keys are, how they work and test it with small amounts (to an address and from that address to a new address) before you do it with large ones.Maybe this 5000 BTC account was such a case, the owner was able to 'reconstruct' or 'calculate' his lost/destroyed private key.@casinotesterÂ  @PawGoCan you post some of these prints? Want to check them.",
