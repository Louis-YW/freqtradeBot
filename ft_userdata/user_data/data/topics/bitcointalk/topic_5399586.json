And yes, we stay anonymous to the public. For Exchanges we provide everything what is needed. the text to the smart chain is for sure a standartised c&p text, but it must be in the whitepaper. best regardsSemantics, but very well, I'll concede, I stand corrected. 10 months for presale. And how long will your public ICO sale be? I can't see any entry for ICO on your roadmap, only presale, almost like... you use both term interchangeably. Did you not know that they're different stages?Quote from: PolyBTC on May 21, 2022, 05:47:47 PMQuote from: holydarkness on May 21, 2022, 09:09:25 AM[...]Plagiarism Detectedreported to mod, sry but simply you cant do those things here. we provided our tax number and everything and we are legit.check our whitepaper and scroll complete down, you will see something there.An agressive move, I like it, it's a nice change of scenery from the usual playing victim \"we just hired a content writer and didn't know they copy pasted the content\". With that said, lets move to the matters at hand.First, your \"tax number and everything and we are legit\", with \"everything and we are legit\" I assume you're talking about your company registration, where exact can we find these info? The first things I usually do whenever I visited a website is scrolling down to the bottom of their page as usually it's where all the legal stuff like company name and registration and address were written, and I'm rather sure it's not there, I even double checked to see if I was wrong, even utilizing a search button for your whitepaper.Second, about your last sentence which imply that I didn't read carefully and missed an important part as below,And the problem here is, in spite of your claim that you've do the proper citation by crediting the original content on your \"bibliography\" --which sadly still inadequate as you didn't properly cite the source as well as crediting other articles you plagiarize-- well.. you see, the thing is, we always archive everything. Those blue archived words scattered on the opening post? Yeah, those ones, like the one i left unsnipped from the post pyramid and the one on previous sentence. It means, we have a record of the original content --be it a whitepaper, webpage, or other things-- as per the accusation being published, which also means  even though you edited them later on to bury the evidence or whatsoever reason, we still have a reference of the original content.",

Nice. It didn't instantly relieve you from the violation of copyright from binance, as Stalker22 pointed out, though. And what's this faking that you keep talking about, if you may grace us by divulging more? Were you insinuating that I fabricate the evidences to incriminate you?

This accusation, though, are presented with evidences.Two, the mods here didn't meddle in scam accusations, especially one that's proven to be true, i.e. you took copyrighted materials --from binance-- without their permission, having your logo from a free source too instead of making an effort to create or hire a professional to create your own, and you can't even show your self-proclaimed reg and tax number.Three, bad news for you, but CMC is no longer the paragon of project tracker, it's been known to people who dwell on this forum that they're, in a way, bought-able.
