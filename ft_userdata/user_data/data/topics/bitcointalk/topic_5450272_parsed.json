  "content": "I have just downloaded the new google authenticator to confirm what is on the news: The danger with Googleâ€™s new cloud backup for 2FA authenticatorGoogle is no more only close source 2FA, it is now doing code backup on the google online cloud. It gives convenience, but there are many people that have lost their coins, or their wallet hacked because of online cloud issue. Backup your 2FA codes offline is better and be careful not to lose it.The 2FA app that I can still tell people to use is Aegis.If you do not want online cloud, do not update to the latest google 2FA. If you update it, I believe you have your email already on your phone, that is only what it would be required and that will be when you will know that it is too late.",

      "body": "The only advanced update that I enjoyed on the Google authenticator is the part that I can generate a QR code backup for all my linked accounts, so even with the devices, I can use any other device to link up my Google authentication. Even if I lose my device, I can have it printed out and safe keep it.This online backup to email was a result of too many complaints of losing access to the authenticator without the help of the platform or wherever you linked it to. There is no means of recovery.What they did not do has made Google Authenticator more harmful than it was back then because anyone who is able to bypass your email and gain access to it will automatically gain access to all your accounts, which is why Google Authenticator was the thing that helped people out from being looted.",
