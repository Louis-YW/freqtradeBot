Well, my thoughts on this, it is not a surprise to see people like him and other celebrities verge into NFTs and crypto.",

On that basis alone I think having celebrities promoting NFTs is probably better than not having them promote it.Quote from: budz0425 on June 12, 2022, 11:58:47 AMA lot of artists are now getting attracted to these NFT's, you're right they see big money because they are popular. so many fans are willing to pay thousands of dollars just to get these exclusive NFTs from their Idol.with these NFT's  they can promote their products without paying Taxes. If it helps bringing NFTs or anything else that innovates to  bigger audience and if they made money along the way, what is wrong with that? I do not see it as a big problem rather it seems a small price to pay in order to maximise the potential of the NFT market.",
