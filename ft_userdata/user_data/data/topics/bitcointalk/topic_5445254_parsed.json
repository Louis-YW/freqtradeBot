If so, I advise you cryptowat.ch[1], and you can see some Basic TA features here[2].Unfortunately, advanced TA and scripts work well with Tradingview, so if you are a professional in trading, this means that you generate profits, and therefore you can pay the fees. Otherwise, cryptowat.ch is an excellent alternative.[1] https://cryptowat.ch[2] https://blog.cryptowat.ch/technical-analysis-ta-alerts-simple-moving-average-sma/",

      "body": "The main charting platform that I used is the tradingview not paid and I only use the free version like you, I don't need to pay because I only use 3 indicators which is the Simple moving average, volume and RSI. There are a lot of pop up ads but for me it is okay as long as I can easily read and understand the chart. When it comes to screener, I use investagrams because they have good screeners than in trading view. There are certain parameters like in moving average that trading view doesn't have so I use investagrams for screeners for me to successful watchlisting all of the good cryptocurrencies. I also want to add the cryptobubbles, one of the great platforms that we can use for us to find good and momentum cryptocurrencies.1. Investagrams.com2. cryptobubbles.net",

Why you need an upgrade are you using more than 3 Indicators or need the alert?I Will share you a tips if you want more than 3 indicators you can actually code it by yourself or just looking the community script https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/ there is a bunch there. Sometimes it combine multiple indicators and turned into one single indicator little bit confusing but here this one of the example https://www.tradingview.com/v/zMeUCm7b/ -  This One combine Stochastic RSI and Regular RSI and you can change the parameter",

Some indicators are available for Premium account and above. If you don't want to spend money to buy Premium account, you can use the free version. In fact you don't need to complicate chart with too many indicators hence Premium might not be necessary for your need.If you want to buy Premium account, you can wait for Black Friday each year to buy it with great discount + 1 more month then you will have 13 month to use.",

It is worthy to pay for that version as you can use some more advanced indicators. It will allow more indicators at the same time on one chart but it is not what I like. Because when you trade long time enough, you will know that you don't need to use many indicators on a same chart.You can wait for annual Black Friday event from Trading View to buy with very good discount price and +1 month to use.",

      "body": "I tried many of the other platforms but I still prefer tradingview. And yes its not cheap but what you can do is wait for the Black Friday sale and I think they offer a 60% discount if you pay yearly. Its obviously not free but its a fair price for what you are getting.They have reliable alerts and have platform that you can use both on mobile and on your computer. The other platforms are just not as user friendly but if you don't want to pay anything then you can always make it work.The ads are not that bad with the mobile app, I dont think ive ever encountered an ad there. Only with the desktop version. The only issue is that you are limited in the amount of features.",
