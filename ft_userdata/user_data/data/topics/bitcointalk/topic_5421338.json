If we try to take an optimistic view, this will teach people to guard their own bitcoins, their own private keys but I doubt it if we are talking about most people, and if that was the case, forget about overwhelming price rises for the next cycles, as the mass trading facilitated by the exchanges was largely responsible for the price rises, just as their collapse is now responsible for the price falls.",

BlockFi and Voyager are about to die, probably sooner rather than later. Well, they should have died a long time ago if not with SBF. But with SBF now hitting the bottom, these two will certainly fall. Except perhaps if somebody else is interested to acquire them. This sister company of Grayscale, Genesis Global Capital, might be the third one. There will surely be others. So there are probably more than 3. They're all definitely very busy right now controlling the damage caused by the fall of FTX to their companies. $15,000 for Bitcoin is a big possibility. Although all these things that are happening with centralized platforms right now don't have anything to do with Bitcoin, I guess it can't be avoided that it's dragged down as well.",

In no previous cycle the price has fallen for so long below the price peak of the previous cycle.Apart from the fact that we are at these levels and I don't see any reason for the price to go up significantly. Neither the situation of the economy in general is good, nor the situation of the crypto ecosystem is good either, because everyone is thinking about who is going to go bankrupt next.

According to some information being shared in social media, Genesis needs a loan of $1 billion for their cashflow. If they do not get the loan by next week and because Genesis is owned by DCG who also owns Grayscale, they will need to sell the bitcoins or the altcoins they have in their treasury. They have 600k bitcoins and 3.1 million ETH.If DCG sells to save Genesis, it might dump the price lower than $16k.Also, some of DCG's biggest debtors are Alameda Research and 3 Arrows Capital.

Will continue to see issues during spikes. Not because of anything evil, but due to the nature of their services. Something like this happens.The 'cloud based' back end should be able to ramp up to accommodate all the extra traffic.BUT....Every other crypto service that is also hosted in the 'cloud' that uses the same provider is also getting hit.So, now everything is getting slow. Said provider is bringing things up and online as quick as can be done.While other people are seeing the other serveries slow down and go offline they go and check on their accounts which adds more strain.Service falls over....And just to be clear, there is no such thing as the cloud, it's just hosting on someone else's servers.-Dave",

Some of these platforms had billion of dollars on their wallets. 0,5% of a billion is enough money to cover operational costs of an online platform. Expenses shouldn't be that high, because they don't have physical agencies like traditional banks. Number of employees should also be reduced.The proposal was to put the interests of the customers and investors above the interests of the businesses' owners. People expected individuals running those companies wouldn't set huge wages for themselves, but they were wrong. They were even greedier than banksters and completely messed up the ecosystem, especially due to schemes involving native tokens and other volatile altcoins pumped with bitcoin from depositors.And if at some point the company had to slow down, they could be transparent with investors and tell them interest rates were going to be reduced for a while, so they could continue operating smoothly. And native tokens should never be pumped with customers' funds. That was a big mistake, as it was to borrow money from other companies for the same purposes, which subsequently borrowed more money from other companies until all of them are falling apart.",
