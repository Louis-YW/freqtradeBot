I think OP is looking for Binance.com Facebook account. About https://www.facebook.com/BinanceUS, I am surprised that it did not work, when I checked 'Binance.us', it worked. I think it is worth reporting this to Binance customer support.",

Binance.us got verified. If binance.us got verified, why won't their official Facebook account not got verified too?",

Binance only shows the correct site to US customers because they've to be separate. And in fact, the person who controls the social account is under the command of a different superior in publishing the post or changing the account name.",
