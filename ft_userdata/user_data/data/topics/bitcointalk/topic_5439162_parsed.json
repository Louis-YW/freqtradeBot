  "content": "Hey Guys,I have a confession to make- I bought my first bitcoin at around $300 (year 2016), when an acquaintance told me to buy bitcoin from him at around $220, but instead i did not bought from him as i thought it may be something unheard or ponzi, After few days of research i actually bought at a quiet higher price (from an exchange) thinking that exchange transactions are secure and without letting him know, Later when i told met and told him he said he would have done the transaction before and i should have paid him later, but never thought of, now i realize i would have got almost 0.30 more which is today around $7500 ...Do you have any confessions to make regarding your crypto journey, Anything that you felt to share that could inspire others or warn others..Anything right or wrong you did in your Bitcoin/Crypto Journey Any confession related to telling friends about Bitcoin and its aftermaths Fell Free to share your Bitcoin Experience...",

Or were you scammed by the exchange or something like that?I don't have any big confessions, but I can share that I used to buy altcoins with Bitcoin during the 2017 altcoin era, which I think was a mistake. I didn't lose a lot like this, but I've made some questionable decisions no doubt.But what's important is to learn from mistakes, not regret something from the past.",

But later down the road, we realized our mistakes and should have been making huge profits already.In any case, it's not too late though, the OP can still invest right now and then wait for the next bull run, probably in 2024-2025 to make a lot of profit.",

Then I was not aware of Bitcoin this much. I knew that Bitcoin is the mother token and all, but didn't know how much it could grow. When I learned about it, I invested all in a bull market. Around $32k. Then suddenly it falls. I also told one of my friend who invested $700+ when I told him to. I was a newbie back then. So with less experience, when the market fall, I sold all of them in panic. Less than half price. So my friend did the same. But now I know. The one who falls, only they can grow much higher. I still regret it to this day. One thing to learn from this, never get emotional.",

I've already invested in hyip schemes and lost money to scammers, thinking those could be reliable modern investment platforms, which were only possible to exist thanks to bitcoin. Anyway, the bright side of the mistakes is that you can learn something with them. Like in your case, next time I'm sure you aren't going to purchase your coins from exchanges anymore, since you have an acquaintance who can sell you BTC for a cheaper price, and you only have to pay him after the transaction, ensuring safety on the transaction on your side.",

I have always refused to invest in bitcoin because most people have lost thier funds investing in worthless coins that promises high profit returns. It was a friend that opened my understanding about bitcoin. This my friend was able to distinguish between bitcoin and other coins. And I immediately saw the need to be part this sector. Therefore my confession is that I once saw Bitcoin as one of those ponzi schemes promoted mostly by these get rich quick fake crypto experts that claim to know all about the industry, meanwhile they are just fraudsters seeking for people's funds to steal.",

This is mostly the issues of some members here. They write a good topic but the message is quite different from the topic which does not make any sense in any ways.
