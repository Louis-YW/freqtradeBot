  "content": "In the game of sports, winners are always categorized based on the team with the highest performance. For example, in English football (EPL), Arsenal Football Club and Manchester City are seen to have good tactical skills, making them stand out as winners in each of their games. Therefore, a gambler establishes trust in those teams because they have won almost 88% of their games. The gambler stakes high on each of these teams because they believe that the money invested in each team will bring out good returns.The same thing goes for when a gambler wants to stake on players. They must know the performance of that particular player before any trust can be established. For example, Harland of Manchester City is known for goal-scoring, and Saka of Arsenal is known for good finishing. This is how trust in gambling is established, although this trust sometimes fails.My question now is, As a gambler would you give 100% to a stake that you trust?",

If you mean to stake such match with high amount of money, sorry that I can not. If you mean that I should give 100% trust so that I can encourage others to stake on the match, no because I know the strong clubs can fuckup sometimes. If you check the clubs draw and lost matches, like Arsenal, no one expected that Everton would first win, though we know that the second match can not be the same, but the Everton which is among the clubs on the relegation zone first won Arsenal recently, such little mistake can take huge amount of money from gamblers. Although Manchester City has already won now and I have hope in Arsenal too today.",

This may be different to other bettors or gamblers but I gamble when I think a particular team/player is doing good for that day or they prepared enough to have a match. There are other factors to consider like the condition of the team/player, it's not because you're established onto something you'd really bet 100% on it, it's still gambling at the end of the day, you're always looking for the advantage/s over it even if we say you have a favorite team or player.",

      "body": "You can never trust 1 team or  1 player because they go through different stages of their career. Boxing might be different because they intentionally set up boxers with hype to fight cans but the odds are never worth betting on. In football games the best teams can lose and the best players can perform badly. I think we like to pretend that there is a secret to betting and once you crack it you can make a career out of it but I do not think that is a good idea. I recommend studying form and tactics instead of focusing on 1 team or player you think you can trust.",

Don't forget when you bet them, the odds is smaller than other team, so it's mean you will not make a lot money when they win because it has been expected they must win the match. I think it's better to bet the underdog team where you know if they're actually have a good performance, just like Real Madrid on the previous Champions League. If I'm not mistaken they're mostly become underdog team.",

And if you're focusing on a single player that will even be of a greater risk because you never know what might happen during the match, you need to work on probability rather than certainty.",

Staking  a game based on 100% trust is like hoping a blind man would drive a car successfully because he is human and expecting his other senses to compensate for his loss of vision. In fact there can never be 100% trust when staking as it is the surest way to lose a lot of money.",

Diversification is one of the key concepts in my trading strategies, I try to also do the same when in gambling and betting. In my opinion its better to focus on minimising my risk of going bankrupt than maximising my returns. Also isn't all the statistical data of the top teams already included in the odds? That's why the profits from betting on the top teams is so much smaller. We either need to combine multiple bets for a decent multipler or bet on the underdog.",

To put it simply; anything could happen in a match. What OP is trying to emphasize is bias with one's team or single player. Ofcourse stats would be a betting factor but to be hundred percent sure and to bet all in one bucket will never be advisable. It is gambling we are talking about and risk will always be present. Therefore, playing it safely would be better than to pour that much and eventually losing all of your assets on a single bet. Ofcourse we all have our own biases perhaps in sportsbetting. But the best example I guess is that, no team who became champion ever made it to the top without losing. On boxing there's Mayweather without a loss, but would you limit yourself into it? such as betting only on his fights. Ofcourse it would be better to balance and manage the risk.",

I can't disagree with you on that since it did happen a lot of times before when I was betting on a certain sports. Those experts saying this and that didn't matter because they somehow overlooked someone or they are just being paid to do this and that just to make odds get on their favor but somehow it didn't work on their favor and sometimes there's always a dirty rigged happening in the game where referees are being paid to do some BS call or the judges.If they want to bet on someone they should make sure that the team they are betting hasn't done any suspicious move in the past just like how they intentionally want to lose on purpose.
