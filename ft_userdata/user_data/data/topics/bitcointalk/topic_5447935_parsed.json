ThanksWhat is your hashrate?You will get a small discount on the fees when you join the pool, but can you calculate the probability of mining a block in solo mining?One ASIC container is from 100 to 300 mining devices, and large miners have 10,000 or more ASICs.",

ThanksIf you have a really high hash rate you can get a lot of sats actually. But this will only happen if you are using a pool that should also have a low hash rate. But you should also know that a pool with a low hash rate can experience downtime as well.       But there are also other pools were know that when you have a large hashrate, they give a bonus for this by giving a large amount of hash power to their pool. However, if you choose a pool, first check if the fee is cheap compared to other pools, even its security and its payout schedule if its on time not delay.",

Thanks It sure is back then but it's just getting progressively harder as time passes by. And as far as I know bonuses only come by for VIP members, which are those who really contributing a lot of mining power to their network, so people who are contributing just more than the average joe is not gonna get anything. So I wouldn't really suggest mining for bonuses because it's mostly a gimmick, and not really something that every miner should strive for. Plus they only ever send out bonuses through altcoins, which given you can still swap for bitcoin but it feels a little \"ehh\" at that point considering you guys mine bitcoin for a living and your bonuses are paid off through some weird altcoin that you don't even recognize most of the time. I think F2Pool's still the best mining pools right now, not only for ASIC miners, I've mined with them for a while but stopped cause electric fees are horrendous that I have to stop mining altogether, and they pay handsomely too. So you might wanna take a gander at them.",

ThanksYes, there are some mining pools that offer bonuses and other advantages for the miners with hash power that's above 20 PH/s, and they will love to have miners with such hash rates. The mining pools provide many bonuses to the miners with good hash rates because those miners are doing good contribution to the mining pools.Quote from: kano on May 26, 2023, 12:55:52 AMFew pools can beat my pool fee of 0.5% and my pool reliability High hash rate also is a 'vague' thing to say.Since if someone with 100's of PH was to join my pool they'd get lower fees than 0.5% and also have low variance.I even offer coinbase 'advertising' for that sort of hash rate The pool owner is here and he is offering good advantages to the ones with high hash rates. Kano you are doing the best thing buddy, and I really appreciate your pool's fee and I must say that the fee is unbeatable. Even though the current fee of the pool is already low compare to other pools, but still you're ready to offer some extra perks to the miners with very high hash rates of 100's of PH/s, and that's the best offer for all the miners.@OP you can see that even in this forum the pool owners like Kano are offering great service and privileges' to the miners with high hash rates. The pool owners truly love those miners who contribute high hash rates to the pools. And, even this days the offers and rewards are available for such miners.",
