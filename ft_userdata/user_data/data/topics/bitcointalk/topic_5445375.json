What did they say about this matter? Did you contact them when your withdrawal was rejected for the first time? What was their response at that time? Why do you think it was fairspin who stole your funds? Your account could be compromised. I don't think casinos will log in to your account and steal user's funds. However, This is not the first scam accusation against this casino. There was two other scam accusation against this casino and handled them (Solved). Considering their dedication to solve issues, I don't think they would touch users funds. If I am not wrong, Your account was compromised. I would like to suggest you to use 2FA.",

Not that it matters, since you're probably not located in any of these countries (I guess you're Vietnamese).QuoteGuess what? Fairspin who was keep denied my withdrawal requests, immediately accepted their withdrawal. Even though I found out and cancelled their second request ( -489 USDT ), they already stole 361 USDT from my account, and only 495 USDT left.What was the reason for denying your withdrawal?What were the security measures on your account? Did they have a phone or email confirmation requirement for withdrawals? From the looks of it, they reject withdrawals over a certain amount automatically, because the only one that went through was the smallest of them all (361 USDT) eberything else was over 489 and was denied. Did you do KYC with them? If not, this could be the reason for larger amounts to be automatically denied. From what I saw I doubt the casino stole from you. It looks like your account was bruteforced. How strong was your password?",

They managed to steal part of your money. In that case, it is your fault because you did not secure your account sufficiently, such as adding a Two-factor authentication procedure and others; of course, Faispin rejected repeated withdrawals because they detected suspicious activity in your account from different IP addresses. Do you now blame them for your mistake in not securing your account? You can immediately change the password and email, put the two-factor authentication into the account, and contact customer service as soon as possible so that they review your account again and make sure that the scammers leave your account.",

He do multiple withdrawal prior to the withdrawal of the potential scammer that keeps rejecting by the casino for an unknown reason. I get the point of the OP on how does someone accessing his account on different IP than usual manage to withdraw funds while he as original owner rejects withdrawal couple of times. This is a very shady experience in a casino and I will accused too the casino for what happened because the timing of the hack is in sync to the time that he can’t withdraw. Normally security team will lock his account after multiple failed withdrawal attempt while another attempt from different IP appear on his account. Fairspin should explain this properly. It’s very scary to play on this kind of casino.",

It’s very scary to play on this kind of casino.This should be clarified by customer service or a Fairspin official on the forum. You mentioned a perfect point. How did the scammer manage to withdraw part of the money when the account's original owner could not withdraw multiple in a row? Could the scammer have contacted their customer support and managed to deceive them that he is the account's original owner and not the scammer? I do not know explicitly what happened, and the case is somewhat ambiguous; for me, I have not played on Fairspin before, and I have not heard of it; this casino not has many good reviews on Trustpilot, but I try as much as possible to be fair and search for details.",

What really happened? Can you tell us your side of the story? Op is saying that you are still owing him 1008$. Did you gave any dealing with the op? And what conspired between you and him? Op has given us some images to claim his accusation. Therefore we will need you side of the accusation. And also op need to provide more evidences like the email sent to should be quote here. And your conversations with the customer care service personnels. But really if Fairspin logged in to the account and did what the OP is saying, that is very bad of them.

It could be something close to op using a VPN to route the IP to Canada.
