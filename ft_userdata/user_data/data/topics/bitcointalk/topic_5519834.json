Yes. Then why didn't they invested earlier?I do not know if what you said is true but gold actually fall when Trump won while bitcoin increased but Trump as the winner does not mean it caused it. Gold is still high in price if compared to previous months, its price really increased this year and got to ATH also several times.Quote from: Perfectbaby on November 18, 2024, 10:49:51 PMBitcoin could soon become a legal tender?Bitcoin is a legal tender in El Salvador. You mean in US? I do not think so. They will prefer only their dollar to be the legal tender.Quote from: Perfectbaby on November 18, 2024, 10:49:51 PMGold won't be as profitable as Bitcoin immediately he is sworn in as president?Gold was never profitable than bitcoin ever since bitcoin was created.",

Then why didn't they invested earlier?Bitcoin could soon become a legal tender?Gold won't be as profitable as Bitcoin immediately he is sworn in as president?Let's discuss to share opinions.You maybe just got delighted by news about the bull run happen with bitcoin and you didn't get much information about latest happening on gold.We can really see some amazing movements happen with BTC but it doesn't mean it has been left out by bitcoin. Gold still relevant into discussion since this remain the top asset choice by majority of investor.You can monitor the movement of gold here https://goldprice.org/ and see that this asset still doing good.Quote from: Perfectbaby on November 18, 2024, 10:49:51 PMBitcoin would give quick returns than Golden? Yes. Then why didn't they invested earlier?Don't look for quick return on Bitcoin since it will burn you. Every investment decision need proper study that's why some people not taking any rush decision.Quote from: Perfectbaby on November 18, 2024, 10:49:51 PMBitcoin could soon become a legal tender?There's always possibilities that bitcoin would became a legal tender in any country if there's more good innovation happen to it, also the government will truly adapt on new financial system.Quote from: Perfectbaby on November 18, 2024, 10:49:51 PMGold won't be as profitable as Bitcoin immediately he is sworn in as president?Gold will still a relevant asset and continue to provide profit for investors. I don't compare it to bitcoin since they are different and I have both of this asset.",

I am guessing that many people didn’t believe in bitcoin back then but suddenly they want in on it now that it’s being valued greatly and consequently they need to have funds to buy bitcoin so they sell their other assets.QuoteBitcoin could soon become a legal tender?It already is in El Salvador. But in the US? Hard to assume for sure because as far as I know, that’s not part of Trump’s plan from his campaign speeches. All he wants is to make bitcoin their national reserve.",

It's just during the recent campaign that the once anti-Bitcoin Trump started making Bitcoin-friendly pronouncements. And he just won. Earlier, there wasn't a Trump saying \"Never sell your Bitcoin\", \"On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler\", \"We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the USA\", and so on. And, earlier, Trump was just a candidate. Bitcoin could soon become a legal tender?In the US, no. And I don't think Bitcoin investors are buying Bitcoin because it will soon become a legal tender in the US under the Trump administration. That's far from happening. Trump didn't even mention that. That's not part of the plan. It's enough for investors to have heard what Trump has said as regards Bitcoin, and that he turned out victorious, for them to invest heavily in Bitcoin. The future is bright. That Bitcoin will thrive and its adoption grows exponentially are becoming more certain now when the president of the most powerful country in the world is pro-Bitcoin. Gold won't be as profitable as Bitcoin immediately he is sworn in as president?Gold has never been more profitable than Bitcoin. But the point is that investors are never more assured of Bitcoin than now when the president of the USA is Bitcoin's ally.",

While gold tends to be a stable, long-term store of value, Bitcoin has shown the ability to skyrocket in value in relatively short periods. Many investors see this potential for higher returns, especially with Bitcoin’s increased institutional adoption.Timing the market is notoriously difficult. Many people only jump in when they see momentum building, and now that Bitcoin is more mainstream, it feels like a safer bet to some. But there's always the risk that it could be too late for some to benefit from the kind of growth others saw earlier.",

Bitcoin is the alternative, but do not go for just other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) except you know what you are doing which is short term investment. You can see how they are getting dumped and not getting to ATH. I mean other cryptocurrencies. The best coin you can go for is bitcoin. Also I do not see bitcoin as alternative to gold.

So Bitcoin is a super volatile asset. Gold is very different. The volatility of gold is much less compared to many other assets. So people who likes to avoid risks, usually invests in Gold. I don't think it's correct to compare these two assets at all! These assets cater to different types of investors.",
