Is that what you are trying to say. If yes, then I think there is nothing better then this, spending extra money on marriage ceremony has became a tradition and this has to be break because if more spending would become a tradition then it will become a burden for the upcoming generation. We should promote normal and easy marriage.If you were planning to delay your marriage ceremony for the upcoming bull run then that's also your decision then, because delaying is your personal problem, but if you want my opinion then I would say you are right, because currently market is bullish and in the upcoming 1 year it can make you 2x (that's not for sure but just a prediction so DYOR). Money is necessary but besides all this you have to get some real job or source of income because bull run is not going to be there forever it have a cycle that repeats which means if you are making money then a time will come when you will be losing too, so don't be so bullish on BTC and diversify your source of incomes.",

But nonetheless stick to your convictions I hope it pays off huge.Aside the ROI that bitcoin offers there are features like privacy that you are not paying much attention to, it was needless to post your bitcoin holdings you should edit the image. Also from the image this is a binance exchange which you store your bitcoin and as the saying goes not your keys not your coins. It will be best you move your bitcoin to a custodial wallet even if it is a hot wallet but for long term storage go for cold storage",

Take note that storing BTC's for profit should not be your only source of income, if you had another source, you probably would have gone on with your celebration, while still storing your BTC.It is worth mentioning that you should not store your BTC on an exchange, so move it into your own self custody, use a BTC wallet like Electrum or Sparrow wallet, and if you think your money is large enough, set up an airgapped wallet or buy a hardware wallet.",

However, it is too early for you to celebrate now when you're supposed to continue to accumulate more BTC cause it's never over until it is over.According to my research about Binance, I don't know how much in cryptocurrency you have to hold on your account to become a crypto P2P merchant trader on Binance but I believe must average country is $1000 in crypto. If you could reach the threshold, you will have your BTC while you also make money by offering P2P merchant services.",

      "body": "Op you take a risk of keeping your coins in Binance for all this while. It is not advisable for you to keep a such amount of money in the centralized exchange platform. And you canceled a marriage to hodle bitcoin. Op Frankly speaking your story is not clear for me because marriage issue that I know very well, when you have informed people that you're doing marriage in a particular time and date and you canceled it for bitcoin. Well that was your decision which you took and even the display images, shows that you were not hodling but to sell or someone transaction image which you have used for merit hunting. But there is no scientific proven yet. Because the time frame is very short for you to accumulate such big amount. The time of creating the marriage cancellation thread and the time of this thread is too short for and investor to make big profit because as of that time bitcoin was above $50+k and bitcoin is $54k. Now another question we have to asked is how much did you used for the investment? If you are still hodling the coins for the All Time High then I advise you to move your coins to non custodial wallet which is more saver. Like as you keep this coins there and the government was trying to stop Binance operating in the country and you would have lost everything in that process. So to be in the saver side of the coin, you need to move them out to non custodial wallet. Congratulations for the amount.",

DCA it with this bull run and with part of your income as you will have many months for DCA and take profit before Bitcoin makes its peak in this 2024 - 2025 bull run.Use this DCA estimation website https://costavg.com/",

I think Binance P2P got a high spread from their own currency which maybe there is only a few people who do P2P trading there.

How much money do you need just for the wedding celebration and are all the funds you have put into bitcoin? If this is true, then I think the steps you are taking are not appropriate because after all we need emergency funds for our daily needs as a family.But however, we will always give applause to friends like you who have succeeded in making profits in Bitcoin because your steps were successful. My advice is don't ignore small celebrations with family, even if they are kept as simple as possible because we live in this world where we don't just talk about investment but other things are also really needed.",

So the marria annual anniversary ceremony would always come times after time but we must chase the income first.Let me tell you, everyone must not be so rich as thought and  if you are not one of the rich guys then you must be financially economical strategical to maintain an affordable role for providing for your essential needs. This is just as accumulating your bitcoin in the DCA method so also you plan yourself life the DCA method.",
