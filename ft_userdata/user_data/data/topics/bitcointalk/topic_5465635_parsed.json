  "content": "Stake.com largest crypto casino has been reportedly hacked for $41.3m. Stake.com was very secure and trusted gambling site. They always tried to secure their users but hackers break the security. Hackers get $41.3m. Now we have to wait to know good news. I think expected team of stake.com are hardly trying to get back their fund and back for site. I think it will be solved within short time.
