Politics are mostly distasteful - arguments, propaganda, politicians creating problems for their own gain and trying to radicalise people to their side. There is probably nothing clean anywhere in the political arena.However, as disgusting as they are, the option of not getting involved does not really work.

Nowadays we see more protest so the evolution is reaching next stage so the politicians are unable to control all the people raising voice against them?...",

The only accountability that ever happens is for the other \"team,\" the political adversaries. When things don't work out, it's never the person or party you voted for, it's someone else because it's difficult to admit to buyer's remorse.I'd rather have someone sit out from politics if they haven't done the absolute minimum of educating themselves about the issues opposed to getting involved and voting for whoever runs the most campaign commercials.",

I'd also add that a lot of people see democracy purely as a right, when really it's also a responsibility.If you are voting simply because you can, and have no real knowledge of what you are voting for, because you haven't really looked into it beyond reading a few breathless headlines and hearing a few catchphrases, then really you shouldn't vote.It's your responsibility as a voter to make sure you are fully informed and that you have reached your own decisions based on the evidence.",

If you don't vote and you're never going to vote, then a politician will see you as irrelevant. You can complain all you like, but if it has zero effect on elections, you don't matter.Not voting is also an easy way out of making an unpalatable choice. If you don't like any of the candidates, then you must certainly dislike some more than others. There's a case to be made for holding your nose and voting for the least bad option. At least that way you can have an influence.",

Everybody can not play politics at the same time. We need doctors, engineers, electricians, plumbers, scientist and pharmacist e.t.c Politicians will always be politicians (lies), but not holding them accountable when they leave the office will be the biggest mistake we can ever make as citizens of any nation.
