      "body": "It's all going to depend on location. You are going to get wildly different answers depending on where in the world you are.Followed by it's also going to vary based many other issues too. Running new equipment in a nice clean facility with good power and cool air is going to cost more for the facility BUT your labor costs are probably going to be less since things should be running better and need less hands on. If you have 2nd or 3rd hand equipment running in a converted warehouse that can't keep up with the cooling along with power issues you may need someone there daily.I have about a dozen miners running in a DC that we still have spare space and power in. I get an alert when one of them goes offline or it's hashrate drops but more or less since all the equipment has been well taken care of other then an occasional remote reboot there is nothing to do.-Dave",

      "body": "We will use new miners in immerson cooling systems or hydro miners in Antspaces. For these options, I need to know what the costs are other than electricity, employees, security guards, office/workshop equipment, rental costs, etc. Both systems also send alarms if problems occur. Can you think of any other incidental costs that I haven't listed yet?",

      "body": "Insurance. Unless you are funding it all out of pocket interest on borrowed money. Might be a small point but if there is a dip again in price you will want funds available to cover operations till the price rebounds. If you are living 'paycheck to paycheck' (block to block so to speak) and the price dips do you really want to sell on the dip because you have to pay bills.Also remember unless you have an agreement in place you are loosing a certain percentage when converting to fiat.Going to need a tax person and possibly a lawyer.I'm sure there is more as you get bigger.-Dave",

      "body": "Gear dies off. So if you have 2 antspaces at $110,000 each and 170 miners in each one 340 miners total. you are close to 3,792 x 340 = 1,300,000 in minersand 2 x 110,000 = 220,000 in containers.this is 1,520,000 invested.plus the spacethe transformers the setups.the temp monitorsthe securitythe labor.and if you did all of the above I would say you are dumbhere is why the container dies you loss ½ the miner til it is up.So my estimate is max of 188 units of s19 hydro will go in 1 container so buy 360 s19's and 3 containersspread the 360 120 in each containerif a container dies spilt the 360 into 180 and 180 until that container is fixed.obviously a big mine has the advantage of say 5 or 10 or 20 containers all loaded less than the 188 units they can do of s19 hydro'sSo 10 could have 150 each (1500 miners) and if 1 container  dies  9 have 1500/9 = 167 miners each.So if you do containers  account for the need to have the ability to spread load.so 2 containers order 3and 3 containers order 4 so on and so forth.that means 110,000 extra on containers if you have 10 or less containers.",

      "body": "Insurance and backup containers are a good idea. There are investors who add a buffer to their investment so that they do not have to sell when prices are unprofitable.What are the sources of error in the Antspaces or what could cause them harm?Should each container have its own transformer or one big one for the whole farm?Are temp monitors still needed with the container solution, there will be a temp monitoring included?",
