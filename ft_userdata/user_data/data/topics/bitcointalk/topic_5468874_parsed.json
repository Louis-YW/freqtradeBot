Now, I see why you made a post from an old thread because you see S19 XP firmware under the S3 download page that you think is the latest firmware for this unit but it's not. Maybe Bitmain incorrectly put S19 XP firmware on the S3 download page.",

In my s3 the cgminer is the version 4.6.1-1, but in the net I find cgminer 4.11.Cgminer 4.11 was released in 2018 but Bitmain's last update firmware for S3 is 2014.They are no longer releasing new firmware for this unit unless someone here on the forum has custom firmware.I tried to search a bit and it seems Kano has a custom firmware for this check the old post below.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1317655.msg13470266#msg13470266You can try to contact Kano he might be able to give you a custom firmware or a guide to update Cgminer.His profile link https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=36044",
