I have never tried such service personally but he got a good reputation[1] and good recent reviews on trustpilot[2]. He may help you if he is active. Since your pass length is too big, it may take a while but you should give it a try.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=240779.0 [2] https://www.trustpilot.com/review/walletrecoveryservices.com",

In that case, there is no point even trying to brute force it, since 29 unknown characters is far beyond the scope of what is realistic.I would also use btcrecover as suggested above to do this, but you need more information to go on. What did the password look like? Was it completely random or did include names, words, dates, etc? What character set did it use? Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, etc?",

I know what the password consists of, but it is very long, 30+ characters. Is it possible to recover such a long password?If you know (big) parts of it, it can maybe be brute-forced.But how it comes you've just forgot the whole password? Maybe you can find it/recover more of it before trying more with the wallet?Maybe you know the password, but it's just not working anymore? That can easily happen when you change keyboard layout (somebody I know had recently a similar surprise too).",

      "body": "I'm a bit confused by your \"only know 1 character\" statement. How did you know it consists of 30+ characters if you can only remember 1 of them? Are you sure you don't keep any backup of it anywhere? Did you use a password manager to fill in the password in the past? If your wallet doesn't contain that much money, maybe you can let it go since brute-forcing the rest of your password will take a very long time as others have mentioned, at which point you probably made more money by doing something else for the next few years. Try to keep a backup of your password next time maybe, use a password manager like KeePass so you just need to remember one strong password and let KeePass handle the rest. CMIIW.",

And another thing is that if you bought this wallet file you are most likely scammed because most of the wallet file out there are free that you can find somewhere here in the forum or other blog posts.",
