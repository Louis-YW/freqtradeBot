I can only think of a few, like Bitget and Mexc, that still permit limitless trading without requiring KYC.No offence, do you work with or for Bitget? Almost all of your posts have something to do with \"how good Bitget is\".I didn't know much about the exchange then, but it was very suspicious because a good exchange would not have any need to hire shillers to promote them in this forum, if they needed promotion, they would rather start a signature campaign. I wonder the number of people who still trade in this scam exchange and keep their money in it, it is just a disaster that is waiting to happen.",

You may need to visit his past records to understand him. This could help you https://www.quora.com/Who-is-Evan-Luthraand probably ask yourself if there was a moral justification for him dumping REELT on innocent traders upon listing on bitget",

Buddy what the hell they had to do with the user's funds it's an open market, but if a person having a large number of tokens wants to sell them off, it's his property he can do whatever he wants to Quoteeven though I know the shitty policies of the centralized changes to grab the custody of the funds..., this is just a lame excuse because the community so-called if they really know the risks they must analyze the tokenomics of the project well before investing and it's a volatile market price keeps fluctuating, even if it dumps to 99% who the hell are the exchanges to intervening in the market. I know for some level it's true if a person wants to dump all in and some report it and stop it can stop the loss of the entire community but the community should know itself before investing the risk of the manipulation in the market and volatility. What if they compensated but lost the trust of users as they can freeze their accounts they violated the standards of the users intentionally? Who wants to trust an exchange that can freeze your account on such a lame excuse?",
