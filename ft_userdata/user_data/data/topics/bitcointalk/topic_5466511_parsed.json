Because in this era, most of the bounty campaigns that I see now are so far okay, and I don't see any problem as long as the bounty managers who administer the campaign are known and have a good reputation in this forum.Then what will be the catch of that bounty technology you are talking about? I don't seem to see anything new in that matter, to be honest.",
