  "content": "Mr. Adam grew up believing that to be rich, he must save and be a miser. So he started saving. Even when he needed money for an immediate and urgent need, he would rather beg from friends and relations. And since he was homeless, his money was always in a pouch tied to his waist. Unfortunate, he fell sick one day and was taken to a nearby clinic. Those who took him there were burdened on how to raise funds for his treatment, and finally did. They paid $718, and left. The sick man woke up from his sleep, asked for friends and was told they were gone. Luckily, they bought some foods and grocery for him. He cried joyfully and prayed for them. Then, he saw a piece of cloth on the floor that immediately struck his attention. It looked like something he has seen before. 'That looks like my pouch, yes, my pouch' he said. He searched for his saving pouch that does not leave his waist but could not find it. He yelled at the nurses, and questioned how his pouch came off him. An elderly man who was on a bed next to him told him how one of his friends that brought him in noticed a protrusion from this trousers, reached out for it and saw money inside. Through the money, they paid for medical bills and groceries. Mr. Adam screamed \" All my savings gone? Who asked them to bring me here?\" Does this story strike any memories in you? It does right? You fooled your colleagues back in junior high school to buy ice cream with their transport fare promising to \"lap\" them when going back home, but failed. You rode, they trekked. You went with a group of friends to a restaurant to eat, and when it was payment time, you sneaked out to the bathroom came back but they were all gone telling the waiter that you were going to pay once you come back from the bathroom. It was payback, they said and laughed off. What's your story?",

On a lighter note, there are always those money fans out there who act like they're in love with money, but deep down, they just want it to take them on expensive dates! üòÑ",

      "body": "He learned the hard way that being too stingy can backfire. When I was in college, I had a friend who always borrowed money from me and never paid me back. He always had some excuse or promise, but he never kept his word.One day, he asked me to lend him $50 for an emergency. I agreed, but I secretly wrote ‚ÄúI owe you $50‚Äù on a piece of paper and put it in his wallet when he wasn‚Äôt looking.The next day, he came to me and said he had found the money he needed and wanted to return my $50. He handed me his wallet and told me to take the money.I opened it and saw the note I had written. I showed it to him and said ‚ÄúLook, you already owe me $50. You can‚Äôt pay me with my own money.‚ÄùHe was speechless and embarrassed. He realized I had tricked him and exposed his dishonesty. He apologized and promised to pay me back as soon as possible. He never borrowed money from me again.",

Frankly, it is difficult to understand the point he is trying to make, but I think above two Legendary members replying based on this story.No one can tell you the perfect savings formula. The health and economic situation differs from one country to another and even among members of the same family. they are psychological and economic factors that are intertwined with the economic situation.",

No decent people do such things, especially over their whole life as your story suggests. You're not a very nice person if you do such things and I think the moral of the story was actually something different. It was that this man put wealth before his health, he would rather have died a rich man than have the money he had been saving spent on helping him get better. Some people are like that and there is no point being a rich old man, as you get the best years of your life when you are young. It's harder to explore and enjoy lots of activities when you get older, so make the most of life now.",
