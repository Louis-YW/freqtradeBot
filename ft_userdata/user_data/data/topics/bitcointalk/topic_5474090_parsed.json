      "body": "If you didn't do KYC before playing in a casino that requires it and you later win before doing it because you require it before withdrawal then don't expect that the casino to speedily verify it and especially if they have something to recheck and whatnot. I just believe that should be the situation. I have not played there though but maybe you should give more time for them to get back to you. It is always better to be cleared and verified on KYC before playing.",

I have not played in a fortune jar before, but I have had experience with respect to KYC at different casinos, and in most cases, the KYC requirement differs based on the reason why the casino asked for the KYC, so you just have to give them a little time, and I believe they will get back to you if they ever need you to give them any further documents for verification. Maybe they are just trying to do some careful checking on your document or try to check through your account if there was something fishy, which some casinos do, especially when a member wins big and they want to be sure they are paying and eligible to win and nothing more. So you're not scammed; just be a little patient. They even have a good reputation here in the forum, and their ANN is also active here, so if anything comes up, you will always have the right to complain about any kind of ruling you are not okay with, and other members will help you look into the matter based on their experience.",

And since you are done with their request to undergo a KYC procedure then let the checking happen since once they verify your identity for sure everything will be fine including your withdrawal request with the amount you won in their casino.Also don't conclude that you have been scam since its early to tell just wait for what decision they do since everything will be decided on what is the result of their investigation and make sure you didn't do any abuse since for sure you can get your winnings if you play with clean hands.",

Negative reviews are the ones most likely to be shared by others after all since, well,  a casino being proven positive simply means they're doing their job properly, not exactly share-worthy.Anyhow, as for the KYC, I reckon it's just a standard KYC check. It's actually pretty normal nowadays that they ask KYC when withdrawing (or more KYC really) compared to when registering. Try reading ToS and just look for clauses related to KYC really. As for support being awful, well, that's just customer support being customer support. Nothing new there really.",

It is good you are here and I know you would find this place to be of great help to you as time goes on. OP you can not conclude at this instance if you have been scammed or not as long as they have told you they are  doing a security check on your account and KYC then you should give them a little time to conclude and get back to you and whatever is their reply to you would determine if they have the intentions to scam you or not but as of now I would suggest you be patient with them.Lastly, I would also advise you follow procedures by reading the terms of service of casinos next time if you decide to engage with another so as not to get this similar experience of needing to do a kyc before withdrawal. Doing a KYC and scaling successfully before you do anything transfer of funds to such casino so as to avoid having issues with identity or regional restriction because that is what might likely come up. So to be in the safe side, one must do the KYC to be on the clear stand before making any deposit to avoid loss of funds.",

Security checking maybe at their standard especially if they see that a user is executing his first withdrawal so maybe he should wait the decision as per other user said in this thread.I know it sucks for undergoing this process and since this is already part of their process then maybe other users should be aware that this one exist and need to think more if they want to undergo on same process.

Don't just jump into conclusion or think that you have been scammed without waiting for the result of your KYC.  I have been a FortuneJack player for years now and I do not encounter any problem in withdrawing funds after I passed the KYC (this is my own experience and might not reflect others).Although they have higher minimum requirement for withdrawal, I think they are reputable enough to trust as long as your account do not encounters any problem that conflicts their TOS.QuoteBut for 600 bucks lol, I hope it's not the case.Anyway, I do not think they will tarnish their reputation for a small amount of $600.  Your withdrawal request will processed soon after you passed the KYC.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on November 14, 2023, 10:17:56 PMI would verify beforehand and also be ready for this kind of harassment.

Fortune Jack is considered to be a legitimate and safe platform to use but s I remember I had a bad experience with one of their customer support way back then few years ago, well its not bad at all, just disappointed and it’s a different story, not related to KYC. Almost all crypto casinos now require users to complete the verification process so they can withdraw their winnings. The KYC requirements may vary depending on the user’s location and the amount of money they have won. Once the KYC process has already been completed, then the security check is likely a routine procedure to ensure that your account is secure.",
