  "content": "I'm setting up a node for the first time using Umbrel and a Raspberry Pi. My synchronization is stuck at around 11% for a day now. It is unable to sync new blocks and keeps getting disconnected from all the peers every other minute. It happened after my home electricity blacked out earlier todayI have tried restarting even turning off the Pi several times but it doesn't seem to do much help. My specs:- Umbrel 0.5.3 connecting to Bitcoin Core 24.0.1- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, 64GB microSD, 1 TB SATA SSD",

      "body": "Actually Umbrel 0.5.4 is the current version, so why do you start from an already outdated version? Your power blackout could've corrupted some files in your Umbrel and to figure out the reason why there's no progress you would need to look into certain log files. It's not easy to give a step-by-step recipe to follow, login via SSH to your Umbrel and have a first look at debug.log located at /home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/bitcoin/data/bitcoin/, if Bitcoin Core is upset in any way.If I were you, I'd prepare a microSD card starting with Umbrel 0.5.4 and start fresh (I assume you didn't have any funds already on your Umbrel node).Next issues can pop up because you use an USB3-NVMe-adapter. If it doesn't have an own power supply you may likely exhaust the Raspi 4B's power budget of its USB ports at some point of time. This may lead to spurious storage corruption or restarts/resets of the Raspi at worst. The Raspi 4B has a total power budget of approx. 6W for all USB ports in sum (i.e. ~1.2A at 5V) and NVMe flash storage is usually at peak more power hungry than that.",

But it doesn't hurt to use quality microSD cards in a Raspi. I use mostly Samsung Endurance variants which can withstand quite some write load and so far I hadn't a single one failing in my Raspis.",
