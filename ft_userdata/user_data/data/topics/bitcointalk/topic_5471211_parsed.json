  "content": "i was having a discussion with someone who was talking about the pro's and cons of his minimum wage jobhe told me he works for 40hours a week at ~£$10 an hour for 52 weeks. =£$20800 pretaxhe then says how in some countries they do not do paid time off. and how he gets 4weeks off fully paid. and he gets into detail that if he takes his £$20.8k and divides it by 48 and then 40, he is actually earning £$10.83 an hourand this is where i then ask himwhat hours does he leave home to go to work and then get homehe tells me the store opens at 9am and closes at 6pm but he has to be there at 8:45 to brief the days needs and exits at 6:15pm once all customers have left and doors are shut officially and securelyso this is not 8 hours obviously, but instead 9 hours 30 minuteshe says the hour extra is an unpaid breaks of 1x30min and 2x 15 minutesi say to him in those unpaid breaks does he have enough FREE time to exit the business and do some personal chores unrestricted. he says no, he has to be in the vicinity of the workplace because he will get penalised if late back from lunch and the 15min breaks are not enough time to go anywhere personally without guaranteed penaltyso i get into detail with him. for those 48 weeks of working of 5 days of 9.5hours for $20.8k pretax = 2280 hours / £$20.8k =£$9.12 an houri then inform him that this amount should be for his time. where i then enquire about his other costs just to be able to work. so he tells me he spends about £$2 in fuel per day. and the £$6 on laundry and lunch(buys instore sandwich, drink,snack deal)so out of the £$80 a day income for 9.5 hours he is only actually paid £$72 for his timeand now he works it out. he only gets £$8.20 per hour of his time of being in the vicinity of his workplace and not at home leisurely.. we then started to debate the details, EG saving £$4 buy prepping meals at home for £$1 instead of £$4 and doing home batched clothes washing once a week instead of £$2 a day laundrybut even with all this, the number was far far below the $10 on contract and £$10.83 he thought he was getting if he deducted vacation time from his labour timeit just goes to show how little things like a restrictive activity unpaid lunch and extra start and end unpaid time before the business opens can take money way from your real life timeimagining being told your life was only worth £$10 an hour where they will compensate you for taking time out of your life to do things for them, under their policy.. but then not even getting £$10 an hour for your actual time spent out of your lifeso folks. the gist is.. if a business requires you to be away from home and performing activities that benefit them from 8:45-6:15 make sure they pay you for all of that time ESPECIALLY if its minimum wage",

But with the figures you put out now, many will definitely take this job with an happy heart, sadly that’s what we have been reduced to. There are many that work more hours than this and get 2x less of this, and they still accept because as they say when the desirable becomes unavailable, the available becomes desirable. The only better alternative to this kind of work hour jobs is the fixed payment rate which again are mostly government paid jobs and those are the ones that we hardly get recruited for. So sadly it will be hard to get companies or organization pay you for just few minutes taking off the job, because it seems to be their policy all round, as this can also be related to their lack of productivity in those resting hours which in turns result to lack of profit too",

      "body": "Unfortunately, it's quite common to work off-schedule by going to work a little earlier and also leaving a few minutes after your shift is practically over. Moreover, the unpaid breaks should be included in your usually legal 8-hour shift, not as an extra. Your acquaintance, as you mentioned yourself, spends more than 9.5 hours in the vicinity of his workplace. He's spending his whole day practically just for work; 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. are way too long hours to be away. Not to mention how much time you spend communicating back and forth, and you're practically away from home for over 10 or even 11 hours, depending on how far your job is.Ultimately, you're spending a lot more time than you're thinking about without being paid for it. I doubt that anyone would pay you for commuting, but arriving earlier and leaving a few minutes later should be paid, and unfortunately, it's something very common, and I have experienced it myself too.",

They're always doing this since the industrial revolution and just because everyone's abiding by it doesn't make it any less inhumane. The point of the discussion is how smart these businesses are at hiding their immoral practices against employees, the fact that you're asking for the specifics of OP's friend's contractual agreement is already a good sign that you're pretty much down with this situation cause \"it's what the contract says lol so you can't argue about it anymore\".

Imagine a guy from a Third World country getting this job. It will be life-changing for him. But I don't think the comparison should be logical. You are getting paid higher also you are paying higher for everything. On the other hand, in a Third World country you are getting paid less but you are also paying less compared to first world country. If I get paid $200 a month I would hesitate to pay $50 for bills. But in a country where I am getting paid thousands of dollars $100 bill won't matter that much. So the problem varies from country to country and their economic situation. Coming to the main point of the OP. If he is okay with what he is getting and living a decent life then that 1.5 hour won't matter that much. He's happy with his life, so why make it complicated? If you start to think that every hour of your life counts, or it is valuable and you should get paid for that, then that's not right. Be happy with what you are getting right now.

After all, a person must waste that time on the road, and it's done precisely for the purpose of working there.It's also interesting to me that you count the wage pre-tax. I guess it's because the taxation differs in many countries based on circumstances. In my country the wage is always discussed post-tax because the employer collects the tax on behalf of the employees, and the taxes are not flexible, so it's usually the same rate for everyone.That being said, £10 or even the adjusted £8.2 per hour is considered a very decent payment per hour in my country, well above the minimum wage of around £1 per hour post-tax. So yeah, I do believe that should be accounted for as well. And, needless to say, everything is not 10 times less expensive here. The difference overall is around 2.5 times.",

Overall, I used to have this thought back in the previous month of September, I am a tuition teacher, and I got another batch of students to teach outside of the city and my expenses to go there were around 2k pkr (in local currency). They were paying me around 14k pkr and after deducting the fuel and other expenses, I left with around 11k Pkr. Which was also enough for the 2-hour job of teaching 4 students only. But still, I was getting less paid in comparison to the market, the rates should be around 20k pkr but the middleman who found me that job fixed the deal at 14k pkr. Well, I left it, as I can do more productive work in those 2 hours so I think I should leave it. Well, if your friend thinks, he is still getting paid less and he can not meet his expenses then he should ask for an increment but to do that, he should have a good approach to his boss.",

Consider it a mutual sacrifice for the employer so that they are both going to make it.You might be not fully right because, in this scenario, the the store owner will be the one making more money. And the employees are the ones who have to sacrifice more, they have to bear more, even if they have more burden of work on themselves. Sacrifice is mutual but not equal, good employers make mutual and equal sacrifices while bad ones don't. We should avoid bad employers and should take action against them too, but for an ordinary person, that's not even an option, because they are not aware of their rights, they should know how to talk to them and how to make them agree on their requirements or specific salary. But you are right that, both employer and employee have to spend the amount that OP has mentioned, on their daily life expenses and they both have to use that money from the earnings they both are making.

That's so accurate, but in my thought, they should now be happy, and they are not happy, they just don't have any option to ignore a job, even if it is paying less. In our country, many youngsters are leaving the country to earn $500 a month which they cannot earn in this country and of course they have no other choice but to leave the country.",
