  "content": "I need a seemingly an experienced person. I just installed a rasberry pi 4 node and went through the sync. I installed sparrow wallet and connected sparrow to my node using the electrum server setting. I connected using my nodes IP address and port 50001. Umbrel.local does not work for my node. My question is how does sparrow use tor without an onion address? The other question is, if you log into my router, you can see the umbrel and the IP address. So with sparrow connected to the node, and the node is hooked to the router, how is this secure? Does the electrum server make the difference? And how does it work(electrum vs tor)? So sorry but I had to get it all out. My sparrow wallet does have multi-sig with a password. Thanks for your time in advance.",
