Their hope is that you cannot provide the information, or they put you through so many hoops that you give up. Their KYC system is not used on any other regulated exchanges. Meaning it's completely fabricated by them; fabricated to be deliberately confusing and difficult.",

Income tax return documents is the best proof for source funds aside from submitting pay slip from your employer. Tax record shows where do you get all your funds including your job, side hustle and business. I never done KYC on Hitbtc but asking for proof of funds is out of the line for crypto exchange to ask because they are not giving you the loan and they don’t have any rights to ask where your funds came from. How money you stuck in there? Hitbtc is a scam exchange and many users from the best that share experience like you for having a hard time to complete KYC. They will just prolong the process until you give up,",

At least you could have gone through the reviews before making any deposits there.HitBTC has had issues in the past with users getting their accounts frozen and hence their funds lost.There are other established exchanges that you could have used. All you can do now is try contacting them through different means such as customer support, social media handles, email etc...Once you get are in contact with them ask them what do they need to get you the access to your account.",
