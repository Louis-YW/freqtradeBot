  "content": "A foundation called Taruna Bakti in Bandung, Indonesia has taken the initiative to educate 700 secondary school students in Indonesian secondary schools about Bitcoin.  Maybe that's how Bitcoin is spreading to remote areas around the world.  If these students learn about Bitcoin from an early age, they will grow up to be much more experienced about Bitcoin. After gaining experience with Bitcoin, they can teach other people about Bitcoin.  We have seen news in El Salvador that the President of that country, Nayib Bukele has taken various programs to educate school students in Bitcoin education to spread Bitcoin widely in their country even teaches Bitcoin to students there. This time Indonesia took the initiative.https://x.com/bitcoinindo21/status/1858767829811818777?t=GgHE0regxVx9Ox9z5XC87g&s=19",

      "body": "That’s a great initiative, but is there also a focus on educating groups who are more vulnerable to scams, like older people? I love their effort to educate students but I am just wondering how many of them actually use Bitcoin. You know, It’s one thing to hear about it, but if you’re not actively using it then you’re likely to forget it over time. Plus, students are young and primarily focused on their studies, so Bitcoin might not feel immediately relevant to them.That said, I was also surprised by the data showing they rank in the top 5 for the most users. It goes to show that education, in any form, can make a huge difference. Maybe it’s planting seeds that will grow when the time is right for them to be actively using bitcoin. https://plasbit.com/blog/bitcoin-adoption-by-country",

It's quite surprising how they allow to teach about Bitcoin considering most people think it's high risk investment, not to mention the risk of fall to gambling. Bitcoin as a learning is needed. The group you are referring here, is probably an investment management company or trying to make money out of it. People must learn about Bitcoin, about its architecture and how it works. Now whoever wants to invest in it, it's their own decision! In many countries, the school curriculum misses teaching youngsters about finances. I strongly believe that if Finances are being included, Bitcoin must be a part of it. The modern economy is incomplete without Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin can be used for many purposes, gambling is one of its use cases but if you consider Bitcoin as your investment asset, it is not gambling.Trading can be considered as gambling especially if you trade without knowledge and experience about trading in general and about Bitcoin market in particular. Trading can be seen more like gambling if you trade it with Leverage or Futures markets.If you only spend your money to buy bitcoin, for your investment portfolio, it's not gambling. It is more secure if you know risk of \"It's not your keys, it's not your bitcoin\" to store your bitcoin in open-source, and non-custodial wallets.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsThese students can learn Bitcoin with https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/bitcoin-explained.html",

Just the fact that these are some of the first big group educational settings/ pictures taken in promotion of bitcoin adoption it just tells me that we are still sooooo early to bitcoin and eventually you will see things like a Bitcoin Academy and Bitcoin University and things of this nature. Once Bitcoin is fully adopted I imagine Bitcoin applications will only grow and create more ways for society and its currency to interact with the world.",

Because the faster one can learn about Bitcoin, the faster that person will continue to progress, here you see that Bitcoin is currently ruling the world as a digital currency, so far those who have not taken this initiative to learn about Bitcoin are far away. All knowledge about Bitcoin should be acquired, here are the most advantageous things for long-term investment, and more importantly, they should be taught how to attract Bitcoin in a better way. Here, everyone should be educated, whether they are teenagers, young men, or adults, because if you learn about Bitcoin, you will be able to benefit from all aspects.Quote from: Felicity_Tide on November 24, 2024, 09:42:21 PMNews like this are definitely what pleases every member of this community, but my question is, what actually are these children being taught about Bitcoin?.

And I think they should be taught more very soon because this is how initiatives should be taken in unique places, this way the country of Indonesia can gain more knowledge about Bitcoin because whenever teenagers gain knowledge about Bitcoin, immediately the next generation will be able to gain more knowledge about Bitcoin. Knowledge about Bitcoin should be gained from the primary level, and I think those who have been deprived of this Bitcoin education are far away, someone should bring them forward.",

But if we put ourselves in the shoes of those students' parents, would it be good to teach them about investing and trading right at school? Have these kids ever learned about financial management? If they have never had any financial training or education, teaching them about bitcoin may not be beneficial to them.What if they neglect their studies, use their tuition fees to invest in bitcoin, and even engage in highly leveraged bitcoin trading? Introducing bitcoin to kids too early is like a double-edged sword, it is not as perfect as we think.",
