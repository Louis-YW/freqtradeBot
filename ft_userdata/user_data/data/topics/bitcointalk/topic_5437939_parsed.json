  "content": "QuoteThe Summer Olympic Games (French: Jeux olympiques d'été), also known as the Games of the Olympiad, and often referred to as the Summer Olympics, is a major international multi-sport event normally held once every four years. The inaugural Games took place in 1896 in Athens, Greece, and the most recent edition was held in 2021 in Tokyo, Japan.event schedule: Jul 26, 2024 - Sun, Aug 11, 2024Reportedly, the qualification for the Paris 2024 Olympics in the Asia zone will take place on April 3 -11 2023.  besides that, there are 4 sports that are added to it, these sports: surfing, sport climbing, breaking, and skateboarding.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics[2] https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/paris-2024",

All they have said till now is that they are examining a \"pathway\" so that the athletes can compete (probably under the ROC flag, similar to what they did for the 2020 Tokyo Games). Stanislav Pozdnyakov (head of Russian Olympic Committee) is lobbying for full participation, while Ukrainians are threatening to boycott the games if Russians are allowed under any flag. The argument from Ukraine is that out of the 71 medals won by athletes representing ROC in Tokyo, a total of 45 went to those who are members of the Central Sport Club of the Army (ЦCКA).",

So I guess all the NATO countries should be banned since they were involved in the invasions of Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan, where millions of people died? I don't approve of what Russia is doing in Ukraine. But NATO bloc doesn't have the moral rights do take a high ground here, after all the invasions they did on third world nations.

This sounds like a bad idea for me. Since when breakdancing is considered as a sport? It is an artform. If we includes breakdancing, then what prevents the inclusion of other dance forms such as belly dance, ballet, samba and flamenco?",

Well, it was until it was added again, I don't really know the exact details about this but there are no sports regarding Surfing, Sport Climbing, Skateboarding, and even Breaking that was 1st time I am hearing, were not included in the recent Beijing 2022 Olympics, Right now Alpine Skiing was not in there aswell maybe because of a certain area that sports availability, so certain aspect that have Skiing was not included aswell like Nordic Combine, and it was in the summertime so no Ice Hockey, all form of skating or skiing so all sports in the 2022 Olympic was a winter type of sports, but all these sports will be available in the 2024 Gangwon Olympics, like I have said it may vary depending on the place, or the weather, Quote from: swogerino on February 07, 2023, 07:15:03 AMNo athlete from Russia or Belarus should be part of the Olympic games,the only games Russia knows to play are murdering innocent civilian and raping women beside doing every new day a new war crime and breaking International Law so based on this it would be a big hypocrisy for the committee who is responsible for organizing such games that are a representation of the free world to make any Russian or Belarus athlete to take part in this competition.If they normally will not let them then from the betting perspective it increases the chances of those who want to bet here to win something. Problems with Russia and Ukraine are all political, they will not include all Russian people or it really doesn't involve the society, tend not to include everyone with it because political things are not the same with personal agenda, but I sure don't approve of war at all, it is between two parties, so could be a provocation involve for the other to start a war, well that is their issue, and I really don't know the full details,",

IOC has already banned Russia from competing the Games and the athletes are only allowed as neutral candidates. Now the suggestion to ban individual athletes is stupid. Because ordinary Russians doesn't have anything to do with the Putin regime. And a vast majority of the Russian and Ukrainian soldiers fighting this war have been recruited through forceful means. Punishing them for the crimes of the regime doesn't make any sense. The most vocal proponents of this Russian athlete ban are those from countries that engage in political interference in other countries - such as the NATO bloc. And I have similar concerns regarding breakdancing. The scoring is going to be quite controversial, as thee are no fixed rules available. Asian Games have included Esports and some of the other multi-sports events have included motor-sports as one of the disciplines. And at the same time, they are planning to shelve genuine sports such as Wrestling and Boxing. I am not happy with the direction they are taking.",

When the scoring criteria can be interpreted quite liberally, it always gives rise to disputes. If you remember, there was massive controversy when Israel was given the gold medal ahead of Russia, during Tokyo 2020. A lot of the sports analysts complained that Russian athletes had performed better, but then Israel was given the medal based on political consideration. Scoring can be quite complicated with boxing as well. But lack of fixed rules with breakdance scoring takes all this to a different level. I don't know how this will work in Paris 2024.",
