  "content": "Lots of people especially those with little knowledge about Bitcoin and it's mode of operations, would be wondering why Bitcoin is the most talked about crypto asset to invest on currently but this image below would help enlighten them with a clue to what they need to understand.  Further more in summary of what the image above portrays, based on the bitcoin halving Bitcoin becomes more scarce and it's value surges very high, therefore since we're in the season of the bitcoin halving investing in it currently seems like the best decision anyone could take currently, if you noticed many industrials and financial institutions are acquiring more Bitcoin currently instead of selling so it's in the best interest of individuals to take advantage of this information and invest on Bitcoin while it's not yet very late. As you can see, unlike other Assets, Bitcoin is a decentralised asset and can't be created more, but increases in value when it's price is halved. But note that Bitcoin as an asset is very volatile in nature, therefore you shouldn't invest all your savings but a spare money you could lose without getting very emotional. However everyone needs to take advantage of this years halving and take profits to prepare for the next very early.",

With all of the comparisons and aspects of Bitcoin, it's no doubt a phenomenal asset that everyone should look at.",

Many people don't even know what bitcoin is, how it works, what its supply is...they know nothing about it but they know that it can keep going higher and they invest in it. I never see these posts or questions during bear season but when cow season comes, there are thousands of questions similar to this all over social media. This is also a sign for me to realize that cow season is really approaching.",

The supply of bitcoin cannot be changed depending on demand. If there is more demand for gold or another commodity, the price goes up and since it is more profitable, producers start producing more, which causes, over time, the price to go down. Conversely, if the price goes down, producers stop producing so much, or some stop or go bankrupt, and as production is reduced, the price eventually goes up again. This would be like this in very broad strokes but what I wanted to exemplify is that this cannot be done with bitcoin. There is a total production limit of approximately 21 million and there is a fixed production per mined block that cannot be varied either by supply and demand or by price variation.",

It is still a valuable investment because no one knows when the reserves will last and owning gold can give you a fortune in the future.But with bitcoin we know when and only how many are left to mined so there is more sense of urgency compared to bitcoin now, not to mention that bitcoin is a lot more accessible and convenient to have.

Because gold has no exact maximum supply, but we're know it's not easy to mine gold, it can be used for jewelry or other thing and that's make gold is valuable. I think that the only comparison if it's related to mining and supply limit is that, we know that there's a limit for gold but we don't know how much it exactly is. Whilst for Bitcoin, there's a supply limit but we won't be there until one has been mined.It's true that it's not easy to mine gold just like Bitcoin. The hash power and electricity that's needed to do it is enormous and the same for the resources and equipment needed to mine gold.So, the value starts from there and people have been realizing this I guess. And just as with the use of gold for those other products, the same goes for Bitcoin that it can also be used but more than that and has more utility and use case than gold.Quote from: Plaguedeath on April 09, 2024, 01:22:35 PMActually gold can be created with other elements, although it's not worth due to the cost is higher than the gold price https://www.wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2014/05/02/can-gold-be-created-from-other-elements/It's still different if it's pure which I think is the preference of most gold investors.",

However, why I'd agree that Bitcoin is the best among them is for instance, gold supply can increase with demand but that of Bitcoin is finite, it is capped at 21 million. Also, when you compare it with stock and real estate, it's volatility is a concern but looking at the level of success it's been able to attain within a very short time frame, Bitcoin still stands out.",

One of the biggest reasons why Bitcoin is the best asset to invest in as far as I'm concerned is that you don't have to be rich to become an investor, unlike real estate and the rest, infact no matter your class in the society, so far you're earning an income, you're qualified. At your own level and pace you can start doing DCA method, and as long as you're on it for the long term, the value of your Bitcoin will continue to increase in the future, so it's the safest investment for the super rich to the average and low income earners.",

Real estate, stock and all other investment options are also very nice investment options but the problem is the fact that you need to understand how to maintain and properly manage them in order to prevent you from making losses instead of profits.However Bitcoin on the other hand has a very easy option for investment which is actually being a long term holder. As a long term holder all you have to do is to make sure you understand how to keep your keys and coins safe then you are good to go. You don't actually require a lot of understanding and learning to do before you can invest in Bitcoin unlike other investment options.",

Long drops, sharp rises in value, intermediate oscillations similar to a roller coaster, multiple increases in price - all this doesn't leave ordinary people indifferent, for many of whom this is a ticket to a happy life, but few dare to take risks. Therefore, discussions about bitcoin don't stop, even in the central media.People's interest is not due to the reduction every 4 years in the amount of mined bitcoins, but due to the fact that this leads to an increase in price. People are attracted not by the limited bitcoin's emission, but by the speculative nature of this crypto asset. That is, the opportunity to buy cheaper and sell more expensive. I would say that most people don't care about the technical aspects of bitcoin.",

Many people think that investment tends to be long-term, while trading tends to be more peer-to-peer, where while you are connected to a computer/laptop and the internet you are still safe to trade, as well as digital payment system methods.Investment tends to focus on the long term, you wait too long for your investment to grow, unless it's like what's happening now with the halving, once every four years your investment will certainly be useful, However, not some investors think of Bitcoin as a digital asset that is traded short-term.",
