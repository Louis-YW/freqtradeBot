Historically Bitcoin usually is corrected roughly -80% in past bear markets.ROI chartsI made screenshot from 10-year to 1-year charts.The longer time you hold bitcoins, the better ROI you will get. If you look at 5-year, 10-year, no other investment can compare with Bitcoin.Bitcoin Price - Doubling timeIn the past Bitcoin has many events that it doubled its price after several days. This chart is good to warn gamblers with leverages to short Bitcoin, that they can be killed and liquidated after a few days if they short around Bitcoin doubling price times.",
