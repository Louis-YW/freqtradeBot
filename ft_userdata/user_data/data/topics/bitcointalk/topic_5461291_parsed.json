      "body": "Do they have any meaning besides scamming and memes? There’s no utility, so they practically pretty much fall into the category of shitcoins along all the other coins. Useless coins everyone’ll forget about in years. Today they talk about UFOs, tomorrow they release UFO coins. There was literally no work in the creation of them, they’re just copies of other coins just like 99% of the market",

      "body": "It's funny to see how easy and Quick it is to issue coins on everyday buzz topics. And they heats up and cools as quick as the topic. These tokens whatever they may call themselves are essentially pump and dump projects. Some may earn from investing early but a larger number of people loses larger amount on them. Even selecting on a meme coin, we should prefer one which would have multiple pumps and dumps rather than one.",

I might ape some of this garbage token and see if I can dig some profit on this garbage. I’m sure there will be a lot of liquidity coming from pepe guys to this new hit on meme coins category.",

It all depends on what capital is behind the scam and what skills to manipulate the price have the scammer. This cannot be predicted. And since there are no mechanisms for predicting this, you are gambling, even worse, because in the casino you can calculate the probability of winning and the house edge. High risk must be justified by proportionately high returns. If you're counting on x100 with a probability of 1:10,000, you're probably not making a good trade.",

Maybe because he thinks like Pepecoin that doesn't have a group or team but is suddenly trending in the market..",
