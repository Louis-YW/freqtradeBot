  "content": "There have been controversial contributions all over the internet towards the bitcoin spot ETF application by various organizations on wether they would be considered for approval come next month which is January 2024 or not, also it has been well anticipated as one of the major strategy to push the bitcoin market price higer than we have currently if approved by January, it's allover the US government as they are in it again with the latest development on new appointment.Now the United States government has made a new appointment for the SEC chairman to oversee all the affairs of bitcoin spot EFT application and considers those qualified for an approval next year, information reaching states that the new chairman is moving towards the plan of approving all bitcoin spot ETF application pending approval as she said. I think some of us should already by now be sensing what next year is going to be, just continue to invest and hold your asset because two major events will pump the market high, spot bitcoin ETF approval and Bitcoin halving.

I think if it's serious, this is like marketing for user behavior on X. Overall, it's nonsense news but quite entertaining. Everyone should also consider before watching.",

You wouldn’t mind if that was your boss I have read the same thing somewhere but looking through that image something sprouted in my mind that it must not be so real...up to now a keen eye can still see some red flags easily for AI-generated images. Anyway, it is a good troll...and we should take it as one for good laughs. These days even the mainstream media can easily be victimized by made-up news...much more ordinary guys like you and me who got the desire to read and consume news that we actually wanted to happen, in the first place.",

I have never read or heard of such stories, and reading your post made me curious to make my findings, but I still do not see a viable source that confirms your claims. Could it be true?In this current dispensation, there is so much fake news going around, so I try my best to stick to some good sources alone, and not social media. Any wise person should know better than this. I think Twitter should be the most wrong source for you to read and believe that what you read is actually true.Quote from: stompix on December 22, 2023, 12:56:16 PMLater editJust so everyone can understand why a fake tweet and a fake AI image got OP hopes up  without clicking that This is the image:Lol...So evident indeed.",

Well ashcrypto is quite legit but somehow youll see that he is trolling with additions of the photo of a big girl with so hot appearance. Damn if the Sec would be literally like that Im not sure if someone would try to make some bad actions or try to do bad things.",

It’s also highly unlikely it would happen on a Saturday which is right before Christmas. I think if they were to get rid of Gensler they would of done it a year ago but he is still there. Hence this is proof he will never be replaced, even with all the mistakes he makes.",

That is, if that is really the new chairman or chairwoman. But in truth, the chairman of the SEC U.S. at the present time now are very annoying. We know that most of what they are doing is just bullying and harassment on cryptocurrency-related issues. But I hope it's true that the chairman of the SEC will be replaced so that everyone will be happy.",

      "body": "Why would the government change the chairman now? With the ongoing ETF applications that are still pending approval, it is highly unlikely that the SEC will have a new Chairman. When you take news from X.com formerly known as Twitter, it is always a good thing to verify the news. With the new policy of buying a blue tick, it is impossible to be sure that the news is not fake. Currently, they have also made it easy for any content creator to earn money on that platform as it depends on the number of activities happening on any tweets. To gain a good amount of revenue content creators come up with such fake news and when questioned they would justify their earning by using a loophole. In this case, it is the image that has been shared by that handle as it clearly looks like a fake image generated using an AI.",

I did find some info from months ago with calls to change the head of the SEC, but that didn't lead to results. That's a shame because the current chairman has a very strong position that Bitcoin should not be regulated by the SEC, and a move to replace him could actually signify that the SEC will change its stance.",
