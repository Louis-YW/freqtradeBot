  "content": "I'm looking for the fastest smart contract platform in the world that's based on Ethereum's EVM. I've tried Polygon (MATIC) and BNB, and I have to say they're extremely fast. But could there be another contender which is faster? Something like instant transaction confirmation times and zero gas fees while using the same \"engine\" as the ETH blockchain would definitely do the trick.Any suggestions? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
