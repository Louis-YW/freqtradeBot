The stolen funds were sent to exchanges for selling, while the remaining member and the remaining 10 trillion PEPE tokens are secured.The remaining member is now focused on moving forward in the best interest of the PEPE community.

But in reality, if Pepe is shitcoin, why is this shit you called listed on different top exchanges in the crypto industry? Problems are always present in each cryptocurrency in this field of business. Many in the community have looked down on Pepe ever since it was started, but what happened was that it was all of a sudden listed as one of the top coins in cryptocurrency. And those who called Pepe a shitcoin were embarrassed. And if this happened now, I think this is just normal for the coin, and yet in the long run, we will see it survive the chance we didn't expect to happen.",

It's an unspoken agreement that people don't speak ill about the coins/tokens they hold. They just keep shilling them, as you can make a ton of money with absolute useless garbage, because when it will rise from nothing (microcap to lowcap), you have already made more than enough money for that year depending what you put in originally.This is why these stories get so much press time. Everyone wants to identify with that guy who made $200 to $2M. It makes it seem possible even though it will happen for handful of people.",

The hype was really big making it to trend slot. I just hope that this is not going to make investors to lose hope in the project that could lead to total downward trend.

There's a lot of FUD about PEPE but I'm amazed that the price didn't really go down significantly. Maybe the founders haven't really sold the stolen funds. If this news are true, I'm really expecting it to be honest since there's a lot of red flags about pepe even if it's a meme coin, sooner or later they will do an exit scam knowing that all of the project team members and the developers are anonymous. This is why I don't really like memecoins/shitcoin since it there's a lot of way that developers can leave the project or abandon it.",

Its never been something new on which it would really be not that shocking anymore if there would be some sudden hacks and exploits or unauthorize on selling out those coins.Checking out the price of $PEPE on which the price hadnt really dipped down so much and considering that $16M isnt a small thing then good to see that it didnt dropped down into the floor. It turns out that those greedy shitty members cant really have a good hold into themselves and been burned down by their greed.Well, thats how human being which we do have that greediness inside. They do just waste off that opportunity on having more if $PEPE demand would becoming even more bigger but welleverything is something that cant be known.",

It was an absolute shtfest when it was released and while I think people could've profited off of it early on if they were lucky, anything past that would've been nothing but losses. Even a minor profit would be considered a loss considering the time spent imo, I'd much rather move on to other coins isntead.",
