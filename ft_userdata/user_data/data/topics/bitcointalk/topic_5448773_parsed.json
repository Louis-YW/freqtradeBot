Assuming you are a company, you can campaign on this forum for members on this forum to know about your products and services. Another is Bitcoincleanup.It would have been better if you use 'bitcoin giveaway for quality posts/posting' as the topic title, or 'quality post competition', or something related to reward etc.But let us leave it to what you want to call it.It would have been better if we have more merit sources. I have exactly this plan in mind many weeks ago, to quality posts that bitcoin is included, but I am not a merit source. It would have encouraged people to post contents that are more related to bitcoin on this forum. I mean merit giveaway to quality posts.",

The initiative is good one. I like people that are trying to make the local board clean. But even as this, those who like to spam the board will still do it and I know them very well. And also your rules, you didn't state it clearly that the posting must be in the local board because some members and newbies would think that they can post for any board. And I ask want to appeal to others that anyone who can sponsor the campaign can also join Satoprincess in this new development.",

It must not be any of the two of them, I just used them as a point of reference, anybody wey SatoPrincess feel say go deliver fit run am even herself too (I just no wan make she put herself in a situation wey people go talk say, she just dey give herself the reward) that's why I suggest she use third party. Igehh self get him other technique to find quality posts and na key words, maybe another person for come with another technique and SatoPrincess use am as basic for her reward so nobi only one set of people go dey received the reward but still on the quality criteria. Dis campaign na SatoPrincess own so las las na she get final say, we go just dey add wisdom as the program dey go on.OP Pm'ed me earlier, and I accepted to run the show; I also suggested the techniques I would use, and she agreed. I will be grateful to use two hours of my time to scrape out data, do some manual cleaning, and ignore some threads, including the Hangout mega thread and others that will be made public. This is a good initiative, and it will only get better from here. Please no alts, I have great eyes, and it would only take me 2 minutes to fish out, and nobody is above DT penalty. I shall be omitting myself from the awards for the purpose of transparency.__________________________+++++++++++++___________________________Please check my personal text space there is a $50 lottery going down this weekend, hosted by JollyGood- sponsored by Igebotz management and Utopia Ecosystem.",
