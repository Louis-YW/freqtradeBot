You can share yours too on the comment below.I recently experienced a heated game session on blackjack that I never experienced before due to I over extent my budget to chase loss. I was down by 200$ while my current bankroll is only 100$. Typically most user will do all in to quickly recover losses but my strategy is to slow down and bet only on craps 5$ on each number. Craps has a low house edge because your only loss is when 7 appear while the rest of the number that you didnâ€™t choose will just result as draw.Craps pays x2+ per win which is good to slowly recovering my losses. I just continue same bet and stop gambling for a day after I recover 50$ of my bet. I keep doing this per day until I completely recover all my loss slowly and rest for the week.The slow down bets makes me think clearly and stop me for doing risky bet. This is most important lesson I learned on this messy situation.",

I personally have had a lot of bad experiences when I lost and then went all-in, what you said is the truth about we have to play slow and relax. Until I realized that I should increase my win rate instead of increasing my bet amount. So when I play the original games (Slide on Stake and X-Roulette on Rollbit), I drop the multiplier to under x1.5, it's a very powerful way to reverse my losses and keep playing slow.",

I admit that I feel very lucky that time since my bet keeps winning and have a longer winning streak even though my bet is lower than normal bet. Slowing down works for me this time because my usual approach on this is to martingale or do all in bet to recover quickly which always result to lose but this time is different since I lose what I canâ€™t afford to lose so I decided to slow down have different approach.I always thinking gambling only what I canâ€™t afford to lose but sometimes I forget this when I lose small amount and keep chasing it without noticing how much that I lose already.",

Though betting techniques differs, playing roulette game on a low bank roll, I take lesser risks by staking little amounts on high wining possibility slots like all black or red. If that works, unlike you, I always increase my stake to secure more wins. It aches me to win with little stakes as I'll regret why I didn't stake big. So I don't stick to little amounts, however, I fluctuate the amounts from big to small and vice versa. It's all about luck and following your instincts.",

If you lose the first bet, you just start the game with a higher bet. If by the will of fate you will have several losses in a row (which is not impossible) then you will lose a large sum just trying to beat your previous losses.",

Only ever lost $20 a session so there's no point chasing those after I lost them on each week. But yeah, this strategy works if you want to get something back from what you spent on your gambling, or at least recoup some of your losses in the process. You will, most definitely, not get 100% returns on what you put out especially in gambling (unless you're really lucky and all that).Also, how is Martingale equivalent to slowing down your bets",

But quick bets do not give you enough time to properly make analysis before betting. Slowing down to think is very advantageous, making decisions in a hurry is a major reason for bad decision making. You also should not chase after your losses, you can end up losing more. Any money you loose to betting, consider it as a win for the betting place that day, another day will be your turn.",

And your advice is very important for anyone that have been losing much money in gambling. But itâ€™s also hard to apply especially if you spend much money trying to recover that money and you keep losing more since in Blackjack as in your case itâ€™s almost 50% chance to win and 50% chance to lose on every session. I play blackjack for fun also and i start with small hand bet, i double my bet when i lose and i return to my initial bet once i win. This is a very known strategy that i use a lot and still a bit effective if you are patient enough",

Same with my thoughts. Itâ€™s hard to recover your losses when youâ€™re already at the losing edge, the best way is just to stop. Because in my own experience, even if I have to slow down, still it doesnâ€™t change. The rest of my bets are still losing so I believe once you start losing your bets, itâ€™s better to just stop and call it a day. Donâ€™t wait until all your money are gone. Just gamble again when you think you are ready and always gamble at an amount you can manage to lose.",

Not really hilarious, have you tried the approach?Â  @OP not only slows down but he changed his game to a low edge game where he has a good chance of winning while trying to recover his losses.Â  He is still in his \"can afford to lose\" budget and he has proven that he is gaining some recovery. The slowing down really doesn't make sense or lessen the risk but the change of game do.Â  Betting on craps you haveÂ  greater chance to win against the house if you bet on each number.Â  So I guess it does the trick.Â  But as usual @OP is lucky that the 7 doesn't show frequently in his craps session.",
