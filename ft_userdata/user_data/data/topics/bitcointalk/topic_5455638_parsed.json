Too risky, will give it a try?It’s is a two way something obviously if everything goes to plan and the debtor doesn’t hang on the money and pays up at the right time then it is good because this time around you will be having a little interest on it and still keeping your coin for the time it took. But the other way is why lending is kinda risky because once the debtor doesn’t pays back it makes you lose your funds. That is why the person been borrowed the money must be a trusted person but even trust can cover for something that is not available. Although I will say lending might work better I would say having your bitcoin with you might gives you extra freedom to take profit anytime the market might pump up not like the loan that has to payed at a specific time. For example if bitcoin should raise to a certain amount you could just sell of and then buy back after it dumps again, with this you might have earned some profits. But without the bitcoin in your possession you can’t take profit anytime you would like",

Too risky, won't try it? Too risky, will give it a try?I have a negative attitude towards lending, but this doesn't mean that everyone else should adopt the same tactics of avoiding lending. This is just my choice, due to the fact that I consider these risks to be excessively unjustified. In lending, you will have to give bitcoin (or othrt crypto) into the wrong hands. Giving 100% for the sake of possibly getting 10-20%? I don't know anything dumber. I would be willing to risk 10-20% to get 100%, but certainly not vice versa. With a hodl, sooner or later, capital growth will still happen, and this is inevitable. I prefer to go slowly, but only forward. The pursuit of quick profits (lending) promises big trouble and unnecessary risks - all for the sake of relatively small profits. It's not worth it.",

What I do now is to diversify my portfolio, damn the risk, this is because if one fails many others would still be standing for me. Just today, a company offers me 20% ROI if I could leave my money for a full year as they use it. That, I will still do and still does not stop me from investing in anything reasonable that comes my later comes my way.And specifically about your question, if I were you, I will divide the money into two and continue to invest in both if their promising returns are truly worth it.",

Lending Bitcoin lets you earn interest on your holdings but carries risks like borrower default. Choosing between Hodl and lend depends on your goals and tolerance for risk. Hodl is passive, while lending requires active involvement.I chose Hodl alone but I researched and researched lending platforms, understood their requirements, and assessed their reputation because of the possibility of borrower default, platform vulnerability, and market volatility.",

Too risky, won't try it? Too risky, will give it a try?To me this feels like speculation on top of speculation, or maybe it could be called leverage. However in terms of trading, which you are effectively doing by renting your bitcoin out, then it might help you to get a long term return from this rather stationary asset. However you always have to look for the downsides or negatives in such trades. If you really think that bitcoin has a bright future then (depending on how long you think it will take to achieve) you might not want to set up a contract where someone can take it away from you if it reaches a certain price. That's how these deals tend to work, people have the option to take them from you if it reaches a presently unrealistic price point.",

      "body": "Lending in general involves a double risk, one of which is the fixed payment term with a guarantee, if you do not pay within the payment term, the guarantee will be liquidated at less than its value, and the second is the interest, which is rising in our current days due to inflation and because of the increase in interest rates.These risks increase in Bitcoin as the value is very volatile and volatile, and therefore you add another dimension to the factors that currently exist. It is an option that I do not recommend to anyone because you want to borrow in a high-risk investment with slow returns in the short term and the results are not guaranteed in the long term. DCA is the best strategy, it allows you to grow slowly but after a few years you will notice that your assets have increased well.",

I can't lend my Bitcoin just like that to anyone, lending don't have anything to do with one's reputation, there must be a collateralized asset for anyone to give out my Bitcoin to anyone; and for me to giveout bitcoin, I wouldn't take any altcoins for collateral, they are too risky for collateral because they can easily be liquidated when the market becomes too volatile.However, with what I have seen in the Forum from lenders who give out bitcoin as loan to other members, it's a very profitable venture from the % profits I have seen in their profits, the profits may be little per individual but when combined as a whole, it's worth something big because they are accumulating more merit and when bullrun comes, they will earn from the profits they make too.",

I know this system is there from the start but its not moral work or a way for borrowers to take the money and for lenders to earn money on interest. So i will pass that path. Secondly, you are totally right about patience plus people who are involved in trading but there are other people too. Like me, who are earning BTC by working, those who get paid in BTC in exchange of their services and products. And, if i talk about myself, i never want to withdraw my BTC to fiat even for daily expenses, but still, i have to as it is necessary that's why we are earning money, so what use do they have if we will just save them instead of using them. Even now, i do not want to exit the market but i have to. The point is, holding BTC solely not depends on patience but on the conditions and situations being made for you. If you have left no other choice then you have to sell BTC.",
