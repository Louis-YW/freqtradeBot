The collapse will come in money and technology, as God makes Himself forcefully known among the people.Revelation 18:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/18.htm...4Then I heard another voice from heaven say:“ ‘Come out of her, my people,’so that you will not share in her sins,so that you will not receive any of her plagues;5for her sins are piled up to heaven,and God has remembered her crimes.6Give back to her as she has given;pay her back double for what she has done.Pour her a double portion from her own cup.7Give her as much torment and griefas the glory and luxury she gave herself.In her heart she boasts,‘I sit enthroned as queen.I am not a widow;I will never mourn.’8Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her:death, mourning and famine.She will be consumed by fire,for mighty is the Lord God who judges her....So, take warning, because if you don't, your judgment is on its way, and you won't like it at all!",
