  "content": "So many people have suffered losses in this incident that befell Terra Luna. there is even news that mentions people who suddenly went into shock and fainted because he had stored a large amount of terra luna. and he went on vacation for a few days without seeing the market. and after coming home he just checked the market and he was surprised to see his terra luna coins were worthless. He was shocked and rushed to the hospital. and many other stories. you can search on google.but apart from that I myself am an enthusiastic person for the development of this terra luna. and did not expect this bad thing to happen.but there is a unique incident from my friends in the real world, namely they buy terra luna coins in large quantities at the current price which is already almost worthless. and I asked my friend. What's the reason you bought Terra Luna? he my friend replied i want to keep it as a memento.from this answer I also think whether it is possible for many people to do the same thing. So I also ask you all, did you buy Terra Luna now to be used as a keepsake collection to remember the achievements and history of what happened to Terra Luna?I feel sure this incident will be a new history in the crypto world. like in 2018.",

Ah, I'm sorry I didn't buy it at that time. even though he invited me. I bought a little late.

Actually it still can and I don't know what chaos could a revert also do.But yes, 40$ is not too much for a lottery ticket  and now he can even cash in the initial investment and enjoy the ride.But you should not be sorry.

I have extra money that when spend or keep won't affect me that much, so why not gamble with it on Terra Luna.  If the market continues to crash and Terra Luna becomes worthless, it's ok since it won't affect my finances, but if ever The dev made a miracle and able to regain at least 3% of the previous ATH then it will be a fortune for me.  So weighing the loss-gain effect ratio,  I decided to buy some Luna and stash it to sell when the price become profitable.",

They are taking the risk of not wanting to be left out if Terra happen to do recovery. Imagine it if with the price of Terra now and the increase suddenly happen in 100%. Depending on how much invested in it that is money. I think this reason is enough if someone invested now not for keepsake. If Terra start increase it will surely do a multiple increase this is possible if bitcoin bull start.",
