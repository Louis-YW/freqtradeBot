I think you must transfer on a non cex since you could benefit on airdrops as well aside from the cex which doesnt benefit you but I think the APR is also same with staking on your own wallet. Ive been delegating on validator and got some free airdrops but of course it has also a lock of 21 days.",

While some desktop and multicurrency wallets are also supporting it.I'll choose to get it on a Ledger live because you hold its custody and you'll have no worry at all because it is on your possession.",

You will spend no more than a few hours studying the operation and setting up a hardware wallet. A trader needs exchanges, but why do you need them if storing coins on exchanges is not safe today?Make the first transaction from the exchange to a $50 hardware wallet.",

Just check the address properly where you'll be sending them. Don't just check the first and last characters but check the entire address where you're about to send your funds.It seems that you've been keeping it on those exchanges for sometime now. It's better to just do anything that you can to get out your funds there and let the next thing come about staking.That should be your priority now, to withdraw your funds out of those exchanges. And upon holding for long term, hardware wallets are always the best choice.",

      "body": "In my opinion, there are a few ways to go about self-custodying your ATOM. One option is to use a hardware wallet, such as a Ledger or Trezor, to store your ATOM. You can then connect your hardware wallet to a staking service, such as Cosmostation or Lunie, to stake your ATOM and earn rewards.In another option is to run your own validator node and delegate your ATOM to yourself. This requires a bit more technical knowledge and set-up, but can provide even greater control and security over your staked assets.",

You can find more info about cosmos staking on their official website https://cosmos.network/learn/staking/ The benefit if you stake outside exchange is you can actually can choose the right validator that suits you it can lead to a better APY",
