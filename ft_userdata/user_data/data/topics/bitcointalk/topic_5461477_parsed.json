It is also important to be very careful with exchanges, wallets and general crypto stuffs, because of the possbility of hiding ones identity in the crypto industry, there are so many scammers out there looking for easy victims.Having said that, these scam exchanges have different modus operandi, some wait for the perfect time to rug-pull, but others like the one in the op is pretty obvious immediately after depositing, because why in God's name would i have to deposit 50% of my initial deposit in order to withdraw it, it should be clear to anyone that it is a scam.",

Try to impersonate Digifinex exchange.Nice catch OP. I just visited (though it's not recommended) their scam website and this is just a avarage quality Phising site but can hard new users much. Most of the digifinex users can fall into this trap or new users may lose their assets if they deposit. The worst part is that their trading page interface is live and bots are doing trading. So it's pretty hard if you have little knowledge about Phising sites and too much confusing. You just caught it earlier and shared with us which is really a good job. Newbies will know how traps are looks like. And everyone should make proper research before investing anywhere or using their wallet. Their main focus is to steal funds but they can also steal data from users. I already shared same types of fake site of Bittrex exchange. You may check here: [WARNING] SCAM BITTREX Exchange Website [Don't Connect Wallet] Anyway this topic should be posted in Scam Accusations board. You can more it to that Board for better discussion.",

As long as they know they will still have victims, you will keep seeing them emerge over and over again with any means they know they can use to catch some victims. I was arguing with one crypto enthusiast, although he is older than me in the space. I still had a long argument with him because of scams, hacks, and fraudulent activities in the crypto space. What resulted in the argument was that I told him that all scammers and hackers use a new and sophisticated method to access investors funds, but he was of the opinion that it's still the same old method that hackers are using; he said nothing is new. I know that in the past, there were some common ways of easily scamming crypto enthusiasts, but now, look at just the OP's catch. For someone who has not used the real Digifinex exchange, how can you tell the difference?",

A friend of my friend was scammed. She deposited $10,000 and was asked to send 50% of that ($5,000) to withdraw. She asked my friend who asked me about that exchange is scam or legit. I did not know about the exchange but I told her immediately it is scam before I checked that website.I told my friend that is scam and recommended her to inform her friend won't deposit more money. Fortunately, her friend did not have enough $5,000 to deposit the 50% so she had to ask my friend and more people to borrow the $5,000. By that, I could help her that it is a scam site but the rest, I don't know as I only can advice \"Don't deposit more, accept the $10,000 and move on.

You can't blame them, scammers are getting craftier everyday and with new technology, they always try and find new ways to scam people which means that if they find a new way to scam people, some will not know that's a scam because it's something new.This is a first time for me to see an exchange where you have to talk to the customer support before you can deposit, definitely a big red flag for me because I don't get why there's a person that I have to interact with to deposit something. Heck, that no email confirmation should tick off your red flag detectors because with no email confirmation, you won't have any way to recover your account in that exchange. Great catch OP!",
