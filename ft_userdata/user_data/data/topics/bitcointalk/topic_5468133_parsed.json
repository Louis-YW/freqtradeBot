If you are using fundamental analysis, you know the actual use case of the coin/token. Also, you can get more confirmations from the market news as well. Those belong to the fundamental analysis. If you know about technical, you can check the volumes of the trading and overall direction. But I think this post should move to the trading discussions",

Fundamental analysis is good to use to see how would the project or coins perform since it deals with the foundation of the projects, the plans and the people behind it, while Technical analysis gives us the knowledge of when to enter and exit the market since these deals more on the previous and recent trend of the projects market price and its signal for the upcoming trend through some mathematical calculation.The combination of these two may supplement each other weaknesses and possibly synergize the pros.",

In the market fundamental and technical can be different and they don't come with same direction most of time.When people lose money in market by their failures with technical analysis, they blame it on fundamentals which are useless and helpless for them.
