But even if crypto casino revenue is included, I think it doesn't make much difference because most crypto casinos are not licensed in the US. They are mostly based in Curacao. So the big revenue of large crypto casinos like Sportsbet, Stake, and many more cannot be included in US casino revenue computation. Where I live, I haven't observed any noticeable growth in casinos. The casinos here are the same old casinos, no additions, no extensions.",

I tried to get data on the revenue of casinos in my country for last year and they are not currently available. But research has shown that as citizens have access to mobile phones and Internet facilities it results in an increase in online betting which ultimately leads to more revenue. And last year more people had access to internet facilities in my country.I do not doubt that last year was a profitable one for casinos in my country because this year more casino companies are being established, existing ones are signing lucrative promotion and endorsement deals with celebrities and other organizations, and more people are turning to gamble as a side hustle due to current economic challenges.",

I guess it's also because of the states that recently allowed online gambling, I only found that out due to the group that i'm following, and I was surprised by the number of promotions that are being offered by several fiat sportsbooks. Most crypto casinos will probably experience an increase but I think it won't be similar to what the US casinos are currently going through right now since crypto casinos have a different player base and only a few of them have a sister site that only focuses on US players.",

Are cryptocurrency casinos experimenting the same kind of boom as fiat casinos?I am not sure about the gambling industry in my country, because we had so many lock downs during covid where all the physical casinos had to be closed. As far as I know all of the casinos got cheap loans from the state to not go out of business. The three big casinos near my hometown are all open again and quite busy from what I heard from friends. The thing is that I just don't know if it's all profits for them now or if they still have to repay the covid loans. Rent is probably one of the highest cost factors as they are all placed at prime locations. So it could be that it will take another 2-3 years to fully recover from the covid restrictions. As for online gambling, I know it's very popular since the lock downs as well. Competition is high, but so are the profits. I think 2022 was a great year for all the online casino and so will be 2023.",

People who usually would not gamble in normal times then get drawn in and likely form a problem. At the same time, casino revenue would most likely be swayed more by the whales than average people. It could be a better indicator of how the whales are doing financially than the economy, which mostly just effects normal people more than it does whales.",
