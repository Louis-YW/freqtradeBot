I think it will be a good indicator to select the gambling site who have made their proof of reserves public.I don't think that I have to demand them with proof of reserve. They're a business and they've shown that they've got enough money whenever I want to withdraw any amount from them. Most reputable casinos are transparent with how much they've got in their bankroll.But to casinos like stake, they've got a lot of partnership and sponsorships to big names in different sports and that's already enough for me that if they can spend a lot of money on these marketing and deals, they've got for sure more in their reserves.",

Not sure if gambling should be involved and have more attention just to show backup evidence. After all, in gambling rules not all crypto holders go in to bet in casinos. Maybe if one or two casinos are trying to show back-up evidence, it means that someone has to drum up the drums as CZ did.",

Remember that casino's, in every game they have the house edge, so no matter what, they wouldn't simply run out of money to pay.",

But if gambling sites need to providee proof of reserve, then all sites that users do deposit have to make proof of reserve available, not even only internationally, but also locally. Beside, I even only always have small money on gambling site, unlike when I want to exchange from one coin to another.Also do not think proof of reserve can not be manipulated.",

For now, it's better to be safe even if you are playing with the top site, don't hold too much money with your gambling account and just stay the money you intended for gambling, you can also do this on any exchanges, transfer it to a more secured wallet.",

The perception and way of doing business by a crypto gambling website are different.Those gambling companies that have closed their business have been clear to their customers and community by telling them what they're about to do like, closing the business. They give a certain period of time for withdrawals and until when customers will be catered for their not yet withdrawn funds. At least from that experience and observation that I've seen from most of them, they're all good in their closure and had satisfied everyone until their last minutes of operation.",

Gambler doesn't keep their funds on their account for a long time. Most of the gamblers request for a withdrawal after completing their gambling activity. Although some bettors keep their funds on some casinos where they receive extra benefits (staking profit). Some old casinos were showing their proof of funds by signing a message with their Bitcoin address. Old reputable casino has the capability to pay big withdrawals to it's user.

Every project no matter exchange, business or gambling will show their proof of reserves to gain the investor's confidence. Although it will not be mandatory but those who will show their balance sheet publicly will get more confidence from the investors and players if we talk specifically about the gambling industry. This has already been talked about in social media and companies are thinking seriously into it. The black swan FTX event has made people think differently about the projects.",
