Also, TaskOn Christmas with $60k. Looks like you can participate in dozens of projects with a higher chance of winning. I noticed the first project offers $7,000, and it‚Äôs going to 300 winners. Tasks are chill, just like the Binance retweet one. Deadline is the 25th. Any other Christmas events? especially ones with easy tasks. I don‚Äôt want to waste too much time on it.",

I don‚Äôt want to waste too much time on it.Easy task = lots of participants = low chance to win even a candy. I would not follow such strategy. You wont get extra money without any effort. I have noticed, that almost every major exchange run competitions almost every month or quarter. Mostly they are trading competition. So if you have skills, you can give them a try. Or major casinos run Christmas events (but they are halfway through already). You can try your luck there. But if you are looking for something like retweet, click, join, follow and etc, then I suggest you not to make great hopes to win anything there. As what looking for are airdrops, that are waste of time today.",

I wanted to disagree with him to a larger extent that reputable projects will not even think to play such an unethical game. But on a second thought I understood it is a centralized system and ought not to be trusted. In any centralized system, many unimaginable shits happen behind the scene.These projects that do these taskful giver aways, do they state the process of selecting the winners. I mean the transparency of the system, is it assured?",

It looks like a promotional offer to me.. (well, Binance's rich enough to donate that away for the xmas without a doubt).. apart from casinos and Thier weird bonuses this Xmas, I don't really know about centralized exchanges that are willing to offer an easy-peasy.. Edit: remitano has been advertising several bonuses and Xmas claims though.. I don't really know their Ts/Cs.. that's left for you to figure out.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

      "body": "The chances of winning these contests are very low. You are most likely to end up doing all the work and not making a penny. It‚Äôs like free advertising, referral contests is good method of marketing and it‚Äôs very cost effective for the company because they only pay a small pool of people. You say you want something easy but when you really think about it, you‚Äôre actually getting the short end of the stick. Most of the contests are designed so only the persons with the highest numbers win. That means if you come up even a little bit short, you get nothing for your work. No compensation of any sort.",

I feel they do those events just to gain more attention for themselves, while there is no real reward that was given. They could tell you that Mr. A won the event, but how do you verify? Also, in a competition where there are already 20,000 contestants, what is the guarantee that they will win? There's no guarantee, and that's why I don't get involved. It's just a waste of time and effort.",

You want to buy a reliable device that protects your investments, which may be millions of dollars to a few hundred dollars. Saving 25% of the value of the wallet in exchange for the risk of losing your money is not a good move.Look for an open source wallet with a good rating. If you find a discount, that's good. If you don't, there's no problem, but buying a wallet because there's a 90% discount on its price is stupid.",
