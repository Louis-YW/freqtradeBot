  "content": "As we must have seen, the news of war has become one of the most frequent headlines around the major channels in the world. Just some months back, it was the Russia and Ukraine war that took the headlines of major news networks like CNN and Aljerera, and now the Israeli and Palestinian war is making serious waves around the globe.It's now more like a common situation that the world is always at war with one another.We know some religious people believe that a time like this will come when nations will fight against nations and kingdoms will fight against kingdoms and then the end of the world will come.What's your take on this occurrence and the possibility that this prediction might be true?",

I also envision wars coming to bring an end to the world but not at this time, not this early even when I can’t tell how long it will last until the predicted time people say it will happen. This war is killing the world but that’s another sign of the end time coming, we might witness more of this in the future soon since every country wants to claim supremacy over the other.Quote from: LucyFurr on October 13, 2023, 08:13:49 PMWar in the human history is not new, it existed 5000 years or even before so it may not be the reason for end of this world.But the modern day invention like nuclear weapons can end the human to extinct and if there is something called World war 3, there is high probability for nuclear weapon to be used.Nuclear weapon will be used to start the world war 3 but I don’t think it will be used till the end of the war. If the whole world is at war, no more production will be done, only existing weapons will be used and when they get exhausted they’ll definitely go back to the old days that they use swords and arrows to fight each other.",

Even if we use 10% of nuclear weapons we have then the human race will come to extinct along with 99.999% of living organisms and it will take few millions years for things to recover from all those nuclear radiations.",

So whether the world is already in it now or facing the tribulation is yet to be known but surely the world is not at peace with the incessant wars and conflict going on because of different reasons and countries want to show their supremacy and military strength on another. The unfortunate thing is that it is the civilian population that suffers from it all. The numbers of death in Israel and Palestine war keeps rising and no intervention in place yet.",

Some Russians never accepted that Ukraine became a sovereign state after the fall of the Soviet Union. They are used to some former soviet states being obedient to them, so this is getting on their nerves. Ukraine on the other hand would like to be like the Baltic States that joined the EU. It doesn't want to be another Belarus to Russia, or worse, another Chechnya.This could be compared to Israel and Palestine, where Israel is the invader that won the first part of the conflict, but many Palestinians refuse to accept defeat and this is understandable. They respond with violence that gives birth to more violence from the Israeli side and this is going to continue until one of the nations gets wiped out, or reduced to numbers that are unable to fight anymore.

He believed that in the third would war there would be weapons beyond the imagination of the people (nuclear) and the next ones would be fought using branches and stones, because of how much devastation there would be, so much it would take humanity to the darkest of ages. Though, in reality, if there was going to be any survivors of such conflict, they would likely to live in miserable standards but still have tools at hand which would allow them to live in a better way than cavemen did.",

There may be some survivors from shock wave created but the nuclear radiation will stay for hundreds of years so possibly if there is someone they can live in the bunkers only.",

This for me, is the case of the world wars.Another thing that, because of the nature of man, which is vehemently designed with interest, man will always do things that will favor them, regardless of what the next person feels. Because of our selfish interest, we decide to shelf the interest of others in that regards. This is majorly what is causing conflicts. From an intrapersonal conflict to interpersonal and multiple interests.Quote from: darkangel11 on October 14, 2023, 06:27:02 PMWe are because it's the aftermath of old conflicts.

But it's unfortunate that these country allow themselves to be tricked by the USA using their Divide and Conquer strategy to distract them and get resources and control over them. At a point, when you look deeply at all these things, you will realize that some super power countries are only taking advantage of the least powerful countries or the weak ones. Else all these conflicts could be resolved through the ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) methods where the both conflicting partners will be brought to a table for resolution.",

If you even look at the Bible, you will see that Is real loves fighting wars and that has been their way of life. The end time is already now and that is why most things that the Bible said is already happening but nobody can tell when the world will come to an end except God. But he said it in his words that when we see such sign, it means that end time is near. Power is what everybody is fighting for and they forgot to see that they are destroying and killing what took them so many years to build.",
