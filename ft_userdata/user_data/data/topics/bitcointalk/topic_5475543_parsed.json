It has different requirements. Sometimes you need the tokens to vote and it only permitted you to vote but doesnt mean you earn somwthing from it.

Can you provide an example DAO you are describing because you can only get paid on DAO if you apply on a job posted by the team but the rest is just voting and suggesting of idea.

I'm still curious to know how DAO makes money,  because from what I understand so far, they're decentralized and autonomous, a place where members share ideas and vote to choose preferred options. So how do they get the funds to pay their members? You said that members can contribute by helping to develop something, manage the community or write article for them, members get paid in their token. So how do they utilize these services by members to make money, and who do they sale them to? I'm asking because I'm having interest to join one DAO to give my services and get paid.",

Best example is stargate which have funds pooled on their stg platform. Everyone who locked stg can vote and before you can vote you need to stake stg which earns different rewards like usdt or op, or depends on the pool that are live. Also some stg tokens too.  Aside from that the token valuation of the project while holding those dao tokens. Sometime they partnered with other defi projects for some rewards, something like that.",

Whether they will compensate you with little or not but if your aim is to gain experience. I think that's a good start for you to do so.

Just keep learning and keep applying to projects. Maybe even ask for those who rejected you why you got rejected if possible and probably educate yourself to the ideas and skillsets that you're trying to contribute to the project since there can be various things you can apply for. The easiest would be as others have said, moderators since there's not much qualification needed really other than being able to spend time. If you want experience then try to look for big servers in Discord of your hobbies and apply as a moderator to get a hang of how things work as one.",
