  "content": "So I figured what the hell. I use Gemini and like them so I got their card.3% BTC / crypto back on restaurants 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else.All managed through the gemini app. Metal card and that I think really cool, which is part of the reason why I got it. There is no number on it. No expiration date. No 3 digit code. Just my name on back.Had 3 color options, I chose black.Other then that, it's a credit card. Decent limit stupid high IMO interest rate, but with rates climbing in general it might be average now, I don't carry balances so I really don't pay that much attention to them.-Dave",

Good security measure if you ask me.No fees outside of standard interest & late fees.US only for now. What is nice is rewards are instant, I bought dinner last night after my post about it and the BTC is already in my account.Side bit of an OT rant but I am getting really tired of crypto places not wanting to deal with NY because of the bitlicense that is required to be here.There are 30+ exchanges that have it and obviously it can be done and done profitably it's just that for some reason places don't want to open their books and put in the effort.-Dave",

BTC goes back to $50k It's 4+% goes to $100K even more for what I spend now.Even if BTC hits $75k and then goes to $100k it's still more then 2%.If I use some other card that is a straight cash back (or points or whatever) it's that value and that's it.So I my mind, it's for cryptp users who are pro crypto and think it's value is going to climb.-Dave",

Unfortunately, the Gemini Credit Card will not be available outside of the U.S.So for now it's US only.At a guess, it's going to be like the Coinbase card. Limited to who can get it at 1st based on where you live and then add on more countries and parts of the world.Very few banks issue cards world wide and just about none of them are crypto friendly. So they will probably wind up with a bunch of different banks depending on where you are.-Dave",

If you are spending very large amounts on your credit card, for business or other purposes, I would strongly advise to keep things as simple as possible. I don't see the IRS doing much to go after someone who they believe wrongly understated the cost basis of a purchase by $30, but they very well may go after someone they believe understated the cost basis of an investment by tens of thousands of dollars. Getting advice on how to handle receiving bitcoin via the Gemini card would be expensive, and if the IRS were to challenge a particular tax strategy, the cost to defend yourself would likely exceed the value of what you received as a reward.",

Just more of a datapoint then anything else. As you said cobranded CCs have been around for many years with many different banks and institutions backing them. Sometimes it's more obvious then others. And some people although they might be interested in a particular card will not want to deal with a particular bank / financial institution for some reason. OT a bit but I noticed an interesting thing. The extra cash back % is based on the code that is attached to the venue. It's part of the information transmitted to the CC company so they know they you are in a restaurant or home improvement store or whatever. If you read the fine print that comes with card documentation it's stated that if whatever establishment does not send the proper code you may get less cash back because the restaurant may not be sending as a restaurant but a \"gourmet food store\" or some such thing. THIS card is a bit more liberal in what they give the restaurant cash back on giving the higher cash back on some places that other cards (Discover / CiTi / Cap1) DO not classify as restaurants. Is Ralph's Italian Ices really a restaurant is a discussion for another thread but I did find it interesting that Gemini / WebBank thinks it is but the other above 3 do not. And since it's still so hot out I will be verifying this a few more times over the coming days to make sure it does not change :-)Although I do think the metal card is cool I have now found there are some places that the card slide on the CC machine too thin for it to fit. Would have thought that something like that was an industry standard. -Dave",
