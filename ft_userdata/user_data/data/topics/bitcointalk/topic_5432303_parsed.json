      "body": "The moment you dream of a new chart every week it's probably the moment when you need to tell yourself to take a break and enjoy the holidays.  Overthinking daily stuff so much that you end up dreaming of them is a sign of real stress, and it's not a joking matter.Anyhow, I find it quite interesting that between your two predictions the price moved exactly $11, you don't get this kind of occurrence, which basically tells you that nothing really happens only on expectations.Quote from: fennic on December 22, 2022, 04:38:53 PMQuote from: fennic on December 29, 2022, 05:02:13 PMi'm xpecting more dump in coming days, on 25th we can se volitility to grab lp to hit SL,Ok, here you got me totally confused, what are you expecting on the 25th, since today is the 29th?PS.Move this to speculation!",

      "body": "Technical analysis (or drawing lines on charts!) rarely works for bitcoin market and at this point that little chance of it working is already gone because the market behavior is not something that can be predicted. Not based on history. Not even based on current event.The world economy is already too unpredictable and the US and EU economy are both a terrible mess with one crisis after the other. That has a significant effect on bitcoin market causing uncertainty that leads to illogical behavior.This is why you can not expect anything! The economy has to calm down first and they should stop manipulating it and the interest rates before we can start speculating about bitcoin.",

      "body": "This drawing of lines reminds me of some things that we often see in some movies, only that the lines are made of powder, which is very expensive, but supposedly helps some people to see things in a much nicer light Honestly, all that line drawing never made much sense to me, although I don't completely reject TA as a tool that can sometimes be of help in certain situations. It's good that the OP understood that we are in a bear market, and that in such a market one should always expect some new and perhaps unpleasant surprises.For those who cannot stop drawing lines, I suggest new pills that certainly help",

So I draw some charts and looking at it according to me there could be still More dump in coming days, my mean in Q1 2023. Despite the charts, there could be indeed more dumps at the beginning of 2023. To make analyzes simpler, I prefer to take only most recent resistance and support levels values in consideration. At this moment the scenario should be considered relatively positive for bitcoin, because we left a support level of 15,700$ behind in November to reach a new support level of 16,400$ right now. It's an inoffensive advancement that must be followed on the next days and weeks, so we can conclude if it's a solid tendency or if it's just a temporary stability proportionated by the Holiday Season to be reverted as soon as the New Year comes in.",

If you look at the chart you will see that the price of Bitcoin is at $19,000. This is a bear market.It's not a bear market but it's a bear market? What does that supposed to mean? The current market isn't in a bearish state, we are actually in the middle. The price did well when the year started until 3 months, but then it stopped, started dropping a little bit and now it's a bit stable in the middle. If we see the monthly candles, the price isn't bad.If it goes further down from this point, it might enter the bear market once again but if it manages to gain value again and more buying pressure builds up, we will be entering a bull market soon after that as it seems.",
