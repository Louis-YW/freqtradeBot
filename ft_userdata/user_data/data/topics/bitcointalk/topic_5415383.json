  "content": "Hi guys,The situation:B = the balance of wallet. The wallet's sync is at least 1 year more \"new\" than the last transaction, so it should be a real balance.L = the sum of balances of labeled addresses, checked on blockchain. Labeled addresses are those I ever received btc to, and those which are visible in the wallet.C = the sum of balances of change addresses.Should be L + C = BBut in this case L + C = 0.98 B (98% of the balance of wallet)2% of balance are somewhere else.But where? Do you have any ideas?",

      "body": "You have probably missed an address when checking their balance on a block explorer and did a mistake in your calculation. That's the only thing comes to my mind. Without any information about your addresses and your transactions, it's impossible to say what's exactly causing the difference.",

As you said that your wallet is synced up to 1 year after your last transaction, I doubt any of your reserve addresses have been funded.",
