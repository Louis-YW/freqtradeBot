Recently, many users are scammed by Pepe Airdrop links. Crypto Buyers should simply follow a rule that any DM or free offering is a Scam unless you are really sure that the person is an official in the community.",

Specifically on cryptocurrency, many KOL does not even bother researching what they are advertising. This is a big red flag because cryptocurrencies especially altcoins are filled with a scam. They just get the money while their follower gets rugged. It could not get worse on Twitter, it has been known that many scammers are exists on Twitter and they have deceived many people. One should stay away from an unknown person that lures you to do something that is cryptocurrencies-related.",

Its really terrible to see that there are so many people fall on scams there so hopefully they learn their lesson for incident happen to them.",

So your biggest mistake was to connect your personal wallet with the scammer's smart contract address and thereby exposing your wallet security, this is a known scam for a long so you have to learn from this.",

I would guess that his twitter account was hacked by someone and then this guy posted this malicious link that drained your wallets. I doubt that a influencer that has a high number of followers already would throw away all of this for a scam like that.Those influencers usually don't need to do scams like that. They are earning enough money by getting cheap tokens in the seed or private sale and then they shill it to their followers, which is also kinda scammy. In generall i would not trust that influencers to much, they are all just using their followers to grow their own bag.",

Many projects that are deemed promising even with a verified Twitter account do NOT guarantee that they will pay off. Make this a lesson that to always be careful about links that are spread only to promise big profits. For beginners this is like an opportunity but for those who already know the act of blocking an account is a good choice. Do not easily believe and must always check all channels so that information is not swallowed up.",

This is one of the risks of the cryptocurrency market, making investing a difficult challenge for both new and experienced investors. To avoid scams, you should always connect your wallet via a secure intermediary, such as the project's official website or in a trusted crypto wallet app, avoiding connecting your wallet to your wallet. themselves through untrusted or untrusted links. Not only twitter, but most social networks, forums, news channels,... are places of criminal activity.Furthermore, before investing in any cryptocurrency, you should thoroughly understand the project, its development team, and its community. Make sure you only invest in cryptocurrencies that have sustainable development and future potential. Finally, always be vigilant and prudent in your investments and avoid investing too much in a single project to minimize risk.",

The era of technology development, social networks are also a place filled with negative information, and the problem that I think users easily access and trust is always safe and reliable information very dangerous. Always be on the lookout for attractive offers about opportunities, because it's really not easy if we don't make efforts to learn to understand, through the story from OP I also want to remind new and interested people If you are looking for opportunities from crypto, always learn more about the skills to use and experience, everything is never easy if you lack knowledge with it.",
