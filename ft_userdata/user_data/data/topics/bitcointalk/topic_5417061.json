There is not supposed to be a consensus on a particular issue, as many people may change their views based on economic, financial, political reasons, fame and others. Therefore, even if most of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin, you will find some criticizing it.If these people mention technical information or economic analysis why the coin is ‚Äúdirty‚Äù and expensive or why ‚ÄúI will never buy BTC‚Äù then the discussion will be substantive.",

It's much better that we're seeing people who have bashed bitcoin and then eventually became one of us and started to buy and not just for themselves but for the company that they own.It can also be a strategy for them to give fear to the market so that there will be a massive sell out for which will be used by them as an opportunity to buy more.",

In fact these synthetic derivatives were one of the prime reasons of the 2008 crash as well. I feel one shouldn't feel bad with such comments as these people will obviously benefit from any harm which happens to bitcoin. They will curse bitcoin and later their banks will start providing bitcoin in the portfolio of their clients.",

Dimon has said that he ‚Äúpersonally think that bitcoin is worthless,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/26/jamie-dimons-jpmorgan-says-bitcoin-has-significant-upside-now.htmlJamie says one thing and does another. People should learn that what these people write on social media is usually the exact opposite of what they're doing. Remember when Elon was posting laser eyes? Just weeks later he was dumping his coins and denying it, claiming that Tesla only planned to sell 10% to \"test liquidity\". This was such a bullshit claim because a few months later they really \"tested the liquidity\" by dumping everything on spot exchange in a single move to crash the price. also this:JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon thinks it‚Äôs stupid that his daughter is trading in bitcoins, but says that bitcoins can reach $ 100,000https://www.brytfmonline.com/jp-morgan-boss-jamie-dimon-thinks-its-stupid-that-his-daughter-is-trading-in-bitcoins-but-says-that-bitcoins-can-reach-100000/",

Bitcoin is indeed already immune with this one, the market is not affected anymore because many already know the real value of Bitcoin, and this is for the best so better not to listen to any fud and just look at the fact.",

Think about it this way, Jamie Dimon is the ceo of a company that deals with fiat investments, unless JP Morgan suddenly starts their own exchange, or outright buys binance or another high level exchange, any investment that goes to crypto means less money available to invest into JP Morgan. This means he has to dislike it. And when the time comes and they go into anything crypto related, suddenly \"we found why it's good!!\" and they love it. That's always like that, if they can't profit from it, and even lose because of it, it's bad, if they can earn from it, suddenly it becomes very good.",

That's a normal statement from a guy who actually owns a bank, JP Morgan might be the last bank to adopt crypto because of this statement and that's ok because we have many options aside from this. Those are traditional people, they believe more on fiat money and stocks, they are against crypto simply because it's against their business but that doesn't stop this market from growing, Bitcoin become more powerful in the future, banks should already know this.",

That could explain similarity in their comments.Or it could be the coke versus pepsi ethos of business rivals not wanting to acknowledge strengths of their competing brand.Over the last century our banking institutions have closely resembled twitter in their lack of rolling out new features and innovations. Twitter developers love to parade an edit button as their cutting edge next generation technology which might \"someday\" be available. To a degree banks do the same with CBDC and blockchain. What type of person is the leader of these trends? People like Jamie Dimon apparently.",
