It is indeed peculiar to observe that they have overtaken Kazakhstan in terms of mining operations and are even competing with United States  to secure the top spot. I must say that Russia still requires a significant amount of energy over 3 gigawatts to be precise to get close to the almost 4 gigawatts of energy put into mining by the United States. Russia has the potential to reach top spot in the mining if they utilize their huge land mass properly by installing renewable energy systems, they can easily surpass other countries in mining operations by 2025.Quote from: DaveF on April 10, 2023, 11:56:14 AMPower does not matter vs hashrate.If you are using 1 gigawat of power to mine with 3 generation old equipment it's meaningless. Someone with 1/4 the power could out mine them.Hashrate and pool info (and I guess what they are mining) is what matters.They could be burning all that power to mine ETC since they got all the ETH miners cheap.....-DaveI agree with you that power is not as important as hashrate in mining operations. Older mining equipment's are not energy efficient and can't produce the same hashrates as modern equipment's. The new generation miners are designed to use less energy while achieving higher hashrates.It is also important to note that what if Russia is using the latest generation of mining equipment's? It can utilize its huge land mass by installing solar panels to add even more power to its operations. It is worth noting that China is favoring Russia and most of the mining tech is manufactured in China. By keeping that in mind I can say that Russia has upper hand in this regard and it could surpass United States in mining operations if things go in its favor.",

      "body": "Even if we only consider the gigawatts of energy, Russia is still far to be close to The USA (4 GW vs 1 GW)Russia being under sanctions, almost no foreign company will deal with.What about this rather, added with the higher taxes for miners, and the Ecology's terrorists...1) Electricity's priceLike many countries, it is as a result of the war. But it's something that will end sooner or later, and so it will return back to normal.2) Higher taxes for miners, and the Ecology's terroristsI'm refering to the paragraph belowQuoteThe Treasury Department’s “Greenbook” published in March argues that the growth of digital asset mining has a negative environmental impact. It can also increase energy prices. The move makes it clear that the tax is intended to curtail the growth of crypto mining. the document adds that “an excise tax on electricity usage by digital asset miners could reduce mining activity along with its associated environmental impacts and other harms.”Reality:The United States is a resource-rich country with abundant renewable energy resources. The amount available is 100 times that of the nation’s annual electricity need.Statistics:In 2021, renewable energy sources accounted for about 12.4% of total U.S. primary energy consumption. Renewable energy sources accounted for about 19.8% of total utility-scale electricity generation.And that was in 2021 (I haven't looked deep to get fresh data). In 2023, it's surely higher, since almost all countries are jumping in the renewable energy wagon, pushed by the terrorists of ecology...Statistics about bitcoin mining:According to the Bitcoin Mining Council's 2022 report, 59.5% of the total bitcoin mining global energy comes from renewable sourcesSo the taxes incrase has hardly any leverage. In exemple, Riot Blockchain use 100% renewable energy.And the crypto mining companies are perhaps the first ones to accelerate the transition to a neutral carbon energy in their country. And if not, they just buy carbon offsets....So at end, the mainly reason is the electricity's price, which as I said will come back.",

      "body": "Delayed by the war no doubt. But the situation may change at any moment. They were clearly aiming to put a leash to all mining operations before the conflict. Kazakhstan was rising after the China ban, until the State started imposing restrictions, people protested and Russia sent troops to end the protests...Cheaper is not always better. My country is less than half a cent (0.004) but so insecure you just can't risk investing anything as people lose their assets left and right from State intervention or criminality (or both). There was a certain hosting trying to bring investors, just pay 4 cents (so they net 10x) but guess what. State imprisoned the guy in charge of the institution in charge of regulating \"crypto currencies\". All mining was ordered to stop, at least half a year the investigations may take. That institution appears to be dismantled, the lower ranking officials fired, so who knows what new restrictions/institution they will come up with next (or outright ban).Those who risked their money for the 4¢ hosting, now must face an unknown amount of downtime losses, and it can be worse, they may decide to confiscate the miners if they find that hosting was \"too close\" to the previous institution (and if you weren't \"close\", you would not be given the permits in the first place).This is the hidden cost of high risk countries. Sure, Russia has more rich oligarchs, but even them may end up fleeing (remember how Telegram was created).",

This business is developed by old enthusiasts. It's good that this business is not taxed, or the miners have a chance to pay the minimum tax, because there are no control possibilities.",

Thanks to this idea of engineers from the Soviet Union in Russia, there are no problems with electricity in large cities that are connected in this system.But it is very very difficult to connect 10MW now. Factories consume 2-3 MW, and it is difficult to agree on such possibilities.Usually miners use 0.4MW transformers that are used for private summer cottages, camp sites and similar objects.",

These are businessmen who have experience in IT, engineers and people with a technical mindset. Investing in mining requires a lot of initial capital, and young people do not have such opportunities.
