You've already mentioned that it's a high risk which seems like you gamble your money in staking, especially microcap coins, which can be highly risky.  It's important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.  Not asking here in the forum.The comment above was right, buy Bitcoin or Dogecoin and hold it for a long run with your desire profit, that's a wise decision than staking which you didn't have control over your coin.",

The market being manipulative by influencers, holding it for long term is the wise choice. Dogecoin being predicted to get its use case on Twitter. Maybe such things might be under development and unexpected launch could boost the price.Dogecoin is one among the best to invest among the low price altcoins. Also for users who have the ability to hold, it assure with good return. This is just my belief and not a suggestion on investment.",

There's no risk if you accumulating DOGE/BTC and transfer it to your hardware walllet, while the one e.g. you trying to find a shitcoin to stake to accumulate more DOGE/BTC but you will need to accept higher risk of losing money.Who wins? people who have better jobs and hold their coins on hardware wallet.",

      "body": "Rather than staking coins to earn Bitcoins, i'd just outrightly buy Bitcoins and hodl them myself; staking rewards always seems attractive to validators, but sometimes they forget the risks involved in it, for someone who buys Bitcoin and hodls it, they'll have to only be concerned about the volatility risk (which isn't really a risk per se), but Bitcoin is a long term sustainable project, thus if the investor is in for the long term, they'll definitely accrue ROI.Having said that, whilst staking altcoins to earn BTC is far more risky because you have to bear the risks associated with the altcoin you want to stake, risks such as a complete failure of the coin, excessive volatility and maybe even liquidity issues. You'd also have to bear the risks of the staking platform, either a centralized exchange/DeFi platform, any of them can stop operation at anytime. You'd then have to bear the normal risks of the coin(s) you want to earn through staking. The risks of staking far outweighs just buying the coins outrightly.",

I don't know such but you're aware that most of those that will give you decent profits for staking are also high in risk. Usually in staking, those that will give you profit in bitcoin upon staking, they're from centralized platforms. I don't do this but I think most people are doing it in platforms as I've mentioned which are centralized like Binance.Quote from: paramind22 on February 21, 2023, 01:55:46 AMMicrocaps are for the birds, though, I should have said Midcap, like Tron, etc.  -- stuff at stakingrewards.comWell, there you go, check anything that's listed there.",

Staking micro-cap coins is almost a waste of time. There are several reasons for this. First, such coins often change staking terms because they don't have as much liquidity for all stakers, and second, such coins very often drop in value and staking doesn't generate any income because the price has become much lower than it was at the time of staking. Only staking projects that have great liquidity in the market and good fundamentals should be stacked.",

Pretty much similar buy so called Decentralized Finance coin and stake it to earn huge amount yield platform, but most of the coins become worthless.",

However, people who invested into just bitcoin and ethereum made a ton more money on average than the people who invested into microcap shitcoins. Sure there are some people who made 100x from them as well, a few, not a lot, but when you calculate the fact that tens of thousands of people lost all their money on many microcaps, it shows you that it's not a good idea at all, and could cause you to lose more than someone who invested into bitcoin.The risk that you take is just not worth it, would you risk a million dollars for a 1% chance to make a dollar? No? Then this doesn't worth it neither.",
