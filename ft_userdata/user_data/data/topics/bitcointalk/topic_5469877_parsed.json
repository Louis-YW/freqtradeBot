Shill services are spreading false enthusiasm that is actually considered unethical by most people.You are right, the shilling of some platform or newly launched coin/token always disturbs the analysis of an investor, especially of a newbie investor. Because most of the venture capitalists already in deal with those projects, as their work is just to throw money into the liquidity pools to build trust among other investors. And after that, they start shilling the platform. The more hype means more discussions and more investors and the chances of rug pull are also more. The chance of manipulation of the price of some tokens also increases due to the shilling.I was a bounty hunter here on BTT, and I saw the rise of many platforms from scratch and how they rug pulled after getting investments, either I joined those bounties or now (as I do have to keep an eye on good projects). Of course, my intentions are not with them but against such immoral work. I am not criticizing anyone here (even the OP) because to some extent it (the services) can be used for good purposes.",

Shill marketing is the act of using a shill to try and convince the public that a product is worth buying. Sometimes illegal, this practice is usually considered dishonest. If customers find out that they have been targeted with shill marketing, they often feel cheated.https://www.smartcapitalmind.com/what-is-shill-marketing.htm?expand_article=1Investors will feel cheated if they find out that they invest on projects that uses shill marketing, shill marketing involves manipulation to entice investors to invest on projects, yes shilling is also a form of advertising but its a deceptive form of marketing and the community shuns projects that uses shill marketing.We have seen this on many projects that turn out to be scam, only dubious projects will hire the service of shills to market their platform.",

This is nothing but a service which provides inorganic, or outright fake, boosts, likes, shares, comments, retweets, upvotes, votes, and so forth. This service might even include spamming. The goal is simply to be trending. That doesn't necessarily translate to investment. Neither is it a confirmation that a project isn't scam. But, yeah, many crypto projects used this kind of service. And such is the reason why social media is already pestered with scam crypto projects and products. As a result, only those who were born yesterday will fall victim to it. And platforms such as CMC, online crypto publications, rating sites, and so on all look scammers now.  And you also missed this forum.",

      "body": "I refer to all questions in the following response. You have to remember that everything can be done honestly and professionally, that's how we work, \"shilling or chatters\". \"shill team\" is just a nomenclature in crypto marketing, and this is why we use it.We simply talk about facts, listings on exchanges, important dates, updates, announcements, new functionalities, and helping people in client main chats and SM accounts understand their products' better. There are many customers that need such services, and we also always repeat to DYOR and only work on projects that we carefully check beforehand.Personally, I don't like to call us \"shill team\", \"shillers\", \"shill\" so from the start, we called us \"Influencers Team\" or \"Influencers services  and members of the team we call simply \"workers\" because what we do is totally different from simple shilling as everybody understands it.There was a problem when we used \"Influencers team\" instead of \"shill team\" in our marketing materials because customers simply didn't understand what we were offering. They thought about influencers with big SM accounts and following, but this is not what we offer.Because of that, there is no other way as to use that nomenclature and call us simply \"shill team\" or \"shillers\" despite the fact that it is wrong and there should be some new name created. Recently,  there have been so-called \"chatters\" and this reflects the meaning of our work much better, although still not completely.Everybody knows what we do, and there is no need to explain that we are not offering something different (like mentioned \"Influencers team or services\") if we simply use \"shill team\" in our offers, and this is why we use it. What and how we do it has nothing to do with straight \"shilling\" which in fact is nothing else as attracting new investors to worthless projects whose only goal is to sell as much worthless cryptocurrency as possible from the project using fake information in order to then make an exit or any other scam, take the money, and run away.This is why we always first check all clients before we agree to work with them. A project needs to be solid, and we already refused to work with many that later indeed turned out to be scams. Here, I need to add that many of them are very hard to decipher at the launch stage because are well prepared. Still,  many years of constant work give us a lot of experience and expertise, so we are able to see red flags that are not visible to others.When it comes to the 400 clients we have worked with, it is not only shiil teams, but also translations, SM boosting, articles writing, publications in biggest media outlets, promotions (even here on BTT), designs, groups moderation - this is the sum of clients that has passed through Emoneymax.net to this day.Quote from: joniboini on October 11, 2023, 12:46:11 AMYou don't even tell us your full team. It is hard to trust a service that has no prior history or track record of its members. It's crypto, and we are all anonymous, but see this profile: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=131333. You have all links in there. I'm Max, and Wwzsocki is Emoneyabc; together we run Emoneymax.net. I think his profile tells a lot. Look at his trust, activity, position, or number of merits.Quote from: robelneo on October 10, 2023, 10:35:14 PMYou do research about the projects that you're promoting but you missed the essence and the true meaning of shill marketing Back to \"shill\". We would like you to know that we do much more than just advertising projects by talking to people and making hype. We all in one.We offer comprehensive solutions. Our people are good writers who deliver excellent articles about projects; we do custom-made graphics, gifs, and videos. We have people who work as moderators. We work with people from all over the world, so we could work in any language; we do translations.During our time in crypto, we not only gained know-how but also gained a lot of connections with different people. We cooperate with good influencers and media and can give our clients competitive prices for their services.We also have evidence that what we do simply works, because, for example, on Twitter, our comments receive hundreds of views immediately after publication, likes, RTs, same with Telegram, Discord, Reddit and Quora where our writers publish new articles every day on which our team comments. We don't spam anyone and use techniques developed by us during cooperation with many projects. Our clients are very satisfied, and usually the next ones come by recommendation, which proves the quality of our work.I've started this thread because I knew that it would encounter such reactions, and that is why, using the example of emoneymax.net, I want to discuss and explain that you need to check everything first, ask questions, and not take words literally, especially in offers, because crypto is specific and many names are new, often invented by the community, and do not always reflect the facts exactly as they are.",

They know that it will be advertising on some social media of choice.So once again, EmoneyMax.net is a regular marketing agency that offers many different advertising services. We have the highest quality standards and developed special strategies that we have tweaked for a very long time. Today,  everything works perfectly and brings a lot of organic traffic from the websites we work on.Somebody has written that \"shilling services\" always mean one thing: that they are low quality and dominated by bots, and this is exactly why we did everything totally differently from the start and chose to provide only HQ services, work with real humans, and do so in real time, usually 24/7.To deliver that, we came up with some rules, Emoneymax.net standards, when it comes to \"shilling services\", Here are they:- we are the only shill service that deliver full proof of work (we create special work group where we post all what we do with links and screens in real time), - all what is moderated in first 24 hours we repost again, - we assign 4 quality managers that work 24/7 in 8 persons team (us included me and Max), so we watch and moderate our teams in real time, later after 12/24h QM's check again if something is not moderated/removed, we deliver 100% as agreed, all comments, articles, daily posts are fully visible and receive multiple views) - we see Twitter comments with hundreds of views seconds after publishing, we mastered some tricks how to engage with people to get as much  traffic possible- we can post any narrative on any website (special signs, links, hashtags, mentions, etc included), and we can change that in real time, - we can support any discussion, link, Tweet, article, - always work 24/7 and provide real time support- real people no bots,  - no copy pasting, - only original Highest Quality content- we can change. adjust anything client wants in real time (change narrative, support any comment, post in main project groups/accounts, hype community, spread the word)- we can target influencers, post HQ articles all of this is included in our work (we gathered big lists with all most wanted crypto niche influencers, servers, boards, groups, chats, etc)- social media boosting (likes, RT, shares, views, followers)- and a lot more...All our services are here at emoneymax.net, but if someone has more questions about how we work, we can talk.",
