To buy bitcoin is easy and secured both the buyer and the seller don't even see each other which is a safe method. During inflation fiat currency becomes scarce but Bitcoin can not be scarceNot everyone has the awareness of Bitcoin concept,this makes some people feel that gold is more valuable than Bitcoin. Payment of goods and services across boarders can only be achieved with Bitcoin because of it decentralized system. In the next 30yrs. I guess Bitcoin will solve so many problems in the economy sector.",

Decentralized exchanged don't require KYC. Face-to-face meetings also. Mining also has no KYC. But if we switch our focus to centralized exchanges, OTC trading, or certain investment platforms, it becomes harder to avoid KYC. Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on November 03, 2022, 11:05:11 AM3. Digital and sucured form of asset and currency Depends on each person and the way they handle the keys that secures their coins. On a protocol-level, it can be highly secure. In reality, it depends on the knowledge of skillset of the bitcoin owner. Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on November 03, 2022, 11:05:11 AM4. High profitability with less risk Bitcoin, just like the whole crypto market is very volatile. Investing in bitcoin has proven to be a profitable investment long-term. But in the short-term that is not always the case. And there is risk involved in all investments, especially the volatile ones. Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on November 03, 2022, 11:05:11 AM5. No inflation tolerance or price manipulation Bitcoin is susceptible to market manipulation and big whales and bag holders can steer the price in their favored direction. If you add media influence and policy changes to the mix, you get a pretty dangerous combination. No inflation tolerance, really? Should we look at the charts for the last 3 months? The one for the last 6 months isn't better either.",

They are the backbone of bitcoin and because of them bitcoin is the strongest cryptocurrency in the market if we look at its demand and supply.

Mostly technical education. To use bitcoin as a decentralized, private, peer-to-peer, instant, cheap cash system, you need to setup a Linux computer, install a Bitcoin client, install a Lightning client, put some money on the latter, leave the computer running all day etc. etc. etc., so even if possible, it kinda requires some good hours to comprehend the important parts. And yeah. People don't have time. Their responsibilities asides. I don't doubt there will be more educated user base in the future, though.",

But most people are hold their coins on centralized exchanges which kill the purpose of Bitcoin, the exchange aka third parties has a control over their coins and they will ask the user KYC since it's their rules.Number 4, Actually Bitcoin has a high risk since there's no guarantee the price will always increase when 4 year cycle happen, it's just a story.",

If you compare bitcoin to altcoins this statement seems absolutely true but if you compare bitcoin to gold and fiat it is only 1/2 true, bitcoin offers high return and very high risk compared to gold and fiat, the higher the return the higher the risk, this is inseparable.5. This statement is only partially true, Bitcoin has also been affected by inflation but not really too much and it is doing better than other assets like fiat which continues to depreciate relentlessly. But in my opinion, bitcoin is the most manipulated asset, even though it is decentralized it still suffers from price manipulation.",

Yeah, I think it's base on individual preferences, majority of us here doesn't want to complicate things, so either we just buy on CEX nad left it there (although this is a bad practice), or just HODL on a wallet that we have total control of private keys and mnemonic phrases.As for bitcoin being the preferred choice, it's easy, the gold standard of crypto, the top one, and the prime mover.And for those who have at least seen a full cycle, we know how big it's going to be, and the potential profit that we are going to make resulting in economic freedom.",

Scarcity of gold is actually debatable because it's very possible that there are huge gold deposits somewhere that we just haven't discovered yet or are about to discover. As for divisibility, I'd say gold is divisible enough, so not having a tick there isn't very fair. And regarding established history, first fiat appeared during the Middle Ages, so it also has quite a big established history, I'd say. Moreover, the criteria we choose matter as well. If we chose something as relative stability, gold and fiat would tick, but Bitcoin wouldn't because it's usually more volatile. Also, we should ask for what Bitcoin is most preferred choice. For savings, for payments, for returns on an investment?",
