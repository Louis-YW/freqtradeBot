It is still picking up the characters you're typing and you can even backspace-delete characters if you notice you mistyped.As far as I know, there's no way to install the Homebrew package manager without root.But if your goal was to install Bitcoin Core, I'd recommend pulling the source through git (like you've done) and building it locally, anyway.",

Because pip isn't install anything for me on my mac command terminalAll of your questions can be answered through simple web searches.brew: OS Package manager.apt: OS Package manager.pip: Python package manager.sudo: Execute command as superuser / root.git: Version control system / VCS.And how to enter your password on the command line is what I've answered in the very first reply. Was something unclear about that?One more clarification: Installing Homebrew requires root; using it after it's installed does not.https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/master/install.sh#L220So you're looking at installing Homebrew through sudo /bin/bash -c ... and then using it afterwards simply with brew install ....",
