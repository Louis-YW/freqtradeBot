I don't have any news on those coins, even with their updates, they have been very quiet since the pandemic times have passed until the covid has been lifted. Or maybe I'm the only one who hasn't been updated, maybe vetchain and Neo can somehow pump there, because during the bull run they somehow pumped their values in the market as far as I know during those times, I just don't know if it happens again. Why are there any holds on these coins you mentioned?",

      "body": "Hong Kong lifting the ban on cryptocurrencies could create a positive impact on the crypto market, especially with mentioned coins like FIL, VET, NEO and CFX. However, I would like to emphasize that investing in cryptocurrencies is a high-risk action and should be done after full research and thorough evaluation. While these cryptocurrencies have short-term upside potential, the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and the market can change unexpectedly. Moreover, investing in cryptocurrencies also has security risks, so investors need to consider and evaluate carefully before making an investment decision. In conclusion, the lifting of the ban on cryptocurrencies by Hong Kong can make a positive impact on the market and digital currencies such as FIL, VET, NEO and CFX may increase in price, however, investment Investing in cryptocurrency should be done after full research and thorough evaluation.",

What's the basis for this?Is China already allowed cryptocurrency and consider this as legal? I'm not updated with their policies anymore since they always change their decision. Anyway, if there's a good update from this Chinese tokens and there's a good demand from them, most probably they will rise again. To be more safe, deal with the top coins instead they are still reliable and can be more profitable.",

If the Hong Kong government succeeds in lifting the ban, this will create greater confidence among investors and experts in the crypto community. This trust could lead to an increase in crypto business activities in Hong Kong, creating a significant recovery for the crypto market. In the opposite case, if Hong Kong decides to keep the ban in place, this could lead to a significant drop in the price of the crypto market, as investors are concerned about the risks and warnings from the Hong Kong government. In conclusion, the news of the lifting of the ban on cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong will have a strong impact on the crypto market and the value of various cryptocurrencies.",

So far i have not seen a chinese coin that completely took off yet. I still remember back in 2017 when NEO was introduced, which is a chinese project if i remember correctly, a lot of people were saying that this will be the next big thing and some kind of chinese Ethereum. It even managed to get into the top 10 in terms of market cap if i am not wrong. At the moment it is ranked on position 60 at coinmarketcap which is still good but of course nowhere near the top 10 anymore.In general i think that a great chinese project that offers something new and that is also introduced and marketed well has huge potential because the potential chinese user-base is just so huge.",

It seems to me that by June, i.e. the third quarter, Chinese projects can get pumped up, which is already noticeable. You did not mention the Ontology project, it is also getting well pumped. But I think that once the law enters into force, we will be in the red again. All in all, I think the bulls will be there until June. Then the bears will be back again.",

NEO is just been overhyped, the project keeps getting mentioned as a potential top coin to invest in for the last two bull market yet nothing has happened. The coin has just be underperforming and I don't think this bull market will be different.Instead of investing in NEO I'll invest in GAS, which is the token you get for holding NEO. I don't know if that still happens but when I invested in this project last 4 years I remember I could claim GAS and sell on exchanges.I didn't see BNB on the list, that's a big project in Asia and they always pump it. It'll put my bet on BNB to be more successful than those tokens you listed. Don't think because BNB is already worth hundreds of dollars that it can't pump.",
