The most cheap and secure alternative is to buy a ~5$/mo VPS from a top-tier provider like OVH or Hetzner (that include DDoS protection) to use it as a reverse-proxy along with a Let's Encrypt certificate. That's how some privacy-oriented projects avoid using Cloudflare while keeping their clearnet resources operational and protected.Also, currently Cloudflare ruins UX on Bitcointalk for users like me a lot, since mostly Cloudflare keeps me stuck at the \"Just a moment...\" page for around 5-10 minutes before I can access the forum.",

This code makes sure that you will never receive any of the previous coins you have added to our reserves in any subsequent transactions you make with Bitmixer. In other words this ensures that you remain untraceable.Day 1: I mixed U$100 worth of bitcoins and received a Bitmixer code so that when I mix subsequent coins I won't received what I previously mixed back. Fine!48 Hours Later: I mixed another U$100 worth of bitcoins and received bitcoins back which none were of what I've mixed two days prior. Fine!36 Hours Later: I mixed another U$100 worth of bitcoins and received bitcoins back which none were of what I've mixed two transactions prior. Fine!Question: How were the last two transactions achieved given the following? ...http://themerkle.com/news/interview-with-the-owner-of-bitmixer-io-a-high-volume-bitcoin-mixer/QuoteOur servers are located in a country where US authorities can’t get access to the server without a local court order. Bitcoin is not considered as money here, so we can’t be a money-laundering service. We use encrypted disks. We delete all order data after 24 hours. We completely erase old bitcoin addresses from our wallet after coins are sent out. Even if the server is seized, they will find nothing.Clearly, my Bitmixer code remains on file attached to bitcoin wallet addresses I've previously used, else there would be a strong possibility of me receiving some of the coins back that I may not want attached to me, but that would be an impossibility given that ALL order data is purged from your system within 24 hours, as stated above, resulting in the 3-LAs et al. finding nothing.Further, I'll be paying you a fee to mix coins stemming from a nefarious act with the strong possibility that I'll be receiving coins stemming from a nefarious act tens of times worst than what I'm tryin' to hide. Surely, wouldn't that bring the feds to my door a knockin' a helluva lot quicker? It'll be pretty embarrassing for me to defend myself if accused of running a underage goat brothel when in fact I ONLY pimp out adult chickens and occasionally a matured goose (soon to pimp ducks - drakes and hens).Humor aside, I look forward to your reply, devs.The question wasn't answered, but 3 weeks later the largest mixer quit, followed by some sarcasm.What's your explanation?",

So primarily by logs I mean information that could compromise user's identity or reveal the connection between his transactions before and after using mixer. Mixing code cannot do that. Also, the mixer address (to which the user sends his btc) is marked by Mixing code until this address is either used or the amount on it is mixed with others to insignificant proportion. And finally, as soon as mixer address is spent - all info about it is deleted, so after quite short time there is absolutely no data left about user's request.",
