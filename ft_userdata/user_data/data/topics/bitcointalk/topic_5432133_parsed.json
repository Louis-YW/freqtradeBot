Since it concerns the security of the account, I would prefer pm for the coaching for clarity. Security is everyone business, it is not a personal or individual business. Together we save lives, properties and accounts. Securing our accounts belong to everyone, but keep your keys away from people. Be your brothers and  sisters keeper.Security is everybody's business.",

Just read through it slowly and patiently various times. It's not trivial, but doable with a bit of patience.What wallet are you using? It needs to be one where you are in control of the private keys, and that allows you to sign a message from.",

Everything is just vacuum.I really appreciate your concern love.You can install and use a bitcoin wallet even if you don't own bitcoins.The point is that if you have a wallet (a proper one) then you can use (the private key of) one of your addresses from your wallet in order to sign a message. A good wallet can do that for you easily, with little interaction.That's why the question was what wallet you use: because the way of signing a message may differ a bit from wallet to wallet.",

When you eventually do though, for privacy reasons, you may want to consider signing from an address you are not going to use to send/receive bitcoins on. I’ve seen lots of addresses in the stake thread that have a balance and history of TXs, and I’m pretty sure that it’s better to avoid that.Your initial priorities should likely reside in reading on bitcoin itself, determining how to obtain it, how to perform self-custody, deciding on the wallet to use, determining the entailed safety measures and so forth.",
