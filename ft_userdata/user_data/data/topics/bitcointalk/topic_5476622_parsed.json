  "content": "I have had a constant trouble with a particular POS terminal in my locality. It started with me going to make a withdrawal on the first instance, but was debited and had to go lay complain in the bank just for the money to be reversed. It took several visit for the cash to be reversed and of recent again, same issue happened. This time instead, I opted to transfer the funds to the POS point account address rather than use my bank card. To my amazement still, the transaction didn't get confirmation but I was debited. When I went there, everyone starts talking about the network being responsible for such issues, but I insist and still do, that the POS terminal is faulty and needs to be upgraded to the new ones instead of having same issues everytime. My question is as plain as the heading, and that's, is the POS terminal faulty or should I believe the assumption that this issues I have had with same terminal on more than one occasion is resulting from network providers?What are your thoughts?",

And I have also seen a pos attendant checking network from banks before allowing card withdrawal or transfer from bank because, if you transact with them within this period, you'll be receiving a debit without confirmation from their terminal. So 70% of my believe is that the fault is from your bank while 30 on the pos terminal because faults from pos are mostly card rejection.",

And you no go blame the op for using transfer, after all with wattin em write e show say na the first time e dey try to use transfer for that pos. Normally the fault fit be from em bank, na one of the reasons why I hate banks be that, especially this Christmas period. Before you go know now you go hear say money don dey scarce and banks no go come dey get network again, na just matter of time we go hear am, because na their normal thing every December. Na why I no dey like use bank, even if I receive the money for bank, the one wey I know say I fit spend within short period of time, I dey move am to my opay account, because of their fast transaction. Though, e nor dey advised to put enough money for there oo, just put amounts lower than 200k. Na the only best alternative wey I get be this.",

      "body": "Lolz! Based on based on your story the answer is very simple. It is the network issue and not from the POS terminal. Now did other people people in the locality also make such complain about the POS? And if yes then the network of the POS is bad but if the no, other people are not complaining and only you have that issue then the problem is from your end. Please one thing you have to know is POS is not liable to your fail transaction but it you and the Bank always. As faras the money didn't reflect in the POS then the money is in your bank but you can't see them unless you meet your bank to do am for you. Even the POS attendance can't do it for you. And one thing I will tell you to do when you are going there to make a withdrawal, the first thing you have to do when you reached there is to check your bank network in the POS terminal to confirm if the network is strong enough to make transaction and if it is strong then you can try first small amount to test it is okay and if is not strong then you go to another place. The problem is either from your network or or the POS terminal network. If the POS has fault, you will not be the first to notice but the terminal attendant. And she or he will tell you that they have issue with their terminal.",

Thirdly you and the POS have to make some changes is either you start going to another POS terminal or you just avoid using the POS totally if your card works on other POS except for this particular one.

Secondly, it might also be from the Pos terminal as all this technology devices can sometimes malfunction and cause a person unnecessary pressure. Just the way one of my bank card cannot withdraw money from most pos and it only accepts Opay and PalmPay terminal, each time I try to withdraw dey telling me to refer to card issuer so sometimes it can be from the bank card",

Hope to read your reply soon. It was an Opay digital service account I did the transfer from because the first time I tried using another bank card, same issue happened. I have even tried to upgrade my Opay account so as not to be suseptible to such cases of network issues but am convinced the POS terminal personnel knew not how to operate the machine at that instant because all she cared about was just to close for the day and go home. I have opted to use another terminal and the way it is for me now, I would have thought same people around the vicinity where I conducted such a transaction have an issue with me coming around such a place, hence why I keep being debited or frauded when I try to complete a transaction there or make payments for anything I purchase.",

      "body": "Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on December 05, 2023, 12:42:44 PMWhat are your thoughts?This issue you explained na common issue wey dey always happen for POS perhaps e never happen to you before, that's why you dey panic. To me na Normal thing because e don happen me countless times. And wetting they cause am na just network provider issue. Sometimes if you wan withdraw money and services no dey the pos, the thing go declined but later you go receive debit alart. Sometimes e go return withing 24hours, but if e no return withing 24 hours is either e dey the pos Marchant account or e don hang for air. So you go need go bank and request for statement of account for that period wey you do the transaction, you go see wetting happen if e dey the pos account, you go see am but if na you account bank go tell you to fill form and expect the return withing 10 working days. 1) How to avoid debit alert from pos:Always ask the POS Marchant if your bank network is available in his POS before making withdrawal.2) if you always have same issue repeatedly on thesame POS, there is need to change to another pos.3) if you attempt to withdraw cash the first time and the second time and it did not work please leave that place immediately if not you will be debited.4) always make sure you find a particular pos you trust for withdrawal, not a random withdrawal otherwise you might get debited from a fruaud POS Marchant which you could hardly locate him or her. Because most POS Marchant are fraudulent and can deny you if anything should occur in your account. And this set of people don't add there POS name on the POS profile. When you receive debit alert, you will not see the name rather different Transaction id without POS name and location.",

Firstly, it might be from the terminal as you said or it can be from the bank. What you need to do first is to try and upgrade your terminal to the latest one then try it again, if it still persists then the problem is from the POS terminal but if it works, that means your issue has been solved. Banks do have issues like this but only few banks have their network issue not resolved within 24 hours of noticing the problem. Commercial banks can be so negligent some times but the serious and more productive banks always supersedes the upcoming ones when it comes to network issues. The network sometimes use to be general network downtime with banks.",
