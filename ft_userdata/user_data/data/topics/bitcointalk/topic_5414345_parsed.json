  "content": "I was scouting through internet and i came across this very interesting post on if Satoshi deserve a Nobel prize.Infact many forums had discussed it Infact a professor  Bhagwan Chowdhry at the University of California in the United States presented the proposal of Nobel prize for Satoshi stating that technology presented by Satoshi is the most significant development of the 21st Century and will have immense implications in the way finance will be conducted in the futurePersonally i believe that Satoshi do deserve nobel prize for his work.Especially after recent Ukraine crisis when we saw how donations could pour in in bitcoin. We saw how bitcoin can help people in events of war when banks were either closed or had frozen accounts.. People were homeless and short of money. We saw how bitcoin helped war affected people to overcome financial barriers and this showed the true potential of bitcoin and how it can support financial support and financial inclusion of poor and needy.I believe for such a great contribution to science and humanity Satoshi do deserve a price, even when he is anonymous.I request members to express their opinion as well.",

Is he just a single individual or group of person who created Bitcoin?I guess it will be better if we leave it that way, we don't need to attract more attention. It has accomplished what it needs to be done in the last 10 years and it continue to grow. For sure Satoshi might not in favor of this one as he really doesn't want to be in the limelight.",

Even if the organisers and jury take this into consideration the prize won't be received by the respective person. Each and every member of the forum will have the same thought and wish he gets Nobel Prize.For now we can't do anything more to get him Nobel Prize. For now we can add a Nobel Prize badge to his Bitcointalk account through which he made his discussions. Maybe in future if the identity gets revealed, community can work for the real Nobel Prize.",

Like, all that tight opsec out of the window for a gold medal and $1m. Assuming Satoshi is alive, he definitely has enough funds to live comfortably for multiple lifetimes.",

But I can’t imagine how the award process would take place (as some in this thread have already noticed this). Maybe in absentia? Of course, no one will come for the award, but if this award did occur, it would undoubtedly have a positive effect. Presenting an award of this magnitude would mean almost official recognition of bitcoin and would certainly attract the attention of people who have not even heard anything about bitcoin.",

Because as far as i know, the Nobel prize award is a yearly or annual award, so the winners are people that met their criteria for the award the previous year, Satoshi's invention was created about 13 years ago, and didn't receive too many positive recognition in the beginning phase, until after a few years later, so if Satoshi was ever eligible for the Nobel prize award wouldn't it have been in 2010, that is if bitcoin had met their criteria the preceding year of creation.I don't feel there is a suitable field to categorize Satoshi's creation under the different fields in which the award is giving, if there was an award in the field of 'finance' or 'technology', then i probably think that will suit bitcoin.QuoteThe Nobel prizes are a series of annual awards given in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace.",
