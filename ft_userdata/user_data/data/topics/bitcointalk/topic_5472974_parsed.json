I am sure that I too will have the same luck without having to follow the patterns or strategies that other people apply in their bets. At this time I am trying to enjoy the bets that I make through the efforts and methods or strategies that I apply every time I make a bet.And I am more interested in understanding and knowing about how someone can control themselves over the gambling they do, not about how someone can win a bet. So this can enable me to be better and wiser in carrying out and controlling gambling activities.but this comes back to you personally, if you see that gambling is about profit and think that gambling is a money multiplying machine, then it is not impossible that later you will continue to look for information about how someone can win a bet and then you try to copy it into a bet that you make in the hope that you will get the same win as other people get.",

Buti in any case, you might want to try this strategy and see how it fits you. Yes there is risk, but what are the chances that you suddenly copy a gambler with a huge bet odds like 500x-1000x and then won? That will be the best feeling of a gambler and you will have to thank that individual for giving you that win.But then again, it's not always going to work your way, still base on luck. So yeah, maybe for some at least try it once and see how it goes for you. Just a little money wouldn't hurt us, IMHO.",

I tend to agree that it is better just to gamble or bet by our own and do not depend on the advice or copy other people, if one is willing to do so then the thumb rule is to keep the wager low.When comes to betting the person partaking in it is supposed to hold 100% of the responsibility. Who has not read or heard about some unlucky person gambling others for the money lost to the casino? It is a common scenario which we all should avoid.",

There it makes sense to go by the experience of someone else and follow their moves. Following the money when there's skill involved could lead you somewhere. But I would never copy someone in chance based games, the outcome in these is pre-determined. It makes no sense in that case. To be honest, believing in prejudices and luck-related tales can lead to mindsets that aren't particularly helpful for luck-based games. In these games for me it only makes to play to enjoy and not much more.
