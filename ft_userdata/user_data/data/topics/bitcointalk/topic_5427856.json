  "content": "Let's analyse little bit based on info.What we know is this that crypto is created with USD.A lot USA financial instutions been poured money in crypto.And developers are russians.So what conclusion we got here?Btc and crypto Are Made by russian Brain and with USA money. So the btc are russian and USA mutual project If we look at all the IP adreses databases and all the data related to btc and crypto we can see a lot activity from USA and russian servers and people at first when btc was Young.The name like Satoshi nakamoto got really nothing to do with it's just some non existing name.Also If we look at the btc biggest whale it's grayscale let's connect the dots little bit About grayscale ceo micheal S well his the guy from new York very strong ties to wall Street so we can connect the dots.So crypto is funded by federal reserve and no Wonder becouse yanet yellen Are connected to grayscale and durov the telegram owner.So If we know it's russians and USA project then we know btc have BIG future i think they did not fund it If it Has no bright future.",

You're making up fact and hope we'll do what? It's a stupid theory. The US would never work with Russia on a matter like this but let's say you're right and they'd somehow make BTC together. You start to mix BTC and altcoins like all cryptocurrencies are the same thing. The only thing you're proving to us is that you know nothing about bitcoin and altcoins. Before you start spreading FUD show us some proof that Satoshi is Russian.",

We should be happy that in USA though stricter regulations can be coming in for sure in 2023, there is no talk of banning it just like what China did. As to the possibility involvement of Wall Street, the only reason they ca be involved is that Wall Street is always looking for money...they will surely be there if there is something good for them but when things can be so negatively hot they will drop anything anytime...and that is what's happening right now all because we are still in a deep crypto winter capped by FTX/SBF saga.

We can also measure the value of BTC by using a different currency. They only put US dollar on default because this was the most popular currency among all. Now for the part where he said that BTC is created by Russians. Maybe that was true? Because. there's even a thread here which also questions if satoshi is a Russian. For the rest of us, we think satoshi is a Japanese because of its name. Oh well, all of this will remain to be as a speculation as long as there is no concrete evidence that have been found.",
