Leonardo Da Vinci came up with the concept of the helicopter centuries before technology was able to build one.Was he the father of the helicopter or just someone who was ahead of his time. Satoshi created BTC, but the concept of digital money using different words and concepts was around for a long time before that. Is there a definitive 1st mention of digital money somewhere?-Dave",

There is no way you try to search about Crypto-currency and you won't at least find a link to him, so I think he is well documented in history, but I definitely don't think he had any idea about Bitcoin, and why is the concept of Crypto-currency always tied to Bitcoin. Yes Bitcoin is the head on the crypto leaders board but all the distractions isn't actually necessary for crypto-currency.There is no argument to who is the founder or the instigator of the concept Bitcoin, we all know who did at least those that read about it. So a topic trying to share the work of his knowledge with another is irritating.",

Chaum is a cryptographer who published his paper that he titled Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments in  1983. That first crypto did not reach the public market so it was not know by anybody not until when Bitcoin was introduced to the public market. The first success in crypto came from Bitcoin and the developer Satoshi.   There is a link here to read about David Chaum and his crypto concept.",

      "body": "I am a researcher on decentralised digital currency over 30 years. There was no concept of Decentralised Electronic  currency, Proof of Work or Blockchain at all before 2007. I was conducting exclusive research on Decentralized Electronic Currency since 1988. Eearly 1993, I designed an electronic Euro Bond but I was not able to lunch it. In 1994 I created a single currency project for South Asian Economic Zone but my project was hijacked from me by EU Financial Intelevent Unit.  Later, the EU successfully launched the European Single  currency Euro. Then I moved on to another project in African Continent call Rica. It was difficult because African central banking system. Finally, in 2005 I wrote the Electronic Digital  Currency Protocol, which actually was my thesis. In january 2006, I created Bitgold project. Later, in October 2006 I transformed it into  Bitcoin Project. I invented Blockchain in March 2007 and wrote the Bitcoin White Paper and Blockchain Transaction Paper on 5 April 2007. In May 2007, I was looking on the Internet if any one doing any project on Digital Currency. After a good search, I found Adam Back Hash Cash, which is nothing to do with Digital Currency. Then I found Wei Dai's B-Money which was not very much clear. Then I found Nick Szabo's Bit-Gold, which didn't make any sense. There after I found David Chaum's Digi Cash but it was not about Digital Money but it was just a form of Gold Certificate. Well, there was no concept of Blockchain Technology any where before 2007. And you all think, Satoshi Nakamoto Created Bitcoin Bitcoin and Blockchain but literally, Satoshi Nakamoto is one of my Japanese pseudonym. I used it just to lunched the Bitcoin project. Well David Chaum is a great man who tried to trade gold certificate as Digi Cash but he has to go to prison. It was his failure to develop something better. I have no problem if some one proposes to respect Dr Chaum. Indeed, when I read that he has to go prison for the Gold Certificate the Digi Cash, so it really inspired me to publish the Bitcoin in my JAPANESE pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, also there was other reason for it.",

In other to be on the right track with factual evidence I would have suggested you show or upload the source of this your findings. This thing is what researchers do to back their findings. It would help along way to cushion some reactions that might likely come to play as a result of your update. It will be nice next time you furnish us with evidence such as Link so we could read more about any such post in the nearest future.",

But the basic principles and fundamentals remain the same.The true father of crypto could be a man who lived thousands of years ago who literally mined his coins using a hammer and chisel. (Have you ever wondered where the term crypto mining came from?) Physical labor was the first proof of work algorithm. Even if today its considered high tech and a dot com internet technology.
