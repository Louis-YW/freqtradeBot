      "body": "Well, no one be will answer this question and why would anyone admit they are involved in illegal practices as per their government norms? Majority of countries have not banned Bitcoin and it's neither legal nor illegal and some countries don't have problems with it unless it affects their citizens in a negative way like some major scams or terror funding or money laundering. I don't think we should term people of committing sins just because they are going against their government when government just wants to control your financial freedom.",

According to Britannica, civil disobedience is the refusal to obey the demands or commands of a government or occupying power without resorting to violence or active measures of opposition. Why is the government telling me not to buy Bitcoin when I know that Bitcoin represents freedom, and holding onto their fiat is economic and financial bondage? I want to be free, and because I don't want to resort to violence, I simply disobey them.",

If someone from a country that has restricted Bitcoin and he's a member of the forum and had an account, is he a violator already since he's on a Bitcoin forum? The government will have an approach towards it for sure.",

Their citizens are allowed to take the risk on their own and the governments have nothing to do with it. And if you are from the country that doesn't want you to get involved with bitcoin and you are a lover of bitcoin, you can either leave the country and stay where you are allowed to do what you want, and when you relocate, are you still falling under the law of your country that deny you the access to own a bitcoin?",

Do you agree that you are a violator for breaking the law? Now see things from a religious side as well, by disobeying the government and investing in bitcoins, are you committing the sin of direct disobedience? Let me answer your question from a personal perspective. I live in a community where we have a lot of seafood like fish, oysters, periwinkle, and lots of valuable seafood that are in abundance here. But the issue is that the leaders in my locality don't allow people to harvest the see food for the purpose of selling them and this is because they don't even know the value of those see food. they will even harvest those see food that if you sell it in the urban areas, the price will be enough to feed a whole household for the week and they will just eat it up just a day.Because I know the value of these product and I know the market I can sell them to make money, I still go out and harvest it and sell it and make a huge money out of it. And here is the striking thing I discovered as I continued harvesting the oyster, I discovered that the more I harvested them, the more they produce fresh and quality oyster while the once left without harvesting becomes old and dies off with time. When some persons in the locality interacted with me and I told them how much I make from the sells of tye oyster, their thought process change and some of them have even joined me.What I'm trying to say in essence is that, that a country bans the use of a particular thing doesn't make the thing bad or illegal, as long as you know that what you are doing isn't illegal and won't harm anyone in the process, then I don't see anything that is wrong with it.The issue is that most of the government that band and kicks against Bitcoin adoption are just afraid of accepting a system that they won't be in control of.",

Do you agree that you are a violator for breaking the law? Now see things from a religious side as well, by disobeying the government and investing in bitcoins, are you committing the sin of direct disobedience?Bitcoin isn’t illegal in many countries but what the government are doing is they don’t support it, let’s take a look at the casino industry, many people do not like or support them even in this forum and they do not advertise them but do they stop others from engaging in them No, they believe you bear the risk. If you look at what most countries do they advise people against bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large but that is left for you to take. If you risk it and it turns out bad for you, the government isn’t coming to aid that is just it. I will give example of Nigeria since it’s your country too, the government frowns at bitcoin but didn’t ban it that is why you see people publicly going about saying they are into it. In a country like China where it was once banned you could see the government coming after everything related to it even mining. In this kind of country you can also invest because it is your money but you can’t publicize it or advocate because it is against the law and doing that makes you a law breaker. so there is difference",

Bitcoin has been gaining significant ground even in countries that makes it illegal. I think doing it in an open space or publicly that is what may seem like you violating the laws of the government. But when you keep calm and remain anonymous no one will ever notice or find out you are into Bitcoin. It can be tag as illegality but deep down we know the truth that Bitcoin has no negative effect to the economy of any country.",

It's not even the government that's paying me the money that I use to buy Bitcoin, it's none of their business. The best thing they can do is block people from accepting Bitcoin as a medium of exchange or making payment in the country, I like Bitcoin because it's a good store of value, not just for making payments only, you are free as a bird mate, do what you feel is right..But do know that no government want the best for it's people, it will be hard to get you under control if you have your own money and power, you can afford abandoning the country for another, but if you are poor you are simply under the control of your government and trust me, this is what they want.",

But due to political suppression crypto community lost the case and crypto was declared banned. Therefore investing in crypto while the country doesn't allow it without any reason, might not be considered as a sin but a crime, yeah, in the law's eye, we are committing the crime.",

Do you agree that you are a violator for breaking the law? Now see things from a religious side as well, by disobeying the government and investing in bitcoins, are you committing the sin of direct disobedience?Nothing is surprising in finding that the citizens of a country are investing in BTC or crypto while it is banned by the government. I have seen many people here in BTT who have exposed that they use BTC or other tokens while their governments have banned them. So, there remains nothing surprising here for me, but for you maybe. I don't consider myself a bad citizen for disobeying the government, but I have to consider myself. Because disobeying your government is directly equal to crime but a crime in one country is not a crime in another country. Same prostitution, alcohol, etc. is a crime in one country but not in another country. BTC is the same as that but it is not negatively impacting society like all those bad factors, crypto is banned in my country too but I think my government is not considering it because they are afraid they can't control it, or they don't know how to react with it, how to get benefit from it. Because one time they legalized it and then banned it two times. This means they are uncertain of what crypto is, but if some educated person would teach them then they might consider it to be legal.",
