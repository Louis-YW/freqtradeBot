      "body": "Privacy is essential, and those who value it have ways of controlling who actually has vital information about them. Regarding the cameras in public places that capture everyone's movements, those can't be compared to Bitcoin, as those cameras capture your face and any information that you have given to regulatory authorities through licensing or any form of registration that you have done under its government body. For Bitcoin, privacy can actually be improved as this is based on individuals. Anyone who ever chooses to remain anonymous can maintain that by avoiding reusing addresses, not attaching a name to his or her address, avoiding centralized exchanges that request user data, and using privacy browsers to remain completely private on things you do and where you visit. Sometimes mixing coins in whatever way is necessary to remove the connection attached to your name is also another means. As for the CBDC, those are no different from any local currency, as their usage is similar to that of mobile banking, except that they have been digitalized but are still under the watch and control of the same government. Unless you just want to increase the use of your local currency to the next level, CBDC is not an option.",

I hope this helps Digging deep into this post I found out that it's helpful that we verify both beginners for the benefits are actually great and while we do this we should be alert as wellCheck out this post ...https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5464484.msg62744099#msg62744099",

The reason why privacy is a possibility whilst using Bitcoin is because of decentralization, thus you can use it without giving any data/info to a centralized authority which is in control.The thing now is, how many people actually use Bitcoin in this private way, quite a lot of them know how important privacy is, but i'm afraid they will choose convenience over it, and that is the case for a lot for individuals who are newcomers to Bitcoin.

But there are others who don't really mind and think privacy isn't a big deal. So, I created thread to see what everyone thinks about privacy.If we are to be honest, most people have accepted that the privacy that once existed is a thing of the past, and if we look in which countries it is most expressed, then one might be surprised that these are the countries that present themselves as the largest democracies in the world. Their citizens are monitored down to the smallest detail and they obviously don't mind it, because most of them don't protest against it.Let's take the example of the UK, where the authorities are testing a facial recognition system with the help of AI on the streets, and the system is so \"precise\" that it results in hundreds of wrong decisions that result in the harassment of ordinary citizens walking the streets. If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't have believed it, but imagine that they single you out from the crowd and start checking you like a criminal or terrorist, and you can't do anything about it.Privacy is important to me, but I don't kid myself that I can achieve it to the extent that I would like, because in addition to cameras that are everywhere, we are spied on by our smartphones, computers, smart TVs and every device that is connected to the internet.Therefore, I would conclude that privacy is a matter of personal choice, and this means that those who want more privacy must be ready to make some concessions in life if they want to succeed in this.",

Some persons that are no longer beginners are regretting because they did not have the information of privacy when they we are beginners and they had already exposed their data and personal information before knowing what privacy is all about. But every beginner who is yet to complete kyc with any company and yet to expose their data, if they understand what is privacy and begins from the day one as a privacy person, they will be highly respected and recognised on the long run.
