  "content": "Through other means of communication and asked if everything is OK and why I have been posting and selling a bunch of stuff. So I figure a post here is warranted. This was I can just point them to this thread.No I don't need the money. (Although who doesn't need more money.) And no I'm not leaving the crypto world.It has come down to the simple fact that I an over 50 and I've had plans to display many of these things for years and years and have not. And at this point in time it probably never going to happen. So it's time to slowly move them out. Lets face it if my 2016 Crypto Imperator halving coins or my 2014 Ravenbit's have not been put out somewhere in the condo by now to be shown the odds are just about 0 of it ever really happening. It's not just cryptocurrency stuff it's a vast collection of hot sauces, that were on display when I living someplace else, but now are just sitting in a climate controlled storage facility. Or the classic car memorabilia and parts which were in my parents basement for 25 years and since they moved has been sitting in that same storage facility or......you get the point.So most of it is just going to be sold here and other forums over time.As for the international shipping. It really is a bunch of things. It started YEARS ago when another tenant in the building on the Thursday before a long holiday weekend left an international shipping box out in the hallway that had the wrong customs forms on it. So it was not picked up. And it had some very perishable and very smelly food in it that then sat all weekend. When everyone came into the building the next week the odor was....interesting. This was followed years later by another tenant doing something similar. So now even if it's something that is not going to go bad, all international shipments must be brought to the post office or fedex or wherever. You cannot leave them to be picked up. Landlord is VERY firm on this. Due to the fact that I do a lot of field IT work getting to a post office during business hours is not always possible so things have sat in my car for weeks on end. I have had a 25 year old graphics card for a retro gaming system for someone in Korea sitting in my car for a couple of weeks now. I have known him since I was a teen so he does not care, but someone paying real money *should* get really annoyed with me for doing that. So, it's just easier to say no international, find someone to re-ship. Yeah, I know it's more expensive to you and a pain in the ass. Sorry.-Dave",

I tried to sell some tazos and trading cards here and found every PM I received wanted to practically take them for a pittanceregardless of what the photographs show to the contrary) and questioned the postage even though I sent the link to the Australia Post website.Are you planning on updating us with your progress? I for one would be interested to read your experiences (it might prompt others including myself to do a little bit of a declutter before we go on to down size)",

      "body": "Probably will have some updates. The issue is where to sell some of the really oddball stuff.Where do you sell something like this:https://www.peppersofkeywest.com/shop/shop-by-heat/heat-rating-10-shop-by-heat/blairs-2009-halloween-reserve-96-of-99/eBay and take the 15% hit if it ever sells and how long would it sit there? Post it here and have a very limited audience? Take it to Vegas and try to get on Pawn Stars? The car stuff is either dead easy or miserable.Some things just sell quick and easy, others....you get grilled about the 5mm scratch on the underside of a NOS carburetor that's older then I am. [No I'm not kidding]For the crypto, most of it is either known or semi known value like the MoonBits I sold, or just a guess and see what happens like the Platinum Penny.And other times its just a question of is it worth it. The 10oz silver I have up now. I can walk into any coin store here and get spot minus 1% to 2% So with the time to take the pictures and post it and then box and ship if it sells, I'm probably loosing money if you figure in that time even with the premium I'm charging. But I figured what the heck. May regret that thought later.....-Dave",

      "body": "The problem with doing a \"stock take\" is that there is no logic to what is where and that although everything is neat, and in boxes / storage tubs. It's far from organized due to the multiple moves and total lack of planning on my part.So yeah, the 1968 carburetor is in the same storage tub with some tools and some old intel & AMD CPUs....The hot sauces are in with some other things and so on. So it's just easier to open a container and start going though it. Figure out what I am keeping and what I want to move out. And where the best place is to sell it. All while still working the regular job.-Dave",

What was good was I was in no rush and could go though them over time and move them out.Changing the plan a bit but I have reserved a table at 2 upcoming car show / swap meet things. 1 later this month and 1 in August.Going to concentrate on pulling the car stuff over the next couple of weeks and see how that goes. Going with the hope that if I make it cheap enough I can have one of the other vendors take all that I bring and then negotiate for the rest that I have.

I could probably fit 99% of the crypto stuff in 1 medium size storage tub. (27galllon / 100 liter) with a lot of room to spare. But what really is the point of having some of them if you are not going to put them out to see.-Dave",

Thereâ€™s nothing wrong to finally cashout on our collection. I even peel most of my casascius coin to redeem the reward. Good luck on all of your sale Dave.-CT",

YikesWelcome to the club, there are no set rules or secret handshakes or even membership patches, but when you move the stuff later you do get a backache for free.Did the car show swap meet yesterday. Was interesting. The things I had out I priced the same as eBay figuring there would be a lot of haggling going on.With the things that did sell some sent for what I was asking, others went a lot lot less. Not as much stuff moved as I wanted, and I didn't even have time to pack and bring as much as I wanted to but I figure I sold about 3 storage tubs to people and at the end sold another tub of stuff to another vendor for very little. Selling things here has also been interesting. The 10oz silver bar that I have for spot+shipping+a couple of dollars has had very little interest (no BR I didn't forget about you).As have the goldbacks, that are actually a couple of hundered dollars below retail. The true crypto things have moved. Might have to adjust my sales strategy as to where I am posting some things.-Dave",

YikesYeh - I've still got a couple (!) of posters that came in tubes and have remained in pristine condition ever since (and I'd probably get less now for them to boot) - the laminated Max Headroom posters (all six feet of them and my Doctor Who - Prime Computers posters are the only ones I'd keep and the rest I'd get rid of if/when the big sweep ever occurs.Quote...goldbacks...Goldbacks? Â As in U.S. paper money \"redeemable in gold\" from the 1920's and 1930's ??Â  I've got a couple as well as the brown serial National's.Â  I might be interested in some.",
