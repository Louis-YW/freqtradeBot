If not it would be nice to have the ci build debug binaries when new commits are merged so new features could be tested faster and easier.EDIT: I was a bit too quick to ask this question. Debug builds can be found here if anyone else is looking.",

      "body": "As far as I can tell that is the official ci but obviously you should only use these debug builds to test new features. You are absolutely right that you should only use the official channels for serious use cases or you're on your own. (You kinda are anyway because of the licence but thats besides the point.) The whole point of this post was that I'm not able to build myself at the moment and noticed that a feature I've been waiting for had been merged. Also for some reason I can't get the link to display correctly.EDIT: Got the link to display correctly",

There is a small icon that displays the build status. Or you can clone the repository and search for cirrus-ci with grep for example if you don't want to use the github website.",
