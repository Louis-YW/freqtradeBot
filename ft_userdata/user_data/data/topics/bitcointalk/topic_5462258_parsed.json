Again my wallet doesn’t support bumping fee due to the private key that I use.I believe this is a mempool issue and not Bluewallet since the fee is correct to the suggested fee on mempool. What's happening on the blockchain?",

What's happening on the blockchain?Sometimes the wallet, and probably most wallets, will have the wrong fee estimates especially during those times of high network congestion.Before making a transaction, next time check how much transactions are in queue.

What's happening on the blockchain?Even it is happening recently when the mempool is not congested. But if you compare it with mempool estimated fee for high priority on mempool, it is just slightly different. And sometimes, the mempool fee would have later increased.

You have to generate another seed phrase to generate the address.Quote from: dimonstration on August 06, 2023, 03:33:30 PMI have no choice on BlueWallet because electrum is not available on ios.

I am using Bluewallet and I like the wallet.I think I have no choice now. I will generate new seed phrase to create new wallet address. I will be sticking to Bluewallet more often now because I don’t have android device. Personally, I have no complaints on the overall experience on Bluewallet because it gives a simpler and smooth user experience to me except on the transaction fee part.",
