  "content": "I would like to discuss a proof of work low-cap project. I became aware of it after the Ethereum Merge last year. www.alephium.orgAlephium is the first operational sharded blockchain bringing scalability, ETH-inspired smart contracts, and energy efficiency to Bitcoin's proven core technologies while ensuring better performance.From its technical design to its interfaces, Alephium has been created with usability and accessibility in mind. It’s made to support powerful, scalable yet user-friendly decentralized applications and protocols. -   Scalable through BlockFlow sharding with up to 400+ TPS (up to 10k TPS w/ more shards) -   Stateful UTXO model for Ethereum-level programmability and security. -   Efficient Proof of Less Work mining, using ⅛ of Bitcoin's energy. -   Custom Alphred VM enhances dApps with improved security and trustless transactions. -   Ralph language simplifies DeFi smart contract creation, resembling Rust syntax.Whitepaper: https://github.com/alephium/white-paper/blob/master/alephium.pdfWhy another L1 blockchain? Isn't there too many already?The blockchain’s narrative evolved from disruptive technology to a possible mainstream solution for several sectors. Due to this paradigm shift, most projects are giving away the core values of decentralization, self-sovereignty, and security in pursuing scalability to meet the performance requirements needed for such applications. Alephium delivers the same result without compromising on those fundamentals, and it is uniquely placed to ignite the industry’s interest in (s)UTXO and Po(L)W and spearhead the movement of UTXO-based DeFi and smart contract applications.In addition, there were a few key technological motivations for building Alephium:1. Horinzontal scaling through sharding2. Many of the new Layer 1 (L1) blockchains are resource intensive, making it costly to run a full node which in turn can lead to a lack of decentralization and desintermediation in the long term. Alephium's approach is similar to Bitcoin's where anyone can run a full node and verify network. \"Don't trust, verify.\"3. Many of new L1 blockchains use the account model or are EVM compatible and inherits its weaknesses. Alephium created a new Virtual Machine (VM) built on the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model to provides a new programming paradigm with higher security level for decentralized applications (dApps).4. Most new L1s use Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Alephium chose to build on the Proof of Work (PoW) as simpler, more consistent, and more robust consensus mechanism for achieving decentralization.Block Explorerhttps://explorer.alephium.org/Githubhttps://github.com/alephiumWallethttps://github.com/alephium/desktop-wallet/releases/tag/v2.1.4Blogs: https://medium.com/@alephiumDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/3y8HvQ97s4Telegram: https://t.me/alephiumgroupTokenomics: https://medium.com/@alephium/tokenomics-of-alephium-61d59b51029cCoingecko:https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alephiumExchanges:https://www.gate.io/de/trade/ALPH_USDT?ref=3018394https://www.bitmart.com/trade/en-US?layout=basic&symbol=ALPH_USDThttps://tradeogre.com/exchange/ALPH-USDTmore links:https://docs.alephium.org/frequently-asked-questions/https://medium.com/@alephium/tech-talk-2-mysteries-of-stateful-utxo-the-ultimate-guide-to-alephiums-accounting-model-and-de2cf2063615https://youtu.be/r_5U7ZgByt4?si=A2r5tHQTN8Ic5xON&t=2",

      "body": "Why do I think it's a good investment?Alephium has not experienced a bull run so far. Personally, I'm a fan of Proof of Work, and my speculation is that more energy-efficient and innovative Proof of Work coins will once again have a chance to gain attention in the space.The founder, Cheng Wang, is a brilliant mind. Here's a short excerpt from an interview with him:\"Cheng Wang: The first time I heard about Bitcoin was around 2014 during my PhD at EPFL on consensus algorithm research. My advisor asked me if I had heard about it because he might have been interested in doing some research on it, but we ended up not pursuing it. It was very traditional research where we focused on theory and didn't pay much attention to potential industry applications.Then, I proposed the first linear-time Byzantine agreement algorithm and published it on the Internet.In 2015, Vitalik Buterin and Casey from the Ethereum Foundation read my paper. They realized I was also in Switzerland and invited me to Zug at the Ethereum Foundation to discuss it with them. That's when I delved deeper into Bitcoin and Ethereum to prepare for the meeting.At that time, I found Bitcoin's simplicity, as described in its whitepaper, more appealing. Ethereum seemed more complex, with a much broader attack surface, and I was concerned people might try to exploit it.\"In general, I'm also convinced by the team. While they haven't raised the largest amounts of investment, they handle their funds carefully, are down-to-earth, answer all questions, and take criticism or advice from the community seriously.Here's a glimpse from one of their wallet developers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHmb87sT9nITokenomics are well explained in this thread:: https://twitter.com/zkitbeats/status/1645357818088771584?s=20There was a pre-mine of 140 million coins.Out of these, 30 million were sold for $0.05, 30 million for $0.12, and 4 million for $0.6.16 million coins can still be sold or burned.30 million + 30 million are allocated for ecosystem, development, team, etc. All of these have vesting periods and only count towards the circulation supply after being moved.Looking at the overall chart, understanding the background is important. In the early stages, the circulation supply was quite low. As a Proof of Work chain, it's a fact that the first 2-3 years see the most coins entering circulation. And while still in the development phase and being a small chain, maintaining a steady price can be challenging. At least for the initial years, which, in my opinion, represent the accumulation phase (see Kadena).The maximum supply is 1 billion tokens, but this will never be reached due to 100% burned transaction fees and proof of less work. Proof of less work is activated at a hashrate of 1 EH/s, where miners need to burn coins to mine new ones.https://medium.com/@alephium/tech-talk-1-the-ultimate-guide-to-proof-of-less-work-the-universe-and-everything-ba70644ab301Considering the market cap of 11 million, I see a lot of room for growth in the long run, despite the growing circulation supply.With Ayin, the first Community DEX was developed.https://www.ayin.app/swapCurrently, the team is building a bridge to BSC and ETH to facilitate high-volume trading. Once Alephium's price rises and the community continues to grow, building on Alephium becomes more appealing for developers. Then Alephium's technology comes into play.Example: https://medium.com/@alephium/alephiums-aps-eliminating-evm-token-approval-risks-5407e7e70a33",

      "body": "Alephium has been flying under the radar for a very long time. And that's ok. Because it was born at the start of a massive bear market. The team saw the writing on the wall and focused on the tech. Most of their hard work (NFT market place, bridge, dex) are coming to fruition so the core team is just now starting to switch  on their marketing engine.I'm very excited for the first of alph. It's the hidden gem in the market. They dev team has been on fire, consistently putting out solid code and features. Can't wait to see how this does in a few years after their hackathons/ more mature ecosystem.",

Or what's bullrun to you exactly? This has risen 1775% since October 2023 and it's currently ATH. So if you are trying to sell us something, at least stick speaking truth. so that rest of your text won't be skipped.Not even going to the fact that proof of work only works if there's enough distributed mining power that prevents 51% attack, so certain pow low cap coins are often very much vulnerable to that. Or that this thread is obvious marketing attempt where you shiill it with all your newb accounts.",

There are not too many special things to analyze about its potential. I think that if you buy in a good position, you can absolutely expect to receive some more announcements about CEX in the future to be able to Increase the price more, but also be honest about the risks and profits, which should also be carefully calculated for those who intend to approach the project at the present time.",
