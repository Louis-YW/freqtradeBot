  "content": "Over the past two weeks there has been rise in crytpo market due pepe project .people have started investing in it. Pepe projects are bringing high rewards for crypto users. Going through the crytpo gaming project came I across another  pepe project that is pepverse that has created unique nfts that can be staked hold mint and used for several purpose for future gains. Multiple ways of earning passive are introduced in pepverse. and  the plus point of these nfts are they can be utilised even before launch to get rewards.  Pepverse tokens can provide liquidity for getting good amount of apy.For I believe it's a high time to invest in such a project for high returns. I need your suggestions as well because this is just research based. Most of my friends are going to buy nfts of pepserve. Share your thoughts regarding pepserve.I also share website white paper link:Web: https://pepverse.io/Whitepaper : https://pepverse.io/whitepaper.pdf",

I Think someday there is problem with this token. may be Don't waiting too long, we can see now the problem of Pepe project don't have any utilty. As they said on website development of project growth is pure from community, as meme coin they don't need utility but only community. Homever pepe coin still have opportunity because they have community will be growth in the future. Always DYOR and you should know meme coin is the most High risk than other coin.

Evrything on this token and meme coin in general is wrong. There is no real utility that will makes the company generate profit aside from the exit liquidity coming from the dumb investors that buying this token without any idea meme coin works as ponzi.Check th roadmap and white paper to see if there is something promising in terms of development. This token goal is just to list on exchange and get as much as possible exposure to gain more liquidity from new holders. The meme coin community knows what really going but they are enjoying this ponzi since the volatility is very high. Whales are just eating retail traders money that buys this garbage token.",

      "body": "In general, I don't like most of cryptocurrencies that have entered the market as a meme coin. The reason for this is that they don't serve any purpose and don't have any usage area. Of course, some exceptions will break this situation but to generalize unfortunately none of the meme coins serves a purpose and doesn't contribute to the ecosystem. Of course, the profit-oriented opportunities they create help to achieve a nice profit margin in a very short time, but not knowing how far the rise will go can also be very painful.Although I haven't do any research on the project mentioned by OP, I wanted to remind you that meme coins in general do not have a roadmap and do not serve a purpose.",

If it has a good demand then that would be an advantage but if it is just because of the original one, then think as much as possible. Many investors are like this for years. Once a project somehow succeeded, any other project related on its name would be their target with high hopes of getting profit from it. But that's not how things work in this industry. Meme coins have no utility which could create a huge demand; it would solely base on its popularity. See how PEPE and other tokens are in at the present? That should give you enough reason to manage the risk.",

I don't understand how a project can be OK when this project was created for the fun of it and makes no sense at all. Similarly, many were shocked by the success of Shiba. Now these projects have a huge capitalisation, which can be compared to a real existing business. This shows once again that there are few serious things in cryptocurrencies.

In addition, since such investments are quite risky, if you decide to invest, you should definitely make your own research and decide. You should definitely not invest in any phenomenon or on the advice of a crypto trader who is around you and making profits. The very high earning opportunities you can see here can cause you to lose money at the same rate after the market goes bad and traders interest is lost in this area. That's why, always do your own research.",

All the other Pepe projects as you call them were just cheap tries of the creators to make some quick and easy money by just copying the name Pepe and create just another useless shit-coin. This has shown again that the whole meme-coin scene is just stupid. Those tokens are offering literally nothing and still some people are aping in without thinking twitch just because they have the same name as a project that was successful earlier. Totally stupid.",
