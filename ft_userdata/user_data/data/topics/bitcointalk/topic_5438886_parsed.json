      "body": "The Bitcoin market is making sellers look guilty of how they want to use their assets. It's not meant to be that way. Hodling helps the network, but we are in control of what to do with our assets that is why Bitcoin is better than the bank. The seller who made such a sell after holding for 11 years made more profits (one reason we are told not to sell) yet I don't see the difference between him and the person that sold after a year (instance). The end scene is that they sold. Let's predict he bought a new property with such a huge amount, that's his pleasure that made him to sell. That doesn't mean he can't sell the property tomorrow and buy Bitcoin at a cheaper or higher amount, at the end, it still helps the network. Then, let's back forward to the guy that sold 1 year after hodling, he may not have made so much profits, but the window is always open for them to buy more. In a nutshell, hodling as long as you can is necessary. Don't let the hodling pressure in the market create a self psychology in you that makes you feel unserious after selling your coin. If it matters to sell no problem. Holding is good too, but we have pleasures and problems in life to tackle.",

And the fact that they were able to get that much Bitcoin in the first place just shows how much faith the early adopters had in crypto. Crazy, right?",

There is no right or wrong answer to how long one should hold cryptocurrencies. Some people may hold for short-term gains, while others may hold for the long-term.It is important to keep in mind that cryptocurrency prices can be volatile and there is always a risk of losing money. Before investing, it's advisable to research the asset and understand the potential risks and rewards, and to seek professional advice if necessary.Ultimately, it's up to the individual to determine how long they feel comfortable holding their investment.",

Why do you assume that owner of those bitcoins never sold any just because he didn't move them for 12 years? People can use more than 1 address in order to hold their bitcoins (like I am doing)Â  and maybe owner sold most of it long time ago and he is still left with those 412 bitcoins.",

If someone sells coins, it doesn't mean they quit Bitcoin for good. I personally sold a lot of BTC in the past, especially when the price was above $50k. And I won't regret it if the price will climb to $100k, because life is not going to wait. I'm going to always hold some BTC in case it goes to the moon, but I'm also going to sell portions of it as it goes higher and higher.",

I won't make myself comfortable if I sell all that I've got, there has to be some remaining balance of my holdings in BTC so that I'm still prepared for the future. 11 years is a long wait and that guy probably just remembered it once in a while or it's just another wallet that he's got while using and spending the other wallets that he's got during the past bull runs. Anything is of possibility with these dormant wallets. But the main thing is, they're all patient and if we're all patient too, we'll be rewarded soon.",

And in this case, no way he was able to recover it once he lost access to the said wallet but being a responsible investor should always back up everything like passwords or keys. Not that I called it \"extreme holding\" but I was negligent. It was a crazy amount and you really become disappointed if never get it but that really happens if we are too careless. Anyways, that was in the past days when we really don't care about the value of Bitcoin but for now, everyone already has an idea of how to keep their password or keys so this won't happen unless they get hacked.",

Purchased 1 BTC at a price of $ 12.41 on 28-09-2012 and continued to accumulate with a total purchase of 411.12 BTC on 01-10-2012. this was then hold for up to 11 years and is active again today.https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1MMXRAo6CZQ5KuLkboQ3tULhZZtj3ovmjTSeeing how far the transaction was carried out, the Bitcoin went to 4 addresses with a split amount.https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qxwhey4zdcg75fan93mnsvsskxyqvfrck8fl28uhttps://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q44rxrlqqvw5ltpnu4kvq77mxss0shgtf2ja899https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qv9k89vpljh96fctpxk9rr7xkdnd3hafhgrchym25r4rcpwm578ash7vl58https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1PjgA9yjHG3N9gUs9aoD7mV7rL5VyjPiK4 [wallet: CoinSpot.com.au]3 addresses using a segwit address and 1 address using a Bitcoin address originating from the coinspot.com.au wallet (local Crypto Exchange in Australia)During the 5 years of doing DCA, there will definitely be many benefits that have been obtained. Counting back 5 years in 2018, of course, you bought bitcoin at a very cheap price and Bitcoin also crashed at a price of $ 3k. You made regular purchases until now and will be used for early retirement, it will be more than enough to cover life in your old age. Don't be tempted to sell if the target you want has not been reached.To be honest, Personally, I was only able to hold bitcoins from 2017 to the end of 2018 when ATH $19k was reached, but I don't regret selling it because it was a good start to get back the same amount of bitcoins today and continue to hold for new ATHs in the future Later.",
