So, at the border checkpoint in Lachin (Azerbaijan), a consignment of goods was found that had nothing to do with this organization. As it turned out, the convoy of cars with the emblem of the Red Cross transported from Armenia to Karabakh, temporarily under the control of Russian peacekeepers, instead of medicines, cigarettes and mobile phones, the latter generally belong to the sanctioned type of goods.(1) Moreover, this casts a shadow on the command of the peacekeepers in Khankendy.          This, it should be noted, emergency incident directly exposes the mission of the Red Cross Committee in Armenia in corruption. However, there are some circumstances that have far-reaching consequences. The fact is that Azerbaijan has repeatedly applied to the headquarters of the Red Cross Committee in Geneva with a request to communicate with Karabakh not from the mission in Yerevan, but from the same Red Cross mission located in Baku. In this case, you do not have to go through the checkpoint, and the road will be shorter. But here's an opportunity, all seemingly rational requests of Baku remained unanswered, which indicates a possible criminal connection between the Yerevan mission and the leadership of the Red Cross in Geneva, which for some reason prefers Yerevan.1.
