How to buy it with crypto ???How to hire freelancer with crypto Is there really a how to this? Not like there is any real established procedure or something.The means of services yo a trade depends largely on if the merchant, person offering the service or receiving the services offers it. Should you find someone that is bitcoin friendly and offers the skills you want, your good to go else, your just stock right where you started.Your best chance of finding those that would accept your terms is by creating your Ann thread on the service board, stating your TOS and Services needed clearly, including the way its supposed to run. You could also advertise it in your blog post on your site.Also, you need to be very careful as there are scmmers everywhere you turn, looking to take opportunity where they could find it and so, you should use an escrow in managing your funding/making payments.",

Coz they have a lot to charge as an established crypto writers or i say journals which I doubt op can afford for now.Crypto writer asked higher rates too so OP should consider it to look up his budget, although there is fiverr, i just don't know if you will like the quality of content.",

In addition, using multiple platforms to find people could also 'broaden your search'. Some freelancers could be in platform X but not in platform Y therefore if you stay in one place, you could be missing out on other candidates. I would recommend it if OP is looking for a specific quality and/or has a limited budget.",
