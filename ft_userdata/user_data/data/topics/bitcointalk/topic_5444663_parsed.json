The FAQ is short but consists of the questions that users are often asked which may contain many things about the ToS too but not all.On every site you are registering, be it gambling site or not gambling site, the ToS page would be displayed and you have to scroll down and you have the check ‚úîÔ∏è it that you have read it, but they are always too long which discourage many people to read it.

      "body": "I'm with you 100% on this one! I'm an avid online gambler myself and have witnessed a slew of novices making this rookie mistake. The problem is most beginners consider the rules and regulations trivial matters, mere formalities. They fail to recognize that these rules are the bedrock of an honest and above-board gambling experience. By ignoring the fine print, they're putting their hard-earned money on the line with no guarantee of success. It's like taking candy from a stranger without any idea of its contents. Let me tell you, I've had some costly lessons in online casinos. I've learned the hard way that ignorance is NOT bliss.Speaking of costly lessons, let me tell you a little anecdote that drives home your point. My buddy, we'll call him Bob, thought he'd try his hand at online gambling. He assumed he had everything under control, but boy, was he in for a rude awakening! Bob lost a significant amount of money, all because he didn't bother to read the rules and regulations. He felt cheated and conned, but the reality was he had no one to blame but himself. Bob learned the hard way that shortcuts in online gambling lead to disaster. So to all you beginners out there, read the fine print! It might just be the best investment you'll ever make.",

I normally browse through them, but nothing stops them from changing it. (I have seen Slot providers adding certain countries to the \"ban\" list and the terms and conditions are then changed, after you accepted it) ¬†I think a lot of scam casinos are doing this on purpose to get an excuse not to payout wins to their gamblers. They will literally go through the fine print to find a reason not to payout wins.",

I am not saying that all gamblers are beginners, but almost on average it happens to beginners who have just entered online gambling.we can see from some people's beginner accounts that they accuse, attack, and complain about their own mistakes in not reading the casino rules so they are suspended and do bad things to the casino. and with this thread I hope that anyone who wants to register or make a first deposit at an online casino please always read the casino rules instead of regretting it.",

      "body": "Not reading and giving attentions to rules and regulations, or terms and conditions of not just gambling platforms has become a habit with people. Sometimes people do not bother reading because they are too lazy to read, they assume that the terms and conditions will be the same with that of other gambling platforms they have played on, or assume that the terms and conditions are the same from the last time they used the gambling platform. For some other people, they are in a hurry to just start gambling, and even though they plan to read the terms and conditions, they end up forgetting to do so and just keep gambling.If you have not read the terms and conditions of any casino and gambling platform that you use, today is a good time to try to do so, Reading and understanding Terms and Conditions can make your gambling experience smooth and without issues and complaints.",

One of the risks of playing in a casino is not knowing its terms of service, I've read one story where one guy from a restricted location not knowing that those who come from that location are not allowed to sign up or even play it's allowed on one casino and not from other casinos.A good gambler read the terms and checks what he can do legally and what is allowed, it's your money you have to protect your money, and reading the terms and knowing your restriction and what you can do is the best way to protect your money and your account in case you get lucky and win.There's nothing like being able to withdraw your winning because you read the terms and follow them.",

I am with stake for years and was never informed about changes of the TOS but when I read them now, like Germany is now banned, guess what, I am German, then I can only wonder wtf is going on.",

I have seen several gamblers online/offline doing the same thing as you've said OP and it makes me feel bored listening to them and trying to explain what they had joined. Some just ignore the ToS and would click the \"I agree\" button on the terms of agreement without even reading the important details.Whenever I try to register to some sites, I usually ignore the unimportant details or skip it, but when it comes that it involves personal information and bank information, I won't skip the terms without fully understanding it, sometimes I even use google to simplify the terms coz sometimes there're sites that uses complicated words in their terms and conditions. Way back it almost bit me when I did try to bet on an online E-sports tournament on a betting platform, I was a total newbie at that time and I only wanted to have fun by supporting my favorite team at the same time earn a quick few bucks. It was then I didn't expect that the withdrawal fee is relatively expensive, while I only put a little amount. That time it was my first time betting online on platform using cryptocurrency, and then I was shocked that my initial balance cannot be withdrawn coz there're limits as to how much is the withdrawal, so I have to bet more if I wanted to withdraw, what's more funny is that, I need to reach a certain betting threshold before I could unlock the withdraw button.",
