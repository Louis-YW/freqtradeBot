  "content": "People have already talked about this coin countless times in these forums. Some thought it is a scam project and remove it from their phone. For those of you who haven't heard about the pi coin before let me give you a quick introduction:pi coin is a form of cryptocurrency that can be mined through a smartphone. A user just needs to install the app into their phone a start mining. They claimed to be a DAO which was maintained and secured by the community. They have a community of 33millions of users worldwide.Recently they announced their main net launch and mined pi is being transferred to their mainnet slowly. What amazed me is people are accepting pi as a form of payment. There were countless attempts to use BTC as a form of payment in store for purchases of goods which weren't very successful. But I got information that in Vietnam and some regions of china many restaurants, and shopping malls are accepting pi as payments. There is a huge P2P transaction is going on all over the internet for pi because of its demands. It seems totally hype to me but what is going on right now tells me one thing and that is Pi is not a scam.Some downside of Pi, in my opinion, is you can only use Pi through your smartphone and you need to pass KYC to use your mined Pi.",

I do not know why some restaurants and shopping malls accept Pi in Vietnam, maybe it is a way to encourage more people to join the Pi mining fever, or they think it is going to be the next bitcoin.

But unfortunately recovery doesn't support via forgotten email. And the affordable one might be via sms but roaming this didn't work.especially from the market you provide maybe in every country there is a coordinator. like everything is structured. I am in a neutral line maybe if you have connections with people from that pi coin. you can give news updates on your tread",

Well in my country there is huge craze for this coin but to get it you have to install a software on your phone which mines pi coin in the background. The problem started coming up when there was breach in the personal data over pi network and guess what was leaking? Well KYC documents in the open market. Peeps were so dumb they still use this mining on their phone in the hope that they will able to spend like this. All this is driven with the force of “together” stimulation and nothing more. I couldn’t believe its still working. The question is for how long?",

Till now I know people are selling their PI coins through P2P transactions in the open market. That means some people made money out of it. In long term, anything can be turned into a scam.

You know what when BTC came into public many called it a scam like many people saying about PI. I am not comparing pi with BTC nor I do care if PI becomes a successful project or not in long term. My attention is on what they are doing right now. In the current situation, I can see people are using it as a medium of payment. If people accept it then it has some value.",

      "body": "Pi coin is clearly a scam business without any future potential. Please understand one simple thing, you don't require any specialized hardwares for mining this coin, you can do it right from your phone. So it means this coin is available for free of cost, there is no production cost to it. Why do you think it will have a value?? People will just use their smartphones to mine! Secondly, you need to be KYC compliant before you can withdraw this coin. This way the owners are gathering millions of KYC data from its miners. Who knows, these data will someday available in the black market!Avoid this at all cost!",

They claimed that people can mine Pi coin even they don't connect to Internet or when their phone is off. What?Only it is enough to be a very clear signal of scam. More signals of scam, you can find. Rumor is recently people can use Pi coin as a payment  method, that is not true. It's only a half of story and more likely a scam marketing.",

Well when I came to know about it, I thought why would anyone pay for something that only takes one click and costs nothing? Then I found a crypto-related group on Facebook in which they explained that it is just a Scam, it has no blockchain and no fixed supply.
