I wish moderators to concentrate on Wall Observer thread and look into the two posts.The proof has been submitted to moderators. They can open the queue right now and check it and I'm sure admins can check older reports as well. If it was a bad report it should be a bad report, otherwise the users should be banned, not just the posts deleted.Obviously no one bothered to even check it, because it was blatant copy-pasta, reported properly including a link to the original. One of the users had been reported 3 or 4 times over the last few months.The point is not about the two posts, there have been many more ignored reports that already fell of my report list. The point is - remove the useless \"Report to moderator\" link in the WO thread because it's misleading and a waste of time.Edit: confusing wording.",

I tend to agree with your point but if moderators usually ignored reports on that thread it might as a reporter we avoid reporting that thread (adjustment) but in plagiarism case, that's very sensitive since it's a mortal sin here.  Moderator should look at it and ban that user. We need a clear answer to the moderators why they do ignore reports that come from the WO thread or mark them as \"unhandled\".So that reporters know this and avoid reporting that thread and just as is that there's a \"report to moderator\" button.I support the removal of the \"report to moderator\" button if that is the case but I want to hear first the moderator's side.Just my personal opinion.",

As much as WO is a special part of the forum where things are tolerated that are not tolerated in other parts of the forum, I don't see why plagiarism should be tolerated there. One-liners, over quotes, etc. are OK in my opinion, but not plagiarism.In theory there should be someone moderating plagiarism and other aspects, if we go by what is said in the thread:QuoteSpecial Wall Observer rules: bitcointalk.org moderators do not moderate the Wall Observer thread for multi-posting (except obvious spam), trolling, or on-topicness. Do not use this form to report those violations; instead, contact the thread owner. Reports of other rule violations are OK here.I imagine there will be some explanation for the unhandled plagiarism reports from suchmoon there, like the moderators are too busy and haven't even looked at it, but as a result of this thread they should deal with them.Quote from: Z-tight on May 26, 2022, 06:45:45 PMTheymos would not remove the \"report to moderator\" link, i guess you know that too because you sound sarcastic here.Of course he sounds sarcastic, I liked his approach to the problem.",
