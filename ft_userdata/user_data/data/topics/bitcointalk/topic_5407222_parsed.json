Even now, ApeCoin has surpassed the MC of the Sandbox.",

Ape token was getting hyped caused by its NFT being used as money laundering. Money NFT worth millions of dollars. That's actually bullshit. I meant if you are also aware if ape token doesn't have fundamental like sandbox. The developer of ape token was giving promise about its metaverse but you didn't even know for sure whether the metaverse will be so successfull like sandbox or not. If you are having a choice that has good fundamental and why do you need to stick into the new project with weak fundamental like ape token? This token getting hyped caused by so many manipulations from the whales.",

I think it has a decent marketcap and has a lot of room to grow based on trading aspect. In terms of project stance, compared to sandbox it has more potential since they started also their land platform and soon to be realize. In my opinion, between two then apecoin is a better opportunity as suggestion to OP.",

Well, do the research about that since you just want to ask about which coin is good as a choice.",

Thereâ€™s a huge price gap between APE And SAND, if you have the money to buy the bored APE then why not, but if you look fundamentally and see what is the best for long term investing then better go to SAND since they serve their purpose, they have the real usage in the market while APE is overhyped. Again, better to have your own preferences before investing because honestly both at ok, its just that the other project is pretty expensive compare to the other.",

This choice makes no more sense than the \"which to choose, Bitcoin or Binance\" option. Choose both, it will not make things worse, especially since both of these assets have good support and prerequisites for future growth.",

I mean lets face it, they both suck but the fact that people are aware that they both suck matters a lot to me. That means we are talking about people finally understanding what it means and how well it is, thats the most important case. You could have a million shitty coins and tokens but if people love them, they will go up, you could have a few great ones and if people think it sucks then they will end up being horrible. So all in all I have to say that people realizing apecoin is HORRIBLE and sandbox may had some good intentions but failed, thats very important.",

If you are looking for a very simple and straightforward way to design your own digital currency, this might be it. It might be a good choice for anyone new to designing their own currency, at least until someone decides to do something crazier. ApeCoin is impressive, but there's a lot it can't do. In my opinion, both have advantages and disadvantages so it all depends on why you have to choose one of them.",
