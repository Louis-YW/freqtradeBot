Twitter Account of the Real Satoshi Nakamoto -   https://twitter.com/SatoshiN4k4moto - Leez Hamilton  JournalistNews of the World Is this some sort of joke? How did you come by the conclusion that a random guy who just showed up on twitter and addressed himself as Satoshi is worth paying attention to? If Satoshi decides to come out from anonymity,  he will not stress the public in proving himself, just a signed message from one of his wallets will do. I understand the dramas and scam attempts that happens during bull run, so this one is no exception. Oh I forgot, Twitter(X) is now paying,  so building a new account using the biggest name in the digital space is not a bad idea.",

Come on you can't be that gullible, no offense though. Michael Jackson is not really dead. he has just changed his names and living in Panama with his news Girl Friend.  and you ?  you are living in Tokyo !   People would start taking you serious if you provide an evidence and not start spouting things out of nowhere.

I am here to let the Bitcoin community know the facts and debunk all the fiction. I assumed you are Andreas, if you are then you also met Satoshi three times.  The Hal Finney's  Twitter Account @HalFin is not belongs to Harrold Finney. That Account belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, He first created it for Halloween Finance@HalFin in 6 May 2007,  later Satoshi Read about Hal Finney's PGM Protocol and uploaded Hal's pic there to make a gift to Hal Finney. Satoshi rename the account Halloween Finance to  Harold Finney@HalFin. Satoshi Choose to Publish the White Paper  in 31 October on Halloween day because there is a story of Bitcoin that has a connection to Halloween day of 31 October 2006.",

Maybe those 4 are his other accounts, and then sharing some stupid comments.
