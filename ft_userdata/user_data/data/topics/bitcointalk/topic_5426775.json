Purchase some Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency with a promising future.What replacement coins would you recommend?Depends on how you look at it,Are you for the long haul? meaning you are willing to buy that amount and not touch it till the next bull run around 2024-2025?Or if you are short term investors then better look for altcoin in my opinion. Not sure how you can look at promising altcoins though because they are very hard to spot in the beginning unless you got lucky.",

      "body": "My take is nothing beats Bitcoin as far as investment goes specially if you are willing to invest money that you can afford to lose and then you will be a long term holder. And this is the right time to buy since the price is still very cheap. And just imagine if in the next bull run, the price goes to like 6 digits.But as far as risk goes, meaning more risk bigger reward, then there could be few altcoins that could be good as a investment, maybe a few ETH or BNB or ADA will do for you. But there could be more riskier, and there could be element of what we call pump and dump.",

I asked this because your account says you're still a newbie.The safest investment plan for a newbie is Bitcoin, if you are good at doing research on projects then you can make some picks from top 20 to top 30 on coinmarketcap. If altcoin is your heart desire you need some time to learn how to do good research, altcoins are very risky and more volatile than bitcoin, be careful.",

Purchase some Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency with a promising future.What replacement coins would you recommend?$800 is enough to buy bitcoins and keep them for a while. I do not recommend buying altcoins but my advice is to buy bitcoins because bitcoin is the main investment for investors.While there are promising altcoins, we will never know which altcoins because there are so many altcoins in the market. And even if you intend to buy the top ethereum or bnb, that doesn't guarantee that those coins can stay at the top spot in the next altcoin season.",

Bitcoin can help you gain profit as well as reduce risk to a minimum. Do not invest in altcoins if you are not capable of doing your own research, and do not listen to anyone's advice when investing in altcoins. Altcoins are very risky, unlike bitcoin.",

And you can also do a dollar-cost averaging on bitcoin.I think the most stable is obviously tether, busd, dai and other stable coins and then followed by alts like eth and ltc. Btc on the other hand is known to be a highly volatile coin but I think many people call it the most stable is due to the fact that it never fails them. Btc can recover no matter how low its price can go. It also exist first than the others so it had lots of experience that people have witnessed even not in actual but only by looking at the chart history.I do believe that btc can times 4 its price but for the two alts that you mention, I am sceptical about it. 10x is too high imo even though they are not that heavy as btc but they are still a good option or addition other than btc. Low market cap coins are risky yet rewarding however the op only said coins with a promising future. I think low market cap coins doesn't have that.",

Bitcoin is the main thing, the rest are many choices to choose which altcoin to like and with offers a bright future. In this case altcoins that already have high credibility can be an option for investing. But if you want to take a big risk, then even a new project can be an option, provided that we are really ready to lose.",

So investment depends on what you wanted but naturally I would asked you to invest in bitcoin.So what is the lesson of this story? Because eth has done very well since 2017 to date just as btc did, you did not gain because you weren't patient enough. In fact, assuming you were holding your eth since 2017 till now, you will still be in profit.So in essence, certain alts can also give profit provided the person has the ability to exercise patients.Btc no doubt is the best choice but the investment can only yield the necessary benefits only if the investor can wait, anyone buying btc now will not expect to earn good returns by next year due to the continuous bear period. So at the end of the day, waiting for market recovery is still important otherwise it will be all for nothing.",
