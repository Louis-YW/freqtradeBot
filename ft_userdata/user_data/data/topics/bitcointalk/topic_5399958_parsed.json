  "content": "Police in South Korea have contacted the country’s leading exchanges to freeze any funds linked to the embattled Luna Foundation Guard.The Luna/Terra algorithmic stablecoin crash, which reduced the coin's value by over 99%, crushed investor portfolios overnight earlier this month.However, this request is not demand and is not enforceable by law. Each exchange can choose how they would like to respond, but it is not yet known how they will react. Several prominent Korean investors requested that Do Kwon, CEO of Terraform Labs, be investigated and sued for the collapse of the UST stablecoin. This triggered the revival of the “Grim Reaper,” a Korean Financial and Securities Crime Joint Investigation Team.The actions by the National Assembly and the Korean authorities make it clear that Korea is willing to take the necessary steps to get to the bottom of the Terra ecosystem collapse imbroglio.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

      "body": "There might be a hidden story that have not even known by public. The police has been doing the right thing. There must be a request from the regulators to freeze all of funds that owned by LFG or do kwon. LFG has no fund left and that's probably owned by do kwon. I hope that police can trace whole funds that may be being stolen by the developers. We will be seeing the government put this as their main concern. Luna team was facing another problem here. They may be jailed in the future.",

I firmly believe that the collapse of $LUNA and $UST was not a coincidence but rather an obvious plan. It is time for us to say goodbye to all the obscure stablecoins like algorithmic stablecoins.",

      "body": "IMHO, I believe it should be done accordingly because as far as I know many South Korean investors were also affected by the recent Luna and UST Stablecoin price crash, And for that particular reason, I believe that there should be a deep and thorough investigation will be conducted to dig deeper into the cause and to know if what was really happened on that day. thats why I think that the South Korean police request has a valid reason that every exchange in South Korea should be followed.",

      "body": "this is a very good news for any holders of luna who have bought this shit scam coin at the peak price. If the police will able to trace whole of funds related with the do kwon and im sure that if people will request for the refund. If the police can block all of the funds that have not yet been moved to the new wallet other than exchange hot wallet and the holders of luna will able to get at least the good news about that. The regulators have more power to do that. If the exchange site was refusing it and it's better for the users who got scammed to take the legal action against exchange site as well.",

South korean regulators known about how big the impact that already made by this case to the image of south korea. This is become another problem for luna. I meant if the terra luna team will be lied with all of scenarios that already made and people gonna massively blaming luna foundation again. This is pretty interesting to seeing how long terra luna team can avoid the regulators. So far regulators have been doing very good job became a very responsive to help its retail invetors.",

Luna announcement attempts to relieve investors and the community of the negative impact after the price collapse at the lowest point, so whatever the team's efforts will not return to the previous condition because investors will not want to lose again. So anyway, we need to know the real facts based on reports from investigators if this case is raised for investigation.",

Fatman was actively doing this to answer the question about where was whole of money disappeared? In my opinion when people are seeing this and they must not invest in this shit. Regulators and community will find the truth. I hope that exchange site can follow the request by regulators and people will know about the truth as soon as possible. This will be also recovering the trust from the investors that already lost a lot from luna",
