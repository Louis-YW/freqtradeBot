I'm looking for some infos.What about, other than the average salary for a data entry job, rent prices? And is it safe to have an office with 10 300€ worth PCs?Average salaries vary from country to country and according to the type of job.  But in general, the average cannot be considered a large amount by calculating the value of the local currency with the dollar.  As for opening a service company, I recommend one of the two countries, Morocco or Tunisia, since they have a high demand for crypto adoption, and it will be easy to find employees, and their salaries can also be paid from abroad using Bitcoin or any of the cryptocurrencies.",

I thought the same point but maybe he wants all procedures to be legal since he may not have enough time to supervise the work.",
