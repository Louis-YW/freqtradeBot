Avoid Bequiet - in 25 years of being a pc nerd, all newly bought bequiet power supplies have died.",

      "body": "I consider the power consumption of each video card from the wall is 150 watts and the power consumption of the motherboard with the processor is 100 watts.A 1600 watt gold or platinum power supply would be a good choice. But if new coins for dual mining appear, and the video card consumes 30-40 watts more, then this power will not be enough.",
