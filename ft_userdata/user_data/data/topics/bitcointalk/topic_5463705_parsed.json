It started in 2017-18 when g20 first realized to set laws for cryptocurrencies thinking that it can't be banned, it was discussed in many forums but never have all the major countries agreed on a single opinion, simply because Asian countries want to ban it while Europeans want to use it. USA wants to use it but with very strict laws. Even now I think the scenario will remain same, it's hard to bring China and Europe on the same page regarding how to use cryptocurrencies.",

      "body": "This time it is different as India is hosting the G20 summit. India would want to get all 20 countries on the same page and by September we would know what might the regulation look like. We might see the regulation bill getting placed in the winter session of Parliament or after the election next year. One thing is clear crypto ban is not possible that I am certain about it. Knowing the ruling party and our PM, India wants to be known in the future as an important country in term of getting a decentralized entity regulated. This will be a big win for India's soft power considering China & the US being part of G20. We need to wait patiently for the upcoming announcement.",

I remember making a post on the same saying that the G20 countries are in favor of not banning crypto outright but will discuss on the possible regulations in future.Still we are hearing the same thing.

There will be many updates related to our concerns after the G20 meeting. I am also sure that an outright ban on crypto won't be on their agenda as crypto is like flowing water which is hard to stop. I am not expecting anything from the government of India in the upcoming winter session of Parliament. I would have felt more motivated if they had made some reduction on the tax part. As of now, It is highly unlikely as the ruling party is more focused on the central election next year. After the election, I am certain we will hear some positive and a few negative news from the government. I feel the same ruling party would come back and continue with their objectives.",

Because once if there are some global rules governments will start taking this as an opportunity instead of threat. Once that happens you'll see government taking a welcoming approach by reducing taxes etc. On bitcoin. India definitely will not keep the flat 30% taxes for very long.",

If not then they would see a dip in their voter base in the next election.",

I am not sure the Indian crypto community is big enough to make a difference in the results of election but if they make some relaxation which will bring some spotlight for them cause media and economic experts are going to debate about it which is still a popularity for the party which will surely helpful to make difference in their results.",

I won't be sure for the current year but even with 5 percent of Indian population they could make a significant difference to the election results. This time the ruling party would face issue if the think they will sweep the poll like last time. That is why I feel they would come up with regulation and more clarity to tax system before the upcoming elections.",

Even if the global rules are introduced I doubt India will lower the tax any time soon.They are accumulating a decent amount from taxing crypto. Only if a majority of population from India starts criticizing the government for high tax only then they will even think about lowering the tax rates.",

Once they have set up the bench mark it will never go down but always up. By squeezing the middle class is the only way to make revenue. India has one of the biggest middle class and what the government wants is to make it remain as a middle class. They won't allow you do go to BPL level nor will they allow you to reach the elite class. Never expect the government to reduce tax.",

Tax rates were as high as 97% after India got Independence and has now decreased to 30% taxation.Go through this article for a full read How income tax slabs have changed since IndependenceAlthough I understand your emotion and yes even I feel that government won't be reducing the tax anytime soon but we can at least hope for it to happen at some point of time.",

India and RBI is very negative about crypto and if you remember the crypto study committee led by Subhash Chandra Garg, they had proposed a blanket ban and also a punitive action on crypto users. So the position of crypto currency in India is very unstable at this moment. The current situation of 30% tax is just an interim arrangement and not final. So if the crypto regulation is an agenda item in upcoming G20 meeting, that is not going to be favorable for us. At least that's my take on this situation.",
