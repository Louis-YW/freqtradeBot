I think China is less harmful with Russia in the same side.As the facts showed, America is making provocations in many locations to provoke conflicts. It did this under the cover of NATO to reach Russia's borders via Ukraine. What caused an invasion, the price of which is paid by the whole world due to the policy of economic sanctions and the interruption of the export of Ukrainian wheat. And here it is repeating the same plan near its enemy, China.",

The relationship between the two is rapidly changing. I don't think both countries will become better between their trading relationship, more likely the China will grow bigger and have enough to satisfy their needs on their own so high chances are there to become new super power. USA may change their policy in the meantime and will concentrate more on growing their economy instead of playing the political game all around the world and I expect them to stop acting like the world police in near future.",

Russia is the most threatening, bullying, scheming country in the world at this point. You can never be sure what they want and what they'll do, which is why whole Europe is running to NATO because they see that Russia says one thing and does the opposite.

You certainly have not heard of America's crimes in Iraq. Have you ever heard about Abu Ghraib prison or about the rape of men? Yes, it is rape of men, not women. Do you have an idea about the crimes of the Israeli occupation in Palestine? Everything Russia does is not equal to 1 percent of America's crimes throughout its history (Iraq, Vietnam and all the proxy wars led by the intelligence services).China, of course, was never a colonial country, and it suffered from a long colonial era in which it paid the highest price.",

I was shocked to read that because as of today the economy of China is still on the verge to slip into recession because of their present crisis. This is one of the reasons why they are being careful to invade Taiwan. With the US having a GDP of $24.85 trillion after the increase in the second quarter by $465.1 billion, China's GDP stands at $19.91 trillion. The population of China is helping with this but the economic growth of the US is far better.",

Do you really want to compare 1 year of Russian invasion to a century of wars the US took part in? If you really want to play that game, add all the murders of the Stalin era, the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, the invasion of Finland, occupation of Poland and so on... Vietnam? The Russians were there as well.",

And the dirty secret of global politics is that the U.S. gets away with a lot because their interests aligns with eastern Europe. Same goes for Israel and U.S./Europe. Wiping Ukraine off the map only serves the interest of Russia and China.",

Both sides are criminals in their own way. Therefore, one cannot be preferred over the other.Just as America practiced its terrorism for years, Russia has a long history of massacres and genocides during the Soviet era. At least America did not practice terrorism against its own people as Stalin did.",

Things are changing, but in the past there was a big enough difference in perceived value of certain material things that the Chinese people were lifted up from some of their poverty by the slaving techniques of the USA, while the USA people received benefits of more products in some areas.",
