      "body": "People do not know what cold wallet devices are. They are devices that are perfectly airgapped immediately just after the OS has just been reinstalled.It would be easy for such malware to reveal all passwords saved on online clouds. Like Google cloud through Chrome broswer. Chrome now log users in automatically and all passwords that were backup are now revealed through Chrome. Even this has been possible many years ago without Chrome broswer, but the kind of devices we are having presently as the world is advancing are making it easier for malware to easily penetrate.Above all, avoid malware. It is easy to avoid malware if you learn how to.",

I can't find anything that says where the software would be installed from so I'd assume it's there.Using a search engine in this case is probably all that's needed to stop you downloading a piece of malware like this though (and clicking on the first non ad). Although perhaps some eth forks like harmony one got a bit confusing (with similar extensions but different networks and two address types).",

      "body": "Okay, another malware in an endless series has been discovered - but what nonsense is this about calling all these affected wallets cold wallets? Of course, some of the listed wallets can be used as cold storage, but some members of this forum who are not beginners should know the clear difference between hot crypto wallets, hardware wallets, and cold wallets.The whole meaning of what the author calls \"cold wallets\" is absolute protection against any online threat, including malware.",
