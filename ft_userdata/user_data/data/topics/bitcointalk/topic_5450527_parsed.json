  "content": "It has become a norm for a guy to pay for dates when ever he takes a girl out. He is also expected to hold the door of the car open to show some sort of meekness. He is also expected to keep up with giving her gifts on her birthdays, her friends birthdays, her dogs birthdays and even on the day Jesus died; well that's fine.But are we ever going to get these special treatments back or is our reward in heaven??",

      "body": "Well I think a man does know this are things that he must do for his girl. We take them out and hold the doors because we are men and this is nice thing to do for them. All of us like gifts for a birthday and she will give you gifts back the same you give them to her.If you are a good man to her then you will get special treatment. There is all kinds of special treatments but we men most want to be loved by her.",
