  "content": "What happened:ilghan has tried for almost a year to get investors for his mining after that fintech now defi or whatever venture, at every single point lying about numbers, their experience, the license, and the actual project itself.I can understand when a newbie tries to start a business and he has no clue how to do it but at this point heliosfund has just turned into a scam trying to get some money no matter what.User profile:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2933399Archived website:https://archive.ph/LYOpNArchived topic:https://ninjastic.space/topic/5347550First lie:Quote from: ilghan on July 04, 2021, 03:19:32 PMwe are starting a fintech based on mining, fully regulated with a EU license:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xeu564gK2D2HcODvy-5gihYBiFir4CCe/view?usp=drivesdkWhen caught he admitted there was actually no license and as time passes there will be none:Quote from: ilghan on July 05, 2021, 08:09:29 AMwe are in touch with https://alphaumi.com/ in order to submit the application for the license in Estonia.Claimed there will be no ICO or Token sales:Quote from: ilghan on July 12, 2021, 09:31:45 AMwe're not doing any ico, whoever is willing to invest in us because and believes in our business model is gonna have convertible notes/equities in return, as a  normal company /startup .Another lie:Quote from: ilghan on June 02, 2022, 12:15:32 PMGlad to announce the litepaper of our $MiFi token:  ~We are going to run a private token presale of the $MiFi tokenBack to the mining business, when confronted with his own lies in this post,  where basic math showed he was running his miners at least 10 times more efficient than everything on the market he suddenly swifted the whole business from bitcoin mining to altcoin miningQuote from: ilghan on July 28, 2021, 09:54:47 AMwe mainly mine altcoins, not bitcon. that's why we make money.Company experience:Quote from: ilghan on August 12, 2021, 11:46:33 PMDon’t worry about experience , our cto has been living off mining for the last 7 years , from early fpga to ASICS through liquid cooled fpga and enhanced bitstreams,  everything . He’s the cto, highly skilled miner , no mystery of sort : https://twitter.com/luca85ogrumo?s=21Turns out the expert with 7 years of mining was also present on this forum, probably his alt, who was not only doing bounty hunting for every shitcoins but was also having problems keeping 6 video cards cool.More fake claims:On the website, they claimed to have been \"seen' on Nasdaq, lies.300% APR claimsStock photos:http://www.heliosfund.io/images/about_us.pnghttps://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/shot-young-man-working-on-computer-1041313726How this is going to work, majik?QuoteWe produce a basket of different cryptocurrencies, in the spirit of diversification. Subsequently, those coins go through the Mi.Fi protocol, where a smart swapping strategy at the best market conditions and a DeFi integration are being applied. The final output will be a larger amount of Bitcoin, which we hold indefinitely.No proof of the former mining equipment, no proof of the claimed datacenter, no proof of a license.",

I invested a lot of Thousands of dollars with the platform only to be disappointed when it was time for withdrawals, They refused to let me take my funds and insisted that I pay some percentage in form of taxes before I withdraw. I was very upset but for fear of losing my initial deposit I had to pay, but these miscreants still refused to let me withdraw. I had to make several complaints to the Agency which referred me to Chargebacknow(at) Aol . com they took up my case and help retrieve my funds",

In fact, every doubt you had has been well explained, no problems at all from our side.  You have zero legitimacy just as you have zero licenses, zero projects, zero assets, and zero plans other than scamming some poor victims who ouwl believe the load of crap on your website that changes every quarter according to the hype you want to attach your \"project\" too.If you had any legitimacy you would show something from your mining operations that should have been working for years now and at the rates claimed you should afford easily to start your business without begging on go fund me ...But the fact that you just copy-pasted the same message on both threads is a bit reassuring, you're running low on credible excuses.",
