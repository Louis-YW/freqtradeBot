      "body": "Interesting. I've never heard of on-chain betting for esports before. The main challenge was the oracle, i.e., no oracle providing sports matches data on-chain. Bookmaker is apparently leveraging Azuro protocol to solve this. Need to read more about these two projects to get a better understandingMany exciting gambling projects popped up in the L2 layers recently and this is definitely one of them. Thanks for posting this.",

It's on polygon so it's much cheaper than ethereum but still congestion can happen and it did happen.",

      "body": "I like the idea of the on-chain because of the possibility of not leaving more of your coins in the centralized site, which is interesting to dwell on and verifiable. Having the non-custodial aspect makes me comfortable with having to bet on it: Trustless and no declined payouts. Thanks for sharing this, OP. This is interesting.",
