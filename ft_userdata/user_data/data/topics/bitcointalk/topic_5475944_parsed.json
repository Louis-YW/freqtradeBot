OP... Let me take this your post as generalizing and relating it also outside this forum. We should know by now that humans are totally different from another and have this special characteristics can be of good nature or bad. One thing to know for sure is the fact that everyone has their bad sides, we all are humans. People tend to have their bad sides in aspect of having pride,  the feeling of knowing or having it all. Judging, having this attitude is bad and not encouraging and should be put to stop. This can lead to missing opportunities meant for such person due to raising of shoulder and knowing it all. Creating unnecessary awareness should not be mistaken for being outspoken, knowing when to speak, how to speak and knowing what to say is necessary to keep a person more responsible and looked upon instead of opening one's mouth and keep saying rubbish or being boastful.",

So this issue of people boasting/showing off in the society as one mistake most young people make while starting life, most especially the so called Yahoo boys, because I'm sure they are the once that show off the most, maybe after cashing-out a couple of thousand of dollars, forgetting that money never last, and as such very good to invest rather than spending it on flashy things. But for those who hustle hardly for their money, I doubt you if those people will have time to show off.",

Judging, having this attitude is bad and not encouraging and should be put to stop. This can lead to missing opportunities meant for such person due to raising of shoulder and knowing it all. Let me correct you slightly, being proud is a good thing, its not bad at all, pride helps you maintain confidence. Whatever you're proud of, you'll give in your best. Proud people boosts the confidence of others cos they know their personal quality and are confident and courageous in their dealings, so people look up to them, admire them and learn from them. They're sources of inspiration to people of low confidence, very likable people and they stand for what they believe in without fear of opposition. They're very friendly people too and associate freely with others. There's a difference between being proud and being full of yourself, the latter is the very destructive one cos when you're full of yourself, you  underrate others and see only yourself as important while others are minors. that's when you've started damaging yourself and your career. People who are full of themselves are very irritable and tends to miss out on good opportunities that comes their way cos nobody wants to mingle with them or share valuable information with them cos they neither value people, nor believe that something good can come from them.",

Sometimes e good make person dey always dey calm down to learn something. otherwise you no go ft achieve anything for life. Sometimes when you get update and you no gree to shear with your friend, e go affect you later, because that your update go expire one day, and you go need help from people wey you been no gree give that your update. you forget say life na turn by turn. The end of your journey fit be the starting of another person. So make we they try to be calm and not to do like say we don arrive.

      "body": "Does feeling that you have arrived or bigger means you have the world? What is pride? What does it mean to feel bigger? What does it mean to feel you have arrived? These are questions worth asking. Most people relatively are poor but they feel they have arrived and are bigger because they are happy with the little they have which means feeling bigger doesn't measure material success. Someone who feels bigger is the person proud? In my opinion, no. Most people have self-confidence and they feel they cannot be oppressed and so live in a way that people find it difficult to look down on them (self-respect). Misconceptions about people and how they should behave are becoming a perplexing issue in the Nigerian polity. This leaves us with a question? How should people behave to please everyone? Should people be humble? If we say people should be humble no matter what they have achieved, then what is humility? A man who tells the world his success story is the person proud? Yes, you are proud of what you have achieved but it doesn't mean that such a person feels nobody is better than him or cannot achieve such height. Most stories or attitudes are put up just to pass a message. So it will interest us more to get the message and better our living. Does not telling the world your success story means that you are humble? In my thinking, it doesn't portray you as a humble person either. There is no prescription on how best a person should live meaning that even if you feel bigger and as long as you don't step on people you are living the best life in as much you don't go against societal laws. Feel big if that makes you excel but don't be proud. In my thinking, pride is when your conscience is gone.",

This are all good but we are looking at pride from just where it becomes the opposite and tends to be destructive to others.Having this prde with a touch of arrogance is something to avoid and those set of people should be avoided as they will always want to feel on top in everything and will never want to see you do better than them, this can lead to some bad scenerious in a case of the persons capability in doing such. People with the wrong pride are bound to be greedy and under rates the ideas of others and this will alter the self confidence of people around him, where else they feel they know nothing and under estimate their capability.",
