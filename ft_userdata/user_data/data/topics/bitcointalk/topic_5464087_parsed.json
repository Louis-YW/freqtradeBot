Can we begin with Tectum blockchain? Currently listed on Mexc, CoinHarbour, Bitget, and Bitmart. It's also listed on DEX including RocketX, SushiSwap, Open Ocean and OKX Dex.This blockchain boasts of being the fastest blockchain with 1.38 million TPS. Boasts of being the first transaction-less payment system etc.Has a flagship product known as \"Soft Note\" which is a digital currency.I'll include the link to its website so anyone who wishes to give an analysis about it can see more information. https://softnote.com/Subsequently new projects will be added to this thread",

      "body": "@OP.Seems to me that if you use paper Softnotes (at https://softnote.com/), you still need to verify the person you receive the notes from. Why? Because a good counterfeiter could make any number of the same note he has received. So, the receiver needs to verify every note.Fiat counterfeiters make loads of fake cash all the time. It's not verifiable unless you, the receiver of the cash, verify it with a bank.With Tectum Softcoin, since you are going to get a new code when you become the receiver, there is no need for a Softcoin 'dollar' bill. Just print the hashes out on a sheet of paper and trade sheets of paper... since you will be going through the verification process with the Tectum blockchain, anyway, just to get your new, private 'code' as the new owner.Is there a way to simplify this process? Perhaps some kind of QR or bar code, so you can scan it with your phone?",
