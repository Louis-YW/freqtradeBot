  "content": "Hi all,I have been in crypto just over one year now and it has been an interesting year to say the least.When I first started my crypto journey I didn't know anything about cycles and just started investing as there was a lot of noise around it at the time. Due to the crash we have experienced this year my portfolio is currently 40% down but I have not sold anything have just kept dollar cost averaging and buying more at the bigger drops. I am expecting most of 2023 to be the same and I plan on sticking with my dollar cost averaging but must admit there have been days recently where I have panicked slightly asking myself If I am doing the right thing investing in crypto. I think this is down to constantly seeing the market fall and feeling like it is going to take a lot for it to reverse and see better days again.I am just after any advice or personal experience from others who have been through previous bear markets?",

The only thing I want to know is what crypto you are investing right now because DCA might give you a terrible loss if ever you are investing on shitcoins that token vesting is still not completed. Your money will just become an exit liquidity to early investors. Do a thorough research about tokenomics of the crypto you are holding. Much better if you will just purchase Bitcoin during this crypto winter since it’s only coin that have a high survival rate compared to shitcoin to make your DCA time worth it in the future.",

Luckily I am quite patient and happy to wait another 12-18 months to see profit. I have Bitcoin plus 6 altcoins of which 4 of them I will not touch for a while as I feel we will go lower so would rather catch the very bottom which would help reduce my average price a lot. For now I am just dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin and 2 of the altcoins I am more confident with.",

You've adopted a good strategy to accumulating your coin but the question now is on what type of cryptocurrencies are you really investing on, remember there are many shitcoins out there and you need to be very care by making your investments majors on bitcoin then few other cryptocurrencies you're sure of after you might have conducted enough research on them.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on December 15, 2022, 10:09:32 AMI am expecting most of 2023 to be the same and I plan on sticking with my dollar cost averaging but must admit there have been days recently where I have panicked slightly asking myself If I am doing the right thing investing in crypto. I think this is down to constantly seeing the market fall and feeling like it is going to take a lot for it to reverse and see better days again.Provided you have the good understanding of how risky some cryptocurrencies could be to invest on them, taking for instance the FTX scam/bankruptcy the recently occur, alot of people were affected and there's no remedy to this kind of attack, crypto in general follows the dictate from bitcoin price, others fall massively whenever bitcoin falls while sone never regain back to existence after their entire collapse which makes bitcoin the king of cryptocurrencies, just know the risk involved before you invest on cryptos but choose bitcoin for the start and have it to cover higher percentage of your investment than any other.",

I am not even going to mention previous cycles and bear markets. But if you have taken the necessary precautions and understand that the money you invest in an asset such as bitcoin is not something you necessarily need today or tomorrow no matter what, you won't be to concerned about the current value. No one likes to see red across their entire portfolio, but we are all in the same boat. If you believe in the technology long-term, concentrate on something else and don't beat yourself up because of the current state of the market.",

What are you DCAing? Is that BTC only or do you have altcoins as well? If your portfolio has altcoin as well, I guess it's a risky method you are following; if only BTC, I guess there's nothing to be worried about. In 2019, I created a thread about why DCA is such an investment model in case of BTC that you shouldn't worry much about. You can check the previous return history for DCA method here- https://dcabtc.com/",

I think this is down to constantly seeing the market fall and feeling like it is going to take a lot for it to reverse and see better days again.Occasional panic and questioning yourself whether you are doing the right thing is perfectly normal when you are experiencing bear market for the first time. I went through exactly the same thing duirng my first bear market and everyone else I know. Its completely normal to think that bitcoin may never reach previous prices, and the more people feels that way, closer we are to the bottom. Like you, I am also doing DCA (unlike you I wasn't waiting for price drops and instead I was buying at regular intervals no matter the price) during previous bear market and what I can tell you what helped me, and that is to remove all price tracking apps that you have and to stop visiting Coingecko/CMC and to stop looking at prices in general. Once you stop obsessing yourself with the current price, you will find it much easier to focus on your goal, and that is to get as much bitcoin as you can.",
