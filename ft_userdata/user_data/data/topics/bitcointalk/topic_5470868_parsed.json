  "content": "According to Coingecko, at the time of writing, BTC dominance is at 49.3%.This lead me to the following chart (by Coingecko), which represents the market dominance history.According to this image BTC has always been far ahead from other shitcoins.What I am curious to know is what happened in 2017 and in 2021. I have been searching on the internet and I have found that in 2017 ETH had the Byzantium fork which reduced the block reward from 5 ETH to 3 ETH. But ETH has no max supply so I was expecting that this wouldn't affect its price so much. At the same time, I couldn't really find anything related to Bitcoin in 2017, but I was surprised to see that BTC's price went from $1000 to $20K in a year. So if there was a 20x increase in price, how could the dominance go that low?In 2021, I remember everyone talking about NFTs, so I guess this explains why shitcoins gained market cap.",

And it's like every week there's a new ICO project and investors are flocking into those projects and filling every crowd sale that they're getting. That was the time that when it's likely every project becomes successful every launch not until the bull run ended and 2018 came and still have tried but that's like the slow death of the ICO era.

Correct?",

Bitcoin's dominance remains a benchmark for why shitcoins can still have play in the market. There will be no signs of capitalist domination of Bitcoin.

So, could history repeat in the future and have the same impact on the dominance? Does it scare you? Perhaps it makes no difference at all.Yes the dominance of bitcoin reduced to its lowest low in 2017, because of ICO of new coins. Before 2017 you can notice almost 90% of bitcoin dominance then because there was actually almost no Alticoins then but when 2017 came the likes of ripple and Ethereum had there ICO and you know how the market reacts to a new coin. The likes of litecoin, Solana also were in the ICO stage and with bitcoin already having high supply people really wanted to have a thing that could pump more and this was what actually Happened. The ripple itself had a huge pump of about 36,000 and Solana also pumped although it was in 2018 but its dominance was because it didn’t follow the POW protocol then and was looking different. I wouldn’t be scared that the dominance of 2017 by Altcoins will happen again because people have seen their value bitcoin holds over them. In that 2017 year what the likes of ripple and Solana promised were fast transaction and people have found a way through that. So I don’t think many people will invest in new ICO projects agains like they did before",

      "body": "Market dominance of altcoins tends to increase during a bull run as both the old altcoins experience a surge, and new ones come to life and start rising again. This is a common market sentiment during a bull run, but it shouldn't be viewed as a consistent trend because the real market dominance of a particular coin can only be measured when the market is neutral, much like our current situation.As of now, according to CoinMarketCap (CMC), market dominance is at 51%. This is because the market hasn't seen any significant movement, and investors often tend to put their money back into Bitcoin once the bull run subsides. If I recall correctly, back in 2021, Bitcoin dominance dropped to just over 30%, which is a significant difference compared to the current scenario, right? The reason behind this is that, despite Bitcoin's impressive rally where it reached $60k at that time, altcoins also had their own bull party. So, it's a bit of a complex situation; you can't really gauge the true state of the market during both bull and bear seasons since they tend to be either overvalued or undervalued.",

ICOs was big because of big project in bounties, but after 2017 which is 5 years, a legit bounty is really really low than the failed and scam project. How can we expect \"repeat\" when most people aware if bountiy is full of scammers?",
