  "content": "I know what I am about to say might sound awkward to some of you but I would start by appealing that you bear with me as I am here to learn so I could gain more knowledge and insight of how things are going on here. Although I have been a member of this platform for long now but as we all know learning is a continues process and as time goes on  curiosity arises to clear ones doubt or misunderstanding. For long now I have been on this thought and I was wondering what happens to merit and Smerit of banned accounts. Is there any way it is been extracted from those banned accounts for it to be integrated back into the system so that merit could go round through the merit source to members who deserves it or once an account is banned everything about that account is gone and merits on that account is burnt or is there any other process or things done with the merit of those accounts because I know once an account gets banned the owner does not have access again to some vital profile assets such as the Smerit.  I know for sure merits are formed possibly through minting or other likely processes which requires it to be easily integrated here for easy access by members.looking at this when you access your merit status you could see it for yourself.Does it mean that  the above is what exactly happens or otherwise. The floor is open for discussion as I stand to be corrected if I am wrong. I look forward to seeing the admins and moderators comment on this so we could get knowledge of how the process goes. If also this board is not the right board for this post, you are free to channel me to the right board for it.Thanks.",

You can rest assured that they're not... well, in a way. If I may assume, your worries come from an understanding that Merit and sMerit are limited, and what circulates here and now are the same numbers being generated since the birth and introduction of merit system.There are group of people called Merit Source, there are several thread talking about these members, but one that probably will give you a good and easy understanding is this one. Simplified, Merit Source are members who get extra sMerit, \"minted merit\" if you may, from the forum, so the amount of circulating Merit and sMerit keeps being replenished, it's not constant and stuck at one number like \"total supply\" of a token. Please have a read and don't hesitate to ask here if you have further questions.",

You don't need to be over worried towards merits maybe, and however whenever you are doing research there's always a curiosity for one to know all things especially how the systems works and functions even though you are not in that position to know how is being operated but, as a scholar you needed those knowledge to add to your upstairs as an added advantage and value to your life.Ban account is an account that has no access any longer to the forum and whenever account are being ban, this shows that such person doesn't have this will power to make alternate account to continue the forum any longer, because the forum prohibit such acts and if caught for any reason their newly created account are also subjected to be ban as well. So, I suggest you should be more creatives and keep all the rules pure and clean, then try to move on and do not allow this to overweigh you down as I think there are more important things to learn here.",

It also determines ones forum rank and as such very important on the platform. So based on your curiosity and to the best of my knowledge, merit are given to merit sources to distribute to members who are deemed fit to have it and as such every one member can distribute it accordingly to everyone who deserves it too. Merit I think are not minted. Possibly, they are just some kind of distributive data in digits as they have no maximum or minimum supply in existence. They are given out by Theymos to merit sources to do their work and that makes it easier for everyone due to receive.Since there is every tendency that merit is not minted, there is every possibility that it could be extracted from banned account but I don't think that would be necessary as it is clearly stated as uploaded by you OP. So Theymos distributing it is a good one to meet up with the activities on bitcointalk platform.",

This is the second post am seeing concerning this merit and smerit of a thing today and i just wonder if the forum is really that short of smerits. Most people who complain about this are mostly low rank member and i feel maybe they think they don’t get merited after making a post. All they are concerned about is earning merits, merits are earned when you provide quality content to the forum thats if another member thinks it is useful or meaningful. The forum is not short of merits in my opinion though i still think the forum needs additional merit sources since people are complaining about shortage of smerit and low merit circulation instead of retrieving smerit from banned accounts.",

Second - you can still login from your banned account regardless if it's temporary ban or permanent ban. It's just that you can't post - can not send PM and distribute merit on posts that you find useful.
