  "content": "Merit farming in the WO thread has gotten way out of hand.Its been a problem for years now but really ramped up this year. Although I can't prove it, I strongly suspect we're now seeing merit farmers creating alt accounts which they use to send merits back to their main accounts, with the end goal being to enroll as many alts in signature campaigns as they can.The typical merit farmer post is a copy/pasted tweet from a large bitcoin-focused Twitter account, complete with picture and (often in smaller text) the word \"source\" with a link to the tweet. These accounts are literally just taking popular tweets and pasting them in WO for no other reason than to get merits. You'll see them on just about every single page of the thread this year.This type of post is bad for a few reasons: - It is a distraction that dilutes honest conversation between good faith participants. - It is lazy, dishonest, and often wholly unnecessary. - It lends to promotion of a culture of cheating.The meriting of these posts is creating a positive feedback system where merit farmers are encouraged to continue this behavior... as a result the only skill they're actually developing is how to extract merits from senior WO posters.The simple solution to the problem is to disable JayJuanGee",

As I can recall commenting and voting on a similar thread that has a different title, maybe this is just an answer to your (Op's) answer and solution to the raised issue. I have come across JayJuanGee on a few threads, and he is a good merit distributor, and at the same time, he knows how to identify a good post when he sees one, no matter the page where the post is located on a particular thread. If the issue of merit farming is to be addressed and a permanent solution provided, then I don't think disabling just one member is the best option, as he is not the only one given merit there.It should be better to disable the entire merit system on that board than just disable one person, as other merit-source and non-merit-source members will still send merit to those merit farmers unknowingly.",

      "body": "I doubt if this will ever happen under theymos' watch.I am not a wall observer regular, but JayJuanGee seems to be the kind of merit source who tries as much as possible to distribute merit across different boards and not just wall observer. I say this because I have received some merits from him a couple of times, yet I am a low merit earn because of the boards I post in at times.In fact, he and vapourminer seem to read through different threads and merit whenever they can, and I don't even remember ever directly interacting with them. I have seen some users abuse the merit system so bad with their reorganized alt accounts and have gone unpunished.I think we shouldn't discourage such good, unbiased merit sources. Maybe try to talk to him rather than just disable (censor) him.",

I don't think you should be much worried about this and as a result, requesting to disable JJG. Come on.If the users are generating such low level spam, report them. Disabling JJG isn't the solution. Instead, maybe you can request for disabling certain rank users. Maybe, only Hero+ can post. Or maybe Sr+. That is how you can prevent the merit farming there. If JJG is disabled in WO, someone else may do the same. The problem will be there forever.",

      "body": "I would strongly disagree to disable JJG or any other member of the WO from distribution of merits or from posting there. We all know that JJG has been doing great on the forum and he has been meriting posts outside of the WO thread. There are so many good members of the WO thread on this forum and they aren't doing anything wrong by meriting the posts. I don't think that disabling a member or merit system from that thread could be any helpful for the forum because I have personally seen many members who aren't contributing good information to the forum and still they are getting so many merits from their local boards. If someone wants to take proper action against merit fishing then they should also consider the merit distribution of those local boards.I don't know why but I think these type of posts are a type of attack on the WO thread and its members because we all know that most of the members of that thread are quite mature and they have more knowledge than most of us and if those members are meriting a post then they have their valid reasons behind that. As far as I know the merit distribution is someone's own right and as far as they are doing it in a fair way then no one should pose fingers on them. If we all continue to oppose the merit sources then most of the merits will only go to members who have already established themselves on this forum and the new members may not get the merits they deserve to get. I have personally noticed that JJG has been doing really great on the forum and he has been meriting many posts outside of the WO thread. I mostly give time to read JJG's posts on WO thread because most of his posts are full of information and someone like him deserves to be part of WO thread forever. The WO thread is known for its merit distribution levels and if someone gets merited because of posting something valuable on that thread then there's nothing wrong with that. I request everyone to give a second thought before creating such threads because it can hurt the feelings of the ones who have been doing fairly on this forum for a long time.",

I have just visited there once thereabout and i noticed there are people who are farming merits, i was even thinking you wanna talk about those that are giving out merits in 10 or 50 merits.Please leave JJ out of this whole drama and or maybe, you can list how he is farming merits probably had he given out 100  merits at a go?",

Although from time to time he gives two for one post.There have been quite a few times that when I have logged in the forum I have seen that I have been given a merit, I have gone to see who and it turns out that it was JJG for a post I wrote months ago on page 3 of a thread. When I go to the thread I see that he has distributed other merits along the thread, so I can see that he has read the thread from cover to cover distributing merits to the posts that he considers worthy. And the thread is maybe 8 pages long, being 3 months old. I think that level of dedication to distribute merits is unrivaled.",

It's hard to abuse by begging a merit source like JayJuanGee and it's my point here.About merit distribution of JayJuanGee in Wall Observer, I did not check but I believe he is a good merit source by what I saw him distributing merit beyond Wall Observer thread.Why do we need the special solution on JayJuanGee, rather than all members in Wall Observer thread including other merit sources?Honestly I think it is unnecessary and unfair too. Posts, if are good in quality, should be awarded merit no matter where they are, in WO or beyond WO.Meriting poor quality posts exists in other boards, other threads too, not only restricted in WO. So if it is special restriction on WO or JJG, something is unfair and totally wrong.theymos can revert merit transactions, if you have yet known about it. Even revert past merit transactions is not a perfect fair solution for everyone.",

JayJuanGee is one of the best merit cyclers I know, and I don't think he sends it to those who don't share value, and it's regularly 1 merit per post. How then is it hard for anyone to overlook that?I share your view, and here is my response that almost totally supports your view in a similar post. But it would have been fair had it been you directed it towards another person as there are countless there abusing this merit. If not more, I've seen someone sending 32 merits to a very simple and unqualified post. Why leave such people and point an accusing finger at one of the best merit cyclers who mostly gives 1 merit per post?I think there is more to this.",

I don't have a grasp on the magnitude of the problem, though I have seen that JJG usually gives 1 merit when a post is mediocre, but I disagree that he shouldn't be called out if he's a big part of the problem (and if it's a big problem to begin with).  He could hand out 1 merit/post, but that thread has how many posts in it?  It's a lot last I checked, so those merits could add up quickly.And just saying, if I was doing something the community thought was inappropriate I'd hope I'd be called out on it either in a thread or, as already happened, by PM.  Then again, that's just me.  Some folks would react to a thread like this with extreme defensiveness and it could end up being counterproductive.  At least it gives everyone a chance to voice their opinion, though.",
