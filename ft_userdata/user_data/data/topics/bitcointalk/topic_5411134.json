He came out of nowhere and has started writing good posts. I don't know if he has any personal experience with the mentioned service, but you can always PM him and ask.",

I'd like to hear some feedback, and maybe a comparison between them and some other similar services.I never tried it, but I checked their pricing and it could be interesting if you want to run light node on Tor with BTCPayserver, but for anything more serious it's way to expensive. Maybe try sending PM to BitGoba, he is our local Lightning Network expert and I think he tried everything currently available for LN Interesting thing about VoltageCloud is that Alphabet invested a lot of money in their business.",

I will give that to you for $7.50 a month.....do you really want that?Setting something up in the AMZN cloud or similar will be different.I don't see a physical address or anything else so I would be wary.Come to think about it https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5364742.0 I'll host one of these for $5.00 a month.........-Dave",

So either their site is not mobile friendly or I just missed it.However, looking at that address it is someones house not even an office in a strip mall or one of those shared office places, just a house.

If it's DaveF hosting it's a different story.Don't get me wrong I like seeing more things like this in the BTC space. But without more info this service may or may not be worth it.-Dave",

But hey, who started in the garage? Wasn't it Bill Gates or Steeve Jobs? Yeah, the infrastructure could be outsourced, but the business model with a pay-per-hour price is also popular in the Hosting niche (AWS, Digital Ocean, etc...) However, if Alphabet invested money in Voltage, as mentioned above, I doubt it has been done for a guy with servers in the garage",
