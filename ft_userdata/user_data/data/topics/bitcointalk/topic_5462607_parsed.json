  "content": "Despite recent financial and reputation challenges, MindGeek, the company behind Pornhub, has managed to stay surprisingly profitable. They've got some secret sauce going on – even when MasterCard and Visa decided not to play nice and process payments for certain sites like Pornhub, MindGeek's big shots expected to rake in loads of cash.In 2021, they were looking at operating margins around 27%, and in 2022, they bumped that up to almost 30%, leaving Facebook's Meta trailing behind at 25%. MindGeek's not your regular Joe when it comes to adult websites; they're making bank without attracting those fancy high-end advertisers, all thanks to keeping their costs in check. But hey, it wasn't all smooth sailing – getting the boot from Visa and Mastercard knocked their potential earnings down by a whopping 40% in 2022.Still, if those payment giants decide to come back to the party, MindGeek's thinking they could bounce back with about $455 million in 2022 revenue, just a smidge under the $460 million they claimed back in 2018. All these juicy details were dished out to possible investors, and it looks like it paid off – Ethical Capital Partners ended up scooping up MindGeek last month.In a twist of resilience and financial finesse, MindGeek's journey through challenges leads to acquisition success.https://www.semafor.com/article/07/27/2023/inside-pornhubs-finances",
