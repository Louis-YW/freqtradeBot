On any exchange that supports p2p, you will need to verify if that is what you mean by zero fee. Know that these exchanges are centralized exchanges that can demand for KYC at any time if they want to know your identity.",

Withdrawal fee is zero? Im not sure if there is a major exchange or good place to exchange without any fees. Possibly on new markets, that is start up offering free fees doe the first few months but later will open fee structure payment. Even on dex there is a fee in a form of transaction/gas fee so I highly doubt there is a platform for that, or if ever there is, be skeptical of it.",

FTX is having a vision from traders to the traders and so many fees collected from the traders being re-distributed again through giving big discount fees. I remember when this is really helpful to face the big withdrawal fees on ethereum blockchain and so you may not find another FTX and FTX is the only one that available in the market.",

Do not be deceived by no kyc exchanges that are centralized, thy have the complete control, do not be surprised if such exchange sieze your cryptocurrencies and mandate you to provide you personal identity documents like drivers license or national identity card.",

So far im still good with this exchange site. It's not yet making the KYC verification as a mandatory unless you wanna try to withdraw big amounts of money instantly. I think that you must check it again. There's no new announcement if FTX was making the kyc verification as a mandatory. Have you talked with the admin of FTX? you can confirm this through its official telegram group.",

No doubt ,there is no alternative of FTX exchange. I am also using FTX exchange because of their low withdrawal fee, other hand if you compare withdrawal fee with others it's very cheap. And I hope in future ftx exchange gain more popularity and become number 1 exchange of World because of its unique features.",

But for Exchanges that don't require KYC, you can use KuCoin. They make it easy for users who don't want to do KYC. but keep in mind that they provide a limit for withdrawal, so, if you want to increase the limit, you have to do KYC.",

You have true first time FTX not passing KYC just filled 2fa and verify mobile phone only, but right now different way for using FTX exchange account and you need verification before use FTX exchange trader or investing there.",
