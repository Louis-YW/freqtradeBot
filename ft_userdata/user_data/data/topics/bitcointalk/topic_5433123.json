No form of fiat currency will ever be a threat to Bitcoin. They will try to attack it, as they have hundreds or even thousands of times...but they will never beat it.If anything, digital dollar is a step to mass adoption. As people start to learn how to use a digital dollar they will eventually see the added benefits of using a blockchain like Bitcoin, and will be able to make the transition in comparison to trying to transition from banking apps or cash.",

Do you think this digital dollar can be threat to bitcoin ? My answer is never because it is centralized. Not really, I'd rather say that bitcoin is more of a threat to the digital dollar than the other way around.Anyway, that doesn't really matter because e-dollar/digital dollar and bitcoin have their respective and distinct use why they were created in the first place. People also have their own reason why would they choose bitcoin over e-dollar or e-dollar over bitcoin. This digital dollar is of course controlled by the government, so that will be useless when it comes to guarding ourselves up when it comes to inflation but if in terms of stable coins, digital dollar has the advantage because it doesn't move that much and has less risk compared to the volatility of bitcoin.",

USD based currencies are stable ones while Bitcoin is highly volatile generating profit as an investment. I've said not even close because investors are using these currencies differently; Bitcoin more of an asset while usd based digital currency are for daily transactions, so I don't think one fears another.Quote from: krishnaverma on January 05, 2023, 03:44:53 PMQuote from: Upgrade00 on January 05, 2023, 12:45:54 PMRather than spamming irrelevant articles across the forum you could add some extra information or thoughts you have on the topic it discusses.

The only difference is decentralization and centralization of each. On my end especially when trading, I do prefer using usdt as a mode of payment because it is more convenient to use.

Do you think this digital dollar can be threat to bitcoin ? My answer is never because it is centralized. They are creating the opposite, it might really be having that notable feature or something which shows much better in terms of transaction speed and high number on volume but still people who are seeing that decentralized things is always been better then it would be just simply ignored.They could create all the things they do want but as long it would be that centralized then people wont really be seeing these things to be interesting.Just like the rest which are trying to make out which interest and recognitionisnt really that much.",

Who is going to adopt CBDCs are the people who don't want to use bitcoin, but for crypto market it doesn't make any difference, nothing changes. It will be the same scenario we face right now. The only problem is that governments start using coercive power to force people using CBDCs and to stop using bitcoin. That would be done through a ban, but I guess most countries are safe from this threat, since governments are adopting relatively friendly stances regards bitcoin and crypto.",
