Install the Appimage and allow it to be used as a program. Otherwise, Linux is a very user-friendly system, and Linux Mint is very good for beginners; the interface is similar to that of Windows. If we talk about whether I will return to Windows after Linux, then I would answer that I will not return.",

      "body": "@everyone! Thank you very much for all the replies. I have now managed to verify and install both Electrum and Ledger Live on my Linux Mint and I am extremely happy with it.For the newbies out there like myself who are trying to get away from Windows and plan to transition to Linux, below is the documentation I've recorded to let others know the issues I ran into during the installation processTo start, despite the fact that Electrum is a included Linux's \"Software Manager (it's like MS Store version of Windows),\" it is still strongly advised that you verify and download the app from the official Electrum website so that you can check the AppImage's authenticity by reviewing this thread[1]. Similar to Ledger Live, their website also provides instructions on how to use GtkHash to check the AppImage's authenticity. Moreover, running both Electrum and LL in Linux isn't similar as to how Windows run these application because you need to download some sort of program called udev rules that enables Ledger Nano device/Trezor to interact with Electrum and LL within that period of plugging/unplugging the hardware component. Otherwise you'll get an error that looks like this.Fortunately, you can easily download the a file on the ledger's github by typing the wget command in the terminal.Code:wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bashSource: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389606417-Download-and-install-Ledger-Live?docs=true[1] /index.php?topic=5240594.0That's pretty much itÂ  . As a beginner, trying to understand the nitty gritty of Linux is by far rewarding, you'll just need to research every move you are going to execute on the internet to avoid having issues. Plus, asking questions isn't illegal.Quote from: dkbit98 on August 05, 2022, 01:47:28 PMbut I would suggest checking out new Fedora 36 instead of Linux Mint.Fedora has better security, it has much newer kernel and software releases while being stable, and it's not based on Ubuntu like Linux Mint.There is a bit learning curve when you switch to Linux but it pays off big time, and you will be much more secure from malware.Thank you so much for the suggestion! As a learning tool for the Linux environment in the meantime, I'll try Linux Mint, and once I feel comfortable with it, I'll surely switch to Fedora as you recommended . And it's true that learning Linux is pretty solid.Quote from: dkbit98 on August 05, 2022, 01:47:28 PMBefore installing any Linux OS you should first test if it works with your hardware using some live USB stick.Linux Mint works like magic in my laptop as compared with Windows LOL",

I think that you used the 64-bit version, which requires a minimum of 4 GB plus the ever-tracking and slowing down Windows trackers. If you don't need the Linux frills, you can always choose the XFCE version. There will be no animation; everything will be quite modest, and this also increases the speed of Linux.There are so many of these systems that any user can find the most convenient for himself.",
