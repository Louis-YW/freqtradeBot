  "content": "Here's a third auction of a coin from the Encyclopedia of Physical Bitcoins and Crypto-Currencies that is somewhat obscure and has been hard to find. For those of you trying pick up one of everything you can find, this coin may be a fun addition to your collection.By the way, usually in forum auctions, discussion is discouraged for the sake of the sale.However, I am encouraging discussion. These threads always end up adding to the history of these coins. If you know something, please share.This auction is for a 2013 Finite by Design 10 Cryptogenic Bullion Bar. It is on page 161 of the Encyclopedia. It is #36 of 50 made. It is loaded with 10 CBX (which I am sure is worth $$$, right? Ok, maybe not...  ) You can see much larger views of the item if you click on the thumbnails and then enlarge them by clicking a second time  STARTING BID:      BTC.0BID INCREMENTS: (limited to 4 decimals) BTC.0001END TIME:             Thursday, May 19th, 17:00 EASTERN (NEW YORK, NY)iso=20220526T17&p0=179&font=cursive&csz=1]https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20220526T17&p0=179&font=cursive&csz=1[/url]PAYMENT:              Due in BTC within 24hours of auction end.
