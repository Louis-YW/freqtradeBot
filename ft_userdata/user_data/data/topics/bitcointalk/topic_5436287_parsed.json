  "content": "The world as we know it today is continually evolving and advancing due to the rapid growth of science and technology. No longer can we imagine a world without the internet, electricity, or even a cell phone. But have we ever stopped to think what our world would be like if one day, science and technology came to an end?It would be like a world without electricity, where we would have to rely on natural sources of light such as the sun and the moon. We would no longer have access to the internet and all of the information and entertainment it provides. There wouldn't be any computers or cell phones, so communication would be limited to face-to-face interactions. We would also have to revert back to traditional methods of transportation such as walking or riding a horse, and many of our modern conveniences would be gone.The world would also be a much more dangerous place without science and technology. Many of the medical advancements made in recent years would be lost, and diseases that were once thought to be eradicated may make a comeback. We would also lose access to many of the weapons developed by science and technology, making it harder to defend ourselves against any potential threats.It's impossible to predict when science and technology might come to an end, but it's safe to say that the world would be a much different place without it. The advances we have made in science and technology have made life easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable for all of us, and it's hard to imagine what the world would be like without it. Science and technology have helped shape the world we live in today, and it's important that we continue to invest in it so that it can continue to improve our lives.",

      "body": "Actually, the right science and technology has to be considered not really what we currently have.Humans were actually wiser and better creators in the past when they were under the rule of the CREATOR of Heaven & Earth and taught directly by HIM to produce good/right things. The only thing you need to do to be taught by our CREATOR is to know and obey his Words. And you become HIS child and HE Spirit teaches and guide you to be fruitful or produce all good things. Those who are inspired by our CREATOR can then teach and guide others below them. Don't always believe what you read in the media of the world. An ancient society under the CREATOR was far better than what we currently have. Such society likely had much better lighting, communication, agricultural, educational,governmental system. Do not imagine them as some goat skin-wearing culture that lived in poorly built huts. It's likely very beautiful, orderly and clean society which functioned & was built in harmony with nature. In such society people will hardly get sick because they were surrounded by healing atmosphere and consumed very healthy foods/things. They will hardly lack in solution to any problem they face because the CREATOR already supplied solutions to all their problems. The solutions could come inform of ideas, via dream vision etc.The modern world is actually advancing/developing with inferior science and technology like cancer is advancing on a body, mainly because things are done contrary to the Law/Will of the CREATOR.Their Science/Knowledge is a distortion of the real science which was either stolen or given to them. The products of the science are bad for people as they lead to their destruction",

But, I also think it's a good exercise to think about what the world would be like without all of it, just to remind ourselves to appreciate what we have and not take it for granted.",
