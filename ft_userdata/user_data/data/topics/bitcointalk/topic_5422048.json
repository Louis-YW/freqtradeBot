Noise isnt too much of an issue as we have a single detached garage at the rear of the house. but having said that how exactly noisy would 10 machines be?This has got me thinking, i dont have the money to buy 1 BTC and my folks wouldnt give me the money to buy one. But they would possibly lend me 17k if it was to start up a mining business from home[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Noise isnt too much of an issue as we have a single detached garage at the rear of the house. but having said that how exactly noisy would 10 machines be?Each unit should be pulling around 12-13 Amps.  Here in the US, older houses often have 100a service, newer one have 200a.    IF you're lucky enough to have 200a service, I highly doubt you have much more than a 20a/120v line to the garage. So you'd need to come off the main panel with a 100a subpanel, and maybe you can run five 20a/240v circuits from that. I doubt you'd want to run more than five machines based on that.   As far as noise, five machines are loud. I was running 5 s17s in my garage, now just 3 s19s.   If I'm standing next to them, I can't hear a word you say from a feet feet away. Each unit is like an industrial hair dryer running not stop. You also have hot exhaust to get rid of.    Youre probably looking at a few thousand $ worth of electrical work to set up for the machines. Then the machines themselves, and factor in your price per kWh...... at this point, you'd be better off to just buy an entire coin.   My electric costs have doubled in the last two years, absolutely killing my profitability. And if you think you'll run 3-5 machines without your dad noticing the power bill going from $300 to $1500, you're nuts.  He'll kill you.",

I think this is better, buying bitcoin and holding it, we don't need to think about the costs that will be incurred in the operation, it can be said to be more economical, (only my thoughts when viewed roughly, / theory not practice)",
