For future reference, hiding the addresses but showing the output amount and the date means it is still trivial to locate those addresses.For example:This transaction on April 4, 2019 spends 5 of your outputs.This transaction on June 15, 2019, spends 1 of your outputs.This transaction on November 10, 2020 spends 2 of your outputs.So the transaction you are trying to broadcast will never confirm because it is invalid, as it is attempting to spend outputs which are already spent.You probably want to try the rescanblockchain command in the first instance.",

It will even give you a nice little pop up window with a progress bar. Given the last transaction in OP's wallet is in block 546,272, he could start scanning from this block to save himself some time, simply by typing rescanblockchain 546272.",

Why did you not believe it in the first place? I assume you're familiar with how a wallet works seeing you are selling some miners in the past. You also posted more or less the same issue a few years ago.",

Some options to importÂ  the private keys to spend the coins are:https://www.blockchain.com/walletor Electrum wallet.Just as the other user mention, maybe those address doesn't have the balance but they show it because there is a sync problem. To be sure about the balance in those address use a block explorer and search there the addresses.",

Keeping the private keys offline (and signing transactions offline) is the safest.However, since OP has been going at this for 2 years now, opening more topics isn't going to help him. It looks like he has no Bitcoin:Quote from: Chandu141 on November 12, 2020, 03:17:01 AMi can see BTC on wallet GUI but when i see it on explorer, the balance is NIL",

I can't know what caused it (and it never happened to me), but you're certainly not alone.I think it's time to stop giving yourself hope.Quotelooks like my coins are gone but i am sure i didn't spent myself. it was back then in 2017O_e_l_e_o showed your inputs were spent a year and a half apart. The last transaction was 2 days after you opened a topic here. If your wallet would have been compromised, I'd expect all funds to disappear simultaneously. So my guess is you must have spent them by yourself, but somehow don't remember.",

If you happen to find an address which still has coins in it, then you can rescan that wallet and spend those coins. But it does seem like all your coins have been spent years ago.",
