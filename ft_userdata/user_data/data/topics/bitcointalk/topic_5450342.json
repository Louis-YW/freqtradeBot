      "body": "I largely disagree with your conclusions. Ukraine, after Russia's attack on it, is indeed now receiving a lot of financial assistance from the civilized world, including in dollars and euros. This is understandable. After all, part of the territory of Ukraine was occupied by Russian invaders, many industrial enterprises were destroyed, millions of Ukrainian citizens were forced to leave the country to escape the daily rocket attacks throughout Ukraine. But Ukraine is not only an agrarian country. Since the time of the USSR, a large number of industrial enterprises have been concentrated in Ukraine. True, but I believe that the industrial potential in independent Ukraine (after 1991) was not used very effectively. In particular, the defense industry worked poorly, even after Russia's military aggression in 2014. But there are a number of objective reasons for this.One can hardly agree that Russia is now continuing to buy gold. In Russia, there are now very big problems with finances and the budget. Therefore, she is not up to buying gold. On the contrary, the Kremlin is now trying to sell its gold reserves, especially in the UAE.",

Moreover, gold with rubles would have a negative effect on the rubles' price... something that russia is actively trying to avoid. Your analysis doesn't seem very sound I am afraid",

Before expressing your opinion in a categorical manner, it is useful to check with some credible source of data so as not to look stupid. For example, according to the latest data from the World Gold Council, in May the Central Bank of Turkey became the largest seller of gold (minus 63 tons), and the Central Bank of Russia can also be found in the list of buyers (plus 3 tons).",

      "body": "Russia economy is doing quite well for a country under heavy sanctions and attack by World powers. It would've been better if she had not withdrawn from the strategic positions she was placed in Ukraine. Ruble was doing really well only for Russia's Bank head to say they don't really like strong ruble. It was then left to be at its current position. If Russia wants it high again, let us know, probably through their media, it would be considered.In regards to calling Russia the invader, who would you rather call an invader between these two groups: a Community of People hijacked by evil/immoral aliens or a neighboring Community that went in to rescue them from the aliens? Beside, If the neighbors hadn't gone in, they and the whole world would have been hijacked too. And the security of Bitcoin actually depends on this. An alien force fully taking over the whole world means an end for Bitcoin as we know it. So, Russia is currently being used to save Bitcoin and the world from full takeover.   Bitcoin users, miners and nodes operators around the World who love Bitcoin ideals like decentralization, privacy, etc should be thankful. A 35billion Bitcoin investment from the country when price is low wouldn't be too risky, as Bitcoin likely appreciates Russia and will work to help the investment grow.",

      "body": "I find it very difficult to agree with your opinion.Let me explain. In Ukraine, the destruction caused by the Russian terrorists who attacked Ukraine is enormous. Entire cities, hundreds of cities have been destroyed. The largest industrial enterprises have been destroyed. Approximately 40% of such enterprises are totally destroyed, the rest are badly damaged. And many other problems. And the existing foreign currency reserves and other financial aid - all this money will go to rebuild Ukraine ! There will be no sale of dollars or redemption of the hryvnia!And regarding your assumption about russia buying gold. It absolutely does not correspond to reality. And Russia is actually in a panic selling off its reserves, and it is gold ! Russia's budget has now lost over 40% of all revenues, losing the EU gas market and getting cut off from the oil price.",
