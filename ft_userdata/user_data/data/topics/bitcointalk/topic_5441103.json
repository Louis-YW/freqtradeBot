It's obvious you are focusing on roulette only so some days you are focusing on becoming an specialist.Welcome to the forum.As suggested by the 2nd post, consider buying a copper membership which will allow you to post image. Have a nice graphical design for the main post and repost it. You will see more people are finding it interesting.If you need any help then feel free to contact me. I do bitcointalk promotions, managing few casinos and mixers bitcointalk promotion currently.

What were you looking for ? I tried to send you a message but it wouldn't let me - so hit me up if you want to discuss.",

      "body": "Does the live chat on the game directly seen by the dealer like Evolution gaming live games? This is the only proof that we can hold to guarantee that the video is live. The camera angle on the roulette is bad because it’s on top view while the screen board is in redundant with the actual table board. I try to make the screen larger using the maximize window button it doesn’t work when I’m using mobile phone. The screen size is not adjustable when viewing the live games without sign. But I like the Vibes of your live games because is more natural. Are you planning to add other table games like blackjack or you will just stick to roulette games?",

I saw the games you provide, and it's something unique that I still need to play. Based on your name, would you have guides with roulettes or like roulette academy or something and integrate some cryptocurrency knowledge or something? Lol.",
