Shouldn't you be a little patient?Have you talked to the support before coming up with this scam accusation?Some casinos even take 24-48hours for the withdrawals to be processedAlso, last year you claimed you had deleted an account with them, what made you make a U-turn?Quote from: Edouble on June 03, 2021, 11:55:55 AMI just finishes to delete my account from bitcoinpenguin.com, they pay if u win, but the problem is that their payout is around 0% i think, there is no way of winning a da*** nothing..so probably games are tricked.

Maybe their hot wallet is temporarily empty or they need to conduct additional security checks. Have you contacted their customer support?Quote from: Edouble on June 01, 2022, 06:49:21 PMLets wait a little bit to see if the pay.Exactly. I see no reason to open a scam accusation, at least not before contacting customer support. Also, 7 hours is not that long.",
