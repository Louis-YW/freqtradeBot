If you hold bitcoin and earn money from it, that will indirectly help economy.How about miners. There are bitcoin miners.

Or every one is opinionated about it, even if they don't have the experience (I assumed that Paul Krugman doesn't own BTC, or at least do not understand what cryptocurrency is).

I don't see any issue here. Bitcoin has a long list of influential haters. That includes people like Warren Buffet, Jemie Dimon, Almost all Democrat senators in US etc. It's just one addition to that list. It has no impact on Bitcoin whatsoever. The environment things a long-standing narrative against Bitcoin. So that's all fine. Haters gonna hate!But one thing I agree about Trump. He is seeing that Bitcoiners in US need support due to the actions from various enforcement agencies and ongoing harassments. So Trump is very cleverly targeting this community and promising to become their support system. It is true that Trump will eventually win this election. The chance is very promising after the attack on him. But never trust a politician unless you see some actions in reality. Take a cautious approach in proclaiming yourself as an ardent Bitcoin supporter in US. Might not go well with the enforcement agencies in case Trump looses the election.",

The field of economics is broad and dynamic, and an individual, no matter how intelligent he is, cannot understand all its intricacies. Maybe he does not know about cryptocurrencies, and instead of learning, he chooses to throw shades. This attack might also have a political undertone since Paul Krugman is a well-known critic of the Republican party. He once called it the \"party of the stupid\". He is still in the dark and might be disappointed by the steady growth of Bitcoin's popularity. Let him check the statistics of the currency that is highly used by criminals and his perspective will change.",

For example, in El Salvador, after the country adopted bitcoin, the country's economy slowly experienced quite good improvements. Apart from that, if someone says that Bitcoin is widely used for fraud or used for money laundering. I think this is a very inappropriate opinion for this person to express. Because did he know that paper money is much more often used to do these evil things? The reason is that in 2022 the US Treasury Department and Europol also said that fraudsters were targeting paper money more than virtual assets. So with these facts, it means that saying that crypto or bitcoin is an asset that is widely used for criminal acts such as money laundering is very wrong.QuoteThe US Department of the Treasury in its 2022 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment² highlighted how fiat and traditional financial activities still far outnumber the use of virtual assets to conduct illicit activities. Likewise, EUROPOL in its 2021 Spotlight, Cryptocurrency: Tracing the Evolution of Criminal Finance,³ stated: “The overall number and value of cryptocurrency transactions linked to criminal activity still represents only a small portion of the criminal economy when compared to cash and other forms other transactions\".Source: https://www.unit21.ai/blog/combat-crypto-fraud-via-fiatSo in my opinion, people who say that crypto assets or bitcoin are often used to commit criminal acts, I think those people only see the case from one side. Plus it seems like the person doesn't like bitcoin and doesn't study it at all. That's why this person only talks about Bitcoin from the bad side, which is actually very small.",

Bitcoin can introduce a sustainable financial system regardless of rich and poor in today's mostly capitalist state system that advocates financial independence and ownership of its valuable assets. In his opinion, if useless, he should explain why Bitcoin's price skyrocketed in such a short period of time and that its upward trend is increasing. Bitcoin has emerged as an important hedge with any financial system. Due to the decentralized system, investors are so interested in Bitcoin that it can create separate economic zones beyond the borders of different countries, which is happening now and will expand in the future.",
