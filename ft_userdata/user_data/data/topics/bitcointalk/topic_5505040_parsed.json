However the truth is  online wallets and hot wallets are as much as important as air gapped wallets and open source cold wallets are.Not all coins can be kept in a cold wallet in an air gapped device. This is because some bitcioners out there have tons of coins In hot wallets because they transact constantly with them and therefore putting them in a cold wallet will make it difficult to transact easily.All I can say is one has to be very careful and current as no one is happy losing coins. The best one can do is to be very watchful or if possible make use of lightning networks for smaller frequent transactions.As for the KYC. And privacy aspect, it's definitely a personal choice as exchange still constantly demand these details for obvious reasons.Don't forget to keep your keys safe",

[impossible]Going to have to disagree with the 1st part. It's not that difficult to get a Money Transmitter License in some locations. Expensive perhaps depending on if you are actually making any money. Time consuming definitely in some areas. But even in NYS it not hard. It's just forms you have to fill out and records you have to keep. AND if you are actually making money running it as a business these are records you would have to keep anyway.But, to the OP, yeah you should never have any real funds in a custodial wallet. This is not even new with regulations being tightened. Custodial wallets have always been a risk because they could just vanish with no notice.-Dave",

So just as OP stated take your funds away from then and that’s the only way to keep your funds safe",

I checked some old wallets older than 1 year that only contained chips from CM, and they were all emptied. Yes, it's a bit stupid that I didn't spend them, but honestly I forgot about a few $ in those old wallets. It's really strange that it wasn't all deleted, but now we at least know where even 7GB of data came from.Can confirm, they stole a chip of mine a friend of mine that he hadn't yet spent. :/ Really fucking bad practice of ChipMixer to keep private keys, not gonna lie.It was still there today morning and even when the news broke here; I he had not considered that private keys may have been backed up on CM servers to be honest.Remember, you don't have to give up custody to gain privacy! Coinjoins are non custodial and make your Bitcoins untraceable.",
