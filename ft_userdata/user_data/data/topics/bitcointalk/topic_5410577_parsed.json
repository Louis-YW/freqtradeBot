But the bounty campaign budget remains the same. Hope everyone will agree. I want the budget to be increased according to the participants. If this continues, at some point Hunter will be untraceable. The more hunters, the more profit the company, but that will indirectly reduce the rewards of each hunter.If you do not follow bounty, then your place will be filled by other hunters. In my opinion, this is a reasonable consequence.",
