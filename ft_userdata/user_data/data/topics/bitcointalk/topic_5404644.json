Questions arise.Quote“Every commodity in the world has looked good in a hyperinflationary environment, but the dirty secret is you can make more oil, you can make more silver, you can make more gold […] Bitcoin’s the only thing that looks like a commodity that is scarce and capped.”These are fraught times for the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector, so it isn’t surprising that industry proponents might seize upon any promising news to help charge flagging markets. A Reuters report out of Uganda last week about a massive gold ore discovery supplied just this kind of fuel.What does the state of gold mining in Africa have to do with the price of global Bitcoin (BTC)? Quite a bit, potentially.Bitcoin has periodically laid claim to being digital gold largely on the strength of its strict 21 million supply limit, which makes it non-inflationary and a good store of value — in theory. Gold, of course, is the store of value par excellence, with a limited supply and a solid track record that goes back millennia.But, if Uganda is sitting on 31 million metric tons of gold ore, as the government declared, might not that substantially boost the world’s gold supply? That in turn could lower the price of gold — and make it a less secure “store of value” generally. Gold’s loss could be the cryptocurrency’s gain.Some drew encouragement from this notion. Microstrategies CEO Michael Saylor, for instance, posted a video on Twitter about the Ugandan discovery of “huge gold deposits” which might net 320,158 metric tons of refined gold “valued at $12.8 trillion.” As Saylor noted on June 17: “#Gold is plentiful. #Bitcoin is scarce,\" further telling CNBC:sourceAnd am wondering how did Uganda get hold of such a huge number of gold ore all of a sudden? and if this this true will this be enough reason for investors to turn to btc with proven limited supply or not?

In a lot of circumstances, African countries are the ones that have been left behind in the funding of these material extraction - until a few years ago when a lot of countries seem to have started to do their own explorations on account of cheaper extraction facilities and a rising price of minerals (because the availability everywhere else is slowly running out - potentially).There has been mining for a long time in Africa but it seems to have been for specific materials and less of a focus on things like gold (or coal afaik).Most things can have inflation now anyway too (even materials like diamond can be artificially generated) it'll be interesting to see if gold gets devalued by more discoveries in the future too (in science and technology as well as naturally occurring discoveries).",

      "body": "Just finding a gold ore is not enough one must weight down everything that there is before jumping to their opinion they would need investors, mining permission and considering the impact on the environment the government might not be that reluctant to bet on it and even if they did it would take years, they won't be able to add everything that soon in the circulation which means that the price decrease for the gold would be gradual and would not be that important. Other than that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins, they should not be called digital gold perse since we do have an Altcoin named the same as well and I do think that bitcoins and gold is very different and people already know it right now, they are investments for sure but they don't have to be that competitive.",

There's a possibility that gold is becoming inflationary as if you look into other things that has less value than gold already has inflation.I doubt that bitcoin or any cryptocurrency can replace it but still you can compare the same way as before as a \"digital gold\".Probably with that kind amount of gold being mined on Uganda but still that kind of amount, it will surely affect it's price having it supply being boosted with that amount.",

To many, bitcoin cannot yet be regarded as a reliable store of value, and gold will still remain top on their option list despite any information about an increase in supply. The demand for gold is very high so any little quantity that the Ugandan government can mine and continue to supply to the market, will quickly be taken off the market for use, hence gold will not be as random as we may think and prices may not fall.

Do share your beautiful opinion. Very, and from the bottom of my heart, happy for Uganda! The discovery of new gold deposits can improve both the financial and social sphere in the country. But not a fact ... Unfortunately! It all depends on how these resources will be managed by the owner of this valuable resource - the PEOPLE and the government of Uganda! There are many examples when some countries, usually with a totalitarian or inadequate government, use profitable resources for inadequate goals. This may be the enrichment of a small group of friends of a totalitarian ruler, corruption schemes, etc. I am not familiar with the situation in Uganda, so I am not ready to predict the development of events after the discovery of such resources.Yes, and this will not affect bitcoin in any way, due to the fact that the real world of fiat money has nothing to do with the speculative and manipulative world of cryptocurrencies...",

This news didn’t even affect the current price of gold and I doubt if it would ever. Hence, I don’t expect much from this news because the World Bank and its allies know how to manipulate such discoveries to ensure it doesn’t affect the economies of its financiers whose wealth are mainly stored in gold. The same story line, destabilize the country politically through coup or internal crisis. Support and empower a particular group and use them to illegally extract the gold. Then loot and move the resources to their lands and control its demand and supply as usual. It happened the same way in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Congo, South Africa and it is currently happening in Central African Republic.",
