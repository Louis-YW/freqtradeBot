  "content": "Hello! We're happy to announce the launch of Dice.ag, a traditional crypto dice game but with a focus on player privacy. We offer what many other dice websites offer, such as a 1% house edge, a provably fair algorithm, and no withdrawal fees, but we go a step further to protect the privacy of our players.We don't require any personal information and we don't even know your email address. Instead we generate a unique login token to identify you. From there players can instantly deposit Monero, which we believe is the perfect cryptocurrency for online gambling giving players a high level of financial privacy. Inactive player accounts are deleted after 6 months and we don't store information longer than we need it for business purposes.You won't find any shady bonuses here. We give every new player a maximum of 20 free rolls using real XMR to test the site out, no deposit needed. We also have an affiliate program which pays 15% of the house edge of every bet whether they win or lose.We have also opted out of having social features which are designed to keep people gambling. There's no chat box, leaderboards, and no public display of your activity.Security is also something we take very seriously. Crypto wallets are never stored on the website server so player funds are never at risk. Each roll is cryptographically hashed and verification takes place before withdrawals are processed.We'd love for you to check us out! Please let us know your thoughts or ask any questions you may have https://dice.ag",

      "body": "^ The comment above was right, we are here a BTC gambling community not an altcoin, probably you can move this to the altcoin section if you want. However, adding BTC also fits into pseudonymous as XMR does to care about privacy. But if you will not, you are supposedly not here because the Bitcointalk forum and this BTC gambling community are for that gambling industry that supports BTC. On other hand, you need to purchase a copper membership too so that your announcement thread looks professional by adding images that are catchy to the gamblers.",

All casinos accept Bitcoin if I did not miss anything. They can accept altcoins or not but Bitcoin is a must if it is a crypto-accepted casino.I strongly recommend the Dice.ag team to consider an integration of Bitcoin on your site for dicing. If possible, after deployment of Bitcoin, you should move next with some old altcoins that are commonly accepted on casinos, Litecoin, Dogecoin, DASH, Ethereum.If your site does not have Bitcoin, Service Announcements (Altcoins) is a relevant board for this topic.How?Click on move topic at the bottom left",

Anyway, any plans to accepts other cryptocurrency in the platform since many wants to have more options when they gamble, especially some gamblers don’t have XMR since you can’t see this crypto in most of the site right now. Also, I suggest to have a good promotional campaign here and better to hire a good manager to handle that, you can be more successful if you follow the top site on how they market their site.",

Any cryptocurrency with a public ledger of transactions and balances cannot be considered private. Although this is debatable, it is not relevant to the topic at hand.It's entirely relevant to our website and the design decisions we have made. All Bitcoin transactions are public, all Bitcoin address balances are public. The opposite is true with Monero. We can't know if the player has a million XMR or 0.1 XMR. We can't know where they've spent their coin, the amounts they paid, or when their transactions were made. When a user withdraws their winnings there's no blockchain website displaying \"Dice.ag Hot Wallet\" showing they've made a withdrawal and how much. Monero is private by default, and that's why it's at the heart of our business.",
