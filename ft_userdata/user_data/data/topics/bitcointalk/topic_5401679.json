It's still remain a prediction for bitcoin to go to the 25k. So many people have been calling this rate at the end of last month but it's still remain side way around 29k - 30k. buying any major coins with very big potential may give guarantee if that will give profit for the next years from now. I have planned to accumulate more during the bearish trend. I do belive market will not bearish forever.",

Bitcoin going down, that's possible mate, but the current price is already cheap, and it's also possible that the current price is already thw lowest, who knows, we might not see below $30k again once the market recovers.",

I think we are not at the bottom of a bear market, I would wait a little longer with a new entry into the majority of altcoins. they have weaker resistance than Bitcoin and I believe they will go even lower. Should also be very careful (based on experience from the previous bear) many very promising altcoins have never recovered.",

Is now a good time to start buying?.With altcoins you never know what to expect, personally i do not think Bitcoin is prolly going below 25k, not that it matters too much if it does, because if it actually goes below that amount then you have the opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at a cheaper price than normal. To answer your question, i am only building my portfolio with Bitcoins for now, i do not really trust altcoins as long term projects, and i am a long term investor, thus Bitcoin is the most suitable project for me right now. If you want to speculate with altcoins you must be very careful, a lot could go wrong very quickly. No matter what you do, do not hodl altcoins for the long period, sell them in the short term and take the profit you can get, altcoins are short term projects and most of them are not sustainable for the long period.",

Since it's not going that low ($25,000) for the past few weeks you may want to consider that it may not. Buy now or be left and have regrets, besides, it is still going up no matter what.

What's not a reason to buy, good prices, sometimes even lower than ICO\\IDO prices. If it drops even lower, that's okay, buy some more. Just do not try to find the absolute bottom and buy everything with one order, it will not work, unless by lucky chance.

No one knows for sure if the bulls are done and facing bear season or indeed we are being prepared for more significant changes. We're already in and not starting over. If in this session Bitcoin has been under $25K then anyone will take big profits in the future.",

If we contemplate a long bearish market, it is certain that altcoins to return past their highs will not be easy, maybe not even recover.",

Even top alts, you need to be cautious as they can easily exit the market if the team behind it decide to cash out their share.

We need to wait for BTC to drop below $25k to start buying BTC and some altcoins.
