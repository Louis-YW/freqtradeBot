  "content": "I finally got my laptop ready for cold storage. I removed the bluetooth and Wifi card.I will next install electrum on the computer by transferring the files from a USB thumb drive.My question is, should I ever use a USB on this laptop again or is there a risk of transferring viruses? My other question is, will I ever need to have to transfer anything to the cold storage laptop again after installing electrum? What about the offline signing to send transactions?The laptop does have a camera on it and its an old windows xp laptop, will I be able to use that camera to read QR codes for offline signing? If so, should I also install software to make sure that feature works? Thanks, and any additional information on the best way to make this electrum cold storage, with offline signing to send bitcoins from my online computer.",

But you still have to be very careful of malware, I mean on the device you have your watch-only wallet. It is worth avoiding malware completely.I will advice you to make use of QR code for transaction signing.Quote from: edward500 on September 11, 2022, 06:03:27 PMMy other question is, will I ever need to have to transfer anything to the cold storage laptop again after installing electrum? What about the offline signing to send transactions?It depends. Assuming you just want to use the device for cold storage wallet creation in a way you will not have to be using it for making transaction, then no need for transfering anything (which are what is pertaining to signed and unsigned transactions), but in this regard, you can just decide to use the computer to create a cold storage, back up your seed phrase in two or three different locations and you are good. You can just use the computer again for what you want to use it for but after you have deleted the wallet or formatted the device (recommended) to erase to wallet that you created on it. But you can use the cold storage wallet to sign transactions. Read this: Creating a Cold Storage wallet in ElectrumYou will have a watch-only wallet to create unsigned transaction, send it to the cold storage wallet using QR code or USB stick, sign the transaction, use QR code or USB stick to send the signed transaction from your cold storage wallet (back, but signed) to the watch-only wallet to broadcast the signed transaction.Quote from: edward500 on September 11, 2022, 06:03:27 PMThe laptop does have a camera on it and its an old windows xp laptop, will I be able to use that camera to read QR codes for offline signing? If so, should I also install software to make sure that feature works?As long as your laptop have webcam, you can use it. I am not certain if the latest Electrum wallet will support Windows XP.",

There is a risk and I would advice you do not use a USD or drive on the laptop, to keep it completely airgapped.Quote from: edward500 on September 11, 2022, 06:03:27 PMMy other question is, will I ever need to have to transfer anything to the cold storage laptop again after installing electrum? What about the offline signing to send transactions?You wouldn't need to transfer anything. All you need is to copy the unsigned raw transaction and send that to the air gapped pc. You can also scan the tx qrcode to get the transaction.Quote from: edward500 on September 11, 2022, 06:03:27 PMThe laptop does have a camera on it and its an old windows xp laptop, will I be able to use that camera to read QR codes for offline signing? If so, should I also install software to make sure that feature works? AFAIK, it should work alright without you needing to get any other software. Other members could drop that input on that.",

Also be careful of using your laptop online, you might catch some malware if you visit, clicked some malicious websites/services, or installed some malicious applications.About the QR code, I believe Windows XP can scan QR codes.

Since version 4.2.0, Electrum hasn't worked on Windows 7, so I doubt very much it would work on such an outdated OS: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/7728Even although this is cold storage, I wouldn't feel comfortable using an OS which is decades out of date. OP, you also probably have no choice but to change. The best option will be to format your hard drive and clean install a Linux distro of your choice. If you are used to working with Windows, then Linux Mint might be your best option and the most straightforward to set up. Any decent Linux distro should be able to support your webcam and not require any additional software.In terms of your questions about installing Electrum, make sure you also verify your download before transferring it to your airgapped computer, and make sure you format the USB drive you are going to use first.",

If you can use a laptop to make it air-gapped I believe you can afford to buy a laptop that will secure your funds from hackers. The transaction won't happen without a device unless compromise the seed phrase. Hope you got your desired answer from above on how should use the air-gapped device to make a transaction.

And I'm telling you this as a Windows user.Especially under Windows USB is a high risk, hence, no matter what OS you use, I advise you transfer the information via camera.On my Win10 Electrum opens the camera directly when I do Tools->Load Transaction->From QR codeDo some tests yourself. If you have another (live) laptop you can start both on testnet and do a test with signing a tx with your cold storage. Then you know you have all you need and can do the proper install and configuration.",

I would never use windows XP OS in 2022, it's much better to format hard drive and install fresh Linux OS (Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.).For camera you can use simple plastic cover that can be purchased for little as $1, and you can this both for privacy protection and for QR codes scanning.Most Linux OS have camera software by default and you can try finding separate QR code apps.",

You could wipe the USB before unplugging it from the laptop to prevent any data from leaving the laptop, but this won't prevent potential malware from doing something like replacing addresses.Since your laptop has a camera, you could transfer unsigned transaction to the laptop by scanning their QR code, then scan the QR code of signed transaction with your phone or other device with camera.

Alternatively, Linux is free, and you could just use whatever distro you want, whack your wallet software (Electrum) on there, and be assured that the software is 100% compatible with the operating system.

Ubuntu these days is basically as user friendly as Windows. Alright, not quite, but it's pretty simple, and the UI/UX has improved ten fold over recent years. Most average users can make the switch within a couple of days. Especially, since if you aren't having the computer connect to the internet or bluetooth, you don't have to worry too much about driver issues from them, which is a common problem I suppose, and since Electrum has a easy way of running the app, simply download, allow to run as executable, and click. It's basically as easy as Windows for this specific usage. Web cam could potentially be an issue without downloading the drivers, but that's something you'd just have to find out if it works without any further configuration/troubleshooting.",
