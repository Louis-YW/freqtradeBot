In fact they will need to send me first then to get payment. But for newbie or anyone who does not have long history they an use forum escrow. There are many users who provide escrow service.Paypal? Go fuck them LOL",

Using telegram is really worst decision, someone can delete the whole conversations.In this forum there are many high trusted users offer escrow service Recommended bitcointalk escrow services, in reddit might be similar.On-chain application will force you to use the service and we need to trust the service, if the service is new and has no reputation, what's the reason I need to risk my money?",

This way, there's no need for any additional escrow, just communication between the two parties. Implementing this logic with a smart contract is simple, and the whole process involves only the two traders and the smart contract.",

After both users send tokens to the smart contract, these tokens will be locked in the contract. To paint a picture, it's like putting money into a safe with two locks, with each person holding a key. Unless both parties unlock it together, if someone doesn't deliver the goods, sends fake goods, or falsely claims not to have received the goods, the victim can choose not to unlock, and no one benefits.There won't be an administrator for the contract, and only the participants can unlock each lock. If someone changes their mind about the price, users can use the smart contract again for a similar transaction to balance the price difference.",

I don't see any reason why should I opt for it when there's a better option where I have a fallback of initiating a dispute, and if documented well, I won't lose anything.",

But not everyone has a good reputation or verification, and some people don't want to use banks or credit cards. Crypto with smart contract or script offers many transaction scenarios and methods, and I think it can provide basic trust for almost all deal situations.",
