This is a good move which the Brazilians have taken in other to help their citizens enjoy Bitcoin decentralized system, I just hope that what happened to El Salvador after adopting Bitcoin will not be a challenge to Brazil. The government needs to know why Bitcoin adoption failed in El Salvador so that they can work to overcome the challenge. We are still waiting for the President's signature..",

Hopefully the majority vote of parliament will be the vote of the president's supporters so this can be considered finalisation. If this has been approved I hope to encourage investor confidence to enter investing in bitcoin. In effect the price of bitcoin can reach a new ATH.",

      "body": "The bill was proposed a long time ago i.e. in 2015, well let me say that is great news for us to hear. But it doesn't mean that it will be a smooth road for quite a long time. Therefore, I tried to trace several sources to find out clearly about the ratification. When this bill has been ratified and signed by the President, it means that it becomes a permanent rule. Until now, based on the articles you shared and several sources that I found, it is still not certain that Bitcoin can fully operate until a court decision is won, and even then on condition that it is under the supervision of the Brazilian central bank. Based on :\"While this represents a huge step forward for cryptocurrency adoption, the bill falls short of making Bitcoin legal tender\".It should be remembered that service providers such as the Exchange will be involved in maintaining control of assets owned by Brazilian citizens so that they can be easily monitored.For those who hold their crypto on exchanges, courts will have the power to compel “middlemen” such as exchanges to freeze debtors' crypto assets: \"In the event that the debtor's assets are not found, the creditor may request the competent Court to issue a letter ex officio, electronically, to intermediaries involved in operations with crypto assets, so that the assets corresponding to the amount executed are blocked.\"",

It reads more like a recognition by the Brazilian government of Bitcoin as asset or medium of exchange. For example, in Brazil the United States Dollar is recognized as currency of value but it is not official legal tender within Brazilian territory. That's what I thought. I have read that news and others, and it seems to me that it is far from being legal to tend and have the same status as in El Salvador. If so, an obligation should be imposed on businesses to accept Bitcoin, as happened in El Salvador (with some exception for rural areas), but here it seems to me that it is more a recognition that it is a valid means of payment if the two parties agree, as can be a gift check.",

Maybe this is part of why Brazil is looking towards it. Hopefully this will drive China into lessing its own regulations on bitcoin since its the only Country that is left in BRICS, who still opposes it.It will also aid the BRICS export of goods and raw materials and will hasten there plans of world biggest suppliers as it could be a general currency for tradingQuote from: target on November 30, 2022, 02:35:57 PMThis must be the reason why there is a pump of BTC price in Brazil.

Indeed, adoption of this technology won't mean that demand will increase in a sudden. It will only do so IF Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will have a function impossible for fiat and other fiat based digital currencies other than lower cost and faster transaction as well as anonymity with transactions, which would boost demand from people to invest towards this industry. This is a long term misconception; many people believe that once more countries allow usage of cryptocurrencies for daily transaction, price would go up eventually. But that's not true. There's a bigger chance that it will have a less volatile market value 'coz its supply will circulate on a daily basis unless it would be the only currency to be used which is impossible. So once this thing happen, will there be many people seeking for Bitcoin and other cryptos telling how advantageous it is compared to fiat? Let's be honest. This industry is so popular as an asset. But if it is regarding this industry in general being accepted by more countries, it is really a good thing for this technology, no doubt.",
