Aside from it many are hating solana for continously breaking down. Team should do is fix this fully and hire a lot of security developer or else other investors and retailers would jump ship. No doubt it will happened if the problem hasnt sold today or in the coming days.Even normal users has been affected, it seems the hackers are pretty well ready for this incident.",

This to make sure if they are working in what they can afford to make sure the security was safe. The whole point of being decentralized was being safer than anything centralized… If a decentralized network can’t be safe then it means it lost its most important feature. Without safety, a decentralized network is damn worthless.Decentralized means it should work like clockwork without any human interference. Human interference may include any hack attempts, DOS attacks as well.If the system can’t protect itself from these kind of activities, then it is not working as intended.R.i.p solana",

There is no evidence hardware wallets are impacted. Do not reuse your seed phrase on a hardware wallet - create a new seed phrase.

This is quite worrying, Solana gets attacks like this every year and the worst thing is this is happening.

It is not advisable to keep finances in Solana long term, I am afraid this will not be resolved in a short time.",

As much as possible, it’s better to disconnect and remove all permissions from all sites now and store them in a hardware wallet that supports Solana and SOL-based tokens. That’s where I have learned it myself when I was hacked around $12k from 3 of my Metamask and Trust Wallets combined. The hackers have improved their skills, so we should also improve and adjust to make our assets safe.",
