  "content": "I would like to inform Kaspa users that on 18.03.2023 at 00:24 and few minutes later somehow 2 unauthorized transaction stole around 87000 Kaspa tokens from my Web Wallet. The transactions appeared on the Kaspa Blockchain Explorer but did not on the Web Wallet transaction history or KDX GUI wallet. I have contacted Kaspa Telegram group and Discord but the only answer I got is that somehow I clicked on a fishing website which I 100% didn't because my Web wallet is constantly opened in my browser. First they thought that my coins just \"disappeared\" from the interface and still there and proposed steps to recover them. I tried all the suggested steps by moderators to recover the coins via Compound ,Delete Data Folder ,entered my seed in KDX wallet etc. In the end they agreed that I was hacked somehow but didn't even try to investigate where are my funds go no matter the fact I asked few times for help. I have showed them screenshots and pictures of my wallet that these transactions are not registered in the history and didn't get any reasonable explanation. I'm begin to think that this was an inside job because one more person contacted me that he has the same problem at the same time. Blockchain analysis shows that around that time at 18.03.2023 around 75k USD of Kaspa tokens were stollen and send via multiple transaction ,divided by 2 after each transaction. So at the end I contacted Uppsala security to investigate the issue and waiting second response from them with offer after which I will contact the law enforcement agencies. If someone experienced the same lost of their Tokens from the Web Wallet write here ,contact as many as possible groups in the crypto space ,blockchain investigation firms or DM me",

Every transaction is in the transaction history - but it is not in a row. Why you have the wallet always open? Is not so save. And why should the kaspa team help you to investigate where you money goes? You think you are the only person on the planet? I mean you made the mistake. And no one from us know how you work on your computer. You should check your pc for running phishing software. Maybe you tried a phishing miner.

Most web wallets are provided by a third party and support many coins.In this case it was an officially supported wallet from the coin devs.A web wallet in nothing like a full node wallet you can mine. It's a managed wallet, meaning someone esle takes care of your cryptoon your behalf, often including the keys. They are no more secure than using an exchange to store your crypto.This case now looks more like phishing or the keys, wherever they are stored, were stolen.So my second sarcastic reply may seem more relevant. In a less sarcatsic way, don't blindly click on links that are offered to you.It's sad but it's the world we live in. In Darwinian terms, adapt or die.",
