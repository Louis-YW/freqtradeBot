I am definitely going to add it to my arsenal of trading tools.Qtn. Is the price live or one has to refresh it manually?",

The main grid (stable coins) shows TerraUSD and 0.09$, clicking into it shows TerraClassicUSD at 0.02$. Bug?Also, can you please check/fix my (old) prediction for Monero? I must have been missing something, since the displayed price doesn't match with the actual prediction.About the survey: imho the dark theme can be better. The white text may be too white? The dark background too dark? I don't know. Maybe in between. And yeah, the background for daily gained/lost % needs to be changed accordingly.",

      "body": "Dark mode works fine but I see that the interface is somewhat similar to most currency tracking sites.The prediction is useless, I note that the predictions for Bitcoin by the end of the current year and there are no predictions in the short term and all of them are illogical ($100,000.00) and this silly reason.Quote Description: I think bitcoin will hit $100,000 this year 2022 because alot of investors are waiting for this to happen, many investors expected it to happen last year 2021 but it didn't, I think it will happen this year as many are already anticipating for it. Quote Description: ATH gonna be 82332 USD, then drop sharply to 45-50k and people will claim bitcoin is dead Logical one:QuoteDescription: For a while we think we entered a bear market then the crypto is booming so we can't really know. Is very unpredictable . I think bitcoin will be around 60k this year and next year we will be bigger if everything will go smoothThe psychological barrier will be higher than one hundred thousand, although it is almost impossible to reach it with all the events that are going on in the world.",

We let them know about it. I wasn't expected you are using API from coingecko which is supposed to be your competitor.  Are you thinking of creating a tracking program for your website or will you always need to acquire these functional services from your competitors?On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the interface of the site is very distinctive and seems easy to use with less crowding of the elements that appear to the user, and by that I mean the ease of searching and finding the functions to be used .",
