  "content": "As many others I discovered an old Wallet.dat file on an old HDD. I've been through all off the other similar topics, but none was helpful in my case.I also found an accompanying text file - which I usually do when I make notes.Back in 2012 I installed all the necessary Bitcoin bits to see what the whole \"Bitcoin\" thing was all about. I did a bit of mining, and lost interest after a day or so. (As most people I regret my decisions back then...)But anyway. Today I'm pretty much as clueless as I was back then.In the text file there is two lines:(I've changed some characters in case I might be unbeknownst giving access to my wallet.) https://blockchain.info/wallet/05bf8b8a-639c-XXXX-XXX-87718ba56d23When I visit this address I get a 404 page not found.Then there is a value which I gather is a public address?12E34isxWUmH52oaePQsAJ9tBNZtbTXXXXI also have a wallet.dat file. I fed the wallet.dat file through the Python pywallet, and it recovered the content with 101 private keys. However all of these appears to be empty, i.e. contains 0 Bitcoins.The above address appears only once in the recovered wallet and it looks like this: ...\"minversion\": 60000,    \"mkey\": {},    \"names\": {        \"12E34isxWUmH52oaePQsAJ9tBNZtbTXXXX\": \"MyWallet\",        \"1PnaH4bB44z6nVSvQVpoTekUriDTeWXXXX\": \"\"    },    \"pool\": [        {            \"addr\": \"16sGKPDPDukFqZdHpUGQhHwTtXNPEjXXXX\",            \"n\": 2,            \"nTime\": 1342705737,            \"nVersion\": 60300,            \"public_key_hex\": \"0296edee31e38d2e8e2a6467183e4cc1d3762cff34596012f2f3956d71e869XXXX\"        },...When I enter the address (12E34isxWUmH52oaePQsAJ9tBNZtbTXXXX) into electrum-4.3.2 it shows a balance of 5 mBTC. While it doesn't make me a millionaire (if only I knew back then...) it is worth getting into the wallet.The wallet is however \"Watch only\"?If I recall correctly there didn't exist a 12 word seed phrase back then. So, will any of this get me into my wallet? Thanks in advance!",

Maybe the problem is with compressed/uncompressed addresses?I copy and pasted each and every \"sec\" value from the recovered wallet into a new file. There are 101 values. I created a new wallet in Electrum and pasted all the sec/private keys using the Import Address/Private keys option.

Yes, with the latest version of Bitcoin core.

      "body": "Thank you for everyone's assistance and time. I finally cracked the riddle!I logged in to blockchain.com and used the walletID (the \"05bf8b8a-639c-XXXX-XXX-87718ba56d23\" part of the url) and an old \"standard password\" I used back then.The site then sent an authorization code to the email address linked with the walletID. It's here that I got lost, because no confirmation mail was sent to any of my email addresses. Then I remembered an email address I used way back then. Opened the mailbox and the authorization link from blockchain.com was waiting for me. Click to confirm. Login. Move coins out! Yay!So in short the wallet.dat file that accompanied the wallet address was the red herring!Thanks again for the patience and help!

I'll pay handsomely.)",
