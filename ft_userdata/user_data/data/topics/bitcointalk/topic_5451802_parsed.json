      "body": "What's your own actual definition of negative price\" and \"positive price\"?I explain the two to myself as Negative price is the time when the price of a particular product goes sideways and it's not in my favor, and positive price is when the price is going in my favor. It can either be if I want to buy a particular product and the price starts to drop. To others who want to sell it, it's negative to them, but to me who want to buy it's positive to me. If this is also the same way you define negativity, then you don't really need to worry about which dex is to accommodate your token. Dex don't actually regulate price, so they don't care if it's on the negative or positive side. Let there just be buyer and seller, and their fee will keep on flowing in. Dex choice will be dependent on your preferred network on which you want to launch your token or coin.",

Are there DEX's which can handle negative prices?Are there other possibility in handling negative prices on the crypto market?No, I can't think of DEX crypto markets accepting tokens with a negative price. I guess that the only way for a \"negative price\" to occur on a crypto market would be one trader borrowing a token from another trader and paying him later(which isn't allowed on the crypto markets). Otherwise, there's no way for financial assets to have negative prices, like some commodities. Why do you want to peg a crypto token with a physical good or commodity? I can't find any reason for this. Do you want to create a stablecoin, which is pegged to electricity prices? This ain't gonna work, the price of electricity can be very volatile sometimes.",

Are there DEX's which can handle negative prices?Are there other possibility in handling negative prices on the crypto market?Liquidity of your token to back up the pegged value play an important role to avoid negative price. You should offer only a token supply that is equally backed 1:1 to the value of the goods that you want to pegged.I’m curious on you will manage to secure the goods that backed your token? Typically, Fiat and precious metal is being used to backed crypto because it has a global fixed value while electricity, wheats and other goods have different value based on the country you originated. Also there’s a shelf life on goods.Can you share your whitepaper?",

So why is that important for stablecoin issuers? They want to carefully manage their reserves of the underlying commodity and have a plan in place to manage price fluctuations and sudden changes in demand. There is also the potential for market manipulation or other forms of fraud.",

But I do not remember too many frequent times where a seller pays to get rid of the goods, that is not really common. In a day and age where inflation is reality, let alone negative price, things do not even go down in price that's a lot more common. I am sure that this must be a rare occasion thing where it is known to happen, but not really common enough to consider building something like this, would be very very unlikely to get used.

Synthetic token owners would not be resposible for holding the barrels so they would only gain money by trading those tokens as they wouldn't have any legal repercussions for holding them. Physical barrel owners are not going to pay for some random token holders that are playing the markets.",
