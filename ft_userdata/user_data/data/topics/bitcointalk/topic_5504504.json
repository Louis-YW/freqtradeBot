  "content": "Trump’s opinion on bitcoin has always been a hot topic in the forum. I have seen numerous posts and discussions about his comments about bitcoin. After his conference, many seemed to be delighted that he plans on keeping all existing bitcoins that the country holds for the strategic national reserve.On the other hand, another candidate has actually said almost the same thing way before Trump. Kennedy Jr. seems keen on acquiring more bitcoin to match the gold the country has. He wants to have 4 million bitcoins as the strategic reserve.He has also pointed out that Trump has repeatedly doubted bitcoin before unlike himself who has supported bitcoin even way before. I doubt a third party is going to win but it seems like he has good detailed plans for bitcoin that do not seem like empty promises. Either way, I think bitcoin might have good support whoever president gets elected.",

I would love to be proven wrong by the way and at this point i think i can say that Trump has won over most bitcoiners to his side and for their sake, i hope he does not disappoint them if he becomes president.On another note, what do you guys think about Donald Trump's statement that he would fire the sec chairman if he wins QuoteTrump said — to rapturous applause from the Nashville crowd — that if elected, he would fire current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler",

So you are afraid of KYC but fine with the US exerting defacto control over the Bitcoin market by using it's financial power to effectively set the price of Bitcoin.Oh yes, so \"libertarian\" .And you want the US government to treat Bitcoin--specifically Bitcoin and (I assume) not any other investment or even other digital currencies--as a special tax-free investment that has a unique advantage over every other investment known to man.In other words, you want to use the power of the government to prop up your investment.Ayn Rand would be so proud .",

Governments are increasingly intervening in the market, introducing more regulations as well as bitcoin ETFs that are not good for the decentralized nature of bitcoin. But besides complaining, is there anything we can do to change these things? No, there's nothing we can do. So we need to adapt to everything if we don't want to be eliminated. Everyone knows politicians are liars and don't keep their promises. But besides the three current candidates, do we have any other solutions?",

I support the strategy overall, but let's not look at what politicians promise before the election. Let's look at what happens after. The total assets held by US federal reserve banks is $7 Trillion, while 4 Million Bitcoins (let's say each coin is $70K), it's only $280 Billion, so technically they can afford to purchase 20% of Bitcoin.Quote from: CryptoBuds on July 30, 2024, 12:13:09 PMEveryone knows politicians are liars and don't keep their promises.

Although, in fact, the bitcoin has existed for many years independently of the approval of the heads of this (or other) state.In my opinion, such a high level of government enthusiasm would not have negative consequences for citizens. If heads of state want to have 4 million bitcoins as a strategic reserve, this doesn't mean that the government is going to buy such a large amount of an already quite expensive asset in the form of bitcoin. Replenishment of this reserve is possible at the expense of citizen holders. Remember the confiscation of gold in 1933 by Roosevelt? But bitcoin is also called digital gold.",

They are basically just using bitcoin which the opposition seems to be against and the masses are for to get more supporters, just as you have said one needs to just assess this politicians and pick the less cunny one, but all this promises of having 1 Million of bitcoin in reserve are just promises which I don’t see materializing not to talk of 4 million. The government cannot hold that amount in a currency that they can’t control",
