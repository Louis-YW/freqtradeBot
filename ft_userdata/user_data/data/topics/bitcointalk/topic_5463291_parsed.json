Furthermore, to better understand the difference between bitcoin and altcoin, I think you can search them yourself using google.

Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, is the alternate cryptocurrency that was forked from Satoshi's Bitcoin. In other words, Bitcoin is the original version and Bitcoin Cash is the new version. This was one of the results of the block size debate or block size war as others call it in which Bitcoin supporters are divided as to whether or not to increase Bitcoin's block size. This was in relation to the scalability concern. Bitcoin sticks to 1 MB while Bitcoin Cash chose 32 MB. The implementation of Segwit however increases Bitcoin's block size to 4 MB.",

Technically the community did not split. There are loads of altcoins like bcash that have copied both bitcoin code and blockchain creating a forked copy of bitcoin called something like like bitcoin gold, bitcoin silver, bitcoin cash, bitcoin diamond, etc.These are always a minority or rather a handful of people that create such altcoins and are not \"splitting\" the community. The only difference bcash has is that it has been so much \"louder\" than the rest of them!",

Two different coins, which rose because of a hard fork that was created as a result of a disagreement of opinions in the community. Bitcoin Core (BTC) is the real bitcoin while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the altcoin that was created. Please note the moniker and trade accordingly, based on which one you find as the most convincing. There is a group of influential shills promoting BCH, which was much more buzzing during that time than now but they still exist and they live in their own bubble and forum.Also note that those who held bitcoin during the fork have received BCH of equivalent amount on the day of the fork. There are official ways to retrieve it, but try not to fall for scammers promising you the same.",

Bitcoin cash was a fork from Bitcoin but that doesn't make them a part of Bitcoin because there has been other forks in the past.The only difference here is that Bitcoin cash can be said to be successful as they're still trading and one itf the popular Bitcoin forks that has occurred in the past and that's because whales are pushing Bitcoin cash but it isn't Bitcoin and won't be successful than Bitcoin.",
