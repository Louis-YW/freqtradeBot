Banks charge a certain percentage of interest for loans given to individuals and businesses. Banks also engage in business partnerships with individuals and companies. They can fund a project and the profit from such a venture will be shared between the parties involved. They can also serve as middlemen between investors which can make them earn commissions. Banks also make money through buying and selling foreign exchange. During scarcity of foreign currencies, banks can make high profits from sales of these currencies to customers. Commission from service rendered is another source of income. Banks can get a commission for receiving payments on behalf of the government or other corporate organization",

It's just a way of the bank being able to take advantage of customers to get money and I think it can't be blamed either because every bank customer who saves money in the bank is based on his own agreement without any coercion from other parties. And if someone thinks about the bank being able to get rich with the savings of customers, it is his own fault in trusting the bank to keep his money there. Because the customer only wants security for their money without thinking about the benefits that can be obtained by the bank itself. What do you think ? Is there an error in that case, if there is an error, where do you think the error came from?",

      "body": "Most of the bank's profits come from lending to customers.  Banks usually adopt several means of providing loans. If someone takes a loan in agriculture, their percentage is relatively low, or if someone takes a loan in business, the amount of interest is a little higher. And they have some other means of earning profit, such as if a customer is given an ATM card, then they take some interest from that card annually. Some charges are also applicable for transferring money from one bank to another.  Current banking services have added various facilities with the bank to increase the profit of the bank.  For example, various banks have now launched digital banking services through which various bills including electricity bills and telephone bills are being paid, from which the banks are receiving some interest from various companies. This is basically how the bank earns profit.",

That's why banks wants people to take loans so they can make money from their high interests. When the economy is declining, people don't usually take loans since they'd be saving money. So the banks will promote low interest loan just to make people acquire loans. Those things mentioned by op are like their fee for the services they provide. Some charges may be low but if you'd compute the number of their customers paying that small charges, it'll be a big amount of money.",

These interests are subject to many controls determined by the Central Bank.- Fees on services: It also represents an important percentage of the total returns and is imposed on all services provided by the bank, including loan study services, even if they will not grant it to you later.

Investment banks advise clients on mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance transactions, and restructurings.
