I love the art work and their overall mission forming a completely legal gold currency, did you know that there is a funny story behind the gold backs domain name? I turns out that when they were creating them and landed on that name someone they were affiliated with owned the domain name by chance and had planned to use it for a gold backed shit coin project that didn't work out. Here is the excerpt here from their story on their website: \"It looked like the name, “Goldback,” was taken though!  We had our newest employee, Jeff McClellan do a google search, and he pulled up a crypto project based around a mine in California.  Upon further investigation, he found that a couple of the board members were Michael Taggart and Stan Larimer.  In a small-world moment, those two men were also board members on our gold-crypto, the Quint.  I called Michael Taggart and asked him what the story behind Goldback was.  He was very surprised that I knew anything about it since he had never brought it up.  He described it as a dead crypto project, and that was enough for me.  We went ahead and got the website and the trademark.  We paid $8,000 for Goldback.com from a third party who had speculatively purchased it years before.  The trademark was approved about a year later.\"https://www.goldback.com/our-story",
