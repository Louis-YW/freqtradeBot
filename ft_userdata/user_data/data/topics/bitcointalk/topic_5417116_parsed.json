  "content": "Have you ever seen bitcoin miners censoring transactions? Well, there have been some isolated cases in the past, but bitcoin censorship resistance is strong and transactions just go through all blocks.Less than 30 days after the implementation of PoS in ethereum, we can see that more than 51% of blocks are censoring transactions due to OFAC impositions. More than 51% of blocks are now OFAC compliant.We csn clearly see how blocks are more compliant after the merge.https://www.mevwatch.info/This is what you,Â  me and everyone need to show when we see arguments like \"bitcoin is bad for environment, it should move to pos\".Pos defeats the whole purpose of bitcoin!",

Ethereum is going now, with every day passing by, towards a centralized worthless \"crypto\".Bitcoin is still a commodity.I've always said that altcoins are great, especially as testing environments for various ideas, good or bad.Ethereum has just shown us that switching to PoS is a very bad idea.",

      "body": "MEV (and their censoring) have existed long before ETH enabled its PoS chain. Idk why that's being pointed here as \"PoW vs PoS\", since one thing is unrelated to the other. The use of pro-censoring relayers has been increasing because it's profitable for validators, but even miners used to do that on PoW.i.e I was using Flashbot's RPC endpoint months ago to escape the \"dark forest\" from sandwich attacks.",
