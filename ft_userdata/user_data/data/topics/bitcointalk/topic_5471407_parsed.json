It is actually all the other new cryptocurrencies which are much much much more advanced than Bitcoin.Bitcoin is old and obsolete compared to the new stuff.So here is their plan:The Blackrock ETF will be approved very soon and this will allow \"wallstreet\" to buy bitcoin.This will cause major price surge of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will basically go to 1 million, 2 million, 3 million etc...Thus will persuade owners of shitcoins to dump their shitcoins and buy bitcoins... which they can then sell again for USA dollars, so there will be demand for USA dollars.USA also posses bitcoins from seizures, so they can lower bitcoin whenever they want somewhat, but that is beside the point, it would be a temporarely drop.The last couple of days there have been Bitcoin Price Spikes.It's now very clear that these are \"TESTS\" to see what would happen and to see how the market reacts...It's a bit nasty right now, because it seems people are making a wrong decision, they believe if bitcoin rises that all other alt coins will rise too, so people are now buying a bunch of shitcoins everywhere... but these will soon crash very fast and very hard ! I warned you !Sell your shitcoins while you still can.Conclusion:Major financial attack coming on the cryptocoin industry/cryptocoin currencies ! Most shitcoins will go to zero/become worthless.My estimate would be: Destruction within one week, maybe even just a couple of days as people start to realize what is going on.Whoever sells their shitcoins last, is going to be the major sucker....",

Meaning of obsolete:Quote1. no longer produced or used; out of date.\"the disposal of old and obsolete machinery\"2.BIOLOGY(of a part or characteristic of an organism) less developed than formerly or in a related species; rudimentary; vestigial.3. cause (a product or idea) to become obsolete by replacing it with something new.\"we're trying to stimulate the business by obsoleting last year's designs\"So is bitcoin obsolete? No. Also because of low transaction fee, less security and the new vulnerabilities of new cryptocurrencies, it can not be said that new cryptocurrencies is having advanced technology. The developers of new coins and tokens will say this to attract people and more people have little knowledge. Quote from: Harambe on October 24, 2023, 12:33:22 AMI think it's nonsense.

Also Wall Street can already purchase Bitcoin if they want, an ETF is not really needed to do that.I agree to this but most of the altcoins will increase and fall back to the prices they were before bitcoin halving occured.

Bitcoin is public. Nobody will require and evaluate forms and declarations in order to buy Bitcoin. And whether BlackRock will succeed in its application or not, Bitcoin will get back to $69,000, reach $100,000 and beyond.",

But for crypto enthusiast, we've seen wars already and then the pandemic, and it didn't have any significant effect on crypto market itself. And I guess that's make at least for Bitcoin to become more stronger is that it has 4 year cycle, based on bitcoin halving. So there is a sense of balance, as we have bear and bull cycle.",

Anyway, we are all just human so we can never be sure of what can be as factors can be moving parts that can be changing as time passes by.

It's all altcoins because they think bitcoin grows too little and cannot satisfy their greed. That is what is happening in the market and it will continue to do so even if thousands more altcoins collapse like FTX or Luna.

I'm not sure it is worth spending any time watching it though.QuoteThis will cause major price surge of Bitcoin.

If they start this plan the way it is being assumed here, other countries can also buy up bitcoin and strengthen their shitty fiat similar to the dollar. Which means it won't work.Besides, US dollar is already printed so much that even $1 million+ bitcoin value can not cover it enough to save it from demise in the long run. After all the trillion dollar oil industry with Petrodollar could not do it, why should the much smaller and more diversified bitcoin market do?P.S. If US regime wanted to save the dollar they would have to find something they fully control, like a new centralized shitgovcoin  a CBDC so to speak and actually in the past couple of months there has been talks of creating a garbage like that....I don't know how effective that would be but that is the route they'll take not bitcoin which they can never control.",
