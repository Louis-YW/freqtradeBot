  "content": "Please, I do not want reply like 'do not save money on exchanges'. I do not do that, only the amount of money I am using for trading are on exchanges, which I even still reduce with the use of leverage.I have preferred not to depend on an exchange, I use Binance which has multi-asset mode, but later prefer to use more other exchanges. On OKX, I think it has multi-asset too, but for users that has $50000 and above but I do not have up to that. On Binance, I can use multi-asset mode even for $50 or $100 worth of coin. On the other exchanges that I am using, they do not have multi-asset mode. Bitcoin price is down massively and I want my trading fund to always be in bitcoin. I still want to be able to open USDT paired positions and still have my asset in bitcoin which can only be possible with multi-asset mode. Is their any other exchanges that support multi-asset mode with little amount of money like $1000?",
