  "content": "Hello,For personal reason I want to create a 24 word seed through electrum (instead of a typical 12 word), this will be done on cold storage through an air gapped computer.Should I use:1) Electrum console to do this ? If so do you know how to ?2) Can I use this website ? https://iancoleman.io/bip39/#englishWhat will be the difference between option 1 and 2 ? Would I be able to retrieve my wallet also with Blue Wallet (for example) for option 1 and option 2 ?",

However it is best if you use the same software you originally did to generate the seed that is electrum itself. Just to complement Abdussamad reply: While Electrum isn't able to generate BIP39 version, it is able to import it. To do that you just need to click on \"Options\" and check \"BIP39 seed\" after entering your seed phrases and you'll be able to import your wallet into Electrum.If you're interested in knowing which wallets support generating BIP39 version you've got a few to choose from:Hardware wallets:All of Ledger devices generate seed phrases using BIP39[1]All of Trezor devices generate seed phrases using BIP39[2]Foundation devices[3]Software wallets:BlueWallet[4]Bither[5][1]https://www.ledger.com/academy/bip-39-the-low-key-guardian-of-your-crypto-freedom[2]https://trezor.io/learn/a/what-are-bips-slips[3]https://docs.foundationdevices.com/en/passport/setup[4]https://bluewallet.io/features/[5]https://bither.net/",

I just know that after tried import the Electrum seed to Blue Wallet, that show detail on my phone: HD Electrum (BIP 32 P2WPKH), and, the difference between both wallets is, In electrum we have 10 changed address while in blue wallet only have 1 changed address. So, why is different? I used the same electrum seed, and didn't change a single letter or word seed. And, how can add the change address on blue wallet?.",

Whether you generate a wallet with bluewallet itself or you import an electrum's seed phrase, it displays only one change address. Once you use that change address, it will display the second one.",
