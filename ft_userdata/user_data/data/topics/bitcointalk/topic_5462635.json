If light wallets are secure I don't want to use my SSD for another blockchain test.How's XMR a privacy coin? If it's exchanged to XMR from BTC can it be analysed from where it's traded?

If that's how Monero's working to give privacy it's a welcome for users who'll prefer privacy as priority. It's up to users to take other precautions.

Instant exchanges with VPN's better for anonymity.

Another obvious option is the Ledger Nano S a hardware wallet that offers excellent security and offline storage for your Monero. Some people use the Cake Wallet for iOS and Android which is a mobile wallet that provides convenience and privacy features.

If you are dealing with a centralized entity, in this case, instant exchange, there is always a possibility they keep logs. This also applies even if you use a VPN. VPN in its current technicalities incapable of being provable verified of not keeping logs.With that to say, that particular instant exchange knows that you have exchanged your Bitcoin to Monero (They also log which address you've exchanged to). However, they can not know any further about whether the XMRs are still there or already being moved, they didn't know anything else.AFAIK, there is a decentralized way to swap BTC to XMR, you should consider and take a look at atomic swap.",

If you use the same account in the future to convert Monero into Bitcoin, they will know that. If you want to enhance your privacy, manage bisq with Tor and convert Bitcoin to Monero and vice versa.Monerujo is a good wallet if you want to use your phone.",

That's important to understand because it'll explain if Monero's privacy really works.Monero is fundamentally private. It has the property of untraceability and unlinkability. Keep in mind it also utilizes a stealth address. All of them enable Monero's fungibility.Here is the thing, those properties are the reason why I said they won't know anything else after you receive the XMR into your own wallet. That means the Monero itself is inherently private. Now since what you asked is the BTC, of course, the centralized swap services that you used, are very likely to keep and store logs for the BTC UTXO that are linked to any identity that they could derive from the swap processes.",

How's the Feather wallet helping to keep XMR private?Ring Signatures work to ensure the output of the transaction is untraceable. The history of that particular coin is unknown, what happens after is also applied by this feature. So if you make a transaction, an outside observer would never know if you truly sent it or not.In regard to Feather Wallet, as explained on https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/#mobilelight, it connects to remote nodes. That part is the crucial one. If you wish to maintain privacy, make sure when you use the wallet, you are doing it over a secure and private network. All is good since the wallet is not a Remote synchronization (lightweight) type that requires you to share some keys.",
