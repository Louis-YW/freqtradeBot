  "content": "So, for some days now, I've had this thought of \"how much some people really value their privacy in gambling\", like as a gambler, you signed up on a new casino and immediately, you are allowed to deposit and play without going through a KYC verification process like we do on some casinos immediately after registration.You start playing and luckily, you won a significant amount of money. I know the word \"significant\" can mean different values for different gamblers, so let's use figures i personally think are significant and capable of changing lives. So, let's assume you luckily won anything as from $70,000 and above with a total bet below $100, and to withdraw this money, or even part of it, the casino requires you to pass all levels of verification in their system, which means that you will have to provide them all your personally information down to the most private of them all, and this casino is relatively new and you are not sure about their reputation.Will you go ahead and provide them all they require from you for account verification, so they can process your withdrawal request, or will you willingly forfeit such amount of money back to the casino on the account that your private information is more expensive than that amount of money you have own from them?I love to read your thoughts on this.",

Personally, I will submit the documents and do the KYC, provided I will be paid my winnings. We do KYC for minor things talk more of when $70k is involved. I know there are people that will think twice before submitting  such KYC but I don't belong to that category because the amount involved is huge and it is my wish I get to such a situation.",

If I win $70000, I do not care about KYC but the money won and I will do KYC immediately. What can be the problem is for the gambling site not to be capable of paying the money, it can not be a scam site that will sell people's KYC to other people to use. Also in reputed sites that you have use KYC to verify before, not that they are better because any site can misuse customers KYC.",

To avoid from the requirement of submitting your identification, try reading their ToS before playing. KYC is always included in their ToS if it is being required upon withdrawal. Gambling house does not change it without prior notice to every player they have. Also, providing KYC to a new casino will always depend on their reputation. If you have doubts on using the gambling website, don't try to deposit and win against the house. That would be better. If there's a casino that you truly trusted, better to stick with it. If trying new casino is out of your option, and if you are the type of gambler who wants to try different casinos, reach out to the people you know and have them suggest the casino they tried before.",

This is because, how can you be sure they will actually pay out large sums of money? They might just steal your data and make you go through all the KYC requirements, asking for more secure documents. Before using any casino, make sure you're familiar with their terms and conditions. Even if they don't initially require KYC, they might change their conditions in the future.",

If it's $1000 up then they would willingly provide everything, even their spouse's name.   I am not really that sensitive when it comes to privacy maybe because I live in a place where they will take your information most of the time even for just exchanging a $100 bill in a money exchange site. Then, there's also the cashing out of money from digital money where they will also take your information just to be safe. If I were in that position, I'd willingly give it out because that's my money now after I gamble my own money.

Because it was a significant amount it took me two days to go back and forth with this casino on my kyc document.

Waiting until I've won a substantial amount of money or when I'm ready to withdraw could indeed be too late, and this might lead to unnecessary complications. I appreciate your insight, and it's a valuable reminder for everyone to prioritize research and ensure the legitimacy and reputation of the casino beforehand. Thank you for sharing this wisdom!",
