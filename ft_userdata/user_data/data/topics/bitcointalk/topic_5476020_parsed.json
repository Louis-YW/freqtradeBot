You know, just recently, CZ got arrested and will have an agreement (settlement) with the US governmnet to pay billions just to stay free, so it's really alarming that Binance has been recently involve on legal problems which could be a sign that it might go down soon (God Forbib).key facts BTW.QuoteRonaldo began partnering with Binance in 2022, creating NFT collections and posts on social media to his 849 million followers.I think this word \"partnering\" with Binance will drag binance name to this.",

Ronaldo have been promoting Binance for about a year now, how come this just happened now? They're not letting Binance catch a break, it seems that the upcoming competition that's waiting the ETF approval are trying to make sure their path is properly paved.",

So now what more do these authorities want? to the point where they want to attack Ronaldo for promoting Binance.

Enemies!!!Well, if this is real, the kind of lawsuit like this is baseless in our society, it's another one from foolish persons who want to waste money. Ordinarily, if hired a qualified and sincere lawyer, the lawyer would have advised them against it because it wouldn't see the light of day. This is just like the case of those who sued Elon Musk for his activities related to Dogecoin, have you heard anything about it again? Elon Musk's case is even worse than that of C. Ronaldo, so it can't see the light of the day.Come to think of it, Binance is a business, not only that, it's a registered and somewhat regulated business. How is promoting a business an issue? Binance is not the first business that would be fined and still being promoted, slapping a fine on a business doesn't mean the businesses must collapse, and once the penalty has been reached, it's all gone.A mere file to disregard the suit is enough to win it. And don't be surprised that some rivals could be behind all this to pull Binance down, regardless, this lawsuit is baseless. A company should not promote their service because of a fine? I can't even imagine it.",

Taking advantage of Ronaldo's reputation will at least make Binance users feel worried these days. Then the biggest exchanges like Binance will slowly lose users and this has indeed become an additional target for the SEC after successfully bringing down CZ. Do you have any wild theories about Blackrock's involvement in making Binance so desperate that it went bankrupt?I discovered the theory around last June https://twitter.com/Travis_Kling/status/1669719994379255808 The bottom line is that a Bitcoin ETF won't be approved until Binance collapses first. In my opinion this still makes sense because it is the end of the business competition and the Bitcoin Spot ETF will use Coinbase as a Custody Wallet. So, is this a coincidence or a structured plan?",

He is simply advertising cooperation, he has never called for investment in binance or any crypto project. I suspect there is a force that wants to lower Binance's reputation and they are willing to do everything to make Binance's reputation go down. Another thing is that investors who lose money because of their own stupidity blame others, and these people will continue to lose more money in the future, I am quite sure of this.",

We all know that when Ronaldo signed the endorsement deal Binance was not under any form of sanctions and the SEC never made any public announcement that the exchange was offering some unregistered services. However, the plaintiffs are claiming that Ronaldo's financial advisers should have scrutinized the operations of Binance to ascertain if the service or product to be promoted is registered. They are also claiming that the SEC gave a directive when Kim Kardashian and Paul Pierce were fined for promoting EthereumMax (EMAX) tokens which applies to all celebrities promoting cryptocurrencies and crypto-related services. The directive was that celebrities should disclose how much they receive from promoting cryptocurrencies which Ronaldo failed to do. So they are suing the superstar not just for promoting Binance but for failing to disclose how much he has earned from the endorsement deal.",
