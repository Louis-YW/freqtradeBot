I refer to this chart on other source.According to the chart link you have provided the average transaction fee for the bitcoin network today is 0.00034 BTC. Where do you get that 0.1BTC in gas fees which is equivalent to 3653.60 USD? I don't think the bitcoin network was ever that congested that users needed to pay that much for a single transaction. Bitcoin network gas fees is not constant they change according to the traffic they get. The more transactions in the memepool the more congested the network will be.",

I see that there's no move in price as well. More demand means more price isn't it?I see where your question is headed, you see the mempool congested which means that there is high demand or supply of bitcoin which should have impacted the price either upward movement or downward movement but it is not that. Yes that is because the mempool is not just congested with bitcoin only but with also has another token called the BRC20 tokens like ORDI on its network and there mass transactions has been the one congesting the bitcoin mempool. The bitcoin transactions in the mempool are just the usual transactions but since the listing of ORDI on binance exchange many people have started falling into the prey of buying it and it is the token that is congesting the mempool. As for the ETH gas fee or its congestion that’s also has to do with the movement of numerous number of tokens on its network that is been transferred and not the ETH coin it self.

I refer to this chart on other source.You are checking bitcoin fees on the wrong site or either you’re evaluating it wrongly your self. Bitcoin transactions fees has never been that high to 0.1 BTC. Even the highest bitcoin transaction fee we have had since this congestion stated hasn’t surpassed 500sats/vbyte as far as I can remember which is equivalent to just then equivalent to 0.0007 BTC You should check  https://mempool.space/ for proper fee estimation",

How this could happen? Just take a look at the price - it hardly moved from the average!Only miners have the authority to determine the direction of fee prices, whether up or down.  To understand this, we must take into account the profit formula of mining companies because they do not do this voluntarily.  They are companies whose primary goal is to achieve the most profits possible, and in this market they have fierce competition.  These companies are mainly affected by the extent of demand for using the network because they operate on the principle of collecting transactions that have more fees, and the extent of the flow of transactions on the network is not always controlled by the price of the currency itself because people may sell a lot when prices rise or buy more when prices fall.",

How this could happen? Just take a look at the price - it hardly moved from the average!Fee is based on the demand of sending transactions not derived from the buying demand which will boost the price. Anyone can send tokens without to exchange or other address which means this doesn’t affect the price. Any movement of tokens from different address is not related to buying a token.I believe the price will pump if the fee is lesser since it only means that everyone is holding while most the trades is happening on exchange via internal transaction.",

This nonsense called Ordinals need to be stopped immediately. Otherwise, Bitcoin network will also become similar to ETH.The fees for bitcoin do have some natural correlation with price, that is at least if we assume that there's stable demand for space in bitcoin blocks. So really it's a multi factor issue, but you can't deny correlation with price. Go to the following website, what do you notice? https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-price-btc.html#alltimeBitcoin fees peaked when prices were also reaching ATH levels. There's some very high correlation with the two well known BTCUSD bubbles of 2017 and 2021. As of this year's peaks in fees, yes, you're right. They're directly caused by heightened demand for block space caused by Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens that take a lot of space in blocks with their really inefficient transactions, putting images and \"token\" creations on chain.",

How this could happen? Just take a look at the price - it hardly moved from the average!You are quite late to notice it because those who are regularly dealing in crypto are well aware of the BTC fee, and this fee does not shoot up due to the price of BTC. If you think the price of BTC is the only reason behind the transaction fee, then I think you should gather some information first.I can assist you in learning that transaction fees don't only depend on the BTC price; they also depend on the traffic on the BTC blockchain. Due to the recent Ordinals probelms, the BTC blockchain is loaded with thousands of transactions in a short period of time, and a lot of bad people are using techniques to dust the blockchain to increase the fee artificially.These bad actors could be anyone but are assumed to be miners because their actions benefit the miners most. Other than this, ETH's price was already high, but I was not aware that it was near $9.",

There will be some solutions to these sudden high fees because it's not the first time that we've dealt with this. It has happened before and likely to happen in the future but don't mind about the fees in the future and much better to get to that point of owning 1 Bitcoin first and let the network handle on its own.",

So there's that. In any case, I don't see gas fees (as long as they are not astronomically high) as a massive loss for cryptocurrencies, since at the end of the day this is an indication that something within the network is transpiring, which is a good sign for the most part since it means a lot more people are becoming involved in crypto.",
