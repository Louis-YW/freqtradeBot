  "content": "Fall of the Banking system is actually the Rise of BitcoinThe traditional banking system is about to end and there is no doubt about it. One after the other the banks are daying on their own doing. The failure of the banking system can arise a new Chaios in the financial market and it's happening from the start of 2023. The recent incidents attracted many analysts to propose a new solution to the financial crisis and their ending solution for each problem is Bitcoin I think this can help us in many ways. Finally, with Bitcoin the worst-interest banking system will come to end, USD was considered the universal currency which is the root of all the problems currently we are facing. Let's learn first the basic point of how BTC is the best solution.How Bitcoin is the Best solutionFirst, the replacement of the USD when any country will propose its own currency can start a big conflict between major nations and the consequences of that battle are not going to be good. Bitcoin is a totally decentralized asset under nobody's control so it can prevent the above crisis.We have already seen how USD destroyed the Small nation's economies as their first mistake was using the USD as their reserves now US government recently announced printing $2T again and for a long time US government is printing money for no reason blindly and they are ignoring the future consequences for the solution of current problems. Bitcoin BTC has a fixed and limited supply so it can prevent the devaluation of the assets.Considering just these two basic points we can say that it's the golden time for the Bticin to shine in this Bull run and become a true store of value and global currency. Bitcoin can rise upto the $1M valuation in 3 Months this is the theory presented by the BalaJii  and I think it's not that easy but still it's possible till the end of this Bull Run with huge developments at least BTC can set it as a base goal for next Halving.But HowBalaJii .. this guy has explained many points but in my view, for the coming days, Bull run his theory somehow justifies some base points. such as;Bitcoin market was under pressure for a long time due to CPI and Intrest reports even the whole stock market was under pressure due to the last few moth economic developments. But now if the US government stops increasing interest rates in the next months the risk investment markets especially Bitcoin will attract investors for future opportunities.As US government decided to print $2T and also update it on the Balance sheet which is indicating Quantitative easing in the coming month where a major part of this easing will be going to be part of the Crypto market and China has already announced Hong Kong official Trading Hub for the crypto market from the month of Junebanks Actually lost the confidence of the customers/users as after a few months back developments I am not sure that my saving is safe in banks and even its continuously devaluating so I will definitely prefer the alternatives and Crypto is the best option is not just a thing to say in reality now people are clear where they need to store their assetsConcluding the reports, analysis, and current economic situation I think now Bitcoin value dream of a trader to $1M has became a living reality its not far from us but still, there is time, but I am not sure how much. Balaji Thread is good but his timestamp seems weird as I don't think in just 90 days these developments are possible.Note: This topic idea is after reading the twitter Thread and all the points discussed are based on my personal views so i might be wrong.",

It didn't happen during the last banking crisis either.But let's say it happens and the price of 1 bitcoin goes up to $1M because the dollar isn't worth anything anymore. What would you be able to buy with that $1M if the dollar isn't worth anything anymore anyway? It could happen that you get less for this $1M than today for 27k$ (I take the current bitcoin price as a basis). Therefore it is questionable whether this scenario would be really good.Still, these tweets are interesting and I'm curious to see if it's really going to happen or if it's all just scaremongering.",

The banking system should just pick up on failed policies now that it's not yet too late to admit their mistake and make possible amends, which in turn might revive most users' trust, even if it's not all of it.All this incident has, to some extent, made people realize that they shouldn't feel too comfortable allowing any entity to be in charge of their funds' security, no matter who is in charge. The best way is for all of us to take responsibility for our own financial security. To some point, we all still need the banking sector.",

Every time something bad happens with the economy they expect Bitcoin to replace fiat and banks. And every time there isn't even a significant increase in adoption.In 2021 global inflation started increasing and Bitcoin was rising and there was a narrative that Bitcoin will become a hedge against inflation adopted by institutions. And then Bitcoin crashed and institutions forgot about it. Something similar is happening now. A lot of hype that drives the price up, whales are buying to dump when the market will lose momentum. If you buy now and sell a the top, you will make a lot of money. If you will keep buying and wait for $1M, you will be sitting on a huge unrealized loss when Bitcoin will inevitably crash.",

However, if hyperinflation will be happening then at least if you have Bitcoin then I would say you have something to lean on in difficult times. Or you can get away from USA (assuming you are based in there) and come to my country where you can still enjoy your millions - just a suggestion anyway. We can see that in the history of Bitcoin there is not big \"correlation\" with it and the banking system. We have to remember that it was born in response to the 2008 crisis which was then also centered on the banking and financial system of USA. Now, on a lesser extent we are experiencing the same so we see BTC and other coins rising on the market with some predicting that it can go to the moon and even to Mars in case there can be hyperinflation to engulf the country. So this is for us a good news but bad news for many affected by the banking turmoil.

The world simply has no replacement for it yet and bitcoin is not the replacement, it is just an additional option that will allow its users to decrease their exposure to the collapsing economy.QuoteConsidering just these two basic points we can say that it's the golden time for the Bticin to shine in this Bull run and become a true store of value and global currency. Bitcoin can rise upto the $1M valuation in 3 MonthsBitcoin will definitely start rising from now on and we can see $1 million sooner than everyone was expecting but I still don't think it can happen in just 3 months.Keep in mind that we have dedollarisation going on in the world which will dump the USD value hence helping the bitcoin price shoot up to the moon.QuoteBitcoin market was under pressure for a long time due to CPI and Intrest reports even the whole stock market was under pressure due to the last few moth economic developments.I disagree. The downtrend in bitcoin market was partly because of market manipulation and weak hands dumping and partly because of the recession (not inflation and CPI and definitely not because of stock market).QuoteBut now if the US government stops increasing interest rates in the next months the risk investment markets especially Bitcoin will attract investors for future opportunities.Meh. The interest rate's effect is no longer there. In other words if they increase it more than this, it won't change a thing except worsening recession in United States. The effects on bitcoin should be significantly decreased too.Quotebanks Actually lost the confidence of the customers/users as after a few months back developments I am not sure that my saving is safe in banks and even its continuously devaluating so I will definitely prefer the alternatives and Crypto is the best option is not just a thing to say in reality now people are clear where they need to store their assetsThis.

To be honest, it's not a good thing for the world to suffer a financial crisis.Lots of peoples' lives depend on this and many have to go through a lot. This will bring an overall collapse which we really can't afford right now. So I don't think bitcoin will reach 1M at least in this year.I agree, it would be impossible for bitcoin to reach $1M without any crisis happening in the economic situation in the world. Remember that bitcoin is a volatile system that you can't guarantee that it would reach to $1M in just months. It took years before reaching its current value ($27k) it might be possible but it sounds good to be true that it will increase the worth of bitcoin in just few months. And the fact that financial crisis is no joke for you to celebrate just to increase the value of bitcoin. Imagine gaining some profit for the hunger and death also increase? It shouldn't be rush let's remember the people in our community that will suffer from the process. This may bring the downfall of the economics that many people can be affected.",
