I think we are giving Elon Musk too much relevance, why not let him do things the way he likes? He is a lousy man, he would let everyone knows even before he purchases it, but I doubt he would do a thing like that soon, if not ever again. The way the guy behaves like a child has made me lose some respect for him, so he should do whatever he likes.He is never a good fan of Bitcoin, he only caught the cruise while BTC and Dogecoin were moving so well. Now that things are not the same, he turned his back and made his company do the same.",

Sell stock -> get cash -> put cash into operations of businesses that are loosing money every day they are open.It works till you run out of stock to sell, then it all implodes in a big mess. Sometimes it works sometimes it does not. I would not think it's that big a deal considering the amount of stock he has, BUT since it was sold at the lowest point of stock price YTD that either means that he really needs the cash OR he thinks the stock it going lower.No way to know at the moment.-Dave",

NElon is not dumb to put his money on crypto that might serve as exit liquidity for other institutional investors that trapped on the peak. Also he still might have some crypto investment in his bag so putting that 3.5B is doubtful for a guy like him in time like this. Probably he will just re-invest it on different company since TSLA is already subjected with many negativity before then buy back later. Elon is known for selling off his stock before though.Probably his action is purely toward global recession preparation or new investment opportunity for him since Tesla is just one of his company.",

I know that since some time ago the community has been obsessed with everything that Elon does but this is getting out of control, has Elon expressed recently any desire to buy bitcoin, dogecoin or any altcoin for that matter which could lead us to conclude that somehow this movement could be related to purchase of some assets in this market? If that is not the case then I think people need to slow down as this movement could have no relationship whatsoever with this market.",

You can try to play the game and maybe you'll get lucky but it's still going to be their game. You don't control anything.You take leveraged position and they'll liquidate you. You'll sell and they'll pump it back again like they did in 2021 when the price fell to 30k. You can hold and they'll release some FUD to make the price go lower. I refuse to play their game because eventually the price will go higher and higher. The only thing we don't know is when and how high before they crash it again. As for Musk, he's a manipulator like the rest of them. When he tells you he bought it's because he wants to sell.",

He needs to sell Tesla stocks but by selling Tesla stock the price goes down further and he needs to sell more Tesla stock.
