When you own your coins, you're sort of protected financially in the sense that you now own coins on both networks and will still be on the train whether a chain or another keeps traction as the other loses popularity. When you own shares of a Bitcoin ETF, you don't get to choose what path you want to take and if the community decides the new fork is the way to go..

How would that work exactly? And most importantly, doesn't that mean that the more ETFs gain traction, the more the original chain would keep its value over the other one?

We know most of Bitcoin Spot ETFs choose Coinbase as their custodians so we will go back to a centralized exchange.Centralized exchanges, as they shown with past Bitcoin forks and altcoin forks, will have their own criteria and support (or don't support) a fork. If they support it, they will do technical steps to claim forked coins and credit it to their user accounts.In a bad scenario, if they don't support a fork, their users will not receive forked coins.If you worry about loss on forked coins, store your Bitcoin and altcoins in your non custodial wallets and claim forked coins by yourself in future. Claiming forked coins is risky practice because it leaks your private keys.LoyceV's Bitcoin Fork claiming guide (and service).",

I get they don't want to deal with each worthless Fork. I can create Bitcoin LV (Loyce Vision) today and nobody cares. That's okay. But if a Fork has value, they should not just choose the most valuable Fork, they should sell the other Forks and pay dividend to the ETF holders.Then again, I also get that this could become complicated: what if Bitcoin LV is initially worthless, but after 2 years it's worth $42. That would mean they can still sell the Fork, but the ETF holders at that moment are different than the ETF holders during Fork days. So distributing the dividend to the right people is complicated.I'd expect competition between ETFs to eventually lead to this solution, but I'm afraid it's only going to be implemented after customers lose money if a new valuable Fork emerges.",

These institutions only care about what would be both convenient and beneficial to them. Yes they could distribute the equal amount of coins in the second chain to their customers but I don’t think they would be as you said go through all that hassle. They would just be making their heads hurt with all the additional regulatory requirements attached to it if ever.QuoteEdit: It’s funny.

I think, having direct coin ownership makes it all easier without having to hang on every change in the situation. Whether there will be more changes later depends on the manager as well.",

      "body": "People who choose to invest in Bitcoin through ETFs must be aware that their choice has certain advantages, but also disadvantages. I therefore think that there may even be a part that regulates forked coins in the terms of business of companies that enable trading with ETFs - because it does not seem to me that such large and serious companies would leave such a possibility undefined.What I see as a much bigger problem is the fact that these companies clearly state in their conditions (at least as far as BlackRock is concerned) that they reserve the right to choose the chain that they consider to be correct. This would mean that they can orchestrate a fork and then say that it is the real BTC - and regardless of whether the community can choose to continue following the original chain, on the other hand we would have far more powerful enemies than the BCH gang that once tried to push their coin as real BTC.",

Since Coinbase is the primary custodian of the BTC ETFs that means they ultimately control the actual coins, so the firm that issues the ETF would no doubt have some legal agreement about forks. Likewise the ETF issuer, based on whatever agreement they have with the custodian, would decide if clients get a fork. I very much doubt clients would get access to any forks as they are buying an ETF for Bitcoin and not Bitcoin plus forks. So either the custodian or the ETF issuer is gonna own the coins from any forks. In terms of affecting bitcoin, I don't see how it would.

If they lose capital of their customers, they will go bankrupted and go into jails.ETF companies don't own private keys and they will have to depend on their partners, the custodians like Coinbase, to claim forked coins. If Coinbase support, I believe they will do, fork claims, ETF companies will not lose anything.The 2017 hard fork create Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, but we see the main chain, Bitcoin continues to grow, higher and higher in hash rate and price.
