  "content": "There are several threats a crypto trader has to face. The worst part of being a trader IMO is the emotional factor control. Similar to a gambling addict, a trader experiences the same rush when doing winning trades. However, in trading, you need to know how and be prepared to lose so that you can later win. Having a defined strategy that was previously tested and proven successful and then sticking to the plan is key. But that is also when the worst part comes. It's when a trader needs to control his emotion and let the plan roll out as it was defined even if it means you are going to lose. According to Steve Burns, there are 10 main Trader’s Worst Enemies:StubbornnessArroganceOpinionBiasEuphoriaAngerAdding to a losing tradeChasing a tradeTrading too bigTheir selfBurns tries to understand the process of trading by breaking it down into 10 enemy stages that the Trader needs to overcome. Would you add any other?",

I think crypto investors should get rid of this greed.I guess we should say that greed is the root of 98% of the losses. So yeah, we could include Greed to Burn's enemy list. There is also something that is directly tied to emotional response but is generally triggered by outside factors such as new or FUD, and that is the fear of missing out, aka FOMO. So, FOMO should also be added to Burn's List.We now have 12 Trader's Worst Enemies:StubbornnessArroganceOpinionBiasEuphoriaAngerAdding to a losing tradeChasing a tradeTrading too bigTheir selfGreedFOMO",

These are actually quite important to consider, especially given the fact that a Trader should always have a golden rule as well as a defined strategy. This is achieved by finding a strategy that proves successful and then testing it to further prove it is successful. Not having accountability makes you go past accepting your mistakes to gather knowledge enabling you to avoid making the same mistakes all over again. Risk management is also something that is an important part of trading. A professional trader always has a plan that guides him to what techniques should he apply to different circumstances and which red flags can be indicative of big movements. When a trader is not having into account its stake and the risk involved and plays out as if it was gambling this is poor Risk Management. So, two more added!

When something goes up (a stock/crypto), you will keep thinking it will go up and up as you get creedy and always want more something. It is very hard to set up a goal where you want to sell something and stick to that.",

      "body": "Everyone says that greed is the main problem that poses the worst threat to traders and it is true. but apart from FEAR and GREED in trading is also a major factor for traders, especially those who are novice traders.To Balance fear and greed is an absolute necessity that you need to have. Otherwise, no matter how great the trading you do, you will never get a profit.here are some tips that you can do in balancing FEAR and GREED:• Your success is greatly influenced by how to balance the role of fear and greed in trading. People who have good self-control will easily do it.   However, if it is difficult to control it, you can stick to the discipline of following a trading plan.    Analyze and determine which coin to buy, determine the take profit and stop loss points.    Do this with discipline: Plan the trade and trade the plan.• Fear is intense influence how you manage cash flow. If you use debt, margin or spend all your wealth in trading,   you can be sure you will be very scared if the price suddenly drops.• Realize profit if it is profitable according to your target. Be grateful for what you have. Do not be too eager to get a lot of profit.   There is still plenty of other time to trade. Determine your take profit point. Stop trading after profit if necessary.• It may be a cliché, but you can start trading with prayer. Aren't you trying to make money lawfully, why not ask Him for guidance?   Trust me, there are many things you can't control in life.",
