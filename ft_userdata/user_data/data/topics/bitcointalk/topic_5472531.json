Some Bitcoins came from the wallet address marked as F2Pool by bitinfocharts, which may be early miners.So these early miners have kept their 6.5k Bitcoin saved until now. 12 Years later, that's worth a freaking $230 Million Dollars.",

Or probably the wallet is a multi sig and owners hand needs to change so they created new one and moved it there.",

Whatever is the reason of moving their bitcoins to another wallet it is not yet confirmed that they have move to the exchanges to sell it. These whales are more intelligent and have more knowledge then the common man, it is already obvious that Bitcoin halving is near and the Bitcoin will move to another all time high so why would they be selling all the bitcoins at a very cheap prices. It really doesn't make sense to sell now and I think we should not be panic by the movement of these coins from one wallet to the another specially at this stage of the market.Yes if Bitcoin was near its all time high or in a bull market we are at the peak of the next bull market and then these move happens then that is a time to be a bit more careful but not at this time at least.",

Therefore, it is becoming easier for whales in the crypto/bitcoin world to manipulate the market. Because simply by transferring assets from a wallet to an exchange, other bitcoin investors may fear that the whale's bitcoin assets will be sold and this will cause the price of bitcoin to fall. But in my personal opinion, the step taken by whales to send bitcoin assets to exchanges, is most likely due to the fact that bitcoin will soon face a halving cycle as well as a bull market. So that way the whales send the bitcoin assets they own first.Because if, for example, a whale sends the bitcoin assets it owns during a halving or when a bullish situation occurs, this will most likely cause greater panic among bitcoin investors and at the same time it is very likely that more bitcoin investors will sell their bitcoin assets. . because they are afraid that whales will sell their bitcoin assets first. So, if a whale sends bitcoin assets during a halving or when a bull market has occurred, it is likely that the whale will sell its bitcoin assets at a slightly lower price, because many investors have already sold their bitcoin assets. So in my personal opinion, this is why whales prefer to send the bitcoin assets they own before the halving and bull market occur. Because even if whales send their bitcoin assets to the exchange, bitcoin investors will definitely not panic. Because most bitcoin investors definitely have a sales target in the bullish market too.",

The cost of mining in the past would be cheaper than latest years like 2017 or this year. I am not surprised if they held their bitcoin so far but I feel surprised if someone (not miners) from the past did not lose their private keys.At Bitinfocharts.com, after page 9, https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses-10.html there are many addresses with above 1000 BTC to 2000 BTC. How many of those dormant addresses will wake up from now till halving and about one year after halving?",

We can take off our tinfoil hats for sometime and not try to link it with a conspiracy or speculation about bull or bear runs, it could just be people moving their coins.The idea that could be interesting to discuss is that of 'lost coins'. The figure of 4 million lost BTC is surely just picked out of a hat, and i am so sure that there are so many coins that haven't moved for long time, and people think they are lost, but they are not, just the owners holding on for a long time.",
