  "content": "I made a post about crypto influencers not that long ago talking about how people still trust them despite all the cringe and stupid stuff they post. In the the last post, after reading your comments, I came to conclusion that most of the people who follow crypto influencers are:1) Normies (or lazy people who don't want to do research and want to follow trend)2) Bots3) Bitcoin uneducated peopleI think the third category is the most interesting one because I don't know how long it will exist considering what is happening with Bitcoin right now.We can see that there are more and more programs about Bitcoin awareness and crypto education. More people are getting interested in what bitcoin/crypto actually is. And one of the signs of Bitcoin adoption is the promotion of Bitcoin education.I think in the next few years, influencers can lose their \"influence\" over uneducated people because they're gonna be fewer and fewer of these people on the internet. And I don't think that bots and normies are sustainable audiences so I think influencers will see a hard time soon.And overall, bitcoin education will decrease people's need for influencers simply because they will already have all the knowledge needed and all these Twitter posts about \"PUMP IS COMING\" will sound pretty stupid. And you shouldn't be the most educated person to see it. And it's pretty obvious that all these Twitter people post specifically for people who don't have a good knowledge about crypto because most of these posts are just basics and hype.So what do you think? Will we finally see the fall of influencers or there still will be enough stupid people to follow their advice?",

There are many ignorant people, who are lazy and they simply don't want to start learning about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. You can call them however you want- normies, uneducated, lazy, sheep, etc. I don't divide them into different categories. They look all the same to me.I don't think that the crypto influencers will go away. Most of the people have the mentality of sheep. They want to follow a leader. They don't want to be their own leaders and put their shit together. The world will always be full of stupid and lazy people, that's why the crypto influencers/crypto scammers will never fade away.",

I don't think there's going to be a fall for influencers because when the market rallies to green, guaranteed that they're going to sprout out of nowhere preaching about the market and shill their tokens.",

Once you know what the influencers are doing and trying to manipulate you, you will avoid them at any cost. It is not so hard to learn once you see how they manipulate others. So what is really important to let people know first? The education on Bitcoin or the scams that those influencers are doing? I think from my POV, it should be exposing those influencers first. Because when people will have no one to lean on, they will start to learn on their own. That way, we kill the root of the problem and the solution will come out on its own.",

People from all backgrounds and levels of experience may follow the advice of crypto influencers, including those who are new to the cryptocurrency space and looking for guidance, as well as experienced investors and traders who may value the insights and analysis provided by these influencers.The stupid thing to do, as for me, is to follow them without a critical eye and doing your own research before making any investment decisions. The danger of crypto influencers is in the fact that they can be persuasive and appear confident in their analysis and recommendations, which can lead people to rely solely on their advice without conducting their own research and analysis. It's important to remember that crypto influencers are not financial advisors, and their recommendations should be considered as just one source of information.",

Do they think that being lazy will make them rich? Do they think that following the recommendations of these influencers will make them rich? Do they think that just throwing money into a project without any knowledge into it will make them rich. If only it's that easy to be rich, then we must all be rich by now.

Bitboycrypto in 2019, and Voskcoin in 2020. Overall, they are being paid to shill some new projects that's why I'm not following them anymore. TBH, I don't know anymore influencers who are advertising projects than these 2 especially Bitboy which is just a stupid sh*t who advertised a few projects in his channel, and now those projects are nowhere to be found now.It's just crazy that Bitboy has more than a million subscribers still while Voskcoin has 600k+ subscribers, and that shows that there are still people who are either getting entertained with their videos or following what project/s they're advertising on their channel. Well, I subscribed to Voskcoin back in 2020 not because of him focusing on mining (because I can't mine Bitcoin using mining rigs here), but because his Shiba Inu doggy \"Tails\" is very cute.",
