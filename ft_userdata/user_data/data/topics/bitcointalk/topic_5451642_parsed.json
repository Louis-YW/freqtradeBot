I'm surprised now that I have neutral feedback for having an argument with @bitbollo while I have a proper justification on my side. He is clearly bullying my account by using his rank and trust system.I'm not informed that talking with expressive words is worthy to have a neutral feedback. He is using my inactivity to justify his feedback for my argument with him.He is hypocrite for accusing me for using aggresive words while he starts this kind of conversation.Quote from: bitbollo on July 24, 2022, 10:08:22 AMQuote from: Xiestar on July 24, 2022, 12:42:01 AMNot positng doesn't mean I'm not updated.

      "body": "Well it is weird that you would wake up all of a sudden after 3 years of inactivity to make some suggestions regarding how a signature campaign should proceed in the future. If you don't have an alt account in the campaign, why would you care? And why would that topic be the reason you wake up and not something else that's been happening on Bitcointalk? If you do have an alt account in the signature campaign, why not post from it instead and share your ideas?Having said that, I neither agree with your opinion nor the feedback you posted. Merits collected in the Gambling board alone can't be a measure of someone's post quality. There are several reasons for that. The gambling boards are filled with spammers, and quality posts get mixed up in the mixture of spam and low-quality posting. Many merit sources never even go there and have the section on ignore, which means less merit rewards for those posting there. Because many gambling posters are spammers, they don't earn any merits themselves and have no sMerits to give to others. Therefore, someone's post quality shouldn't be evaluated based on the success rate in one of the worst sub-boards on the forum.Regarding the neutral feedback, it's not a negative rating. You were king of arrogant, and the offensive remark is surely because you called him a clown. Personally, I wouldn't have given it to you, but I share bitbollo's astonishment regarding why someone who has been away from the forum for so long has such an interest in how a signature campaign should work from a dummy account of his.",

I'd say grow your skin thicker or do we need to start a drama?  Also that neutral feedback is incorrect use of trust feedback. We can all have our own opinion. I do not see how Xiestar offended bitbollo, no trade between them, not that he posted spam. Or is he trolling? I do not see him trolling or doing anything wrong. The campaign, Blackjack is a gambling site campaign and what is bad in saying that? That people that have most merit in gambling section should be considered. It is all left to campaign manager to decide. I too see the idea not good, but that should not be the reason to give someone a neutral trust when not that the person cheat anyone nor being a spammer.",

I only emphasize his self interest towards his suggestion to manager at that time for choosing participants.This means a DT can give feedback like this whoever user that against his opinion?

It is clearly a case of neutral color feedback but negative in spirit. That's a common practice here, using neutral feedback but actually writing it in a negative tone, usually to avoid being called out by other DT members for the incorrect use of trust system.

I will if he will just continue the argument and not use the trust system to retaliate on what I said. He is DT and I'm not. Retaliating trust feedback is useless.~He is the one who started mocking on my opinion against his suggestion. He laugh at me while giving a comment on his suggestion. @Pmalek, Your opinion over my argument doesn't related on my concern. He started the mock on my comment instead of making an argument. How come I become the arrogant here for replying to his mock post.

Team said to me to minimise the campaign for a while. So I have to make the big changes in this campaign. So I have decided make this campaign for maximum 10 participants. Now please help me, how I should process this changes? Don't take any decision personally. You are all good to me. I will update the spreadsheet tomorrow and will remove some participants to short the campaign for 10 users. Hopefully campaign will be back to normal in near future. Thank you.Has the management already evaluated other solutions, likewise... reduce the amount paid per post or the total number of posts paid? generally speaking @OP this is a difficult choice to make because there are several factors to keep in mind.from my personal point of view... quality in the forum is \"measured\" by merits and it's the only \"valuable\" fact to be keep in mind.users who write quality posts are \"rewarded\" in this way and in general this type of evaluation is used to understand \"who spams\" or creates \"valuable contents\".I would use this criteria (example merit in the last 120 days/full history of merits) to understand who creates content of a certain level = more people read its contents = more visibility to the signature.... Only true if the merits that you get is from the gambling thread and not on other thread that is not related on gambling because this campaign is a Casino and you know how hard to get merit on gambling board.it was 3 years since you wrote a message on the forum! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=720626;sa=showPosts;start=0I think there are more interesting topics to discuss after 3 years of absence, since they do not concern you directly... don't you think? I know that is really hard produce quality content not only in the \"gambling\" section but in the whole forum!  Not positng doesn't mean I'm not updated. I'm an ETH holder since 2016. You can start counting all your merits from gambling board to disproves my opinion. Since you join on this campaign how much merit you get on gambling board?Quote from: Xiestar on July 25, 2022, 08:17:29 AMQuote from: bitbollo on July 24, 2022, 10:08:22 AMQuote from: Xiestar on July 24, 2022, 12:42:01 AMNot positng doesn't mean I'm not updated.
