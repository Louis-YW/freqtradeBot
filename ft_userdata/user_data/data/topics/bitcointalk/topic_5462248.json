However, It was recently disclosed that BlackRock and other major institutions had been secretly purchasing Bitcoin even before an ETF was available. While the SEC was busy accusing Binance and Coinbase, these banks were expanding their cryptocurrency exposure.",

Its not about that. microstrategy's operational activity and business profits is negligible compared to its exposure to the price movement of bitcoin, which makes microstrategy something like a bitcoin ETP, which was also pointed out by Sailor himself. And the fact that blackrock already bought microstrategy a year ago proves that the company already had a large exposure to bitcoin even before it officially began to admit it and I think thats what OP had in mind making this thread (@OP we shouldn't have been guessing that right?)",

If we listen to what Saylor says, they are not going to sell Bitcoin, and in any case if they need liquidity, they will borrow against it. According to the theory, an asset that does not stop appreciating, you can refinance it and spend the cash without selling and having to pay capital gains tax. This is how many billionaires do it. Another thing is to what extent we trust Saylor, but in this respect I would not be surprised if he would follow that plan, perhaps with some small exception such as selling a small amount as he already did for tax purposes:Bitcoin’s biggest buy-and-hold evangelist sells BTC for first time ever after spotting lucrative U.S. tax loophole",

Was Saylor testing thefuture implications and tax loopholes for future selling of Bitcoin? yea possibly but Ibelieve he fully backs what he preaches.And his strategy of borrowing FIAT against something as -solid- as Bitcoin seems like a sound move.Quote from: PIMPdev on August 06, 2023, 01:27:48 PMI didn't know that, but I'm not even surprised. Sometimes I think that Michael Saylor doesn't speak for himself and just says what he told to.I strongly doubt it, if you mean Blackrock are pulling his strings then IMO with 8%share in the company they are not and I would counter that they are 8%in on thecompany is because of the way MS talks!",
