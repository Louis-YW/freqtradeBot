The only caveat is that it can only be installed on desktop/laptop, plus the software is FOSS[1].

Easy solution is to use CoingGecko cand create account there, but there is also alternative apps and I suggest trying one app called crypTrax from bitcointalk member Escaflowne.crypTrax is open source app that works on all operating systems and you don't have to create any coingecko account: ANN topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5375431.0github: https://github.com/Escaflownevan/crypTraxOne more alternative option for desktop portfolio manager is open source app called Rotki:https://rotki.com/Do your own research before using and installing anything.",
