I honestly like what you said. I have also been using the term dirty and clean bitcoin without reasoning much about it. Could it be the name the government and exchanges gave to victimise people. After reading your post I understood that I may have bitcoin sent me from untrusted source, although the bitcoin was not used to commit crime but to ensure privacy I decide to mix the bitcoin. By this, that bitcoin in the address is called dirty or tainted as the case may be. I prefer using the term you used \"Breaking the trace\".",

They have to actively prove that you are the one that is using it and you can use plausible deniability to your advantage. Afterall, they cannot prove that you were the one using the service unless you were to send it directly to your exchange without any hops.",

As soon as a transaction has more than 1 input and 1 output, you cannot say which bitcoin ended up where - indeed, \"which\" bitcoin is a concept which doesn't actually exist. The very concept of taint is provably nonsense.

Use them instead, and stop worrying about whether some faceless third party thinks your coins are naughty.I think this is true for most situations.If you want to trade a 20usd for an Amazon card, you can certainly use a p2p solution, or some merchant or whatever...But for people who are heavily invested in bitcoin and want to trade high values, this is not feasible.Would you dare trade  1 or 2 btc in a p2p? This is very risky, and an exit scam is a real possibility. Additionally, people who live in developing countries mostly don't have an USD/EUR account, which narrow a lot p2p possibilities.On the other hand, trading 2, 3, or even 5 bitcoin is quite secure in the biggest centralized exchanges.Quote from: joniboini on August 23, 2023, 06:04:37 AMQuote from: bitmover on August 22, 2023, 04:56:25 PMWhat is more ironical about \"clean\" bitcoins, is that some exchanges consider bitcoins \"tainted\" after a recent mixing process.You can just make a few hops (transactions) to other addresses you have, to make that mixing undetected by exchanges.If I remember it correctly, somebody said their mixed coins were classified as tainted even though they already move them through some addresses.
