The scenario you promoted here is possible in a bull market but in a bear market when everything is dumping daily, you run for safety and try to keep your money as much as possible in USD. Before trade against Bitcoin used to be very dominant but after the 2018 bear run, most exchanges opened USDT trade pair to help reduce the bleed, especially among the Altcoins",

At the same time, if there's a chance to arbitrage with such pairs then I guess that there are traders that won't let it pass because as long as it can be done and doable, that's where it's being made.Do what makes you comfortable, if it's an altcoin and bitcoin pair and you're making money there, do it or if it's a dollar pair, choose your battle.",

This helps you make more money for less risk. There's still risk, and probably a lot of it depending on how the market moves. Sometimes they move upwards and downward together, other times they move in opposite directions.The other problem is that it's hard to analyze the market movements between the crypto pairs as compared to the general cryptos vs the USD. I have been there before.",

That time it was possible to find ‘value’ and made some profit out of it. Nowadays I just buy all coins with fiat money.",

We better not judge our ability first only with our instincts and if ever we fail at our earlier tries, we can continue trying again and again. I am sure that time will come will now be able to master it. The key is to not give up and lose hope easily.Volatile market in crypto is true. Can you see the ups and downs in the price? There is nothing wrong in implementing more than one or two strategies but they are in fact beneficial because we can switch on them when the market switches on the other side.",

And remember that bitcoin maximalists threaten all altcoins as shitcoins because they are \"bitcoin maximalist\"",

This helps you make more money for less risk. Learn more:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5JMtzGSaRIThe use of crypto to dollar orders only makes it easier for us to see the difference in prices. We can say this method with unidirectional trading. If we use crypto to crypto orders, it will look more difficult. For example XRP to BTC, BTC to XRP. On the XRP order to the Dollar chart it seems that it is experiencing an increase, but if we look at the BTC to XRP order it seems that the price is falling, this is because the BTC price is increasing. Honestly, I have a bit more difficulty using this method although it is more advantageous. Sometimes I make a three way chart, BTC to XRP to Dollar, then I know whether my order is in a profit or a loss position.",
