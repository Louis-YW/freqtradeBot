And yeah I will say that we are no longer in the bullish market, it was November last year when we have our all time high.But it doesn't mean that holding BTC is pointless, I mean this is the perfect time for accumulation. You should buy them because they are quite cheap at 70% and then hold. And then wait till the next bull run maybe in 2024-25 and see how far BTC goes and how much you are going to profit by investing right now.",

If the current price level will hold, if the drop to $17.5k was just a fluctuation and not a bearish trend, then it means that the old pattern largely holds, and the next bull market will bring new highs, likely over $100,000. So, buying BTC now and getting 400% profit in a few years is a pretty decent deal.",

You have to flash back from when cryptocurrency information come to air especially bitcoin. The value of bitcoin in the year 2017 and 2018 is not the same value of same this time. Once we are moving and Bitcoin get another way of increasing for it value. But right now the downfall of Bitcoin does not mean it has losed all the value in cryptocurrency Kingdom",

Personally I will start to accumulate more ETH than BTC in the futureThis means you have been in the market for 6 years. you are someone with enough experience with the market and you are starting to lose faith in bitcoin. If you've been accumulating bitcoins since 2016, I think you've made a profit, so if you don't believe bitcoins will explode in the future, you can sell them now and leave the market.It seems a bit strange to me to see you say that you lose faith in bitcoin but trust in eth. I myself still choose to keep btc over eth, what will happen to eth if btc doesn't grow?.",

Personally I will start to accumulate more ETH than BTC in the futureI would agree on that, but bitcoin also evolved its narrative right?I mean government are investing, institutional money is slowing. My point is that we are still very young and this numbers are not etch in stone. Sooner or later the pattern is going to break. And it just so happen that this is the first time that we have reach the previous all time high. Even having 9 successive weeks in red candle as well is a first this year.It's your call if you want to go with Ethereum rather than Bitcoin. Best of luck in your decision.",
