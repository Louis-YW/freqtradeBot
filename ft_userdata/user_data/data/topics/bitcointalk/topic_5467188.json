The preliminary protection for your devices and wallets is how you keep your devices air-gap or use them with good habits on Internet.If you say any wallet is not safe and think that those anti-virus, anti-malware softwares can detect and solve all malicious threats, you are wrong. They are not silver bullets to defend against all risky hacks and exploitation on your devices.",

One other thing, can you explain how can someone \"hack\" an offline/air gapped electrum? It seems interesting. The thread is exactly development and technical discussions of the wallet, which balance is publicated. Offline/air gapped electrum wallet is not possible to hack of course, but if the hacker is experienced and know the wallet balance - who knows. Hackers can work also in the groups, when they do not know how to solve some problem, for example, offline/air gapped electrum wallet hack.",

In the thread is completely different story from wallet, also hardware wallet and offline wallet security point.Airgapped wallet provides maximum security if done properly and can be used to safely store large amount of bitcoins as well as smaller amounts.If you want extra security, you can use a multi sig wallet with backups in different locations or use a regular airgapped wallet and back it up in multiple safe locations.An antivirus does not provide extra security as your wallet should typically not be online.",

Do you have any knowledge about what kind of protection is applied to the assets owned by the forum, and what exact AV/antimalware would be a logical step in protecting those assets? It is true that such programs can sometimes really save you in the form of stopping or quarantining a file that is judged to be malicious/risky, but even that is sometimes not enough for those who do not know what they are doing.In other words, you can't stop a skilled hacker from hacking any system that has online access, you can only make it harder for him if you have a good defense, and that would first of all include a properly installed firewall, and only then some of the top AV. I believe that the coins in question are secured in a fairly safe way, i.e. they are not in a hot wallet.",
