  "content": "So apparently there's this new exchange called Kollider built on top of the lightning network. I still haven't tried it yet myself, but thought I'd share it[1][2] (there's both pro and lite mode). The exchange is still in Alpha at the moment so use it at your own risk. The team is also building an LN wallet (web extension) with synthetic stablecoins[3].More can be found here[4][5].[1] https://pro.kollider.xyz/[2] https://lite.kollider.xyz/[3] https://kollider.xyz/wallet[4] https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/26/kollider-raises-24m-to-build-lightning-native-financial-products/[5] https://github.com/kolliderhq",

      "body": "I wrote about Kollider exchange last month in The Lightning Network FAQ topic, and I am following it since then.It looks like a promising project, especially since it has it's own version of fiat currencies USD/EUR that are backed only by Bitcoin, so there are no altcoins or stable coins involved.If we want to reduce risk and switch from centralized exchanges, we need projects like this and more popular decentralized exchanges.One thing I don't understand is how and why they have Ethereum(USD pair there.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on November 23, 2022, 06:08:32 PMHave you used them yet? I haven't seen your post until now. I made a topic about them earlier today after coming across them on Twitter.I didn't use Kolider yet, since it is still in beta phase.",

      "body": "So I just checked the project again and it looks like the wallet has been released to Chrome, Firefox, and Brave.They need to work on the UI/UX more but it's functional. You can deposit BTC on-chain, LN as well as their synthetic stablecoins which you can read more about here now that they have updated the site[1].I still haven't tried the exchange yet but it looks like they have around ~50K $ volume per day.[1] https://kollider.xyz/stablecoins",

Definitely not what you would expect from an open-source project but I guess this is what happens when you're backed by investors.Quote from: https://cdn.kollider.xyz/tos/kollider_terms_of_service.htmlResidents or citizens of some countries are restricted from using the Services or owning or using Digital Assets, including any residents of the United States of America and any residents in any of the countries listed on the U.S.A Office of Foreign Assets Control Sanctions List here: https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information.",
