But this period will favour buyers that have long term ambition to hold, there can be volatility within certain range, but all-time-high would not likely take more than 3 years from now.",

BTCBTCany facts why you think this or is it just a \"feeling\"I don't see it breaking out of the 20's this yearI think the attempts to liquidate large market players have somewhat failed for the time being.  I'm not sure if they're covering positions and preparing another attack, or if they're going to admit defeat and let Celsius live.  It does seem like they've adequately addressed their liquidity issues for the time being with the pumping of CEL coin.  That relieves the chance of a massive wick downward in the short term.  I'm sure there are some players who are already zombies in the space but haven't been forced into liquidating yet, so there's definitely some choppiness ahead.  I think $30K is starting to look more likely than $10K in the near term, but I'd keep an eye on the next shoe to drop.",

Not convinced most investors will sell again if they haven't already though, for me this is more like around the $40K distribution level, even $50K. It will be a shorting range for derivatives markets though, that much is true. Given it was long-term support for 18 months, it'll likely become resistance now.  I think it also depends how quickly price rebounds to this level however.",

We haven't seen this coming to go down below 20k. A lot thought that it will stop at $30k. But then, as this market is very volatile, you need to be ready whatever may happen to the market. And you should have the list of what to buy or sell in this period to maximize your profits. Or just hold some valuable alts and wait for the market to recover. In this situation, we have our own preferences on how to tackle this market.",

Traders will get into shorting and the users who made an entry around $20k will also go for a selling around this price point. There can be high volume selling which could further lower the price. If this gets resisted and moves forward. There is chances of reaching $35k. However the market being highly unpredictable makes way for a speculative move than real progress.",

Right, from $17,500 it's eithera) to down further to $15k rangeb} move past $20k and then go towards $30kAnd luckily for us, it went on the latter, 2 days of trading above $20k and then even trying to go break $22k but with some resistance. But the last week again will be critical, though, and just like the rest of the previous months last week, it seems there is a downward pattern. So let's see if this will continue as we might see < $20k before the end of the month again and then goes back up starting July and reach $30k.",
