  "content": "Web3 gambling project recently launched in August 2022nice2win.comThe project?nice2win is a gambling platform running on smart contracts that allows to bet ETH, MATIC or BNB (very soon BTC) on games like:Coin FlipRoll a DiceTwo DiceEtherollRouletteNo signup required so you can stay anonymous. All you need is a web3 wallet. House edge is 1%. Non-custodial gambling ensuring no KYC or frozen funds.Why play?For now, the $N2W token, which is not officially launched, is what generates the most hype for nice2win. You receive $N2W on every bet, whether you win or lose. The token will be spendable on the platform and will eventually be tradeable on DEXes like Uniswap for example.Otherwise, playing on nice2win guarantees a verifiable fair experience. In contrast to what is done on web2 platforms (99% of sites advertising on this forum), it is impossible for nice2win to cheat its users or alter results because the backend part of the platform is visible to the world. Moreover, centralized casinos have the potential to rig the odds (you are bluepilled if you don’t think this happens already, no matter how reputable a casino is). Players are entering bets with probabilities of winning that are lower than publicly displayed; this is reality.Gambling is actually one of the best use case for Dapps (web3 apps) because all the algorithms behind your favorite games are verifiableLastly, avoid custodial gambling platforms like the plague (see the FTX debacle) — NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINSOur specs?nice2win is deployed on the following blockchain networks:PolygonBinance Smart ChainOptimismArbitrumWith the help of smart contracts, we redefine the meaning of the expression provably fair commonly used in the community, with the following attributes:All bets are processed by hundreds of validators instead of one centralized database like the ones used on all popular web2 casinosVerify in real-time the code logic that processes your bet very unlike trusting a traditional black box casinoHave access to all-time history results for all bets ever processed by nice2win on; do not rely on the good faith of the \"house\" to store your precious data and coinsThe site is now available on mobile, tablet and computer. Currently working on the Stacks solution — they enable smart contracts for Bitcoin!The proofs?Medium : https://medium.com/@nice2winDune Analytics (for Optimism): https://dune.com/nice2win/nice2win-web3-casinoTwitter : https://twitter.com/nice2winDappDiscord : https://discord.gg/GwuDax5RRWGithub: https://github.com/nice2win",

      "body": "This thread gives me a little Dejavu, I think I have seen it before?. Perhaps it was a similar Web3 decentralized casino...Anyways, It looks interesting and I like the fact you included the BNB network and also the repository on Github.However I have a couple of questions:Since the native token of this web3 casino will be airdropped to users regardless they win or lose, it would not undermine the intentions of some people who would like to buy it?Will it be an inflationary or deflationary token?What other utilities this token will have? Will the management of this casino provide the initial liquidity for the pair N2W/ETH or N2W/USDC on Uniswap themselves, so people can swap it?",

      "body": "@Hispo I'll be happy to answer your questions and thanks for the interest!1. Market is going to do what the market wants to do after the token is tradeable so the price movement should only matter to speculators trying to make a quick buck. The $N2W token will always carry the same value on nice2win as for the \"betting power\" on our games. The market (and the price) will adjust towards what profit value we standardize for bets made with $N2W.2. It will definitely be an inflationary token.3. We will write more Medium post about the token when closer to the official ERC-20 launch. For now, players can accumulate slowly when playing our games without compromising the gains they are after.4. The management will definitely add the initial liquidity for the pair that makes most sense when we launch, could be either N2W/ETH or N2W/USDC or other stablecoins.",

This is what I was thinking. Some of us gamble with bitcoin and don't care about anything else. Bitcoin I can deposit from my HW wallet to the site and withdraw to it. Quote from: AmoreJaz on November 20, 2022, 11:03:50 PMmany gamblers do like nonkyc casinos. so more then likely, you will catch those users to try your site. Yes, especially as the supply of non-kyc casinos has been shrinking over the last few years, and although there are still a few left (quite a few if your betting limits are low), it's always nice when a new one comes along. Quote from: AmoreJaz on November 20, 2022, 11:03:50 PMalso, the additional feature of earning your token, win or lose is a good incentive. Well, if it's something I'm going to get for 'free', fine, but I don't really care about tokens.",

If you are looking for feedback and ideas, you should check that thread out.Also, this initial liquidity you will provide to the Defi pairs will be permanent of will be withdrawn once users themselves manage to provide most of the liquidity in the future?",

      "body": "@Hispo. Really seems Stake.com is working hard to get our thread out of the main Gambling thread... You will find new reasons every time to get our thread moved? It's now the second time. It is clear I am hyping the casino first, and not the token. Very clear.Thanks for the all questions! I'll answer them all.@AmoreJaz1. We're going to add a major BTC smart contract solution called Stacks. This will require a different wallet because it's on a blockchain of it's own. Totally not like WBTC where you warp BTC. It is actual Bitcoins that you use.2. Thank you for the kind words. The utility token is mainly to add an extra incentive. Users don't have to get invested in it like you said. Totally up to you!@Don Pedro Dinero1. Like I said above, it's not WBTC. We are working on a solution called Stacks which uses real BTC.2. That's what web3 is about. No KYC and an anonymous presence is encouraged.3. The token is an extra for recurring players so you don't have to worry about it.@Hispo1. We are not promoting the token first, as you very well can see; we are promoting the Casino. The token is an extra incentive for recurring users and will hold a value for the users to win real crypto from it. The price will be decided by the market, of course, but the market will price in the real crypto value winnable from it...2. Liquidity will be locked for 1 year or 2 years. To reassert on the subject, the project is not about the token: it is about a web3 casino earning fees (1% house edge) from bets and hoping to slowly grind it out with exciting games and gaining new users that want out of the traditional web2 model. That's it.Please, can you move this thread back to the Gambling section. I can remove all the content about the token if you desire. The project is about the casino, the token is secondary. Also, can you reply? I know you did not reply on the last post that you moved on a dead thread section.",

The reason why we want the post in the original thread is because we are not trying to sell our token. Although, we appreciate the interest in the token, it is meant to be secondary to the project that is a web3 casino, more like a loyalty program.Definitely will address the issue for the next time I post.",
