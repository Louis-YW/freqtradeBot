  "content": "https://www.github.com/nkaz001/hftbacktestI know that numerous backtesting tools exist. But most of them do not offer comprehensive tick-by-tick backtesting, taking latencies and order queue positions into account.Consequently, I developed a new backtesting tool that concentrates on thorough tick-by-tick backtesting while incorporating latencies, order queue positions, and complete order book reconstruction.Key features:- Working in Numba JIT function.- Complete tick-by-tick simulation with a variable time interval.- Full order book reconstruction based on L2 feeds(Market-By-Price).- Backtest accounting for both feed and order latency, using provided models or your own custom model.- Order fill simulation that takes into account the order queue position, using provided models or your own custom model.Full document: https://hftbacktest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Example: https://github.com/nkaz001/hftbacktest/tree/master/examplesAdditional features are planned for implementation, including multi-asset backtesting and Level 3 order book functionality.",
