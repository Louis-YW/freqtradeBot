As long as institutions in the country are dependent on the internet or web to transact and carry on with daily trades and commerce, cryptocurrencies would remain a feature that would  keep getting audience and users. No matter how the government tries to ban or limit the use of cryptocurrencies, the main option should be to stop the internet from functioning. I bet this can't happen, as the disaster bound to happen would be tremendous.",

There's no how you can made mention of cryptocurrency any where without first considering bitcoin in anything, not because it's the first cry in the world but because it's the only most acceptable and reliable digital currency in cryptocurrency that has maintained it value over 14 years ago, other cryptocurrencies are pirate copy of the first digital currency bitcoin.Quote from: Truthlovecoins on May 17, 2023, 09:48:38 PMAs long as institutions in the country are dependent on the internet or web to transact and carry on with daily trades and commerce, cryptocurrencies would remain a feature that would  keep getting audience and users.

Government cannot stop bitcoin, if not they would have done that along the ago, they have although make every necessary moves to achieve that but all avail not because bitcoin has maintained it standard and also meet the target required needs of the people.",
