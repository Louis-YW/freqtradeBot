      "body": "Hi, thanks for asking. So far, there is no utility for the token other than exploring the possibilities of distributing 21 million in a blockchain with low trading fees and how people gets involved and decide how the project should move forward.I want the community of holders to make these decisions (we have voted on the decisions made so far). I thought a guy I worked with before was going to help me in giving the token some utility, but he stepped down (he wanted to raise capital and then use that capital to invest, giving the profits of those investments to token holders).So far, most of the community is interested in seeing the token increase in value (which I understand), but nobody really wants to get involved in the core idea of airdropping the token to real people. I have 60k additional requests, but only 800 are allegedly real people.",

But none of them would be percectly working proof of personhood, which i am assuming you are after. Not without kyc:ing everyone at least.But what do you mean by $1 worth? Why it would have value during the airdrop? Or are you already giving it a marketcap estimation? If so what's the point of that? I don't see a point for the whole token but i am guessing you are asking how to do this in theory.",

Even IP detection wouldn't work since that's easy to manipulate as well as other methods like email registration and whatnot. You can add additional requirements though, e.g. having a discord channel where you have a bot that verifies if they received something or not but again, this only elongates the process, not necessarily stopping bots from appearing. There has been quite a few implementations of captcha from matching images, to typing the same letters/words to puzzles so maybe implement that and some additional requirements just to make it harder for bots to enter.",

I don't understand, there's no cost at all but the effort that you're going to airdrop that coin. Anyway, this is named after BTC, I'm not expecting a lot from it even if you successfully airdropped and distribute it to many people.Quote from: Castor(Beaver) on November 30, 2023, 09:14:19 PMThe purpose of this thread is to get some ideas on how to efficiently Airdrop the token, without using bots basicallyIf this is the purpose, good luck.",

If it was on an EVM chain with smart contract functionality, I'd suggest using the \"pull over push\" principle where you just provide a mechanism for users to claim the tokens rather than directly trying to push it to users. This way, the cost (gas/tx fee) is pushed over to the user.That's the best approach I've seen across the board. If you go ahead with something else and as long as it gets the job done, do share.",

      "body": "First and foremost, the blockchain which this token is built should have been shared. It will help people who are suggesting know which approach is better and which isn’t. My own opinion is that you still use your website but send out the airdrop in batches. So, if you have a form on the site where people ask for their share, then you collect information of each and everyone. Maybe when you get up to a hundred thousand (or more), you distribute that batch. Or maybe someone else have suggested some other possible solution, but batches is what comes to my mind; I think it’s the easiest and most possible way.",
