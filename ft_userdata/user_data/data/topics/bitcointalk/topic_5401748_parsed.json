  "content": "Hello everyone, let's discuss now the positive and negative of Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency.  I'd like to show you something in which I saw it at one of the youtube influencer sharing about the advantage and disadvantage of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency, then after that I will give my personal view or assessment unto it. The advantages of Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency1. It made possible to send and get money anywhere at anytime.2. It made people free from the worry of rescheduling for bank holidays, or any other limitations.3. In Bitcoin you are the only owner of your money, there is no higher authority.4.

During the transaction of money there is no need to give full and personal information own identity is hidden. 7. It keep us save from the illegal corruption and theft.8. In comparison to banking channel bitcoin transaction is quit fast.The Disadvantages of Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency1.

Its value has no approved by any central bank, it is not trust worthy.Source link: https://youtu.be/tCCK-8K1uoANow I'd like to add some assessment of mine to make it simple to understand about this thing. based on my personal opinion such as follows:ADVANTAGES OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY/BITCOIN- Blockchain Technology, Users' transactions are protected against identity theft. There is also other called element  online privacy where you really don't know whom the money sent came from or other term is anonymous though its shady sometimes.- It is more Confidential in a sense that your the only one knows the password, at the same time there is a security features  before you get your transactions withdrawal, they will notify you first something like that.- Cryptocurrency or Bitcoin has 24hrs of accessibility, in short term easy to access and we are the one in control.   Anytime you can use it as payment worldwide. where you can deliver it anytime, anywhereDISADVANTAGES OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY/BITCOIN- It's not easy to understand or in a simple term it can be difficult to comprehend. Even though there is a lot of information on the internet but   there is still a lack of understanding. Aside from the lack of understanding of cryptocurrency, it can also be challenging to use the unfamiliar   technology. So it is important to listen first and get the right information first before being trusted when it comes to financial and investment.- Market Fluctuation, this can be a very challenges to all traders here in this industry. Crypto is not only a currency, not only considered as   money but also a form of investment. Because it can rise and fall the price value, that's why since this cryptocurrency hasn't really been   around for a long time, we can still say that it's not stable yet, it's really prone to fluctuation, as if you can earn a lot, you can even go   bankrupt.- Cryptocurrency has no Security in case the coins will be loss. indefinitely, just in case you lost it digitally Like the example of hacking your   computer, they saw your password, and they saw your profile, and they saw your authentication and they used it, for sure it's gone. It is not   liable where you buy and if you lose money.NOTE: I hope that what we are talking about that I have shared with you as a source link and my additional opinion will help others who do not have that extensive knowledge of cryptocurrency, although I am still just studying this matter. And if you have anything to add besides this, everyone is free to share here on this topic that we are talking about.",

The Bitcoin value remain changing according to the demand, then it create confusion at the time of refund.Though there is huge opportunity from the blockchain technology, it is also important to be aware of not just the benefits, but also the risks. With that in mind, here are some of the things you need to consider before making a decision on whether or not to invest in this currency-based platform.Maybe in this moment Bitcoin is the most modern idea of currency which few merchants are accepting.  I must say Bitcoin has good properties from both sides, which are good for business providing and good for general user. Those who have already experienced mainstream services will find it a little bit hard to adapt in the beginning but as a business trading this is a better option as you can save your money and at the same time does not require any transaction fee, moreover the changes happen in real time. I would suggest you to use them if you have a plan to start new business or deal with Bitcoins effectively.",

      "body": "I love comparing it with democracy. Both for its advantage and disadvantages. In a sense it's financial democracy for the people. In true sense people decide the value of assets and money. The valuation is not in control of any centralized body. It's the money for the globe defying national boundaries. And just as democracy, it's not perfect and not perfectly decentralized. One who have the larger holding are more influencing and determining on the matter of value and future.",

He has put before everyone who comes across his content and is interested in crypto the choice to either continue to want to learn about crypto or not after they analyse the advantages and disadvantages to see if it favours them. People who have a good idea of what they are getting into tend to do better and can handle issues/situations more confidently that those who just followed the crowd.",
