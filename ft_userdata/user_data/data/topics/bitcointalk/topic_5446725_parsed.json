It's scam.Quote from: ryzaadit on March 29, 2023, 02:58:19 AMHi everyone!I just want to give you an update, possibly this discord hiring is a scam one-two days before my discord account was hacked. I was in touch and in contact with the @OP, but after that, my account discord got hacked.During the hack, @OP deleted the all-conversation and kicked me out of the discord group he was for the hiring. My last activity for connecting any link is with him, probably the bot verified mee6 group was fake.@OP looking someone who are working in discord mod. My suggestion, don't apply or click any link from @OPBe careful with newbie accounts want to hire you. Be more careful with woke-up newbie want to hire you.",

Isn't it possible that someone else hacked his account? Contacting with saruc before he got hacked maybe a coincidence.Quote from: UchihaSarada on March 29, 2023, 03:46:40 AMBe careful with newbie accounts want to hire you. Be more careful with woke-up newbie want to hire you.Everyone joins here with a brand new rank. Some joins for business. They don't need the rank. This is a weird logic.",

      "body": "Looking at the quote he's saying possibly and probably which mean he's not even sure if saruc was a hacker or not, that's still an assumptions. It's his fault to click random link, but there's no way to verify it.The @OP account have been painted by him, even though I don't think the negative feedback is correctly used because there's no solid proof about losing money.Anyway why this thread posted in Meta? move to scam accusations/reputation.",

Be more careful with woke-up newbie want to hire you.Users with high ranks on the forum can also scam you, there have been cases previously were users with a high rank either defaulted on a loan, or used donated funds for private purposes, etc, so basically don't trust (irrespective of ranks), but verify.Business brands who launch signature campaigns on the forum start with brand new accounts, then they hire signature campaign managers that launch their campaigns, whilst they mostly write the Ann thread themselves. There's nothing wrong if a newbie account wants to hire you, just don't trust by clicking random links, or throwing away your privacy, just be open and professional about it all; and if they are scammers, it wouldn't take you long to notice.",

At least that way it shows you likely are the original owner of the account.The scam accusation thread is inconclusive IMO as ryzaadit cannot prove saruc was the hacker, but it does seem likely it could be the case.",
