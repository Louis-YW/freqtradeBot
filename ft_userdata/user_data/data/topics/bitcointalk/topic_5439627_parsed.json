This radical new pen featured a compact plunger-operated pump filler that nestled at the back end of the barrel, eliminating the space-hungry pressure bar and sac. The Golden Arrow was later renamed as Vacumatic. The Vacumatic went on the market in 1933; and discontinued in 1939, due to the introduction of new Aero-metric filler.Parker pens were frequently selected to sign important documents such as the World War II armistices, and commemorative editions were sometimes offered.You can also view our item on Trumblr.Please visit other Parker 61 fountain pen in our collection.https://pastpens.com/shop/vintage-parker-61-new-old-stock-fountain-pen/",
