I like it that way and it really proves the importance of trust score in the forum. The trust system was created with the objective to mark users who have completed trades and thus can be \"considered\" trustworthy of another trade. Eventually this became a method to mark scammers too, because the same boon and be a bane for those who are not trustworthy. Hence Marketplace, Trading Discussion and its child boards are where you will be shown Trust scores by default on the Global forum. Those are the ones pertaining to use of \"trust\" mechanic.Extrapolated, it started incorporating other types of fraud, like campaign cheaters.",

I have seen it in \"mining board\", \"altcoin boards\" that aren't related to trading at all. And, I really agree that trust score was basically introduced to help protect the members of the forum from the scammers. I agree with your points but still the members who left those type of feedback are doing good for the forum. A person who contributes good information on forum will always get appreciation from the other members of the forum in the form of a positive feedback. The ones who buy accounts are mostly frauds and that's why members leave feedback like that to warn the users to be careful from such users.",

      "body": "Given the nature of the trust system, it's easy to get your profile painted in red for something that has nothing to do with you being untrustworthy, initially, and supposedly the trust score shouldn't be there to begin with, it is supposed to be that whenever you want to trade with someone, you visit their profile and check the feedback one by one to see if they make any substantial evidence that this user is not to be trusted or vice versa because it's possible that you refrain from dealing with someone who has 2 negative feedback just because of some nonsense.For the most part, the trust system is \"okay\"-- it gives you a general idea about the persona behind the profile, but it's indeed not enough to judge the trustworthiness of said persona, having that displayed in all sections causes more harm than good, as a reasonable person you would want to hear about a security leak found in your wallet from anyone regardless of their profile status, now imagine someone with a few negative feedback in the technical discussion writing a comment of that nature, you will likely automatically discard that comment and move on to the next comment written by someone with 5 positive feedback telling you not to listen to the person above.Quote from: digaran on October 06, 2023, 12:14:19 AMI wonder, do people trade in all of the mining boards to have trust system enabled there? In most boards some level of \"trade\" happens, people offer repair services, a new mining pool, a new firmware, etc., so it does make some sense to have the trust displayed there, but when you have a discussion about increasing BTC block size in the Bitcoin Discussion Board, you are unlikely to have any sort of trades with the users there.",
