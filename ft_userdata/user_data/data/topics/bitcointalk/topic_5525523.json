That is why we must be careful when we want to send our coins and makes sure that we are in the safe way. If we report to the police, they will ask many things to us and makes us confuse what we should answer because some polices can use the advantage to get the money from us.We must learn from our mistake so that will not happen more in the future.

Speaking of information, I know this post is all about the service you are shilling and not all Bitcoin can be recovered. If a scammer uses a mixer to cleanse the stolen Bitcoin, it cannot be recovered back. So, reaching out to you for help means the victim will be wasting his time and resources. Also, your service may be a scam and in an attempt to recover a stolen fund, a victim could be scammed twice.",

Lol!Anyways... In addition to what you have earlier said, Bitcoin transactions is literally transparent in the public ledger Blockchain which means it transactions can be traceable but does not mean users are easily to be realistically captioned because wallets I'D's are  pseudonymous such that the name implied on the wallet might just be junks and unrealistic to identify one of scammers just by that.As suggested, governments (authorities/security agents) are only option to help recover your lost Bitcoin while the chances are very low and when the transaction is executed on a non custodial wallets that are not centralized on regulations. While you may have that little chances if it is a regulating wallets where KYCs may be required. Then the agent can get trace of the scammer.Then, the victim to the scam must make sure Bitcoin is not tagged an illegal financial technology esle you as complainant is equally getting yourself into trouble.",

Security measures and knowledge are very much needed when people are here so that they can distinguish between fraud because most people are deceived because they do not understand the fraud patterns carried out by people.If it is said that it can be easier when our assets are stolen, then what if the person who deceived us is in another country. Do we have to spend a lot of money to find them? and how certain about the potential for success and I think it is complicated and will cost even more money.",

I think the concept of the difficulty to recover lost bitcoins is due to it decentralizations which means you are in control of your funds and when it gets off from you you either not stress on getting it back as it then belongs to the other users. This should not incite fear to be used but if do then should ask how much we even trust the central banks because they records more of scamming process than the bitcoin blockchain. Just know that there is no source of funds that is scam free. Hold your bitcoin carefully and enjoy it services of decentralizations.",

It's not as easy as OP have stated in this thread that is why it is always better to avoid being a victim of a scam. Most people who lost cryptocurrencies from these criminal activities never retrieved them. Some of them that were lucky worked with law enforcement agents and exchanges. I am also careful of these recovery service providers because many of them are scams. They will collect service charges from victims and end up not offering any assistance. In some cases, they collect important private information from the victims and use it to scam or blackmail these customers.",
