  "content": "Hi all,Would it be possible to please advise if the  \"mkey\" and \"names\" data in the pywallet key dump file are linked to each other?  As in, is this the master key for all addresses listed under \"names\"?\"mkey\": {        \"encrypted_key\": \"F******************\"8,         \"nDerivationIterations\": 1***6,         \"nDerivationMethod\": 0,         \"nID\": 1,         \"otherParams\": \"\",         \"salt\": \"5*********2\"    },     \"names\": {        \"1*****************w\": \"\",         \"1*****************h\": \"\",  The reason I ask is that I have a bunch of addresses showing under \"names\".  Most of the addresses also appear in the key dump file with their \"sec\" and \"secret\" keys listed however there is a couple of addresses that only appear in \"names\" section - Can I get the private keys for these using the mkey encrypted key and if so, how would I do this?Thank you!",

Every encrypted private key is encrypted using the mkey, after it is has been decrypted with the passphrase.Quote from: NotATether on August 13, 2022, 06:27:37 AMAs for \"name\", maybe those are addresses that Core knows about - perhaps they include addresses you've sent Bitcoins to.name is the label applied to an address. It is for both receiving and sending addresses. Every new address requested from the wallet will have a name record and the label for that address, often just an empty string.  Addresses that you have sent to that you have also labeled will also have name records.",

Though given the pywallet output, I doubt that coins were ever stored in either of them.",
