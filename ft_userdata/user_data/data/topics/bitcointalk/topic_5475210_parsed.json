I always come across different question from people and most of this questions has been brought to the forum repeatedly, and also has been answered, when I start giving them answers to there questions it seems I know much, not knowing that we spend most of our time here and we learn different things. Be it bitcoin, politics, economy, society and other things. So I see bitcoin forum as a life transforming forum.What about you?",

There is no point in rushing and the best thing is to let time work, these lessons Bitcoin brought to my life. The Bitcoin Talk forum is the best place to be in the middle of this sea of garbage that exists on conventional social networks.",

      "body": "that’s what’s good in this forum, isn’t it?we are one community as we learn things, we also get to teach the new ones and maybe someday they can even teach us things we also don’t understand this forum does not only focuses on bitcoin which allows participants to learn about a lot of things like politics or economics for example i think this is a great platform where like-minded people can come together and share their insights or correct each other’s misaligned conceptions this forum has definitely helped me understand cryptocurrency and bitcoin specifically even better i had a general idea of what bitcoin was before but after reading through and interacting with various threads here i’ve come to appreciate how truly complex and amazing bitcoin’s system is outside the general purpose of making profit",
