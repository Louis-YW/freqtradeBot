And is other site ok with this if their competitor handle the funds or security for them? I applaud Binance and CZ for this initiative, but there’s a lot of questions to be answered first and its up to the investors if they will support this or not.",

I think it's a good thing to support those struggling companies but really has the potential. What it's like is an insurance like they'll be distributed with money for their recovery and then if they go back in shape.They'll be the next one to contribute for those projects that might have been seen struggling. If I understand this, CZ is trying to weigh and balance thing from the perspective of these exchanges and huge companies. But all I think is that he's trying to make an organization for which he'll be the leader of them all.",

It is a good time for Binance and CZ to show their power which increases their power and domination in cryptocurrency exchange market. From Binance's core approach that prioritizes safety, they will not take too much risk. Especially the lesson from Sam and FTX is just very hot right now.QuoteIt seems like that binance wanna try to make a comeback to the market but its seems like that there are so many crypto fans who enthusiast with it. At least CZ has been revealing the truth of centralized exchange site and so this gives more exposure to the decentralized ecosystem in the market. Decentralized exchanges can take advantage of the FTX collapse and a fud wave against centralized exchanges to bounce strongly in this bear market. However I would like to remind that most of decentralized exchanges we have now, are not actually decentralized. If their owners, founders, core team members are known, they are not decentralized. Their services can be shut down anytime by governments if they want to do it seriously.",

It might also take a few years for it to happen even, not to mention it might be again, centralized, so if say CZ handles the money and does an FTX move on it then a LOT of money would disappear.Which leads us again to issues of trust, really, people would just be better off using non-custodial wallets instead of having to think of all these issues.",

Maybe CZ is trying to safe retail investors like us because sooner or later taxi drivers, clerk workers etc that invest in crypto will all be affected.If CZ is sticking his neck out for this again then there is a bigger damage we don't know of yet, it might affect Binance too.Do not forget that this is the same man that tried to safe FTX until he saw what FTX have done in the back, this is a man that reveals that some exchanges are sending customers' funds to other exchanges. I trust this man because he is trying to safe us all.",

Latter; CZ really wants to support in good faith. Both of these can be true at the same time. We will see this later. My personal opinion is; What happened to FTX could happen to any exchange. I am against any boss in crypto. I am in favor of being supported by governments. This support must also remain within certain limits.",
