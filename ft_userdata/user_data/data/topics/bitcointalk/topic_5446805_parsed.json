      "body": "What about if you say early profit is an advantage   haha. Anyway I think it is an advantage for an old trader to start making profit almost as soon as he or she enters an order because he can guide the profit better by watching the outcome of the market and to safeguard the profit by adjusting stop loss to entering point and by that he has being in a 50/50 chance of winning maximally in the trade, at least he can readjust entering point to taking some percentage of profit while the trade is still on. As for the newbie, IMO I still think the early profit is good. Profit gives confidence and if a newbie starts seeing the green in the account, he can give a thumbs up to himself. However a newbie should have a journal or jotter to analyze what he is doing right or wrong so that when making mistakes and resulting to losses then he can refer to the past when profit was made through the journal. Nothing is wrong with early profit for me all that is needed is passion to go through the losing times because as for trading, it is profit and loss business depending on the one you have more.",

Because a trader lose, make some amendment, that does not mean he is perfect to profit than lose, he can continue to losemand he may not get it right.A trader can get it right from the start, but the possibility of getting it right from the start is low. But a trader can possibly be making profit than losing from the start. I understood you, I have seen people like that before, they did not learn trading, they were just using trading to gamble, they make money and thought they can continue to make money, but instead, they suffered losses and later concluded that trading is gambling. Although trading and gambling are different but they do not want to learn.",

      "body": "You make a valid point, OP, but if you think about it again, you'll see that profiting from the start can be a boost and encouragement for a newbie to stay and try more. Too many losses without any profit can cause a trader to abandon their trading and settle for their own peace of mind. If one is not well prepared before beginning to trade, the losses that come with it can lead to a mental breakdown. Both point works well, it is either they’re not too exposed to profit or maybe they get to make little profit to make them stay along the journey of trading.",

There are always unintended surprises from bitcoin or altcoin trading. The volatility and unwanted prices at any given time make it very hard to learn the true colors of the crypto trading pattern. We can not have printed charts and theories in the crypto trading chart view because it is just so unpredictable at any given time. You can pass the test once or twice but not always when it comes to bitcoin trading for example. So yes, when it comes to newbies or even experienced traders, the learning phase should not be stopped at all.",

There are always inevitable failures not just tor crypto beginners, but even for those professional traders in the market. And the more we are exposed to losses, the more we are motivated to learn and move forward. However, the good thing about this is we become stronger and more confident to trade, knowing we had learned a lot from our mistakes and that help us as better traders eventually. So never be afraid to lose, as trading has reserved a lot of losses for beginners. Instead, move forward and learn from them as experiencing losses at first is better than to be exposed with quick profits as that will develop a wrong mindset that trading is all about profits, when definitely its not.",

What do you think, let us discuss?Most newbies that joined cryptocurrency during the bull always end up quitting trading during the bear market, most of them are use to the profit they were making during the bull run, some of them end up quiting their jobs because of the money they were making during the bull run. During the bull run, everyone is always making money, just buy coin and hold, within a short period of time, you will be in profit, but when trading during the bear market, the more you keep on buying, the more the coin keeps on dumping, not all newbies always survive the bear market. When you are trading as a beginner, money shouldn't be the primary aim, because when you focus on money alone you, you might not get things right.",

I can say this because this is what I experienced before.For sure these newbies are also driven by other people that can they see on the internet, which only show profits or winning trades to other people, which is really misleading.Overall, I can say long-term and consistent is better than early profits.

Even my understanding of cryptocurrency trading is not more than 70% because the science of cryptocurrency trading is very complex and has many strategies that can be adjusted. Detailed things such as checking white papers, open source code, and some detailed knowledge about the network is already included in the Research Section, by doing detailed research we will know whether the project is worth investing in or not.
