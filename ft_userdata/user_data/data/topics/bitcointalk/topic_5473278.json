      "body": "You got it backwards though, first of all tell us what exactly is an offline blockchain? And how do you suppose we should have a currency in an offline blockchain, don't bother because \"offline\" blockchain (currency) has been around ever since of invention of banks. You could claim it's interesting to see decentralized offline banks, but that can't happen due to the nature of DDL, or decentralized distributed ledgers. Maybe I am the one getting all this wrong, right?Thanks to cryptography, generals have no problem anymore.ðŸ˜‰",

      "body": "I'm not entirely sure you know what the Byzantine Generals problem is.For starters it is a condition particularly defined in decentralized systems and for \"distributed computing\" which means if you centralize the system the Byzantine fault no longer applies to the system!It is about reaching consensus between the \"peers\" that are all at the same level. Bitcoin has successfully solved that problem with its Proof of Work algorithm (not just the \"blockchain\").So I'm not really sure what the points you included in your post (wars, natural disasters, internet cut off, etc.) have anything to do with Byzantine fault. Any catastrophe is a special situation and your centralized bank (even with the centralized \"offline\" blockchain) is still susceptible to these disasters. For example flood can hit the centralized servers where this centralized blockchain is stored wiping out all the money anybody stored there!Not to mention that as @digaran pointed out centralized ledgers (without being called blockchain) existed forever!",

It's not byzantine generals' problem, but rather problem about communication infrastructure. And node which was offline or disconnected from rest of Bitcoin network can verify block/TX created which created when the node went offline.Quote from: Bialke on November 08, 2023, 01:10:20 AMIt is very interesting to see, that a lot of blockchain developers are working on offline blockchain solutions! If offline blockchain only means lack of internet, theoretically you could use different medium to broadcast transaction or communicate with other node. An example would be Blockstream Satellite.",

Back when I was a kid in the 60's there was a project called \"Radio free Europe\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty. It is still around look above. I would think that EFTbitcoin's idea of using a satellite for internet or blockstream could fall into this idea somewhat.So the restrictive places in the world would still have some access to BTC and other coins.",
