  "content": "this seems to be a new scam making the rounds on Twitter. I posted a link to a photo, I'm not sure if that will work. here's the gist:an obvious scam account, in broken English reaches out with the following:Hi!  i'm a student  I received a sum of 686USDT(trx20) but I don't know how to sell USDT to get USD into my bank account. . Can you teach me how to use my Trust wallet? I will pay 200USDT as a reward!                                                                                                         this is my wallet key: rate drip find gossip senior diet hungry mirror early absorb despair visit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      address encoding: 11d1fde9b1f191efcef4e473fbd52ef3ed9e9201c8b1786fa5861031f6909606https://photos.app.goo.gl/UywkhompYhL45Lsg9here's what I don't understand: in the early days of the internet, when checks moved money, the \"overpayment scam\", was very popular. obviously, this has all the hallmarks of an \"overpayment scam\", but I am under the impression that there is a certain finality that is built into Bitcoin, or even the shit coins that these scammers try to deal in. one of my favorite characteristics of Bitcoin is its immutability, but it seems as though, without a chargeback, this scam would not be profitable. the only other possible attack vector that I can think of, is if somehow interacting with this wallet would open the mark up to privacy concerns.I have only noticed this phenomena taking place over the last 2 weeks or so.I can offer merit to anyone who knows what they are talking about! thank you for your time!",

Don't let the greed of reaping where you did not sow make you lose the little you have.Scammers are everywhere so it is not surprising they are trying to get some victims on Twitter as well, and about the scam it is not really that new but it is important to remind people about it so they keep their eyes open and do no fall in it and lose their money because of it.So it is important to use your common sense, because even if you have never encountered that scam before you will not lose anything as you will not send tron to steal the balance, and you will not loan any tron either with the hope you will be repaid by the scammer as we know loaning any cryptocurrency without any collateral is incredibly risky.",

Scammers are also getting smarter, they never get tired of looking for someone to become a victim and fall into their evil plan.As even though we keep spreading news and information about this but somehow, many people still got to fall into their hands. It looks like social media now is the common medium used for scammers as they can just hide their identity. That is why I suggest not to trust strangers so easily especially when it talks about money as that can lead to scam.",

Haven't you heard about Twitter hacking of prominent individuals and being used to scam crypto?  Former President Barack Obama's Twitter account appears to have been hacked as part of a cryptocurrency scam. The scam here is pretty obvious, you need to send funds to be able to withdraw that alleged 686USDT. So once you send some TRX or USDT to be able to withdraw it, that money will be withdraw immediately because the scammers is running a bot that monitor that address. So the moment you deposit on it, it will be gone in a blink of an eye and transfer to a address that the scammers control.",

Well without using a block explorer I am going to assume that the address has only USDT and no TRX correct?Hence to send the USDT you need some TRX for the transaction fee. So you send some TRX and as soon as it’s confirmed they send all the TRX with the USDT to another account and you are scammed.Very popular on ETH network however seems new on TRX.",

Nowadays scammers always looking and finding ways just to scam, they have different techniques and strategies just to scam innocent people who are lack knowledge of crypto. But if you know that there is no TRX network on USDT but instead ETH network. Then probably you are safe because ta the first place you are aware of it. So we should always have a research before doing any transaction in crypto to avoid scams.",

For anyone to be scammed, check very well they too are greedy. I'm not talking of a complete hack where the victims may not even be aware. I'm talking about active participation of the victim in their bid to claim what wasn't even theirs. This day, it's dangerous clicking on links; even when they're from trusted friends. Some times our friends may mean well but will be ill informed on this crypto stuff and in their bid to help out they may endanger us. I've seen this happen on several occasions. This innocent friend who is naive finds a seemingly great site paying people who visit their site and then decides to share link to the site, not knowing it's a scam site. It gets dirty. I advise everyone to be their own detective.",
