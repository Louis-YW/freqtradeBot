  "content": "Hi all ,I bought my first lot of Cardano last week and sent it to my ledger from Coinbase there was no problem at all. I went to send back my Cardano to Coinbase yesterday but when doing so it shows I have 0 Cardano. When I look at my Cardano on Ledger live however it clearly shows the amount I have. I spoke with someone on Ledger live chat this morning and they are saying I am unable to send my Cardano back to Coinbase as the Cardano I have on Ledger is showing as staked. I have never staked Cardano so not sure how this is possible. I spoke to someone at Coinbase and they said it is impossible to send Staked Cardano to Ledger and Ledger is saying you cannot stake Cardano on Ledger so I am not sure how my Cardano can be staked. This has left me confused as to how this has happened and ledger have advised in order to send my Cardano  back to Coinbase I must unstake my Cardano through a third party. I have been using Ledger for around a year now and this is the first time this has happened. Has this happened to anyone else at all or does anyone know how this has happened?",

      "body": "Much better if you can show some proof of its image and we'll see if it's really staked at all. Just the image of your Cardano was really staked on Ledger live. And if you can't remember that you're the one that staked it, it's very impossible that it will be staked because it doesn't go there automatically unless somebody or the owner just did it.I am not sure if you really talked to the actual Ledger live rep if they're telling you to use a third party, that sounds sketchy when ADA's were staked on their own platform or they've actually just integrated it with a third party for that feature.",

      "body": "Hi , I have just had the below email from Ledger ..Hello, Please accept my apologies for the delayed response.  In regard to your ADA and as Coinbase noted, you cannot send ADA while it is Staked.  I am not sure either how your ADA became staked. ADA staking and unstaking is not supported directly in Ledger Live.  You will need to use a third-party ADA wallet to unstake your ADA. Be sure your Ledger Live application is closed when you start the Eternl connection process.  Also make sure your Nano is connected to your computer, unlocked with the PIN and the ADA app is open. When your Ledger is connected to Eternl, click the \"Stake\" tab and you will be unstake your ADA there.  After the ADA is unstaked, you can send to Coinbase. Let me know if the Eternal set up and unstaking process works or if you have issues.",

      "body": "So I went through the third party ‘Eternl’ and having done that it was showing my Cardano was not staked so I informed the customer services on Ledger of this and they told me to try another Third party wallet called Typhon to confirm this.Again, when checking on Typhon it showed the Cardano I hold is not staked so now I am just waiting got a reply from Ledger to what is now best to do because it is clearly an error that my Cardano is showing as staked on Ledger.I am wondering if it is safe to send my Cardano from the third party wallet Typhon but I am not sure if it is safe to do so? Can someone confirm if it is ok to send crypto from a third party wallet to Coinbase? I just don’t want my Coinbase account to potentially be affected in anyway.",
