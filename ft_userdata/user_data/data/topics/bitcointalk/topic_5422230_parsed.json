  "content": "One more milestone on the Roadmap has been completed.From the beginning, one of the main goals of JupyterNetwork was to be completely decentralized and a DAO concept is a great way to start it.What is DAO ?A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization with publicly and automatically documented governance rules. Smart contracts, which are autonomous programs that carry out certain conditions automatically, are the foundation of their functioning. Once it has been activated, it cannot be halted or shut off, and it cannot be altered in any way, even by adding or removing data. Features are numerous, such as governance tokens for voting rights. Furthermore, all information, including the source code, is available to the general public. Open to everybody, unrestricted by any authority, based on computer code, and in which no one may engage in fraud.On 17.11.2022 JupyterNetwork officially launched its DAO on Dework.A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain.JupyterNetwork DAO is collectively owned and managed by its members. JupyterNetwork DAO has built-in treasuries that are only accessible with the approval of their members.JupyterNetwork works without hierarchical management and can have a large number of purposes.All the tasks are publicly viewable and there are also tasks that will generate instant rewards upon completing them.To join JupyterNetwork take a look at the entry form here.https://app.dework.xyz/jupyter-network-dao/join-jupyternetwork-58256/overviewPlease note that the DAO will be always updated with new interesting tasks and features.Next on the map is Governance, in which the JupyterNetwork community will have an even bigger role in advancing the project.JupyterNetwork is a community-driven project and anyone can contribute to it.p.s we got an ongoing Airdrophttps://www.coinscope.co/coin/iom/airdrop",
