      "body": "This is indeed a good idea and as Wapinter pointed out, we already do have a dedicated board for trading. But, P2P trading on forum is much more worse than trading on large scale platforms such as Binance P2P. One such problem is losing the anonymity of individuals : We as forum accounts have knowingly or unknowingly built trust and these forum names are much more trusted than our real life names. What if a bad actor try to take advantage of this and threaten us for doxing in the future? Even though, we both have been chatting regularly and discussing about various news related to Bitcoin over the past few years, both of us never knew each other personally and this anonymity is required in the case of crypto transactions.Binance P2P on the other hand, helps us to connect with trusted anonymous individuals who have done various trades in the past. They never know if you are involved in forum activities or they never know the other side of your life. More or less, our Binance accounts are connected to our real life whereas forum accounts have been created to be distinct from them. Trading cryptocurrencies within the forum is always a good practice since we never expose our fiat bank account and our name and personal information are safer. Finally, the chances of getting scammed or account being frozen is relatively lower IMO since Binance regularly monitors the transactions and accounts in their platform so that we have a safer trading platform.",

Avoid any Indian P2P at the moment if you do not want to get your bank account frozen. As @Heisenberg_Hunter said forum P2P is a bad idea because it will reveal everyone's identity.

Thoughts?Since you are a mod on that subreddit, you can surely create a poll on that platform whether members would be interested in doing P2P transactions on the local board marketplace. Some of us might not be interested due to lack of anonymity but others might. According to the results of that poll we can then think about the T&C. A telegram channel is also trying to find ways to do P2P transactions securely. It is a small group of 1000 odd memmer. A few prominent BTT local board members are part of that channel. I can ask them if they would be intrested in such initiative.",
