  "content": "What happened:I registered an account on 1.08.23.Number account is 657199543Made 3 deposits of 1000 trx (77 USDT).I played at the casino (slots) for all three deposits.I lost everything.I made about ten more deposits in the total amount of 6000 trx - (462 USDT).The total amount of deposits was - 9000 TRX - (693 USDT).I used this money to bet and play in casinos (slots).Also lost.From the last ~1000 trx (77USDT) I won 8638 trx (665 USDT).The total number of bets is > 200.Bets were placed on FIFA (cyber sports where bots play) FIFA 23. 5x5. Superleague,FIFA 23. 4x4. England Championship,FIFA 23. 3x3. Conference League,FIFA 23. Europe League,FIFA 23. World Championship.And for tennis WTA Monreal,WTA Washington,ATP Toronto.The last bets were on FIFA 23. 4x4. England Championship, after I was kicked out of my account with the words \"wrong username/ password\".They told me to write to the security service's email.I wrote and received an answer - \"Access to our platform is closed for you, and your account has been canceled.\"I did not receive any evidence of violations, as well as my money that I deposited.Then the security service ignores my messages.There were only deposits on the account, there were no money withdrawals.The account balance was 8638 trx with deposits of 9000 trx.I didn't withdraw anything, didn't win anything. My balance is 8638 trx, and the sum of all deposits is 9000 trx.They didn't even give me back my deposited money.Just closed the account.This is a scam and a scam on their part.If the official representatives do not solve my problem here, I will also file complaints to the licensee about Curacao and Askgamblers.Beware of scammers, if you lose - they are interested in you.If you start winning, they will close your account and will not even give you your deposits.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3502111Amount Scammed: 665 USDTPayment Method: CryptoProof of Payment:https://imgur.com/a/AENItPYPM/Chat Logs:https://imgur.com/a/nKIY5qZMy balance on coinplay https://imgur.com/a/xExaIjy",

      "body": "You should have done some research on this forum before depositing your money on that casino. The casino is somewhat similar to 1xbit and anyone who deposits money on such casinos won't get anything even if they win the bets. I'm sorry for you, but I don't think that they will allow you to withdraw the money that you have won.Be more careful next time because going with a casino site without proper research is like throwing your cash on fire in hope of getting the cash back, ah, you will get ash out of that cash and the fire will burn it cash paper into ash. The analogy might be funny, but that's a fact because the casinos that operate with such business are always doing this with their users and yet no one can stop them.I would recommend you to learn about a casino and read reviews about it on this forum as well as on other sites, and you should at least search scam accusations of the casinos on this forum before depositing money into a casino. It's always said that prevention is better than cure, and it's always better to avoid fishy sites at any cost.",

The moment that they've asked for something just to withdraw your money out of their casino, you know then and there that you're already a victim of a scam. You writing a review on Trustpilot is enough for this kind of stuff. Hopefully you will learn to check on the forum for vouches on websites that involves crypto, saves you a lot of headaches.",

Because as you can see they already have a negative reputation here in the forum with several negative tags and some flags opened against them so adding another scam accusation thread here in the forum will have little to no effect whatsoever on their reputation.So I’ll suggest you take the matter to https://www.askgamblers.com/casino-complaints and submit a complaint there providing as many evidence as you can to back up your claims and if they’re found guilty it might have an impact on them but as for this thread? Nah nothing is coming out from it.",

But, although I cannot guarantee results, there are some steps you can take. Firstly, try posting your complaint on websites like AskGamblers or Casino.guru. They have a reputation for assisting gamblers facing issues with gambling sites, and you might get more responses there. Coinplay casino has a few unresolved complaints already, but even if you do not get a resolution or response, at least you can warn the wider gambling community and potentially lower their score on those platforms.",
