I didn't get even a 0.002$ reward...as a result, I have 3.7 Million of JB coins (empty coins which can't be exchanged to real money) and a 10.6$ locked BCDs (nothing, unlocking requires:  Unlock amount = wager amount * 1% * 25%, and this means that to unlock that amount, you need to wager 400 times of that amount, and fee(house edge 1%) would eat 4 times of that amount)so this Lucky Spin is completely fake giveaway...site gives you nothing, it just expects to get investments from user that he will play on, with vip0 you can't get anything there, that will allow you to increase level (JB coins doesn't have any weight)...and also, withdrawal representation looks pretty uncomfortable, it deletes zeroes, (BTC Min: 0.0009, Fee 0.0002 BTC, so you need to count the numbers to know that it's 90k and 20k satoshis)...Last Edit:   May 19, 2022===UPD September 11, 2022Soon after this post, I've made an investment and reached vip1, and the result of the next few month...So, totally, 365 spins = NOTHING!I've haven't won a 0.02$ prize position, which is there, and even for previous 190 spins - that 0.002$ prize, not even a single time. So, it's absolutely empty giveaway, for a year not a single cent of reward...P.S. I know that the chance of winning is ultra low, I've made 19K spins on freebitco.in, and maximum win only 2$, 2-3 times...",

      "body": "I don't know the site.However, it's called \"Lucky spin\". I check what type of spin you are discussing, it's a freeroll spin. The most common mistake from all gambler, they think all of their previous lost is gonna increase the chance win. Actually is not, If you spin with percentage win 50% and you get multiply lost. Your previous losses are not gonna increase your win % in the next bet, your chance win is still 50%.This type of spin is always under 1% win or maybe 0,xx% win. Never hope too much for a spin/roll in from \"FREE\".",

      "body": "I feel like the game is constructed in such way that you see it as a round wheel where there's similar chance to get any of the visible results. It makes you believe that if there are 16 sections you have 1/16 chance of getting one of them, but in the background there's a code running that has assigned rolls to each field. It's still a game of dice, just that you're not rolling 1 or 0, but for instance 1-10000 and everything between 1 and 9990 gives you a worthless shitcoin and the last 10 are real rewards. That's why you're constantly getting a shitcoin because even after 10k rolls you don't have to get a reward, just like in normal dice you can keep rolling 6 times in a row and never get a 6. I don't think it's a complete scam, but it definitely takes advantage of the way people understand it. It's not a physical wheel of fortune where you really have 1/16 chance of getting something. It's a wheel where 99% of it is covered in sections where you win nothing and there's a hairline where it has to stop for you to get anything else.",

Obviously if its a free spin then the only real purpose it serves is as a marketing tactic to keep you on their online gambling casino website and to lure in new customers or better said, gamblers.Why would they make a free spin where you can win up to 1 btc a high probability game? They would only make huge losses that way. Personally, I have never used that particular online gambling casino so I cannot really make an informed decision on whether or not it has any virtue or whether it is a fake scam site. But the fee seems a bit high so I would avoid it probably. It seems designed to keep people on their site. Just like the \"lucky spin\"",

If not (which is the most likely case), then that's just natural, I don't think there's anything odd about it really, granted that it's even a free spin. It isn't like the chances of winning go up with each spin after all. Maybe said investment of others was to spend money to spin it again? (I'm assuming the lucky spin lets you do it again but with a cost after the 1st free one). And besides, it's free, I don't think there's anything to complain about, you didn't exactly spend anything on it.

In most cases the chances of getting something from a free spin are actually very small. You are much more likely to win from a \"standard\" spin of a roulette wheel or a slot machine. People make the mistake of believing that a free spin game is the same as a game that people generally play for money. Many people think \"What's the harm? You can still win something\". The problem with that is it greatly understates the time involved in the process. In a lot of free spin games, you have to spin the wheel a lot of times just to get anywhere close to 1% chance of winning anything. I mostly ignore games like that because I know they’re just a marketing tactic to attract players. The chances of winning are so small, it doesn't really make sense to devote my time to it.",
