It is very annoying you know. Like i checked,the slotella casino presence is identifiable and can be recognized here on this platform. The last that the representative account was active was October 06, 2022, 12:31:44 AM¬† which is over two weeks now. i think just this post you have made is not factual enough to back your claims, it would be nice if you possibly do the needful by providing proof and evidence backing your claims that their actions was unprofessional.

I found redlanegaming only back of slotella and looks weird a new scamy site poping up with even impersonating a casino with THEIR assets.¬† is not also enough to tag both¬† site as scammy, definitely, there is every possibility or tendency that the site might have been developed or built by the same developer for only God knows reason. Sometimes, developers would want to test or try their now code for another to seeing if things works out fine for the other as they have used if for the previous. Lastly, slotella going silent might likely be an internal issue from the management though i am saying base on assumption and i have no clues as to why they have not responded or replied you and allowing you to withdraw your funds but this you did by raising an alarm and calling to the consciousness of the forum members is a good one so that everybody would be on the know as to the sudden change and development regarding slotella.com casino.",

I don't know if they have been posting positive reviews for months now or if these reviews are from real people who have used the casino and liked the casinoOP I suggest you open a scam accusation in the scam accusation section, you have to put as much evidence as you have, and don't put too much hope on these scammers paying you, because these scammers always use their secret and infallible weapon the \"TOS\" \" and unfortunately when they use their weapon the TOS there is nothing else you or anyone else can do, they will take your money and get away with it as if they were absolutely right and you were wrong. It's sad when you don't have a third party with power to mediate the conflict between the client and the casino in a neutral and fair way",

Problem is that, scam projects won't be distinguished easily; some would be hideous of their reputation and some would turn out to be a scam halfway of their progress to this industry. To OP, this post could catch the attention of the site but that would solely depend to them on how will they make actions towards the issue. Unfortunately, in most cases, gambling site managements won't do anything about such instances especially if it is an 'isolated case' but I hope they would, on your end. I agree with other users' opinion of posting more evidences for this concern to not just be an accusation and to be more of an eye opener to those who are planning to engage with this gambling site.For now, try still to contact their chat support with hopes of them being responsive.",

Casino never said I'm not right or there is not a bug. They just delaying my case and let this bug be there to affect anyone.
