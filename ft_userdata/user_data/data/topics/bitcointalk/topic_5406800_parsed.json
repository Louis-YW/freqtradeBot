RECYCLING AIEcosystem connects people with companies and municipal services, and makes it possible to encourage citizens toexercise care with waste utilization.Current situation:The current waste market operates based on an outdated scheme. Waste in most countries first goes to a landfill, andsorted only afterwards. However, to adequately cope with the large amount of garbage is difficult, and therefore most of itsimply stays in the landfill. Landfills take up a lot of space, and contain untold quantities of useful recyclables that couldbe utilized.- ”We did not invent waste sorting; rather, we will help involve significantly more people in this process.”RECYCLING AI ecosystemInsufficient motivation is the main reason for improper waste disposal. We propose to reward people for everyeco-friendly action. Every single piece of sorted garbage — such as discarded bottles, cola cans, or other packaging — willbring several coins to the person's account. You do not need to haul a bunch of metal coins, returned by a plastic bottlesrecycling automat, in your pocket; instead, simply and easily accumulate CYCAI token in your cryptocurrency accountonline.These token can be spent via our partners’ network — used as a discount for garbage disposal, electricity bill payment,and/or many other payments or withdraw to all other Blockchain.RECYCLING AI for businessEvery year, countries spend billions of dollars to resolve ecological disasters. Why not start fighting the cause, instead ofthe consequences? The platform is designed for any garbage processing plant or municipality, or a company that workswith any type of recyclable materials. By collecting waste properly sorted by consumers, the plant no longer needs do soitself, which reduces costs, and also increases the amount of collected recyclables. More resources and lower costsenable factories to grant rewards to people; these rewards are RECYCLING AI token.Why blockchain?There are more than 100 types of recyclables — glass, plastic, metal, tires, wood, and so on. And there are tons of thesegenerated daily. It’s simply impossible for this vast amount of information to be processed on a single server. That's whyblockchain is the solution. Each operation is undertaken by the network participant, and we can be assured of its reliabilityand security.OFFICIAL EMAILContact@recycling-token.comSupport@recycling-token.comJob@recycling-token.com",

      "body": "Quote from: patricklix on March 03, 2023, 03:52:13 PMI think that many people care about the environment, so they will all be interested in recycling, even for tokens. I think that after this, the streets of the states will be so clean that they will definitely be in the world's top clean countries. I'd start picking up trash myself if I knew I'd be rewarded for it. But I doubt that this is true and it will happen at all, unless MrBeast is behind such an idea. So, for example, I have only to turn to a company to removing junk in Fresno, as it is so far the only way to remove the trash, and also to keep my city safe from pollution. I am confident that the company knows what to do with it, so I trust it.",
