I believe we that are here have a very big seperate mentality. Then moved down to governments, they aren't trying in any case to help the youths at all, if there were to be work would there be any way youths would go involved in any malactivity?No! because they aren't talking responsibility.That is why i used to beg our brothers here to please be patient while you are here, little time your shoe go shine and your face go show and as e day you go dey see am live!",

Those who don't value it because they need quick cash, should feel free to do as they please. In this economy of our time, every person has what is favorable to them, but illegalities are what I don't support. Let the youth learn from the mistakes of others who have run amok; some are now into trouble they can't excape, and some are now severely derailed.",

In the video you can see how these Nigerian youths who were armed, harassing and chasing people from the street. With these behaviors, the government of other countries can decide to ban Nigerians from immigrating into their countries so as to prevent loss of life.With the forthcoming election, we all pray that Nigeria gets a good President who can restore Nigerians economy back to it's fullest.🙏🙏🙌🙌🙌☑️I no even know say you be naija, nai you dey worry technical board with plagiarism and smileys, them don report your account I no know wether moderators go pity you.
