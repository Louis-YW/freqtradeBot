Three times now as I keep checking back just in case you've add those info, and since you didn't but keep insist on that answer for my questions... have you check my question properly?Two questions that I asked are simple. One, I am curious about why almost none of your team mentioned their employment on Bitconia, not even the CEO. The only thing that tied you with the CEO is that he works on Future Trends, which you also mentioned as your strategic partner, which unfortunately, their website couldn't do the same for you. So there goes the ties. I think it is quite justified if we questions whether those people you mentioned as part of your team really works for bitconia or you just borrowed their name without their consent. This issue is very easy to tackle, though, all they need to do is just updating their linkedin.Second, the award. Can't find which organization crowned you as the best ICO 2022",

For the first question though, I am rather sit it can't be found on your whitepaper, your team need to update their employment record to match the claim that they're indeed spring for you. Otherwise, it'll open for an assumption that you just borrower random people's name without their consent",
