In my opinion, that is the basic science of investing and everyone who wants to invest must use these 3 methods. So I don't think it's a little secretInvestment requires experience and a good environment. We need to have the courage to try and learn using the try and error method until we find an investment that suits our passion. Apart from that, we need connections with fellow investors so that we can learn from their experiences. The world of investment is not easy, there are many profite and risks in it. Many also fail so we have to be prepared for the possibility that happens and make sure our investments use safe money",

For a successful investing journeys, one must observe this above 3 master keys of investing . These are actually some nice points given but I feel number one is really good as I also feel that the basic theory that behind every successful investment is the theory about being patient and you know what they say when it comes to patience \" the patient dog eats the fastest bone\" which is obviously true because you cant be in a hurry when it comes to an investment especially when it has to do a bitcoin investment. There are so many cases of possible investment wanting to meet up a target with their earnings and investment but at the long run of everything they end up misusing their investment and jeopardizing their whole plan because they lack that share principle of discipline and patience.",

The points op listed, are what we observe everyday as an investor. Before you embark on any investment be it crypto or stock, you have to be knowledgeable and ready to bear the risk that follows. We all learn everyday. as an investor, you have to follow up the market update consistently and only invest what you can loss. Investing is easier compared to trading they both involve risk, but many people confuse them both for the latter.",

OP you made mentioned of Patience, which every investors real need in making decisions, Risk management, that's another one you as investor need to keep in check and always have it in mind that the risk you face is always high, and Power Of Knowledge, on this I feel you just have to let people know what you don't know, it helps in growing not only on investment but also in our daily lives.But let's not forget that we can't have it all at ones, because having it all is like you're perfect and you know it all. Is not easy being an investor facing difficulties especially when is time to decide, desperation can make you make a move that you'd sometimes regret. So to me the best to have on all is patience because it comes with other packages.",

That makes it looks too easy, well it's not, because not everyone are in good shape to be investing every time, that's why investments benefits the rich more than the poor, as you DCA onto your favourite crypto projects you also have to live, sometimes it will be difficult because of some unexpected accountabilities.A poor man planning to become rich will have to fight some battle within himself, he has to start seeing things differently and he also must be willing to think like the rich, because a poor mindset will always try to bury you deep in the ground, it can be hard to believe but the mindset is everything.Rich people don't have time for soberness in their vain, they knew that the pain they have to endure to keep floating is investing, rich men lives for investment, that's their hobby, they do this more than anything else. They also prefer to be in the midst of smart people, they believe this is the only way to become smarter. Learn.Watch your circle.

We all know that Bitcoin investment requires a long term hold before profits will start coming, and it is not a get-rich-quick scheme. Op, having a good understanding of Bitcoin before investing in it will give you the ability to be patient when the time of storms comes, and you will not panic about selling your Bitcoin because you are already aware that price drop is a part of Bitcoin's characteristic. If FOMO makes you invest in Bitcoin you will not be patient enough, you will sell your Bitcoin anytime you are dismayed because you don't have a good understanding of Bitcoin. Understanding Bitcoin or something before investing in it will give more trust to be patient with that thing.",

For a successful investing journeys, one must observe this above 3 master keys of investing . I think almost every investor knows those things and they publicly share these tips with everyone. Seems like you used the title intentionally in order to make us believe that no one tells those things in public. Being patient is important in everything not only investing even if we start a new business still we will have to keep patience because that business will take some time before others know about it and want to invest in it. The huge companies like  Apple, Amazon, Google, and many others we know are successful because their inventors had patience in their personality. A investor should learn about the assets in detail where he/she wants to invest his/her money. That's why learning is highly important and without research the investors will mostly lose their investments. A good investor doesn't invests in a single asset and tries to diversify his/her portfolio by investing in various assets. We as humans are mostly emotional by nature but when it comes to investing then controlling our emotions is also important. The ones who have patience, who can control their emotions, and who believe in research are among the top investors.",
