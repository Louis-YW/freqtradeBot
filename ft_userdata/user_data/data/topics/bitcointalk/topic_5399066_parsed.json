Exchanges and other services such as our own offer purchasing online with much lower fees. Bitcoin ATMs dont offer much privacy either as you usually need to provide ID and KYC items as well for purchases.",

But if it gives a choice to stay anonymous, some people may be ready to pay that extra premium in exchange of protecting their anonymity. So this has bith pros and cons. I hope the pros of such huge initiative overpowers the cons and nake the venture profitable in long run.",

Investing in 800 ATM's ? That's a bold move to be sure but where even are they getting these investors from as well? I do think personally they are not going to have a good business and at the end the blame would be on bitcoins and with this fee they might as well deliver the fiat on a horse. They might also start an ATM card or something for sure to try and dominate the market but I think this won't really be adopted by most people.",

Investing in 800 ATM's ?Unless I am wrong, this is not the first time Kwik is attempting to offer Cryptocurrencies.  Anyway.  The high fees were fine back when ATM's offered a certain degree of privacy.  I learned privacy has a cost and I started acknowledging this as a fact long time ago.  But now with all the Know Your Everything laws and orders, it makes no sense to use a KYC enabled ATM over an Exchange.I assume the users of these ATM's are older people who know just pure and basic things about their Cryptocurrencies like sending and receiving, those who have an emergency or who are fooled into believing KYC enabled ATM's offer more privacy somehow than an Exchange would.  Or, maybe someone who simply does not want their banks to interfere with their Cryptocurrency transaction history.  Other than these types of people, I do not get why someone would see any kind of advantage in using an ATM.-Regards,PrivacyG",

To be honest, while ATMs might be a good way of increasing adoption, this might actually do more harm than good, since people who are interested in using them, might go to use them, and realise that they charge a massive fee like that, which ultimately leads to them losing interest thinking that Bitcoin is fundamentally like that. I know they have to recoup the costs of the machines somehow, but 11% is absolutely ridiculous. I'd be interested to know anyone that regularly uses them with those sort of fees. I'm not sure there's any monthly statistics on people using them, i.e just the number of people of independent deposits/withdrawals. With those kinds of fees, the convenience for me doesn't out  weigh those enormous fees.",

It's not an efficient method for criminals.Then why make it mandatory even for $100?  Even for $10?  Who in their right mind would go to an ATM and exchange $100 dirty money a thousand times to withdraw their dirty $100,000?  And if the ATM has KYC and AML limits, do you think the dude would actually use an ATM over alternatives such as trading locally Peer to Peer knowing the ATM might take a snap of his face every transaction and all of a sudden they have a hundred images of your face dating the same month?  If you impose KYC for all values and the trader moves on to the Peer to Peer exchange, then was KYC even necessary at all?-Regards,PrivacyG",
