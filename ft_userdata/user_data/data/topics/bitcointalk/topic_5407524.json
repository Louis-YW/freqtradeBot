While the USD is a safe-haven currency and would remain the same even in most war situations since a major war on the USA will likely be a global issue (world war). This is highly unlikely in this present dispensation and note that Bitcoin alternates between the safe and risky currency as much as I know. The fact that some Bitcoin investors, including banks, are in the USA does not make the country the sole driver of the Bitcoin world, the country's stake in the cryptocurrency won't collapse the system in case of eventualities, but will affect it the way many countries' restrictions and banning had affected it in the past e.g China. Nonetheless, the effect you attributed to this could only happen with the outright banning of Bitcoin in the USA, yet I believe Bitcoin would still survive since the USA is not the only contributor in the world. Also for clarity's sake, the USD and Bitcoin do not move perfectly inversely or proportionally, there are many times the USD would be selling and the Bitcoin will be selling too or otherwise (You may check their correlations of last week Friday (18/07/22 - 22/07/2022) for guidance on this.",

The full nodes and miners and mining pools and exchanges are spread across the globe. It's true that many of the centralized businesses are located in US but bitcoin does NOT rely on centralized businesses to run!Quoteonly option is euro as safe heaven becouse if dollar fall btc fall also.You are confusing a bunch of things here.First is the fact that bitcoin price falling has nothing to do with it relying on a centralized shitty exchanges. It is pure panic sell and it is purely your speculation that it would fall and a different topic.Second is that both Euro and USD are dumping, EUR harder than USD most because US exports its inflation to countries that only use dollar as reserve currency.QuoteBut we know usa is under wall street people protection they rule worldLOL. sure kiddo.",

In any case, crypto is, so far, still fluid-like enough to adjust itself in case of any outside changes.",

Quote from: 325btc on July 25, 2022, 06:37:57 AMJf if there is signs that usa western powers are out or even might get attacked military or cyber or other ways then im out of btc becouse btc relie on usa servers and exchangers.Why? How? Because BTC is created by US government? Bitcoin was never created by US government. Or because the exchanges in the world are based in US? There are far many exchanges that are not in US. Just like the talk about China having 75% of bitcoin mining power like 4 or 5 years back, but after Chinese FUD and mining crackdown, was bitcoin affected? Yet still bitcoin today.Quote from: 325btc on July 25, 2022, 06:37:57 AMBtc can shine only if usa banking power strong but if the usa elite know this only option is euro as safe heaven becouse if dollar fall btc fall also.Btc is from usa coinbase is one of the founders yes crypto can survive without exchangers but crypto neeed central globql price if there is disturbutiins in network then we cant price in crypto.Coinbase is one of the founder of what? Of BTC? That is nonsense.Central global price? For bitcoin? That is nonsense. Your post is not making any sense about this.",

Do you remember this post of yours \"Time to leave btc\" you were supposed to be gone for 2 years, that would have reduced a lot of your spam post.Whatever gave you the idea btc is controlled by the USA! if that was the case shouldn't their approach towards BTC be a lot softer than what it is now?  you just make post without thinking about its meaning. I can tell the market is really getting to you because all your post only revolves around btc and how to print money, I will suggest you take that time off, have a good rest with a clear head and come back.",

Europe made euro to keep itself strong economically. But now china is blunting US economy by becoming their manufacturing house and making Europe and US dependent.  We need to look at real long term scenario. Already many countries want to switch away from compulsion of US dollar and  in such situation there is an urgent need that we create a international currency to prevent any future currency frictions. I think bitcoin can fit the bill. Its decentralized and owned by none.",
