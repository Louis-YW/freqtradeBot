  "content": "I was reading some topic few days ago, and that topic led me to this post of LoyceV where I read that, theymos address has 750 BTC and I did not believe it. Then I checked the theymos profile, and an address was mentioned there, and I checked it on blockchair explorer and found out that, there are 2 addresses connected to it one is of BCH and one is of BTC. Well, on checking, he has around 388.96 BTC. Then I came to get the idea of finding out how many BTC does the administrators of this forum have. It is possible that these administrators might have other addresses containing more BTC, but my way is simple. I went to each profile and checked the address mentioned there on blockchair for the amount of BTC they have received or sent. Well, here is the list of administrators I have found when I was reporting a message in my last topic . Cyrus--1ASUtuHN5KHzm3t7BNXjLeZBZK65D3DrNR  Number of BTC Received= 11.18626505 BTChilariousandco-- 3Pq1njf9QsntNxaNHSnt1MRRCgvHNv9oco  Number of BTC Received= 5.919296 BTCmprep-- 3Dk152szgAebDq7VUPXLqxsTYm2Z4XqX5f  Number of BTC Received= 0 BTC  Mr. Big-- 1GKXB7fYGXAadovDzLebD4Ds6cbx5CdTAE  Number of BTC Received= 4.18533532 BTCtheymos-- 1NXYoJ5xU91Jp83XfVMHwwTUyZFK64BoAD  Number of BTC Received= 388.96200792 BTC  After checking the profiles of administrators, I came to conclude that, theymos has the most of the BTC and as per LoyceV's Post, which I stated above, theymos has around 755 BTC on that address. But that address is not the one that is mentioned on the theymos's profile. So, I cannot say anything about it. To be honest, I thought the administrators might have thousands of BTC in their holding as they are the ones who made it this far from the start. But I think they don't have that much BTC, or I might be missing the right addresses to check. And I don't really think mprep has none BTC, he might not have written his main account in his profile. PS: I hope I did not miss any administrator or consider any moderator as an administrator. I did find another good thread consisting of all the moderators, admins, and staff. ( List of the forum's admins/ global moderators/ staffsSo, I thought I should also check the address of the Staff too and should add how much BTC they have received at the addresses they have mentioned on their profiles.  -ck -- bc1q7acmav3wyxqqq4cdwtf3a7fh569ujcquxvefd6  Number of BTC Received= 0.33743833 BTCachow101-- bc1qypj0d5z37syl3l9962v4p9p42el09hdhd8ayrc  Number of BTC Received= 0.02950067 BTCAdriano-- 32PxGqk7FkADJ4Q1Zkh5CP5UHBanQsTMvu  Number of BTC Received= 0.05256382 BTCAnon11073-- 32NctAtYszp2gduMDFKgqbFiY2PjchS6AJ  Number of BTC Received= 0.29174984 BTCBarcode_-- 1J3KruLBLqK6zAMMJtjKc55qJyN3z47WUf  Number of BTC Received= 1.55347947 BTCdbshck-- bc1qxw4n7gy9x8x2x4kxcc7ve688eh768h8yzyzlcz  Number of BTC Received= 0.19953026 BTCEFS-- bc1qkpwlc02srj73a382k25x5xdpy9adph7wa2vyaz  Number of BTC Received= 0.14058284 BTCHalab-- bc1qsy4usnqcs94nx25z43y859f7xz23f78awnxl2u  Number of BTC Received= 1.04159094 BTCHostFat-- 1CHQHCENZPncS2rjiT4CEXWx7wJeq3cS2X  Number of BTC Received= 0.72127406 BTCgmaxwell-- bc1qwv07swd7xru8e8u07sjccptqmmnf8sqgdtn6am  Number of BTC Received= 0.00408933 BTCmalevolent-- 34tAEd9qx6dwY2frG56hweF7NMhA3b68Z4  Number of BTC Received= 0.03652254 BTCOmegaStarScream-- bc1q9vz8segfzph88kmxct447zgws6kehjf72a0rd9  Number of BTC Received= 0.00024535 BTCsapta-- 1777777vibDywVGuioASat4vq5B5eJXPbg  Number of BTC Received= 1.82112707 BTCWangbus -- No address associated amazing thing is, he has only 13 merits.

Like I am saying they have only this much BTC in there holdings. While to make sure, I even shared my way of finding the amount of BTC they have in their profile mentioned addresses only. I made this post in a fun way not in a serious or rigid information about them having only BTC that I have mentioned above. I hope you all will not mind me.",

Hey man. Well personally I dont believe we have anything to gain from knowing how much BTC anyone owns. However, take into consideration that anyone can own the keys that lead to multiple addresses. So the one address you will find on my profile (for example) doesn't necessarily mean it's my only address. In fact it's the only address that I am comfortable in sharing with this forum's members. Finally, if anyone owns many bitcoins, good for them. Concentrate on your goals and make sure to educate yourself. Of course this applies to many areas in life.This is friendly advice of course",

It takes less than 10 minutes to setup a bitcoin wallet and for people that have stayed in the forum so a long period of time and know so much about privacy and security it will be easy peasy for them to move their coins into their main wallet without anyone being able to trace the transaction to the new address, so just take a can of soda and focus on more relevant things rather than waste time on people’s money that of no use to us.",

(Just trying to explain), as on blockchain information is public, what matters is your identity and I'm sure OP cant mention their identity.Even someone can post a full list of wallets having X number of Bitcoin using any API or filter on the Blockchain's data.. besides that OP seems like you've put a lot of effort into coming up with an idea, for the next time I would suggest finding more specific informational content.

No need bringing someone else’s business with regards to there holdings to public notice.
