  "content": "Hello everyone I found one very interesting project. It's called cryptorium. This is a crypto game, the developers on Fiverr contacted me and asked me to check their code for bugs, Their condition was payment for work in eth. I agreed, they gave me all the tools to work with, even gave me moderator credentials to log in to the game. When I completed part of the work, I began to demand payment from them for the work done, as we agreed with them. As a result, as often happens, they stop responding and block me. Yes, I realized my mistake that I don't need to agree to pay outside Fiverr, but it really hurts me. As it turned out later, they did not change the login details! I suggest those who wish to download the project (here is the link https://crypteriumplay.io ) and make fun of them! Maybe you'll have time before they wake up! Here is username Wizard** and password 12*Robert(). Good luck to everyone and let's punish unscrupulous employers!",

I believe you should open up a Scam accusations thread against the founders will all the relevant information. That will make everyone here aware about them. The Meta board is to discuss  about the forum and not about third party. Please move this topic to",

      "body": "Fiverr is very strict about their freelancers and users there's a term there that prohibit contract or deal outside of their platform, have you contacted Fiverr about this, do you have screenshots of the conversations and the deal you can forward to Fiverr, it is an unethical practice.Since you just registered and you missed the right format in creating a scam accusation I advice you to provide all the information by filling in this Code:[b][color=black]What happened:: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Scammers Profile Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Reference Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Amount Scammed: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Payment Method: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Proof of Payment: [/color][/b][b][color=black]PM/Chat Logs: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Additional Notes: [/color][/b]And by the way, are you charging them with accusation or do you want us to deface or do harm or something to the platform, its not good just by posting here and providing all the details is enough to get back on them.",

      "body": "I don't use Fiverr but usually these platforms have got their own escrow system that you can report to them if you're not paid and the employer abused you. Your experience what happens to someone decided to deal with the employer outside the platform. I think if you guys have been working for years, it happens that you both agree to get out of the platform and deal directly on your own. But in your case, you just met them and agreed already to get out of the platform then the risk is on you. I have seen this happen for many times in many freelancing groups that they agreed to work not under the platform but directly quickly thinking that the fees will be saved but they don't realize that it's a protection policy that gives to the employer-employee deal by platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, etc.",

I was looking around the internet and I kept seeing \"playcrypterium.io\" but if you visit the website, it doesn't work.also, have you tried contacting them on other platforms? Their link tree(https://linktr.ee/crypterium) shows all the platforms where they might be active.",

Yes, I realized my mistake that I don't need to agree to pay outside Fiverr, Sorry for your bad experience, but Fiverr holds payments in escrow and depending on the last time I used them, escrow period can be up to two weeks. You have only lost your time, contact them to pay you, and I do not think that they will scam you because you now know the site’s infrastructure and you can sell the site’s data to hackers or steal money from them. wait for their response, as perhaps there was a problem, and if they want to scam you, report it here and consider that the time you spent in checking code it is a lesson for you not to accept work without escrow.",
