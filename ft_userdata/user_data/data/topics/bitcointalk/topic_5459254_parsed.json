  "content": "I have tried visiting the site many times today and unfortunately I was unable to get any success. For many hours I was unable to visit the forum and the feeling was really annoying for me because I'm kind of addicted to the forum. I have used multiple networks to see that if there is a problem with my internet connection which is basically a fast fiber network and it can load other sites within seconds. The issue was so severe that I had to try as many ways to connect to the forum as I possibly could but unfortunately all of those failed. Once I was sure that the Cloudflare thing wont allow me to visit the forum , then I decided to not give up but find a solution so I can visit the forum and share the details of my struggle with other members. After so many failures I decided to try the Tor browser to visit the site, and after installing the Tor browser I was still unable to visit the forum because it was asking for human verification for so many times, and was very slow than my regular browser. I renewed my tor circuit many times and no success at all, but finally I was able to browse the site when tor was connected with a France based IP address, and as soon as I was connected I logged into the site and replied to a post. I also thought that it would be better to share some information with forum members who are not able to post or browse the forum due to this Couldflare issue.A basic guide to use Tor for browsing the siteI have changed some settings in tor torrc-defaults file where I forced it to mostly go with France based IP addresses only, and then I was able to use the forum without any issues after tweaking the settings of the Tor browser. I'm going to share my settings here for the ones who are facing the same issue that I was facing.Code:EntryNodes {FR} StrictNodes 1ExitNodes {FR} StrictNodes 1All you have to do is to copy the settings that I have shared above and go to C:\\Users\\XYZ\\Desktop\\Tor Browser\\Browser\\TorBrowser\\Data\\Tor and search for the file named torrc-defaults. Once you find the file then open it with notepad and paste those settings in the end of the file and save the file with added settings. Now launch the Tor browser and connect to the network, and as soon as you're connected you should enter the URL of the forum and within few seconds you will be able to browse the site without any issues.I hope that this guide might be helpful for those who aren't able to visit the site because of the Cloudflare issue. I have also added a screenshot of the edited file so members can follow the details without any problem. I know that the issue is of a severe nature mostly for those users who aren't able to visit the site like me, and I hope that this small guide may help to solve their issue. You should also remember that Tor browser automatically changes the circuit sometimes and in that case you'll have to renew the circuit and the forum will load without any issues.Note: If you have access to a safe proxy or VPN that you can trust then you can also use any France based IP address to visit the forum without any issues. But, I still prefer Tor over those VPN's and proxy servers. However, if someone wants to connect via those services then they will also work just like the Tor, but if someone is concerned about privacy and safety of the account then I think Tor is a better option.",

Now this has made me to double submit comments here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5459142.msg62527812#msg62527812Now the forum is back into its working state but that time I was having difficulty to browse the forum, and everyone else were having the same issues. I tried many things to browse the forum but unfortunately I was unable to visit it after many unsuccessful tires. For me the Cloudflare verification wasn't showing and I waited so many minutes and did refresh the page after few minutes interval but the issue was still there. I was basically unable to visit the forum not even for a second, and that's why I tried Tor, but even the Tor wasn't working in beginning, but after many tires I was finally able to visit the forum when Tor was connected with a France based IP address. And, after that I did proper research that how to force Tor browser to assign France based IP only, and after some tires I got success in that. I'm quite sure that if in future anything like this happens then the same trick will solve the issue for the members, and that's why I shared the trick via this post.",

Hopefully forum adminstrator find some better solution to this as sometimes it take lots of time in verification and delay in posting time. I think they have already solved the issue because I'm not facing any issues right now and that's why I don't think that the issue is still there. The issue was truly alarming and caused much problems for the users who wanted to access the forum, and I was among those few members who weren't even able to browse the forum because they verification wasn't appearing. I'm a regular user of the forum and when I was unable to visit the forum for more than 4 hours then things were very stressful for me. I hope that in future such issues wont cause any lags or delays for the users of the forum because those people who are truly devoted to this forum wont be able to spend a day without visiting the forum.",
