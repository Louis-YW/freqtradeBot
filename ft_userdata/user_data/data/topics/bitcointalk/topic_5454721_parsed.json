  "content": "A new malware in the wild was spotted by trend micro. It leverage what we call runas.exe function, so they take advantage of it and can run the propagation with administrative privileges.QuoteBy using the runas.exe command, users can run programs as an administrator or any other user account with appropriate privileges, provide a more secure environment for running critical applications, or perform system-level tasks. This utility is particularly useful in situations where the current user account does not have sufficient privileges to execute a specific command or program. In the case of Bandit Stealer, this is done with the following command line:The Bandit malware was so intelligent that it will check for several environment first, and alter itself depending on where it is running.What's scary is that it targets the following wallets:So the principle hasn't change, they are dropping their dropper on emails and those who are looking for crack softwares. It could also spread and carry out in Youtube wherein there is a link that supposedly download a free softwares.https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/e/new-info-stealer-bandit-stealer-targets-browsers-wallets.html",

      "body": "Perhaps to thwart these stealing attempts by malware, the wallet software could have an option to change the directory used to store wallet files. Malware can't possibly list the files and folders on the entire hard disk, so changing it seems like a good \"security by obscurity\" option.It would only work with application software though, not browser extensions (with which you should not be storing your money in the first place).",

Suppose the hackers were able to call runas.exe, obtain administrative privileges,  was able to search for a path and find the appropriate path like Code:%appdata%\\electrumall what will get is the wallet file.In most wallets, that file is encrypted with a password. Hacker still needs to know the appropriate password to access your coins to brute force it, or did I miss something? to call runas.exe, it needs to download the program, meaning that random clicking alone is not enough to endanger your device.Whatever the reason, storing a lot of bitcoin in a hot wallet is behavior that may lead you to lose them, no matter how careful you are.",

Table 3 says \"cryptocurrencies stolen\", but they mixed up cryptocurrencies and wallets, and in the second table they even add a CEX as a wallet.There are probably hundreds of such malicious programs, and all of them have in common that they enter the system through the carelessness of the user, and AV companies just want to tell you that you will be safe if you use their protection. This is only partially true, because the first level of protection against such malicious programs is each user for himself.",

We should always be cautious of clicking of links sent to us via email or online to avoid falling for their traps. Also you should download whatever you want to download from the right website because these hackers operates through malware sent to their victim for easy accessibility of your information on your PC. This is even worst because they have the crpytocurrency and wallets that they target.",

Finding cracks for the application you downloaded that needs activation could also result in your wallet data being stolen. Being careful is what makes us safe from hackers who wants to steal crypto.",
