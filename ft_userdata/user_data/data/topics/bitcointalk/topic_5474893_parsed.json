Please do not misunderstand me to say you are a scammer but I am only trying to illustrate something which needs be understood and that has to do with finance so how do you handle the payment process for your deal because nobody would want to give you or make payment for anything that they have have not gotten result for. So in that case, would it not be nice you implore the services of an escrow to hold funds until after the service is being deleted and confirmed by your client then escrow can release the funds for you. This is just an honest opinion for which it is your decision to do or not.",
