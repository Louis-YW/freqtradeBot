Here's an explainer from the discord:QuoteOle Bitcephus — Today at 3:42 PMThis is an option for those wanting to mine with Nvidia GPU's.  There are other softwares you can use but I prefer LolMiner.So these are the mining pools currently setup https://miningpoolstats.stream/altcoinchain depending how much hashrate you have determines which you would use when considering Solo mining vs Pool mining.  If you have less than 1 gh/s then I would recommend pool mining but totally up to you.  I'm currently using Ekapool but mining4people is the other option for pool mining.If using Nvidia GPU I recommend Lolminer https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/releases you'll want to download the latest release v1.63 and pick for the system type you're using, likely Win64 or Lin64.  Click on the file to download it. Once you download you'll need to extract the files since they will download in a zip file.Once you extract the files you'll see a ton of different bat files that are preconfigured for mining.  You need to make adjustments before mining.  If you are using a non-LHR GPU then use the mine_eth.bat and if a LHR card use mine_eth_lrh_admin.batRight click on the file to make edits.  You only need to edit the small section of code you see below.\"POOL=mining4people.com:4073 OR alt.sg.ekapool.com:7799\"set \"WALLET=Ethereum address\"set \"WORKER=This can be whatever you want the name of your miner to be\"Once you've made those changes just save the file.  Now you are ready to begin mining and just need to right click on the bat file and select Run As Administrator.  Sometimes this doesn't work for me and I just have to double click the file to get it to run.You may also want to overclock your GPU for better efficiency but thats really dependent on the card and can find info about good overclocking from here  https://cointomine.today/overclocks/",
