If you use P2P, you will see many buyers on the exchange that you are using which you can send money to their account and you will receive bitcoin in return.Also decentralized exchange like Bisq can be used.",

      "body": "If I remember correctly, Australian can use Coinspot to trade fiat and crypto. I'm referring to this one[1], but as always you'll need KYC to do that. Keep in mind that I never use them since I'm not an Aussie. Still, I've heard good reviews from some Australian guys on the Telegram group for one of the crypto projects that I followed. Probably not the most reliable place to get reviews so please do your own research[2]. You can also share some platforms you have already tried so we don't suggest the same thing repeatedly. Do try P2P if you don't want to rely on a third party at all.[1] https://www.coinspot.com.au[2] https://coinspot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000775776-AUD-Withdrawals-FAQ",

What kind of issues are you facing in the past? Do they require you to use a bank account with the same name as your exchange account, or are they limiting your withdrawal amount, or something else? I'm not sure how Australian exchanges process fiat withdrawal, but I guess you'll face similar issues if they work on the same regulatory frameworks. P2P is probably your choice if you want to have flexibility on which bank account you want to withdraw without requesting additional KYC information.",

If so, then I don't think you will find that anywhere. It probably has something to do with regulations.Bitonic used to allow that back when they didn't require ID verification for selling BTC but I don't know if they still do, and if they support anything other than SEPA transfers.So you've got a couple of options here:- Send the money to your bank account first, then you can transfer it to whoever you want.- Use P2P platforms as we've already suggested.- Send crypto to the person you want to transfer fiat to and ask him to create an account at the exchange.",

So you can ask the support team whether you can change the default account to every account of yours or just go with P2P exchange whether you won't be facing this kind of issue.",
