      "body": "Of course, you can generate any private key you want using something like bitaddress (offline, of course) and then use it to calculate the public key as well. Â Here is a guide that shows you how to do that: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-generate-your-very-own-bitcoin-private-key-7ad0f4936e6c/Generating the public key first, makes things a lot more difficult because then you have to brute force the entire address space for the corresponding private key, which for obvious reasons of theft is not possible. It is more practical to generate part of the public key by hand, which is done when you make a vanity address.",

      "body": "Your bitcoin address is derived from your private key through a one way function. So, it's not possible to have a bitcoin address with any character you want if you want to own its private key and can spend fund from that. Note that even if you want to have a specific address without owning the private key, you can't select all the characters. Because the last few characters of a bitcoin address are checksum and are a function of the other characters. A good example of such address is 1111111111111111111114olvt2. It's only possible to generate a vanity address in which you select a few characters. For having a vanity address, you generate private keys again and again until the derived address matches your criteria.",

      "body": "You need good hardware to generate a vanity address and I hope you understand that beyond the 1st few characters it is impossible to generate larger vanity addresses. This depends on your hardware a little on the speed but after 5/6 characters it becomes very difficult and impossible after a certain amount of characters. You cannot have a vanity address of the full btc address because no one has the capability of doing that and thankfully that is the way it is because that would break btc.",

The more characters you want to generate the better your computer hardware you will need and the more time you will need but at a certain point it becomes impossible and this is just to have a unique address that does not benefit you except for vanity.",

My website should help educate you in the process.I really appreciate all the support guys.",

Hell, why even consider using P2PKH addresses at all anymore? All good wallets default to P2WPKH address, and several wallets won't even generate P2PKH address without some work around now. I haven't used one at all for a couple of years, and before that I only used them when withdrawing chips from ChipMixer.The only benefit I can see for legacy addresses is the standardized signing mechanism, but this is trivial to overcome by just using Electrum.",
