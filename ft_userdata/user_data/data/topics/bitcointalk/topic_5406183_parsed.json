  "content": "Every day, a growing number of people adopt cryptocurrencies, and everyday additions to the population all want to use cryptocurrency exchanges to buy and sell tokens and coins. Due to its trustworthy p2p transactions, exchanges like Binance and Kucoin are among the most popular exchanges. However, many scammers continue to operate and utilize various p2p transaction cheating techniques.Many buyers and sellers were involved in a peer-to-peer transaction; some of the cheaters among them will set a very high purchase price to entice the seller, but the seller falls for this and always pays less than what they agreed to.  Most individuals tend not to notice this since we consider it to be the standard and are quite confident that nothing similar to this will occur. This week, a friend of mine told me that he was conducting a peer-to-peer transaction and that the payment was less than what he had expected. He also informed me that he had previously had the same problem from a different source. I write this to inform our newcomers and a few other colleagues because anyone may become a victim of such an act because of the complete faith we have in the exchange, thus we need to be really vigilant and always check our transactions.Before releasing the coin, you can always Appeal to the exchange if something like this happens.",

      "body": "When conducting a transaction, be it on a p2p platform or sending to an individual address, the sender needs to verify a couple of information such as the wallet address and the amount of crypto to be sent or received. P2p exchanges have a set of rules and they always advise their client to confirm the figure and details of the senders and anything short of what appears on the exchange rendering the transaction invalid, and the buyer is at risk of losing funds if the case escalates and warrant proves. So the best advice is to always verify the sender's name and amount before releasing the assets.",

They say to follow blindly after high rates will often lead one the way of scammers and cheats, these scammers and cheats know how enticing high rates are and use it to lure the greedy and unobservant individuals that want to sell their crypto. You should even still count yourself lucky if your case is a case of you were paid less, have you considered others who followed high rates and never received fiat after selling their crypto to some vendor even on binance p2p. The overall lesson should be that we should as much as possible transact with only trusted and reputable individuals either online or offline.",

Ok, so I don't get it!It's a transaction on a platform where you see what you're paying for at what rate.Thre is no such thing as you agree on 600/coin and he sends you only 500, it's not a bazaar, it's a damn simple transactions that show you the real numbers at every step.Probably the heat got to me or I'm just dumb but where is the scam in this picture?

This is not about being a newbie to crypto, this is about not being able to buy a loaf of bread without getting cheated, why would you pay when he gave you less than agreed?Quote from: crwth on July 14, 2022, 05:51:36 AMHow can that happen?The scam can't happen in the actual exchange on the platform, it simply can't unless somebody is able to hack your computer and show different rates, as you mentioned those are set in stone when you initiate a transaction no user can change them as they see it fit.My guess is that OP refers to guys actually paying less in the cash transaction, maybe \"forgetting\" a zero and hoping the victim will release the escrow, and if not they will claim it was a typing mistake and they send the full amount.",
