But I think what makes people to start it is because after halving, the mining reward decrease by half which makes the supplying of bitcoin into the market to reduce, making it deflationary and valuables.Well at the first time of the halving there was no precedent, no anticipation. Neither was this the case during the second halving.BTC investors could only vaguely see a pattern when the 3rd cycle arrived.Meanwhile the whole world is anticipating on the 4th cycle. The attention was never so big in previous cycles because the price was not as significant as it is today. Everyone expects the price to go up loads after the halving. But why? It makes sense that everyone who ever heard about BTC, buys before the halving and not after. We're also at a stage now where buying 1 BTC is not an option for 99.9% of society. People would have to buy per 0.1 BTC. I think that the price of BTC went 10x on all previous occasions because individual investors wanted BTC, and were able to afford it. I think that the price can only explode from here if large institutions pump big money into BTC.",

Individuals keep telling me that it is too late to get into BTC because the price has already gone too high.",

Buying 1 BTC was realistic for many people before the first 3 halvings. Now that is no longer the case.When a thing happen once it is called luck but the third time isn’t luck. The reason why you see an increase in bitcoin price after halving is because the amount to be mined reduces and as such the supply becomes limited. When the supply of a product decreases and the demand is high it increases the price according to law of demand and supply Quote- Why would people invest loads of money in BTC after the halving and not before? People actually invest more into bitcoin before halving because after halving that is actually when the price is low because after halving there is bull run.

If you know the historical price of Bitcoin you should notice the price ranges are different every block halving because like others said the block reward for miners drops into half every 4 years.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on December 15, 2023, 09:22:56 PM- Why would people invest loads of money in BTC after the halving and not before? Actually, for me that's not a good idea to invest in Bitcoin after block halving you should buy Bitcoins before block halving because if not you might be late if the price increases much before and after block halving.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on December 15, 2023, 09:22:56 PM- What is a good price range for an air gapped wallet, for someone who only manages 0.3 BTC?I don't think you still need to buy an Airgap or hardware wallet if you already have an old PC and phone it should be enough. You can make your old PC as offline cold storage and only use it to store your private keys and sign a transaction and never connect it to the internet and install your watch-only wallet into your phone where you can monitor your wallet and make unsign transactions.",

Bitcoin price is purely determined by a combination supply and demand, and no one really understands them. Is the price growing because supply is decreasing or because demand is rising? We can't answer even such simple question, because we don't have the strong data.One of my theories is that these cycles are a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. People look at the past pattern, assume that it will repeat and act accordingly. If the price rises before the halvening, speculators think it's a premature rally and dump their coins, causing a correction.",

It reduces the rate of new coins entering circulation potentially leading to price increase. Some investors may prefer to wait for confirmation of the impact before committing. Others might see the potential for higher returns after the event. Individual investors are the key players before and now it’s the institutional adoption for the major price appreciation.",

Buying 1 BTC was realistic for many people before the first 3 halvings. Now that is no longer the case.It was easier to buy 1 BTC in past years, past 3 halvings, but it was harder to hold those bitcoins years ago. Because bitcoin was not too valuable years ago and people were less seriously about holding their bitcoins.Now, you have more difficulty to accumulate 1 BTC but you will have more reasons to hold your bitcoins.On chain stats shows that more holders have been accumulating bitcoin in last few years.Greater than 0.1 BTC https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/addresses-greater-than-0-1-btc/Greater than 1 BTC https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/addresses-greater-than-1-btc/Quote- What is a good price range for an air gapped wallet, for someone who only manages 0.3 BTC?You even can have an air gapped wallet, free.

People choose to invest in the BTC market post-halving due to a reduction in its supply, which will increase demand, and you know that when supply becomes low and people demand anything high, it increases price pressure. Such types of events are a strategy in which investors look to invest based on historical performance.",

You’re not out of place to have made these observations and that it happens plus, we today see it for a pattern and bank on that to be the case through every other occurrence.Well, we could blame this on the psychology of human behavior. Most times, it’s about what we already know, coming to push us towards same repetition over again due to an already established expectation thereby, creating the event (Bulls/Bears).The halving is already a certainty, something that is independent of efforts but what comes after is based on our response to it.The halving creates an idea of scarcity due to the reduction of block reward to miners. This in turn reduces the introduction of new Bitcoins into the market, mounts pressure on available Bitcoins in circulation, creates reasons why there should be more hodlers and as well, goes about to advertise for more patronage. It’s become a significant event in the history of cryptocurrency, field with expectation and people now bank on this for high returns.",

This has been the trend in the past three halving and I don’t see that changing even though the past bull run increases the price with high percentage, l think this one will not be too high since the volatility rate seems to be reducing. It is not only ETF approval that will incite a bull run Infact the ETF approval will just be like a FOMO causing a mini bull run and nothing much. QuoteThe only argument I still see for strong price increase, is ETF approval leading to BTC being recognized as an official means of payment.Been recognized as an official means of payment means that bitcoin is treated as legal tender, which is wrong. ETF approval doesn’t guarantee that bitcoin will officially become a legal tender, both are two different things. ETF will just drive more adoption although to me it will give government more power towards their quest to censor or centralize the bitcoin.",
