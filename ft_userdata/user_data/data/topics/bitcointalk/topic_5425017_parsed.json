I’m trying to purchase a miner that doesn’t have any complex method to build. I can extend to 2000kwh for a month but with less noise as much as possible so that my neighbor beside my farming house will not be distracted. What’s the estimated time of ROI on your suggested rig?Quote from: FP91G on December 02, 2022, 10:45:41 AMWith this option, I would buy a RX 570 or RX 580 4 GB.

But only sell coins in the next bull market.I preferred Bitcoin because I already loss confidence on Ethereum after the merge. Mining fork coins is gamble for me. I need to ensure the ROI first for my rig cost before I can venture on risky altcoins mining.Quote from: BitMaxz on December 02, 2022, 12:31:44 PMIf you only have 1000kwh per month for Bitcoin mining you can only use S9 miner that consumed around 1400w per hour and around 1000kw in a month.Thank you. I will try to check some of this rig price and specs.",
