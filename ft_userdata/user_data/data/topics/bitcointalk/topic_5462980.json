So, do you think no one ever will mine a block with CPU or smaller devices like Nerdminer in next 10 years? I will be here at 08.01.2034.The ONLY way a BTC block can be mined by CPU/GPU or toys like the nerdminer is if difficulty plummets back to where it was around 2013. That ain't gonna happen unless the value of BTC collapses.To have even a remote chance of finding a block means the miner must process at least 1 share before someone else finds a block. In other words it has to be faster than 1 share every 10 min (on average). At current diff that just   is  not  going  to  happen. Period.",
