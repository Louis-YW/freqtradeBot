Bitcoin is not very easy to understand and there is too much misinformation about it.The 4th truth denies the 3rd truth, and that is the truth. Bitcoin only helps in certain aspects such as saving from 3rd party fees, saving personal data, and supporting cross-border transactions without being bureaucratic.If you mean \"Bitcoin saves the world\" revenue-wise, that's just part of what people believe is wrong in my perspective. Like fiat, bitcoin can't help anyone who is passive. In addition, volatility has two equally sharp blades. If it doesn't save you, it will kill you.",

Bitcoin will probably make a lot of people rich especially for long term holders... againThis is what Bitcoin holders including me are believing that's why many of us are holding Bitcoins and base on history, it seems that it's true. Just look at the charts.Quote from: bitzizzix on August 11, 2022, 03:23:17 AM2. Bitcoin is the future and bitcoin is the medium of exchange because it is widely accepted, portable, shareable, accessible, commensurate and relatively stable. That's why it will be used as future currency.I disagree with this. Bitcoin will not be a medium of exchange but it might be considered as an alternative mode of payment. I don't think that a currency that is scarce and has a limited amount can become a medium of exchange because let's face it, not all people in the world will have access to Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency in general.

I mean elaborate this furthermore .Quote from: bitzizzix on August 11, 2022, 03:23:17 AM4. Bitcoin is not very easy to understand and there is too much misinformation about it.It depends on the person. I myself just learned the most basic parts of Bitcoin and I'm happy with it. I don't want things to be complicated for me that's why I'm just focusing on the basic parts and not on the complex side of it like the technical aspect, programming language, coding etc. but of course you will have an advantage if you know the most complex part of it. In terms of misinformation, that's why many people are falling into scams because these people are teaching the newbies the wrong way. That's why I focused more on watching documentaries instead of going to seminars or events and in fact, I didn't attend any seminars whatsoever and I will not. Documentaries in youtube and the information here in the forum is enough for me.",

Like myself, no one thought me about bitcoin way back 2016 but since I learned that it has many uses that can help our financial system, I always keep updated to the current trend in the crypto space. The reason why there is too much disinformation about bitcoin is because of its continuous rising value over the years. Scammers take advantage of that telling people that it is a get-rich quick scheme.",

I can give you proof about some investor buy bitcoin when price still on $60,000 and one year later bitcoin price drop right now under $24,000. Can you count with how much money losing with bitcoin investment after choosing wrong time for investing? No doubt with many people become rich person in bitcoin but they have been right time when investing with bitcoin, price still drop and they have strong hand keep hold bitcoin and right now with their patience have reach goal and take much profit from bitcoin investment.",

Quote from: bitzizzix on August 11, 2022, 03:23:17 AM2. Bitcoin is the future and bitcoin is the medium of exchange because it is widely accepted, portable, shareable, accessible, commensurate and relatively stable. That's why it will be used as future currency. I kind of agree, and disagree here. I'm not sure if it's the entire future, likely there will always be other currencies floating around, especially now the world has been introduced to cryptocurrencies. I don't know if it's the future for the majority of people, but I know it's the future for me. Unless something crazy goes on, where another altcoin comes out, and massively outclasses Bitcoin, since the popularity of Bitcoin right now, means it'll have some resistance to certain altcoins which marginally improve on it. Quote from: bitzizzix on August 11, 2022, 03:23:17 AM3. Bitcoin can save the world Hmm, probably not. As with everything, the rich will hoard a lot of the Bitcoin, and the poor will be late to the party. Obviously, Bitcoin can increase denominations to make Bitcoin worth using, but the rich elite will always remain the rich elite. Bitcoin does provide a path that isn't typically available to people though, which means they might find some success they otherwise wouldn't. The Blockchain definitely has its uses, and it might make things more comfortable in terms of transparency, but I still don't think it'll save the world as you put it. Quote from: bitzizzix on August 11, 2022, 03:23:17 AM4. Bitcoin is not very easy to understand and there is too much misinformation about it. Myself, and others have always said this is the biggest obstacle Bitcoin has. The complexity means that not everyone is going to understand or be comfortable with using it, even if they like the sound of the freedom it provides. Quote from: bitzizzix on August 11, 2022, 03:23:17 AM5. Bitcoin has spread far, far more than most people know. There are already some of the biggest companies in the world using blockchain technology and some countries actually want to clone bitcoin, because bitcoin is so good.Goes without saying. Anything good in this world, will be replicated a million times. Doesn't mean it's any better though. As we've seen over the years many have tried to become the next Bitcoin, but Bitcoin had everything in place, and basically was implemented at the right time to assure its success. It doesn't have gimmick features, it has features that were carefully thought out, and even though it might have not been implemented perfectly, it has been improved on since.",
