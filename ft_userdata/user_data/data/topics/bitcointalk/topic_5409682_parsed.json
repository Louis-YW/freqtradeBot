What is your driving force,  motivation in promoting 1xbit?, knowing fully well that the casino is blacklisted on Bitcointalk due to numerous complaints and scam accusations that remains unattended to by those in charge of the casino.1.1. Is the money you are being paid, your motivation?Or1.2. Is your lack of ability to join or get accepted in other signature campaigns belonging to more reputable businesses, your motivation in deciding to promote 1xbit?2. As a 1xbit promoter,  are you playing/gambling on 1xbit casino platform?2.1. If \"Yes\" is your answer to the question above ~ then what is your experience like? Please tell us..2.2. If \"No\" is your answer to the question above ~ then why? I myself can not promote what I can not use,  because I have this believe that it is absolutely wrong to ask other people to use something you know within yourself is not good enough for you to use,  it is insincerity to yourself and to those around you.",

      "body": "The answers are straight forward, 1xbit campaign participants can not give you the true answers, but we know the reasons they join 1xbit. Many of the participants in the past are spammers and low quality posters. Psychologically speaking, some people even make use of their alts that have been abandoned to join. It was easy to get accepted in 1xbit campaign because no reputed accounts wants to join, no competition, people that re applying are accepted.Basically they joined for the money.We too in another campaigns joined those campaigns not only because we want to interact with people on Bitcointalk, bitcoin that we are paid is involved, but I noticed that it is not easy to join a signature campaign. We still care about campaign reputation, if the present campaign I am is tagged with negative trust and people are complaining about the gambling site, I will have no option than to leave after red flag, that is what 1xbit participants are not getting correctly. We should not promote scam gambling sites.I was lured for the incentive paid by the campaign when I had no campaign, but I had to wait for a better campaign to come this forum, or joining a reputed one that is already on this forum, but some participants can not wait that long because of the money involved and ease of joining 1xbit. They do not care about the people that are scammed, but care more about the money they are paid.",

We all know for sure that they follow the 1xbit campaign just to earn money, without wanting to know the experience of playing there. Maybe we won't even find the serious posts they made in their post history since joining the 1xbit campaign.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on August 12, 2022, 11:29:28 PMI myself can not promote what I can not use,  because I have this believe that it is absolutely wrong to ask other people to use something you know within yourself is not good enough for you to use,  it is insincerity to yourself and to those around you. This is very important to do, I also before joining Rollbit, first tried to play there and see how big their community is. And it turns out, even when I win big, they will pay for it, about the community, they also have a very active community on Discord.",

This is surprising many do not know this, so we can conclude that they are on a long term campaign because they are not going to buy those accounts if these campaigns are for the short term, I'm surprised how cheap these high-rank accounts were bought, you can easily earn $200 for a month of a campaign on a good campaign, anyway, these are disposable accountsQuoteIf those are not bought then those accounts are merely promoting 1xbit for the pay. EArning BTC still is more appealing than earning bounty tokens.   Those other accounts will not play on 1XBIT because of the reputation issue, they don't want to be the next victim and they cannot complain because they are promoting 1XBIT.",

It's quiet bad seeing people still promoting them. Though it may be for some other reason like, if a user got Reflagged they may decides to join the campaign since no other managers accept them for their campaign so they may decides to rent out their sig space to them and be receiving some payment from the site without minding the effect of promoting the site around the forum. I think basically they are being paid directly to their btc address and is not certain they must used the site, all less their payment is being sent directly to 1xbit site.",

If you're talking about the people outside bitcointalk promoting this casino, then again, it is. Knowing it's a casino, gambling niche rate for promotion is different from other niche, which is much more costly. And even those gambling/casino reviews sites are most probably paid, no one will give an almost 5/5 star review without being paid especially if the casino is a shit like this one. For f*ck sake, i don't know if there are people here still using this casino except for the newbies knowing what kind of service they provide.",

For me, I will surely get the gist first about the site because it would be a shame if I'll be question how's the site and why do I choose to play their, that's just my take for a legitimate casino and by far has few accusations and whatnots. For 1xbit, I doubt if most of the user plays on their site. I think it wouldn't be close to 50% if I'll be asked on how many users who participated on their campaign that plays as well in their casino. They may try but with the payment goes directly on their personal wallets, I really doubt if they happen to play there.",

Some people need it desperately, others just do not care about the damage they cause to the community as long as they earn a few more bucks each week. I for one would have to be extremely desperate to join their campaign.
