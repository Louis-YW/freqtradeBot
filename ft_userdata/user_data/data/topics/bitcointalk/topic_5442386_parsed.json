Unless there's some mechanic to create demand for the token and earning for the platform, it looks like another valueless cash-grab project.",

From the website itself, Id rather stay away and has no fundamental use case for their project. One thing to look for when investing is their product or any worth at all and look on the bigger picture, does it have some useful or very unique utility on their end? Like dbshck said, its token will served as reward. Try to check whether they have some sort of usable feature that will create buyers when this goes to market and reason for them why they should buy this.",

Don't be hypnotized by words like that, because everyone can brag. I'm not going to say it's worth it or not, because investing in a new project isn't just about whether it's worth it or not. Because a very strong mentality is needed here, we need readiness when developers take our money away. Answering whether it is feasible or not, it comes back to us, are we ready for a higher risk, in the sense of losing money?",

Instead of doing something like that, it's better for you to donate your money to a charity. Apart from that they will be doing their token sale on Pinksale, this platform is a platform that has been blacklisted by me for purchasing early tokens. It's enough, mate.

I checked this coin still on pre sale and launchpad at Pinksale, there are depend on your hand looking for how interested or potential with this coins or not. But when joining with launchpad or presale coins on Pinksale need to check how rule adopt with pre sale, will the costumer earn 100% coins or need vesting few percent every month.Second option is not worth because can't guarantee with this project keep exist for long term, if OP excited with this coin need get 100% launchpad coin on Pinksale without vesting yet.",

First of all, as others already said, i don't really see where their tokens is needed or where the demand for the token would be created. That you get free tokens for doing the quiz is a fact that only will devaluate the token even more.Also i see that their are listing Binance as their backers and i am 99% sure, that they are not really backed by Binance at all. Probably they are just using the BNB chain as their blockchain. So to say that Binance is a backer is a very shady move and that alone should be a big red flag to everyone.",

You are right, most of these new projects are scams and it is possible that #QUIZ is one of those projects. We are not sure this time but I was having a doubt about this project and felt the huge risk of investing in this. I'd suggest you to better consider those projects that already have a working product just to assure that it was not a scam rather than spending some amount on something new that is prone to scams. Many AI projects had come out and so we must be careful when choosing them.",

It is good to take a thoughtful and strategic approach when investing in new projects. Here are my personal factors that can give you an insight into investing new project, you can increase your chances of success and make informed decisions about where to put your money. First, before investing in any project, it is important to determine your risk tolerance. If you are willing to take on higher risk for potentially higher returns, then you may be comfortable investing in newer or more experimental projects. However, if you prefer a more conservative approach, you may want to consider established projects that have a track record of success. Because for me, investing in a new project seem to like are gambling your money. I don't know quizbox but if it is new, you should be aware by now of what I suggested above.",

Binance was mostly backing the new project through binancelabs. That means if it's a fake claim. I have marked it as a scam project. Look at that.
