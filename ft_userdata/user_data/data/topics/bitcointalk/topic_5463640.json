If anything, Husk selling his coin is just icing on the cake. Or perhaps it is a panic sell of enormous proportions from his side, due to the Evergrande news? That would be hilarious. Either way, I see a good buying opportunity but I am not quite sure if we will bottom out just yet, so I will wait.Although I do wonder about the dynamics of how exactly the bankruptcy filing of Evergrande pushed the Bitcoin price down. Anyone have an explanation?The last time Evergrande went belly up in 2021 it prompted a selloff in riskier assets from the side of institutional investors. I am guessing this is happening again? I doubt the sell-off will be as large scale this time, since Evergrande was already basically a dead fish in the water.",

Either SpaceX are struggling to fund a new project or their cash flow is weak - or both.well, we have in the previous years, btc crashed so many times, and yet, it goes up again and again. this one will just be one of those hurdles and if you are weak, you may also sell at a loss. but do remember, even one big economy like China can't topple the bitcoin's narrative. and musk is just one entity. so yeah, even if we are seeing that btc is going down, but look at the change, it is not so big deal in my opinion. time to collect more satoshis if you have very good feeling that sooner this will go up again.",

Elon is very harmful for Bitcoin as always. He always supports shitcoins that doesn't have any real value. The article doesn't say when Musk sold his bitcoin. It only says that in the recent filing the company confirmed that they sold. The recent filing wasn't today! They had to sell then report it and then someone wrote an article about the report. Get it? This means that a drop from 31.8k to 30k was possibly them selling, but the crash below 28k wasn't.I'd say these were liquidated longs that caused it. Maybe some Chinese investors were holding bitcoin and seeing a possible crash on Chinese stock market sold everything, including BTC. That caused a long liquidation cascade and here we are. More cheap bitcoin! I'm fine wit that. Wasn't planning to do anything before the halving anyway.",

Thanks for the share up, i wasnt able to read up with the current news or events on the recent dump of Bitcoin which it did really hit up that 25k mark. Lots of sure who got liquidated specially to those who had made out some long position. Good for those who shorted.  Im not really that too impulsive with these kind of situations about those sudden sells that do happen specially into those companies who had bought on earlier years.There's always an specific time that they would really be releasing those bagholds and would really be resulting that devastation in the market but come to think that having that -4k usd in price decline is really just like an ordinary condition or situation here on this space.For those who had been dealing with this market for couple of years wont really get shocked nor get surprised with this sentiment.Good time to bag hold more. Feel sorry for those who had been liquidated. hehe",

That's why I follow that fool so I know what shitcoin I should buy in hopes that he will pump it and then I can profit from it and then buy myself more bitcoin. The insiders are probably making bank right now, especially those that was involve directly with the dump. To all the people asking if it's a good time to buy bitcoin right now, I think this event should be enough as an answer to your question if not then you're probably missing out.",

That's not the reason!Musk as in Spce x didn't sell coins now, it did somewhere in Q2 so that's at least  3 weeks ago and at most 3 months ago!Rather than speculation about Musk this is far more realistic and more correlated with the dump:https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/17/bitcoin-slides-to-283k-after-leveraged-funds-ramp-up-bearish-bets/QuoteAmong the factors behind the selling is a continued surge in global interest rates, particularly in the U.S., where the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 4.42%, its highest level since 2011, according to Bloomberg. The 10-year yield at 4.32 has risen to just a basis point shy of about a 15-year high.That's helped put a damper on not just crypto prices, but risk assets in general.

I'm seeing quite a few users suggesting that it isn't accurate and that it's practically old news. Although even if that happened, I find it doubtful to believe that SpaceX caused such a major crash, as Bitcoin has been losing value in the past one or two days. This major dip today, however, has been the icing on the cake. I do believe, however, that if their coins were actually sold, it would deteriorate an already existing situation, as Bitcoin is currently trending at $26,500, something that I wasn't expecting to see. I'm frustrated if we're about to see a major downfall in the market for the remainder of 2023.",
