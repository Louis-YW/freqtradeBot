  "content": "Hello,I am currently working on a project to assist campaign managers by doing the heavy lifting for them i.e. automatically counting posts and displaying them in an user interface so the manager can easily view the posts, reject posts etc.With my proposed idea campaign managers could easily:Keep track of campaigns & campaign roundsAdd new campaignsStart and end new campaign rounds and manage participantsCount posts automaticallyView participant activity by campaign or roundAccept & reject postsExport data to CSV, Excel etc.I could also add features to automatically count payments to be made etc. The managers could also share links to the website for their campaign participants. The idea is that the amount of repetitive, manual tasks would be minimized and managers could focus on the relevant things i.e. post quality and other campaign goals. With what I have in mind, it could also be easy to make sure participants keep their signatures the entire round.I need opinions of campaign managers regarding features they would need from such a service and if they would benefit from it.",

I have read a similar post, I can't remember if it was by LoyceV to assist campaign management. It is a nice move, but I feel that if the most important task of any campaign manager  i.e checking post quality, cannot be done automatically, the whole idea is not complete. What is the essence of counting posts automatically and the manager will still revisit such posts to check the quality? I cannot speak for campaign managers, they might be in need of this service, especially if it will notify them about a user who removes or swaps signature and avatar.

Meanwhile, I am still skeptical about the service coming at this time we are in battle with AI. Everything could be hijacked both from the managers side and the participants side.I think this topic best fits in service discussion boardThanks for your input. Having managed campaigns myself, it takes time to pull up user profile, going through posts and making a distiction where previous round ended. With this, one could easily check the posts and only the posts for that specific campaign round and then evaluate quality in the same spot. It would all be done in the same spot and there's no need to fill a spreadsheet in the side. Practically, the value is in that it will save time.I hear your thoughts regarding AI but I do not think we are there yet. The problem with AI is that it cannot really think for itself (yet). So, as a campaign manager or participant I would still feel the need to double check the result which takes about as much effort as doing it yourself. The question is whether or not AI can do it, of course it can do it. Question is how well. With that being said, AI is a great assistant for simple tasks.Mods: I do not object to this thread being moved to discussion board.",

However, it kind of got out of hand. I've got a bunch of it figured out and now I'm just working on implementing the backend. The idea is to make it be as little manual labor for myself as possible and as easy for the campaign manager as possible. As such, I could charge quite little and benefit managers by quite a bit.@LoyceV I've also already figured out automatically fetching posts and user profiles so incase you want to collaborate, I'm open for that too.",

At the weeks end they need to count and check quality of each post of each participant.At a push of a button, my service will end the current week, count and put together posts made in that week for each participant. Now, the manager can open my website and check and mark each post accepted or rejected there. At the end, the system will automatically calculate how many posts each person made. Then, another press of a button and output Excel or other format is generated.Easy. No more having multiple tabs of user posts open, no more checking quality separately and marking accepted or denied in a separate excel.That's what I am proposing. With much more possible features.EDIT: Just to clarify, I do not propose that managers don't check quality. I propose that they can do it easier and quicker at one spot for every participant.",

Each manager has their own set of rules for managing campaigns and ensuring post quality, often imposing restrictions on participants. As companies pay managers to maintain a flawless operation, I believe it's the manager's responsibility to put in the necessary effort to ensure campaign quality. Otherwise, companies could manage these campaigns themselves by employing bots like the one you mentioned.",

      "body": "I have managed a few campaigns and based on that experience, let me be honest that it would certainly be a convenient tool as the way you mentioned. Seems like some people have got the idea wrong. I can imagine the frontend and from that point of view, I would use the service.1. I will have users post on the platform. Say, Little Mouse has made 20 posts and here's the list of 20 posts. I will have to check the post and simply accept or deny. After that, your platform will give me total eligible post for Little Mouse. That's quite awesome. I hope I got you correctly.2. The problem is the service fee you will be charging. I have no idea how much other campaign managers charge. According to my charges, I wouldn't spend more than $30/week per campaign. Will it be a good fee for you? I can't speak for others but without having a big budget campaign, I don't think a lot of campaign managers will use the platform.3. This tool is very much convenient for managers like Hhampuz and Royse since they are managing a lot of campaigns. For managing 1/2 campaigns, I don't think it's going to be much helpful. It doesn't make much sense to spend some bucks when you are managing one or two campaigns.Moral of the story, your client will be very much limited. However, if you are going to build it for yourself, that's fine. But if you are only focusing on other managers, I don't think it is worth the time.Off topic- Are you managing any campaign now? Haven't seen you around for a long time.",
