That's true...I keep saying that gold remains a stock in value; since it's not a  digital currency  and can possibly be accessible to the governs alone in some countys, it's value tends to increase in a more dilatory pattern overtime ... it's the utility measures and how melleable it becomes that increases its worth on a single commodity... Otherwise, a gold bar would sell for atleast 1 grand or lesser... Bitcoin?? It's way different....the whole purpose of decentralization was to root-in the volatility, which has made the coin sellable/buyable, and has created an awareness overtime.Quote from: BitcSeo on January 19, 2024, 09:35:16 PMTo them, btc might be a kind of experiments¬† in order to pave way to the main coin.Are you being serious right now?

We must be realistic that all 11 companies that have 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs will need time to build their infrastructures, train their staffs before they can go next with massive marketing, product sales.Approvals are only very first bricks for those companies and Bitcoin to fly.",

One milestone has been beaten, the next is on the way!Competing with Gold is definitely hard, but I think the question is rather what you mean when you say hard. It won't happen within no time. If no other technology is about to pop up that thwarts Bitcoin's future plans, in my opinion it is a question of time. We often say that we live in a digital world, but that doesn't apply equally to everyone. Certainly, the kids and youth from the richer countries do. If I look around in my family circle, the young are fully digital. Some of them know what Bitcoin is, but not how it works for obvious reasons. But the elderly are not yet fully digital and they may never be. But this transformation from an analog to the digital world is not only dependent on hardware and software, but also on the people interacting with it - the human agents so to say. We are seeing a whole new trend with all the digital agents now stepping into our lives. So far most of them have been instructed as to what to do and what not to do, but who knows, maybe soon AI will really be smarter and at least as intuitive as we are. If this whole transformation keeps accelerating and the network of people that trusts technology like Bitcoin keeps expanding, I think the demand for Gold could decrease whereas the demand for a fully digital alternative would increase. So there is something like a natural process involved because older people who store a large part of their wealth in precious metals probably will keep it there until they die. It is understandable as for them this Bitcoin thing is way more mysterious and incomprehensible than Gold and silver. But the younger generations already tend to invest more of their total accumulated wealth in something like Bitcoin. But Gold will be around and it will remain valuable for as long as there is no chemical process that allows for it to synthetically be produced and for as long as there is no other chemical molecule that can fulfill the functions gold fulfills in our society industrial sectors. However, nobody yet knows what Bitcoin has cooking for it. We are still scratching the surface of the use cases that Bitcoin either directly or indirectly enables or initiates.",
