I just want to make sure someone has tried this before I order it.It should work but if it does not work due to hash boards mismatch power/serial number/etc. Then you can flash the control board with BraiinsOS to bypass this issue. Just make sure that you buy a Xilinx control board not a beaglebone control board because this board can't able to flash with Braiins OS(Currently they developing firmware for beaglebone).",

      "body": "Where did you get the unit from the S19XP only came out last summer IIRC and should be under warranty from Bitmain.They may, probably will, make you jump through a ton of things to get it replaced but they usually do come around.The other issue is that if you have a spare board, do you want to put in the time and effort to get this one fixed? I would, just to keep a spare but since as you found out, they do fail....-Dave",

      "body": "If you look at the available firmware for S19 XP, Bitmain currently does not provide one for Beaglebone Control Board. The only available firmware is for xilinx 7007, AMlogic and CV1835 CBs. Since there is no bitmain firmware for Beaglebone CB on S19 XP, you won't be able to run bitmain firmware if you install a beaglebone board. That being said, the lastest version of BraiinOS v23.02 for S19 XP works on beaglebone boards. They meant to support it for xilinx 7007 as well, but this was somehow missed. We are running performance tests with BeagleBone CB on S19XP as you can see here",
