For a project that is heavily integrated into the deep roots of defi, it leaves bitter taste in the mouth of anyone that gets on their blacklist. I guess that if they have controversial issues in the past and they're accused of being too centralized, then perhaps this daily report can be aimed at redeeming their image in the eyes of the public. Despite their true intentions for these publications, so far it'll add value and show their transparency to the public, then it's a welcomed development for me. I like the crypto space because of the numerous options that it has, whether it's cryptocurrencies or exchanges, we have plenty to choose from, so if one is not giving us desired value, all we have to do is switch to another one that can give the change we want.",

It's their own audit and this is not done by a third party and until it's audited via a reliable third party auditing firm we will.not believe in the numbers shared, they can easily manipulate is with these made up numbers which they publish to fool us and to continue gaining our trust that our funds are safe but in reality they will not even have 1/4th of the reserve which they have mentioned and it's a bubble which is gonna burst anytime. Secondly, Why USDT is getting all the hate? It's simple, because it has the most funds out of all the stable coins and when one talks about stable coin Tether is the first thing which comes to their mind and it's obvious that the more people use it more it would get more exposure and it would go through more scrutiny, which they can shut down by allowing an third party audit.",

Tether is a crypto that used to avoid the volatilty and keep the value of your investment stable coz it's peg to the fiat money.You own tether = you own fiat money. There's nothing different.
