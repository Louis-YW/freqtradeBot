However, if this is confirmed real information then the question from the community should be will cousin Elon support his statement and begin accepting bitcoin payments in Tesla again?Tesla also should start buying again hehehe. The Bitcoin network, with its continually increasing hash rate, has seen a corresponding decrease in its emissions intensity, according to recent reports from Bloomberg. Analyst Jamie Coutts explained that this trend is contrary to most other industries and could potentially trigger the next wave of institutional investment. Data cited by Coutts on Monday revealed that the sustainable energy mix for Bitcoin has been steadily rising since 2021 and now exceeds 50%. This increase in sustainable energy use has resulted in a slower growth of emissions relative to the network's expansion. Coutts noted that the evolving relationship between Bitcoin network growth and the global push to transition from fossil fuels could \"catalyze a wave of institutional and even sovereign investment capital.\"Read in full https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoins-sustainable-energy-mix-surpasses-060305672.html",

I guess it's obvious that Elon Musk just used Bitcoin as his clout for his company during our the last bull run. Take advantage of it and then later sells their stash to take over Twitter, now X.And it's not rocket science though, we have our own thread here: by @fillippone, Debunking the \"Bitcoin is an environmental disaster\" argument.And I doubt that this whole sustainable energy mix for bitcoin will be the next narrative for the next bull. It might be the whole \"Bitcoin Spot ETF approvals\" in the future that we might see waves of institutional investor pouring their money in the market. Or even rich oil money from Middle East could also be possible.",

It seems that all these calls on Elon Musk to take a look at Bitcoin mining's energy usage once again and reconsider accepting Bitcoin payment once more for Tesla or even reinvestment on Bitcoin are merely subtle ways of begging, \"come on Elon please, push the price up!\" It might not be about adoption or whatever.There were negative remarks made against Elon just as there were against Buffet and Bill Gates and others who prefer not to shill for Bitcoin. Sometimes, they seem nothing more than bitter attacks against rich personalities whose money won't bring Bitcoin's price higher.",

He will probably buy btc before the mass adoption happens. Actually he probably already has thousands of coins in his personal stash and since he doesn’t have to declare it to the public, we will never know the truth. One way or another, Elon is pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things. If he wants to get piece from the action that’s fine but if he doesn’t, he may duck right off.",

He already knows all the analysis data about bitcoin energy usage for the next 10 years, so when he promises you something it's because he has a plan to make more money for himself!",

And btw, this carbon emissions/sustainable energy fight is one sided...Elon Musk's EVs are the culprits for this knowing very well electricity generation has a Carbon footprint trail and with increased production and use of these vehicles means more damage done to our environment and the man needs to walk the talk.Otherwise, Elon being the type that loves the controversy am pretty sure he will oblige to accept BTC payments with his companies.",

He loves money, what can help Elon making more money, he loves it.Elon is also very chaotic with his mind and he does not care what the crowd talk about him.

Accepting Bitcoin as a payment method has a downside to it due to extreme price volatility and that's a huge risk. Is he ready to accept the risk - that's the question! Let's hope he delivers on his promise! But I don't see this happening anytime soon. It requires a lot of changes in Tesla if they prepare themselves to accept Bitcoin as a payment method.",

This was the very statement made by Elon Musk 2years today about his decision to stopping the use of Bitcoin for an alternative emission free cryptocurrency for buying of his Tesla motors due to the negative effect of fossil fuel used by Bitcoin miners on the environment. So if this news happens to be true that Bitcoin now uses a more cleaner and safer energy source for mining Bitcoin (i.e. use of Solar energy & wind). Then, i see no reason why he @ Elon Musk would decline to accept BTC for the second time, even though he is known to be the godfather of Dogecoin & meme tokens.",

Analyst Jamie Coutts explained that this trend is contrary to most other industries and could potentially trigger the next wave of institutional investment.So it's an analyst expressing his opinion, there is no real data, just claims based on other people's claims!Kind of ironic how everyone can get excited about this when just the other week we had this:A crypto-mining company in Pennsylvania is seeking to burn tires to produce bitcoin, prompting an outcry from residents and environmental groups.If the so-called Bitcoin mining council would really wanted to prove they used 50% renewable they would have done a simple thing, talk bout this this:https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Seven%20Cryptominers%20Responses%20to%20Senator%20Warren.pdfStronghold:QuoteThrough the first three quarters of 2021, Scrubgrass emitted 412,445 tons of CO2 and produced243,068 MWh of power. The final 2021 numbers for Scrubgrass are not yet available. Panther Creekemitted approximately 203,109 tons of CO2 in 2021 and produced 146,783 MWh of power in 2021. Asdiscussed above, we are actively pursuing a variety of mechanisms to mitigate our carbon emission output.Our 2021 emissions data is still preliminary but our final figures will be reported in accordance withregulatory requirements.The cumulative estimated metric tons of CO2 produced by the Facilities to supply this power required for Bitcoin operations is 1,284,360.GreenidgeQuoteIn connection with Requests 1 and 2, the Dresden facility is permitted to emit up to641,878 tons of CO2e on a rolling twelve-month basis.The others didn't want to mention it are claimed they are just busing energy provided by the grid and!So, in a letter addressed to a US Senator, not a single member showed any proof of mining directly with renewables, all the renewable energy comes from the grid, so it would be simply stupid at this point to call an industry greener than another when they are consuming the same thing.Elon is stupid cunt but this greenwashing must also stop!",

He is also a businessman and a good one, he will look into the current scenario before taking any decision. The positive outcome of this news would be that Bitcoin emission is going down and the hash rate is increasing. A piece of positive news now might trigger a short-term bull run before the halving.",
