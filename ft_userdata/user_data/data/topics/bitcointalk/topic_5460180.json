  "content": "Couple of weeks ago I wrote an article on vanity bitcoin addresses and one major argument I read on the comment section was how the address could be mimicked and potentially be used for fraud. This has made me do come up with this article which could either encourage or discourage you from the use of vanity bitcoin addresses depending on your point of view.As Bitcoin adoption grows, individuals are exploring ways to personalize their digital assets. One intriguing method is setting up a vanity Bitcoin address, a unique address that incorporates custom text or patterns. This article delves into the pros and cons of vanity Bitcoin addresses and seeks to determine whether having one is a good idea. Additionally, we will explore a couple of controversial questions surrounding this practice.Pros of Vanity Bitcoin Addresses:Personalization: Vanity addresses allow users to add a touch of personalization to their Bitcoin transactions. By including a custom phrase or pattern, users can create a unique identifier for themselves or their business.Branding: Vanity addresses can be an effective branding tool for individuals or organizations. By incorporating a company name or slogan into the Bitcoin address, users can reinforce their brand identity in the digital realm.Recognition and Memorability: A vanity Bitcoin address with a catchy phrase or recognizable pattern can be more memorable for recipients. This can enhance user engagement and facilitate easier identification of incoming transactions.Cons of Vanity Bitcoin Addresses:Time and Resources: Generating a vanity Bitcoin address is a computationally intensive process that requires substantial computing power and time. The more complex the desired pattern, the longer it takes to generate the address. This process can be resource-consuming and may deter some users.Privacy Concerns: Vanity addresses, by their nature, can reveal a portion of the private key during the generation process. This could potentially expose users to security risks if the process is not handled properly. Caution must be exercised to ensure the private key is adequately protected.Is Having a Vanity Bitcoin Address a Good Idea?The answer to this question ultimately depends on an individual's preferences, priorities, and risk appetite. While vanity Bitcoin addresses offer personalization and branding benefits, they come with potential privacy and resource consumption drawbacks. Users must carefully weigh these factors before deciding whether having a vanity address aligns with their goals.Setting up a vanity Bitcoin address can be an intriguing endeavor, enabling users to personalize their cryptocurrency transactions and enhance brand recognition. However, it is crucial to consider the potential privacy concerns and resource consumption associated with this practice. As with any decision related to cryptocurrencies, thorough research and understanding of the risks involved are essential. Whether having a vanity Bitcoin address is a good idea or not remains a subjective choice, influenced by individual priorities and the value placed on personalization.An answer I simply can't get is....1. Does the desire for a personalized address outweigh the privacy concerns associated with generating a vanity Bitcoin address?2. Is the environmental impact of the computing power required to generate vanity addresses justified for personalization purposes?",

Does the desire for a personalized address outweigh the privacy concerns associated with generating a vanity Bitcoin address?It's simply No from my angle. Bitcoin was not primarily designed for personalization and recognition. On the contrary, was designed for anonymity and privacy. Quote2.

The more complex the desired pattern, the longer it takes to generate the address. This process can be resource-consuming and may deter some users.It depends on how long the characters that you want to customize, the more the characters, the more computational power needed to achieve this in a short time. On computer (CPU), for just 3 characters for uncompressed legacy address, it will take only few minutes like three minutes, while 5 words for segwit will take just some minutes too. But the more characters that you want to customize, the more it will take more time.Quote from: Sinzu_ on July 18, 2023, 08:00:36 AM1. Does the desire for a personalized address outweigh the privacy concerns associated with generating a vanity Bitcoin address?Privacy first. If you are not savvy enough to generate vanity address, do not generate any. Get a reputed open source noncustodial wallet and generate your keys and addresses using the open source wallet.Quote from: Sinzu_ on July 18, 2023, 08:00:36 AM2. Is the environmental impact of the computing power required to generate vanity addresses justified for personalization purposes?When discussing about vanity address generation, there should not be any reason to relate it to environmental impact. Most people are using normal bitcoin address generated on noncustodial wallets. Some people also only use their computer to generate it.",

The more complex the desired pattern, the longer it takes to generate the address. This process can be resource-consuming and may deter some users.It practically takes seconds[1], for most personalization. I remember using my GPU to generate an address that has only lower case IIRC, and even that only took an hour or so.Quote from: Sinzu_ on July 18, 2023, 08:00:36 AMPrivacy Concerns: Vanity addresses, by their nature, can reveal a portion of the private key during the generation process. This could potentially expose users to security risks if the process is not handled properly. Caution must be exercised to ensure the private key is adequately protected.It doesn't. Your vanity address can be generated locally which would expose you to just as much risk as using your wallet to generate an address. Alternatively, if you were to generate it with a third party, you can use split-key generation to keep your keys safe.Quote from: Sinzu_ on July 18, 2023, 08:00:36 AM1. Does the desire for a personalized address outweigh the privacy concerns associated with generating a vanity Bitcoin address?No. Unless you are trying to re-use your address or generating a new vanity address for each transaction, it definitely isn't worth. Besides, vanity addresses can't really be generated in a HD wallet, which negates the benefit of being able to back up using seeds.Quote from: Sinzu_ on July 18, 2023, 08:00:36 AM2. Is the environmental impact of the computing power required to generate vanity addresses justified for personalization purposes?You probably consume more energy gaming than generating vanity addresses.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5322102.msg56510404#msg56510404",

If you generate them yourself, they are completely private. If you use the split-key method, the other party knows one part of the process but that is irrelevant and does not decrease the security at all. It would only be a security risk if someone else generates your entire private key for you, and you should never use such a key or such a service.You also neglected to mention the fact that they encourage address reuse and thereby completely remove any and all privacy. This is their second biggest downside, after imitation addresses.Quote from: Charles-Tim on July 18, 2023, 08:18:04 AMOn computer (CPU), for just 3 characters for uncompressed legacy address, it will take only few minutes like three minutesYour benchmarks are off.

If you generate a private key, create a public key out of it, give the vanity generator only the public key, and tell it to generate another private key its public key that creates the vanity address when the two pubkeys are added together, they will still be able to find the vanity address because they must add the two public keys together, but they will not be able to create private key for that vanity address because it only has its own generated private key and not your own private key which it needs to be able to add it together to get the real private key.",

And instead of spoofing \"1DaveF\" they can just easily spoof \"1PckaE\" and spoof the end of the address the same way. Most people will see the same front and back and might copy the address by mistake.This is why so many people on Ethereum end up sending to the wrong address since their transaction history got hit by the address poisoning attack.

The accuracy of those detectors is still not 100% confirmed because they can detect original text that has been grammar fixed with the help of those AI tools, however they are efficient at detecting many texts which can often be confirmed as AI generated texts. Those tools are getting tough each day and I'm quite sure that the day isn't far when they will detect human generated text as AI generated text, and on that day we will have to find a better solution to detect such texts.
