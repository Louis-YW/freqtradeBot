  "content": "The war Will be expanding becouse people don't care.Ukraine war STARTED many was not care about not interested the middle East war started and now If people still don't care the war will move closer and closer to their homes. The war will expanding so that people who seems to not interested about it will feel the war in their life the hopeless feeling the same that world don't much care.And inflation Will be rapant we are use to with one thing that what ever problem we have we just print money to solve problems but even the Western society getting now to the point when just postone the critical decisions and just solving problems with money it's not solving problems.Nobody of our political leaders dont want to make critical strong moves the hard decisions instead of that they try to delay and wait and If nothing changes they Will just fix all with money.But world getting to point when there will be no easy fix and people who use to watch tv and saying \"well that's just middle East there is always war\" now we getting to point when those who says like that might feel themselfes what means war.People have lost humanity and emphaty and feelings instead of feelings they focus on ratrace to chase money and wealth.But how can you be human when you see and know other people suffering but you tell its normal.And yes war Will expanding only because those whos not touched by war now Will get touched so they can know what means when you Are in the war in the hell in the horor movie and all world watching it and many will \"well nothing special it's just war\" Until people don't get involved to pressure their own goverments to stop Wars then nothing changes for better and wars will be expamding more just because everybody looking them on tv and getting use to with Wars.It's not right to get use to with any Wars but If people do then wars Will move closer to them.",

Wars are serious business and leaders need to know if everyone's up for it and if it's really worth the cost.The sad thing is how many of these leaders are listening to their people? To whom they are listening? to the other world leaders that don't live on the land where they're fighting the war. Why is it too hard for them to realize that they should protect their people and not listen to people that are not even stepping on their lands? It's a complex thing but it boils down to simple fact that it's all about the interest of other country's or world leaders.Quote from: Hispo on October 31, 2023, 10:13:29 AMPeople indeed care, specially those who live close to the zones in conflict.

We all know the casualties that these wars will bring to the innocent people and that's why everyone who's in the border line won't agree to continue these wars because there's no winner on this but everyone is a loser.How many wars are we going to see that these wars are going nowhere but to depopulation and killing more innocent lives that don't deserve to die.",

Wars are serious business and leaders need to know if everyone's up for it and if it's really worth the cost.Going to war is the problem of ego by the leaders of the countries. Today I watched on aljazera the bombing still going on in Gaza by Israel and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu saying seize fire is like surrendering to Gaza and he was blaming Palestine for initiating the first in the first place by bombing them. So that seem like an ego that is leading the leaders to continue to fight even when seize fire has been advocated.People do care about not going to war but those who give final command are the problem. Likewise, there have been series of protect by Russians in dispora for Putin to stop the war against Ukraine but that has not been heeded to, so the people care but the leaders ego don't allow them to stop.",

And then for other people in their countries, they have enough on that is bothering them concerning their own situation, so they choose to focus on that.",

I do think that this kind of perspective could be true because we all know every country is investing billions and trillions in their weapons every year and if there is no war at all then that business will vanish.People should care about other people but in reality, they care about the benefits vs risk so that is why we can see double standards when it comes to war and everything else. As you said there won't be an end to it unless someone took control over all the nations and bring it under one rule cause different leaders will always have different strategies which will not benefit all the sides no matter what.",

I do not believe People don't care, people actually care, moreover no one likes war.The world is advancing as well as human activities too. Sometimes, the activities of one group may tend to interfare with the existence of another group negatively. Where this interference becomes a problem,  peaceful dialogue will set in and where dialogue isn't working,  the next option will be the use of force and aggression to enforce adherence. War will be an option provided the possible benefits to be derived from war outweighs its negative impact.Those who choose to go into war with another group care about the welfare of their people this is why they will go to any length to make sure the rights of their members are not violated and also ensure their members do not live in difficulty, a difficulty caused by another group who has refused to take responsibility.",
