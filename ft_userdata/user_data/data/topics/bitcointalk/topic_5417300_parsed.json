It's not really surprising that this happened to you given how random the game is even if it's a live game. Also, Evolution is known on the gambling industry as one of the top live games provider, and so far similar doubts and thoughts have been raised over the years against them but none had succeeded in proving their suspicions.",

On the video provided they were accusing that the wheel has a Motor, Magnets, or Brakes. We've seen enough accusation even the Wheel of Fortune experienced some accusations. This is not very different to the roulette we play where the two green 0 and 00 makes the odd in favor to the house. I can see Crazy time wheel has more of these.",

I agree that there is the possibility of the game being rigged, though maybe it is not. It is easy to say that it is rigged, however, the accusation is just mere assumption if no hard evidence is presented. Until now I see no proof being shown. Since this is one of my favorite live games, I play a lot of it, from my experience, my win-lose ratio is almost even. Maybe your bets are much riskier than what I am commonly doing. Above all, it's a game of chance, if you're out of luck, you'll get wrecked if you happen to play much that time.",

Think about the odds of your winning before you accused them just you are not hitting a huge jackpot. There still some time that they giving away huge multiplier on there bonuses but of course this is only rare because the chance of having that is very low. Crazy time is pure luck with high volatility. You should bet on 50:50 type of games if you want to win more often.",

This game is very risky if you are betting on tiles that has a low chance of winning like bonuses. Sometimes bonuses only gives small multiplier so it’s not worthy the risk if you want to play this game in your advantage.

I read this article https://www.ltccasino.com/cryptocasino/is-crazy-time-scam/ today and it only increased my doubts and distrust of this popular game. What do you think about it? Please share your knowledge and gaming experience regarding this game.Those videos in your link are really surprising, you should post the links of the best ones here with the timestamp of the weirdest sequences, it would entertain posters at least, and certainly shock many of them.But I'm not really convinced that the game is rigged at the end, mainly because the RTP is already larger than classic casino games actually. So they don't need to take risk of being sent to jail, to earn money with it.If you've lost more money in this game than in other live games, it could be because of the difference of RTP. Besides that the author gives an explanation at the end of the article about why players won't get the same winnings as a slot game with a similar RTP.QuoteIf you’ve been playing mostly Crazy Time up to this point, you might want to consider other casino games, such as Bitcoin slots. Most of them have a higher RTP compared to Crazy Time, while payouts can easily exceed the bet thousands of times. What’s more, players at Crazy Time usually make bigger bets and spread them across multiple areas. But only one segment wins in each round, and bets placed on all other segments lose, which must be taken into account when calculating the final multiplier.On the other hand, in slots, you place one bet per round and can make dozens of spins per minute. This allows you to bet smaller and play more rounds, which ultimately increases the odds of getting a big multiplier.https://www.ltccasino.com/cryptocasino/is-crazy-time-scam/",
