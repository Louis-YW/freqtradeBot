  "content": "Hello. I have seen many people (mainly early bitcoiners) that own keys in the form of paper wallets.Most paper wallet generators provide the user with a private key and an address.For educational purposes I have developed an app in java that generates  paper wallets. I have run it multiple times offline and I have tested it in Bitcoin's testnet. The way I tested it was just sending test money to the address and then recovering the wallet in Electrum, Sparrow and BlueWallet using the private key.Although I am happy with what I have done, I needed to recover my wallet and be connected to the internet. Before sending REAL money to the generated address, I need to verify I can access it using my private key. But how can I do it in a safe and private way? Preferably offline.",

And, I must do it offline.

I ll check it out, but it looks tricky to do it totally offline, since I don't know which tools I must use.",

Electrum, or most of the mainstream wallets that we have should be able to do so just fine.As I've mentioned, if you're able to import the address into a well-known wallet, it should be fine. They are unlikely to allow you to import a private key that cannot be spent. The first one would be the best, if you can do so. It doesn't affect the security nor the privacy of your paper wallet so long as you spend the coins back to yourself.",

You can create a transaction and sign it offline. Regardless, the security of the paper wallet is compromised even if you were to only expose your private key when you're spending. If you want to be safe, you should not expose your private key to a computer that is connected to the internet at any point in time.If you have a synchronized Bitcoin Core instance, you can get the raw transaction and use testmempoolaccept to test if it is valid without broadcasting.",
