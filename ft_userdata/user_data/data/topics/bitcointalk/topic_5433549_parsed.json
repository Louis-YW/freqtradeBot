Welcome if you are new to cryptocurrency.  If you think you have less idea about investment then I suggest you to get better idea about investment first. You will get a good idea about this on various social media. No matter where you invest, if you don't have a good idea about investments, you can face losses by investing. According to many experts, there is a possibility that the Bitcoin market will be very good in 2024. Since the market is very bearish now, if you get some idea about the investment and hold it for a little longer time, then maybe you can get some good profit from this investment in the future.",

We will most likely close this year in the positive, but there doesn't have to be a huge price increase either. Just if we closed at $20 on December 31, there would have been a positive return. OP, do some research on what Bitcoin is and you will see that it is worth HODL for at least one cycle, if not two, although you can take advantage of times like this to buy more and bull market times to make partial sales.",

Although 2023 is also considered a good year to invest as the bitcoin price is still quite low, but it will be good for those who already have good experience and understanding of bitcoin. For you, don't know anything about it, what you are seeing is it's increasing in price, and you want to invest in making a profit, but it's more complex than you see it. Let's say BTC is 17.2k, and you buy from now on, it doesn't increase anymore but drops to 10k, then you will surely panic and sell at a loss immediately.

You chose a very time to enter the market since bitcoin price is far from the all time high and what's even more important, you chose the right cryptocurrency. Many newbies are attracted by various alts, thinking that they are too late to invest in bitcoin now, while in reality they should invest in bitcoin only since they have no idea how market works.Quote from: Bitcoin_people on January 09, 2023, 01:52:55 AMHow should I start investing right now, should I start with a small amount of money or should I start with a lot of money? Its probably the best to start with smaller amount to get yourself familiar with bitcoin, especially how to securely store it which is yet again something that a lot of newbies fail at. Once you get more comfortable to send/receive/store bitcoin, you should proceed with getting bigger amounts, but only if you have some money on the side that you don't need to everyday expenses as you may have to wait for years to profit.",

      "body": "Investing in bitcoins can be a very profitable endeavor if done correctly. In order to maximize your chances of success and minimize the risks, there are certain steps you should take when considering investing in bitcoin for the new year 2023. First of all, thoroughly research everything involved with investing in bitcoin. Bitcoin is still a relatively young asset class and there is significant risk associated with it. Make sure you have a working understanding of the technology, economics, regulations and other important factors surrounding this asset class before diving into an investment strategy. Speak with experts in the field who can provide personal advice tailored to your individual needs and goals as well as identify any potential pitfalls that may arise along the way.Second, carefully consider which type of bitcoin investment best suits your appetite for risk as well as financial resources available at your disposal. You could choose to buy bitcoin directly through an exchange or even engage in speculation by trading futures contracts or other derivatives designed to take advantage of its price movements over time (derivative products such as options and leveraged traded funds may also be considered). Setting up regular purchases through algorithms (also known as 'dollar-cost averaging') is another viable option for those wishing to reduce their overall exposure to risk by spreading out their buying decisions across different times during the year instead of only once or twice per annum like most investors tend do. Thirdly, diversify! Do not put all eggs into one basket! If possible make investments into both fiat currencies such USD/EUR/GBP etc., stocks/bonds/commodities alongside cryptocurrencies so that you have some form of protection against losses that may happen due to volatility present within markets today which could potentially substantially decrease one's wealth overnight so having options outside crypto gives better flexibility more desired optionality overall..  Finally have realistic expectations about returns on investment from bitcoins; many traders tend overestimate expected reward from past successes leading them astray from correct path towards profitability.. It’s important understand no how volatile market conditions can be what implications will this bear long term terms especially given current political landscape around world.. Monitor news reports relevant crypto space regularly gain insights regulatory dynamics tensions between countries various industries using currency making more informed decisions come tax season too since governments now treat cryptocurrency differently than they used prior years thus requiring people who own digital assets prepare accordingly taxes accordingly avoid running any legal troubles future down line!. Overall investing in bitcoins new year 2023 lets us capitalize upon opportunities arising frontier while managing risk properly individuals follow these steps thus allowing them realize maximum returns rightfully deserved gains made",

If you're unsure of that and want something more, well, backed up, copy trading is also a thing. If you're not familiar, the term says it all, you copy the trading strategy of someone else that they provided. It's not a guarantee that it's effective though so do be careful when studying and judging those available ones. As for the money, start with what you can afford to lose, no matter how big or small. It's an investment, a risky one, so only use what you can risk.",
