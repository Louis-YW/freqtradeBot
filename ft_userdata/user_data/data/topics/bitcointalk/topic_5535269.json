I don't know... what's your opinion?I don't think it's a \"showoff by the filthy rich\" since the people sending it are not publicly known in the first place. You have a point though. Those massive amounts would definitely go a long way if actually donated, but I guess every individual does what pleases them with their wealth.I think the same reason why people transfer dust to that address might also be why others transfer massive amounts. Maybe seeing their 2 BTC or whatever amount in the genesis address feels cool to them, but certainly not to everyone. IMO, those massive donations would have gone a long way in terms of donation, but we can't really talk people into what they don't intend to do.",

I don't know... what's your opinion?There's no explanation for such decisions other than the personal desires of the coin owner. There may be those who enjoy seeing the transfer address on BlockGenesis or those who want to thank Satoshi. Often, we're unable to explain everything according to our own logic, so our minds are surprised by things they're not used to thinking about, or things we once thought were unthinkable or pointless. I agree with the post above, which indicated that there's no reason to be surprised by such news because sending dust to BlockGenesis is a million times better than spending it on wars and killing. At the same time, I don't deny that I hope we'll one day get to know these donators and let them offer us their perspective. In any case, whatever their reasons and motives, they are legitimate, and no one has the right to oppose or criticize them in any way that offends their owner.",

Second reason is to get attention/fame/.The third reason is to get profits or to sell their products.",

It's similar to Bitcoin donations to Bitcoin forum years ago, and these donations are appreciated.It's only a burn if Satoshi Nakamoto has discarded his private keys completely. We don't know, we likely won't ever know for sure. I don't expect Satoshi to ever consolidate any coins \"donated\" to blocks they mined in the beginning. I do consider those coins as burned, even when technically they aren't.Donations to this forum are a completely different thing, not comparable to immobilized UTXOs \"on the Genesis block\" or similar.Quote from: hugeblack on March 15, 2025, 04:00:58 AMIt may be a new style of proof of burning.There's no proof in my opinion. You can't prove Satoshi has discarded the private key of the Genesis block.
