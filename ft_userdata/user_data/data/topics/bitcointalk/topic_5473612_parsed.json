  "content": "US MQ-9 Reaper Drone Shot Down by Houthi Rebels.A U.S.A MQ-9 Reaper Drone has been short down by Houthi Rebels of the coast of Yemen. According to the US the MQ-9 Reaper Drone was operating in an international air space when it was short down Houthi Rebels in Yemen. It is not the first time the Houthi Rebels has short down a US MQ-9 Reaper Drone. They did it in 2017 inside the northern territories of Yemen that they control. This time is not clear how far of the coast they shot the MQ-9 drone down. The cost of a Reaper Drone is $30,000,000 apiece and its highest flight altitude is 50,000 feet, endurance is 27 hours in air.Who knows how the US will respond to this incident directly to the Houthi Rebels in Yemen. In the min time, the US conducted an air strike in Eastern Syria they targeted a well-house suspected to be holding weapons for Iran and the aftermath explosions that occurs after the strike shows they really hit something. In recent weeks the US Warship sailing in the Mediterranean Sea has short down several cruise missiles and drones over the red sea these are targeted at Israel by the Houthis Rebels. Israel themselves has short down one in the upper atmosphere. The US has also hit site of Iran backed militia Syria in retaliation for attacks on US bases in Syria and Iraq. Infact since October 17th, 10 days after the Hamas attack in Israel US and Coalition forces has come under attack about 40 times in Syria and Iraq. These are footprints of Iran who will never attack the US or Coalition forces directly because they know their retaliation will be disastrous. These guys play dangerous games with a lot of rhetoricâ€™s.Iranian politicians hold the belief that the utilization of military force by any global superpower against Iran would be ineffective.The shotting down of MQ-9 reaper drone is a form of escalation by the Houthis rebels. Do they secret plans to drag the US in a conflict? Since they claim responsibility for this, are they saying the drone violated their air space and as such is within their right to shot it down. Shotting down a flying object needs precisions and Iran capability through the Houthi rebels to shot down drones and other flying objects should worry many countries around.",

The significance of it is that others have not been capable of successfully shooting down these advanced aircrafts. For example Russia has tried multiple times and failed. The last attempt was with two Su-27 over the Black Sea that couldn't target it despite trying; they ended up dumping fuel on it to cause a crash. The time before that was Russian air defense in Syria trying to shoot at the drone and missing QuoteWho knows how the US will respond to this incident directly to the Houthi Rebels in Yemen. We do know. US will not respond because if they do the next target is not some silly unmanned vehicle worth $32 million. The next target could be their bases or their warships. And we already know what a couple of dozen 4.5 ton ballistic missile with 500 kg warhead (such as Hatim) landing on any of these targets would do QuoteIn the min time, the US conducted an air strike in Eastern Syria they targeted a well-house suspected to be holding weapons for Iran and the aftermath explosions that occurs after the strike shows they really hit something.Their last attack on another supposed Iranian target was a week ago and it turned out their target was two food trucks carrying groceries  The explosion there was huge too which is not because of what they carry but because of the type of missiles they use.We have to wait to see what this target is this time... Although if I had to guess I'd say this time it was actually a weapons storage not because of the explosion but because after this attack the retaliation against US targets was heavy. In less than an hour at least 4 attacks were recorded that were mainly using ballistic missiles such as Al-Aqsa-1 which has a 150 kg warhead. That's compared to before where small suicide drones were being used that barely had 20 kg warheads.QuoteThese are footprints of Iran who will never attack the US or Coalition forces directly because they know their retaliation will be disastrous.I think we know the opposite is true. They didn't dare respond to the \"the largest ballistic missile attack ever against US military\" as CENTCOM puts it, (sattelite image of the aftermath) and that was when US was in a better position in this world, militarily speaking. Today US military is in a much weaker position to even handle a city called Gaza let alone face a super power such as Iran that would start WW3 which would make US mainland the main target.QuoteDo they secret plans to drag the US in a conflict? Since they claim responsibility for this, are they saying the drone violated their air space and as such is within their right to shot it down.They've already made a clear statement. US is already in the conflict in Palestine supporting the genocide committed by the apartheid Zionist regime by supplying weapons and forces. US actions is what's pulling others in the conflict.QuoteShotting down a flying object needs precisions and Iran capability through the Houthi rebels to shot down drones and other flying objects should worry many countries around. Why should it? Only those supporting terrorism and genocide are worried.",
