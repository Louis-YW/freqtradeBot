  "content": "Bitcoin wallets created with the so-called Libbitcoin explorer are very insecure due to a cryptographically poorly implemented random number generator and should be cleared as soon as possible. the Libbitcoin explorer, more commonly known by its abbreviation 'bx', is a handy tool for the command line, with all sorts of functions for Bitcoin key and wallet management. among them is the ability to use the 'bx' seed command to create a supposedly secure new wallet with 12 or 24 recovery words.Libbitcoin explorer is best known for its prominent mention in the technical Bitcoin book 'Mastering Bitcoin' written by author Andreas M. Antonopoulos. an entire article is dedicated to how the tool works and how to use it.David A. Harding, who is busy writing the revised and third edition of this book, sent the following tweet about it today:https://twitter.com/hrdng/status/1689022029142560771under the following link you can find more information about the vulnerability: https://milksad.info/",

      "body": "You should never have used any closed source wallet-- but being open source is not enough.In this case the rng was replaced with an obviously broken toy and no one noticed because the project has no reviewers.Some extra relevant links:https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/pull/559The pull request adding the vulnerability, the lack of review or collaboration is worth noticing. The prior code was already dubious in that AFAIK std::random_device library doesn't promise that the randomness is suitable for cryptography. I believe on common systems where this code was run the old code was not likely to be exploitable, but I wouldn't bet my money on it.https://twitter.com/evoskuil/status/1688657656620167169Developer commentary on this issue. I can't figure out what \"long-documented intended usage\" a seed command that mandates 128-bits of output but never has more than 32-bits of entropy would have.https://archive.is/A7Jn6The documentation the tweet references. I don't know how the 'Pseudorandom seeding' warning there would be distinguishable from warnings against CSPRNGs in favor of dice rolls or whatever, perhaps this is an example of the harm that chicken-little crying about CSPRNGS causes. Nor can I figure out for whose convenience this function would serve except attackers. In any case, this is the only place I found any kind of warning and the warning postdates the mastering bitcoin usage (as well as the change that made the command unconditionally unsafe).https://archive.is/HDe8hCurrent libbitcoin-explorer instructions telling users to use the seed command to generate private keys.https://archive.is/fhm5J#selection-12915.2-12915.10Current libbitcoin-explorer instructions telling users to use the seed command to generate BIP39 seeds (also private keys).https://archive.is/PWLKJCurrent libbitcoin-explorer documentation on randomness noting that bx seed is the ONLY source of randomness available to users in the package, and that all other commands that need randomness require the user to provide it. It also notes that 'bx seed' will not function if less than 128-bits are requested.The private key and bip39 seed usage (above) sure appears to be the \"intended usage\" in their documentation, but the \"bx seed\" function as currently implemented (since 2016) is unambiguously not fit for those purpose.",

Based on my short experience, libbitcoin is one of least friendly full node implementation where i also had difficulty to compile[1] and also prone to corruption[2].[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5329445.msg56770963#msg56770963[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5329445.msg56832879#msg56832879Regarding your second link: It's been years and still version4 (what master branch points to) is still unfinished and hence non-functional. Obelisk has also been discontinued apparently in order to develop libbitcoin-server, and 80% of the libbitcoin repositories are all broken with the message: \"Please use version 3 branch instead\". Last commit to most of these repos was on May 9.So yeah, it seems more and more like vaporware with every passing day.",

So, would it be fair to say that the vulnerability where you could generate a seed using weak and not random enough entropy was there from 2016 at earliest? I am asking because according to the report, the first misuses are believed to have been recorded in May 2023. If it was there for such a long time before someone figured out what they could do with it, it's quite positive that they figured out what was wrong.

With reservations though, because depending on the operating system, there is a chance that even older versions of bx seed are using unsafe random number generators (this is because previously it was using std::random_device which in turn uses the OS random number generator).Apparently, nobody figured out that this new code could be exploited until a few months ago.",
