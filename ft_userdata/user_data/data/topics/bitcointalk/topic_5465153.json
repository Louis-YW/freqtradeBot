I personally consider 1-2% of the fee to be more than a fair price, although I understand that if it is about larger amounts, everyone would like to pay as little as possible - I hope you will find something that will satisfy you.",

I hope you don't expect to get compensation for mixing coins with someone  Now seriously, there were mixers without a fee, but they were mostly short-term actions in the form of some kind of promotion. I think you will spend more time searching than you will save on the fee.Also, by using exchanges, you should pay attention to the current exchange rate, because there you can lose more than that 0.5%.",

In fact, most of them offer the most expensive swaps. And they are all centralized, meaning that even if OP manage to find a cheap swap exchange, they may not send the coin back and scam.By the way, all solutions come with a price and we need to understand that we need to pay in order to get a service.

I know that there might be some mixers that may offer you lower than that fee but I would recommend you to be careful from those mixers unless they already have been online for a good amount of time. The best mixers have their signature campaigns on this forum and I recommend you to go with any of those mixers that are currently promoting their platform on this forum. I would recommend you to go with Mixero as recommended by @Charles-Tim or go with Sinbad as recommended by examplens because both of those are trusted mixers and they have been active on this forum for a long time now. You'll get best quality service with both of those mixers because they have been on market for a long time and they can be trusted without any issues.",

Jam is the front-end to JoinMarket and fee there (which depends on order book and market condition) may be unbelievable low. Look at live order book   to get feelings on how low it may be. Nevertheless the less fee  the longer to wait, as market makers always waiting  for higher fee to provide their liquidity.
