  "content": "The reason why I created this thread was to share my interest on a new Altcoin project named ethax and to get the sentiment of members in the forum about this project. Should the success of this Altcoin persist, I will keep update in this thread over time.For two months, I have been following up with this Altcoin named $ETHAX. On seeing the name similarity for ETH to ETHAX I decide to know More about this project. What I found outEthax (https://ethax.com/) is a licensed & regulated digital asset investment & software development business delivering some of the worlds most advanced products & services. the native token with ticker $Ethax  is built on BSC and was first Launched on the 2nd of May 2022 on PROBIT EXCHANGE and pancake swap with $1.8 starting price. The bear market seem to affect the token but it still had little stability  $0.05 in the past 2 months since Launched, just last month it drop to 0.04 and now currently trading at $0.041. I just felt this project is going to produce the next $Ethereum coin in future because just in 3 months after launch, $ETHAX has been listed in 6 different exchanges + their self exchange ETHAXswap which was live on July 21 2022 (https://www.ethax.io/swap). When Ethereum was launched in 2014, 1 ETH was sold for $0.31  and when ETHAX was launched on May 2nd, 1 ETHAX was sold for $1.8 on the PROBIT EXCHANGE. Features of ethax 1. Ethax is a Licensed & Regulated Digital Asset Services.2. A Secure Digital Asset Machine Learning Trading Platform.3. World-leading technological developments;4. Enhanced virtual asset ETHAX mobile wallet;5. ETHAXswap (DEX) Custodial Decentralised Exchange;6. ETHAX NFT universal marketplace.7. Neural machine learning advancements.Smart user-interfaces.8. Execution of world-class marketing strategies.The ETHAX Token launch on PROBIT and other exchanges, ETHAX Token staking rewards on ethaxswap.(https://ethax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/White-Paper.pdf) (https://ethax.com/newsletter)I know ethax may not fight Ethereum but in a near future I think the token will be worth it.",

I know so well that this two projects doesn't cross path. But that's your sentiment thou, I think I should modify my topic so I don't get a lot of members think it too far from own point of view.",

This looks just like a copy-cat of Ethereum, in the first place, and it can be a \"poor\" copy-cat at that. We have seen so many projects projecting themselves to be the Ethereum or Bitcoin killers but unfortunately they were the ones that got killed in this very competitive yet frauds-filled crypto marketplace. Still, am wishing Ethax the best and may it not be just another shitcoin. Good luck!",

Honestly, the name will make investors feel uncomfortable and have no interest in learning about the project. As soon as I saw the name, I thought that this project was a copy project, the purpose was to confuse investors into thinking it was related to ETH and people will invest because of this fake relevance, not because their project has potential.",

As far as I know about this token, this token is new. And this token is working very well at present. So it's never fair to assume that Ethereum will be like that. Yes, if it thinks about the future, if it works better, then it can be said that it will move towards much better. But it is never possible to say when a project is scam. So you should always keep an eye on the update of the token.And especially if you focus more on the website and the market, the future of this token can be understood.Website: https://ethax.com/Marketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethax/markets/",

The description of the said coin based on Op seems legit and reputable but it has to gain the trust of more investors to build a firm community. Despite all the good things being said about the coin, we shouldn't disregard the fact that some new projects don't survive the bear so we should still be skeptical and mindful before buying it.",
