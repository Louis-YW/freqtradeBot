For example, the first IEO, which was held in this network Mojito Markets, immediately after the start of trading on DEX, fell in price by 70%.

Still reviewing some of the details about this APTOS, itâ€™s getting more interesting so far.",

We will still see if this is going to be for long but I think so, since they've managed to get listed into big exchanges, I guess that's a good start for them, and those that are holding it would want to hold it a little bit longer and see if the price would double.

Those are better but remember that if too many first layer solution is not good at all. Arbitrum and layer zero were also working pretty much the same like artos. I don't know whether these layers have been preparing to launch its token or not. Aptos was getting hyped caused by it has backed by big VC owned by big exchange site, it's not only aptos but any project backed by big VCs will always getting hyped",

As you also mentioned in your post, Aptos has collected around 400 Million $ from big VC's like FTX, Binance and many others. That amount is just way to large for me, because this basically means the big exchanges keep advertising and pushing Aptos and once a certain price level is reached they will start to sell of their tokens with a massive profit and given the fact that they have invested 400 Million $ means they have way to many tokens now to dump.",

It is better to forget about it as it can help you to avoid dead cat bounce traps.Dead cat bounces can be great if you are experienced but more people lose money with dead cat bounces than people who can get profit from it.Aptos is more than risky to invest in, it is my opinion. If you want to invest in cryptocurrency, first choices for you are: Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB. Don't try with new born coins or tokens like Aptos.",

If you have scored Aptos Zero NFT but you did not receive the email to claim the Aptos airdrop maybe you can message them via email airdrop@aptosfoundation.org including a screenshot of the NFT and your wallet address so if you are really eligible to receive the 150 prize Aptos then they will send you a gift.I think it's too early for us to say that Aptos is the killer of Solana maybe we should just wait how far Aptos develops.",

That's the downside of altcoins. Hype does not live long on them, but when people get some profits on altcoins, they start thinking that this will go on forever. In altcoins, the winner is always the one who knows how to stop in time and fix the real profit, not the number of tokens, which can quickly depreciate. Aptos is in high demand right now, and everyone is talking about it. Any product related to Aptos gathers a large audience. I think the hype for Aptos will continue as long as its main catalyst, NFT, is in demand. In other words, Aptos will be highly valued as long as the NFT summer on Aptos continues.",

Seems with several NFTs launching at Aptos network sold without few kinutes after launching and most hype, worried for every one purchase at late time and could loss much money their investing with NFTs, what happen last several years after many people loss their investment on NFT should be learned when joining with new kinds of NFT investment.",
