  "content": "Hello,I bought Sapphire RX 580 Pulse and it worked fine before, after changing the bios it started behaving abnormally. I reverted the bios from the backup I took and it still not working or mining. RX580 seems to be okay and it's in pretty new condition. I am encountering some errors during installation and after, which might help understanding the situation better.   Screenshots: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7a0x25cyrhgdphg/AAAO1uU3nyfG-X2KlMTU6TI2a?dl=0Please let me know if it can be fixed or it's dead ??Thank you for your anticipation!Best Regards,Aqib",

You need the original BIOS of the video card. Perhaps you bought a video card already with a bios flashed for mining or did not update the bios of the video card.Hive OS will not have such problems.Video BIOS Collectionhttps://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/",
