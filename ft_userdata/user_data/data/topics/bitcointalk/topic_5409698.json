As far as I know, most who are into crypto wanted anonymity, unless that country isn't crypto friendly, you really need to go elsewhere. Here in the Philippines, we're more like in the grey area, so, most likely I'll prefer to stay, plus the benefit of cheap cost of living compare to other nations.",

But, you have to move to another nation. Which would you move to and why? I'm especially interested to hear from those living in the USA. From what you say, it is not clear to me whether you would have to move because you have not declared the bitcoin you have and you are looking for a more tax-friendly country where they will not take a significant percentage of your profits, or whether it is a simple move, without taking this into account.For me, there would be two important factors to take into account: the place should be safe and have an acceptable climate. Although if you have a lot of profits you could travel from country to country and see which one you like best. If you're a millionaire, if it's just a million, you won't be able to afford much.In my case I am not sure but I think I would choose to travel to several places first, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and some others and then I would see which one I would choose.",

If I have bitcoins and my country is not very friendly to them, but I have a sufficient amount of bitcoins, I will certainly prefer those countries where they will not build barriers for me to own them. As for America, I will not go there, even if they offer me all the conditions for a good life in this country.",
