  "content": "Serious question, where I get different reply from everyone. Personally, I think his vision of Bitcoin is not what Bitcoin has come today.- It has became a centralized market, which is controlled by entities. A single cex or dex can manipulate the price in its favor, meaning dumping the price to aquire more btc in lower prices. (liq hunting) So it has become B2P instead of Satoshi's P2P vision.- Many of it's adapters today don't even use it as a currency or store of value, they use it as a speculative derivative. You can look at this by looking at spot and futures volumes. Adapters pre-2020 know more about Bitcoin's motive, fundementals and mission where after 2020 the market is filled with idiot perma-bulls.- Bitcoin and Bitcoin's price are two different things. According to Satoshi's Vision BTC is meant to be a digital peer to peer currency; not a store of value which contradicts today's investors. BTC's scalebility issues caused people to shift the narrative to a store of value. However, hence BTC is created as limited money, I believe satoshi also believed one day the narrative would be shifted to a store of value case.- To conclude, I believe Bitcoin is in the wrong place today from Satoshi's vision. I'm a satoshi visionaire btw, you could think otherwise and I will respect you. This is just my thoughts.What are your thoughts?",

And after 14years, bitcoin is one of the top preforming assets, it has not lost its vision of decentralization, the community is growing from just a group of people talking about it on the computer over the internet to millions of people adopting it and using it to escape oppressive regimes, for personal economic purposes and all. I think that they would be proud about the speed at which we can now send bitcoin from one wallet to another as compared to the time it took the bitcoin sent during their time to get to another wallet. They would be proud of the many bitcoin security measures in place. They would be proud that individuals in the community are owning the project and speaking about it. There are some other things that they may not be so proud of like too like the saboteurs in the community, who seek to lead us astray with their manipulations and gimmicks.",

You said Bitcoin is centralized over time yeah it is true but still, bitcoin is decentralized as people run their own full nodes and participate in the network and many projects are working to reduce centralization like the lighting network.

We don't know what that person might think about the direction Bitcoin took, but there's a lot to be proud of. Bitcoin is familiar to hundreds of millions of people, it has a huge market capitalization, it is a major policy question in some countries, lots of tech giants dipped their fingers into it over the years. Now, turning to op's specific points:I don't think it's a centralized market where a single exchange can manipulate the price.I think many use Bitcoin precisely as a store of value, although probably less as a currency.Scalability is a tricky part, that's true.So overall, I think it's reasonable to be proud of this invention and the direction it took.",

He is probably still alive and watching Bitcoin while spending most of his secret Bitcoin stash freely. I believe he will give a sign or a hint using the blockchain if he doesn’t like what’s going on to Bitcoin.Bitcoin is controlled by the majority of Bitcoin community. He designed it that way so that there will voting among the community on what to do.

It must succeed or fail, as we still need about 7 years before we reach the first evaluation, and let us remember that it took Apple decades of years to reach the current level.It is not necessary to reach Satoshi's scenario, but it is something that works and there is continuous development, which is the most important thing.",

I will say it will be easy if we have some interviews with Satoshi about BTC. But Whitepaper does that work. And you have pointed out a good point here. But this is not something new in discussion.If Satoshi is still alive (who knows), then I think he would definitely not think that BTC would have gone this far, as according to a factoid about Satoshi:QuoteI'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.This indicates one thing for sure, he was not sure that either BTC would work. But I think BTC works, and if BTC works, then it will grow more, and that's for sure.And you said, BTC and BTC price are two things, and according to Satoshi, it means p2p, but I can say something for sure:Satoshi must not see the taproot, or lighting network coming. And he also does not see ordinals coming. And he also has not seen coming that people will start to use it as a store of value. But the thing is, BTC has performed unexpectedly and made many people rich too. I hope you get my version of the answer.",

Bitcoin that was invented by Satoshi, is not the same as today's Bitcoin. Technically it's same but not how the way people are using it. The reason is Bitcoin itself and it's extreme price movement.

At that time, the monetization technique stemming from Bitcoin market volatility gained popularity due to its sheer simplicity. Everyone is naturally enticed by the prospect of making money effortlessly, without significant effort or physical exertion. You simply buy and then wait for the opportune moment to sell. All of this takes place online, anywhere, and at any time.Admittedly, this deviates from Satoshi's vision, but it is also challenging to avoid because the presence of Bitcoin is exceedingly rare, and demand consistently fluctuates.
