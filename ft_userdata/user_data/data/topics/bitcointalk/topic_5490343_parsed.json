  "content": "After watching this video on social media then I conclude to post it here for other people to take a good look at it and say their mind.Bitcoin is an online currency which can be used for different purposes like buying, selling, trading, investing and you can use it as means of payments on your business.Bitcoin was invested on 2009 and the value of 1 Bitcoin was too low. People that believed on it bought it when it was low price did buy the ones they can. Many people didn't buy Bitcoin because they thought Bitcoin is another Ponzi schemes project.Today Bitcoin is @66k and people are looking for money to buy as much as they can because they have realized that Bitcoin is a legit project and it's almost bull time.However, I commend you all to take some time and watch how this man made a physical bitcoin with gold and it looks exactly like Bitcoin. Question is will the physical bitcoin worth the same rate like the online Bitcoin? or another design?",

Question is will the physical bitcoin worth the same rate like the online Bitcoin? or another design?The physical bitcoin that I know of and which are the physical bitcoin casascius. They are somehow worth more than the price of bitcoin if you sell it physically without tampering with it.It is worth knowing that bitcoin is digitally created. What makes the coin to be recognized as physical is because it has bitcoin private key which its address has been funded with the amount written on the coin.",

It's a digital currency as you said hence it's flaws doesn't permit it to being a like our daily fiat or coin. Perhaps a lot of people have made their physical bitcoin but here in the forum and outside but it can't be considered bitcoin in any way rather it's see as collectables. I could remember someone if I'm correct @cryptoevangelista created a physical bitcoin too it's not been too long ago but he understood the fact that it cannot be a real bitcoin so he made it as a collectable for himself with an encryption of his forum username. So any one can do same but we can it would only have a value for decoration but not a value of bitcoin.",

A physical bitcoin without this embedding is useless.  Physical bitcoins has a hologram feature. Underneath the Hologram it contains the private key so your Bitcoin is actually held at a address and the private key is needed to get the Bitcoin off that address so the private key is affixed to the coin and placed under the Hologram. I couldn't watch the video but if what is in the video doesn't have this feature describe, then it is just a piece of art with no use.",

But they are the entities that get Private Keys at beginning.You must trust that person, that company that they don't redeem your bitcoins later with private key they have.Nightmare with yogg.My Cold Keys Just Got Swiped!

I don't get what point you're trying to deliver to us OP but bitcoin can never be replicated so if by some miracle that someone made a physical bitcoin, it's going to be a fork since the supply of bitcoin is fixed, meaning that it's just another bitcoin copy that's trying to capitalize on bitcoin's fame, that's all there is to it.",

Question is will the physical bitcoin worth the same rate like the online Bitcoin? or another design?OP, the simple answer to your question is that Bitcoin is not a centralized asset and it is not a cryptocurrency that is pegged to any physical asset or property; it's only a digital currency, and I don't think there's any way a physical gold, bras, or diamond-designed coin can be pegged to the value of Bitcoin. Take this discrimination.The price of gold, brass, and diamonds is not the same as the price of one bitcoin. Gold is measured in troy ounces and Bitcoin in SATs. At present, 1 troy ounce of gold is $2,165. With the current price of gold, if someone wants to make a design of a Bitcoin coin right now, he will need about 32.5 troy ounces of gold to make that coin. Secondly, we know that the price of gold doesn't have the same volatility as Bitcoin, so if the price of Bitcoin gets volatile and reaches $80k while the price of gold is not volatile,  the 32.5 gold coin design in Bitcoin shape will not be equivalent to 1 Bitcoin any longer. So, it will be very difficult to make this equation balanced because Bitcoin doesn't have the same volatile level as gold and is not also centralized.",

But if it's just a gold plated coin and designed as Bitcoin, it's more of a commemorative coin and it's far from the actual value of Bitcoin.",

      "body": "As others have already said: It's BTC value is whatever the address  (and private key) that are inscribed on it is loaded with when the coin is bought. Value of the physical material it's made of be it paper, plastic, or metal is what the material itself is worth. Beyond that there may or may not be a 'collectable premium' as well that some idjits may be willing to pay for.Physical coins and yes also paper/plastic bills loaded with x amount of crypto and of course also inscribed with the private key needed to access the crypto have been sold for many many years. Yes, If you bought one in say 2014 that was loaded with 1BTC it probably would have cost just a few hundred dollars. Today that 1BTC is of course worth a helluva lot more.HOWEVER:The main problem with these physical crypto currency is of course the fact the buyer has NO assurance that the maker of said physical coins/bills has not also kept a copy of the private key. It is far too easy for someone to play the long game of issuing them for several months/years then later check the preloaded addresses and using their copies of the keys to empty the addresses that still hold something.",

Because the physical value would be worth whatever is the worth of the material used. If for example you used gold for it then the value would depend on how many ounces of gold was used. Even if it was some cheap material, I don’t understand how bitcoin could be physical. Yes there could be an embedded address but if you were to give that physical coin to someone, how would that reflect on the blockchain? Which just defeats the whole purpose of bitcoin in itself.",

If it were available I could have been able to get more facts and that could have been okay. I will advise you edit and include the link to the video so that people could access it.I was having a thought over this topic after reading through comments and replies and I realised that creating a physical Bitcoin might be too risky and come to talk of it, Satoshi never made mention of creating physical Bitcoin in his white paper and I believe he never intended to do such. Although I understand that as time goes on there would definitely be am attempt to do such but would it be effective? Bitcoin is a digital currency and not a physical one which makes the value more appreciable so therefore mimicking Bitcoin for physical gold would hold no much value because that is not amongst the reasons why it was invented. Bitcoin has already surpassed the value of gold so bringing it down to hold level would make no sense.",

But it is not necessary. OP Physical Bitcoin's value cannot be the same as online Bitcoin because physical Bitcoin requires both gold and the real online Bitcoin. Apart from this, an expert goldsmith will be required to give a gold shape to Bitcoin and label the private key of real Bitcoin on its backside with the help of a QR code.  But all these processes cost more than the online version of Bitcoin.  So I think it will not be a good way to spend extra money. It would be profitable to get more Bitcoin instead.  Physiological terminology means that if something becomes prominent in an industry, then a person considers him an expert in every field. So the online version of Bitcoin is only good, it is not made for physical shape. However, there is insecurity about physical Bitcoin. So it would be better that one thing does not belong to a field, why are you forcibly making it a part, Everything looks good in its own place.",

The only scarcity that would happen wouldn't influence the price of a physical bitcoin to go much higher would be the limit of how many is made, the maximum supply doesn't really dwindle since there's really no way it can't be lost forever.",
