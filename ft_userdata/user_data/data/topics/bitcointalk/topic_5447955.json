  "content": "This question is simple because the answer is unequivocally YES but the answer has complex and deep meaning so let's get on it. Buying or trading bitcoin is an activity that considered as inherently risky. If you engage in that kind of activity you can consider yourself as a risk taker.  Why it is considered as inherently risky? It is because the outcome of buying bitcoion are probable not guaranteed meaning that we are not sure if we can make money. We are simply taking risk when we buy or trade bitcoin BUT it doesn't mean that we are correspondingly accepting the risk of buying bitcoin and that is the PROBLEM.Most of the investors or traders are keep telling that they are taking risk because they bought a bitcoin, they did not accepted that buying bitcoin or trading bitcoin has a non guaranteed outcome. They just making hasty decision without making a plan and also accepting the possible consequences of their decision. Most of the investors and treaders are not yet knowledgeable enough because they have absolutely no concept of what it takes to be a risk taker. The best bitcoin investors and the best bitcoin traders have fully understand what it takes to be a risk taker wherein they learned to accept and embraced the risk.There is a huge pychological gap between assuming that you are a risk taker because you bought bitcoin and fully accepting the risks inherent in each bitcoin that you bought. I created this thread because I see a lot of people who are having negative emotions like regret, hatred, sadness, fear, jelousy and many more emotions just because they lose money after they bought bitcoin. The lesson is the best bitcoin investor and trade doesn't resonate the slightest bit of emotional discomfort because they understand the game and they fully accepted and embrace the risk where they know that buying bitcoin are probable not guaranteed.",

      "body": "Basically, what's called investing or doing business or anything that has a profit orientation must have a risk or have a bad impact if it fails to run it as well as in bitcoin, of course for a bitcoin trader who is mainly a day trader will have a higher risk than a long term investor.The emotion arises because of disappointment with the money received, when you want to really profit in investing in bitcoin, you have to hold on to the bitcoin for the long term, don't use money that you still need in the near term and only use money that you are ready to lose, big losses will occur if you go against the bottom because there will be a panic that will make you sell your bitcoins at a cheap price.4-10 Years is enough time for you to reap decent profits from bitcoin, and I believe that bitcoin always repeats cycles, and I think if I hold onto it long term none of those losses and none of those disappointments.",

The newbies often ask questions before investing but eventually, they bought which means they have checked BTC through the lens hoping to make money when prices spike. The traders are likely the risk taker that has an adrenaline rush addiction since they watch the chart and tries to make money using the BTC capital they have. I am a risk taker I'm sure of that. Holding coins for years without touching them means I took the risk.",

      "body": "Risk perception is an integral part of investing or trading. In some cases, taking risks can lead to higher returns. However, it is important to have a plan and risk assessment before deciding to invest or trade. Risk taking should be based on a careful assessment of your profit potential, possible risks, and risk tolerance. If you take too much risk without a plan to deal with it, or if you don't have the risk tolerance, this can lead to failure and huge losses. A sensible way to take on risk is to spread your investment across multiple sectors, diversifying your investments to minimize your risk. At the same time, you should monitor and evaluate the risks throughout the business or investment process so that sound decisions can be made. In business, you can also apply the principle of risk taking to look for new and expanded opportunities, but also need to assess the dangers that exist in the process. Valuation and risk management are an integral part of risk taking for maximum return in business or investment.",

If I’m going buy bitcoin at different prices and store them in my cold storage then that’s gonna be my holding risk. If I’m going to invest in bitcoin under third party programs like swapping liquidity etc then that would be risk associated with it. In short whenever someone is buying bitcoin for any purpose mentioned above they are taking a risk for sure. The risk is when they lost the coins value OR their real investment value. If they are increasing the profits over the time then they become risk free and win the trade. So from my side yes we are risk takers.",

While we don't always need to delve into the specifics, it's important to understand that taking risks means putting our funds at stake. It's akin to playing a game, where some individuals come out on top, while others suffer losses. As I cannot accurately forecast the direction of prices, I consider myself a risk-taker.",

The main difference between crypto and rest of trading maket is that crypto is very much new and unregulated. So the risk in crypto investment is more then in mature and somewhat regulated investment options like stock maket. But the risk in crypto has its own benefits also, few weeks before bitcoin was trading at 16k and today its at 28k. Those who took risk when bitcoin was 16k are now getting good profit.",

Like, from the start of my journey in trading, I have kept one simple rule in my mind, \"Invest/put only that money which I will not regret on loss\" I teach the importance of this rule to every single person who asks me about trading. Because, trading has become a field of interest for those who have wasted their time in irrelevant activities w.r.t their fields of study and after realizing this fact they tend to learn a few tricks and tips to understand market sentiments over a month by taking courses, and in the end, they are full of optimistic and positive ideas which have been inserted by there teachers.But when these learners step into the field and start to understand the unpredictable nature of the BTC market, they realize there is a \"loss\" too, which we were avoiding discussing. Overall, the one who keeps all the facts of failure and prepares accordingly to deal with it is the real risk taker. And I am one of them. Even recently I taught this rule to my brother and his friend who ere interested in crypto trading so I taught them they there is profit in in but there is loss to and you have to be prepare for it I one simple rule that I follow is (OSWYCBL) Only Spend What You Can Bear to Lose",

It all just vastly differs on how much risk you guys play around with. Some go apeshit and puts all their cards on the table hoping for the best. The middle ground who knows how much his capacity for risk is and is doing his best not to go over or under that risk level, and then there's the chickens who puts little to no part of their investment at risk at all. Basically staking stablecoins lmao. In any case, whatever risk you're taking or how high, you are honorable enough to even take that step and invest in bitcoin, because honestly speaking, at the current phase of the internet, it's a miracle if someone who doesn't know shit about bitcoin turns out to have a positive opinion about it.",
