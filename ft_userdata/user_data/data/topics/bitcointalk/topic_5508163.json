He might be innocent but he might also be after your Bitcoin!https://cointelegraph.com/news/scotland-first-ever-bitcoin-seized-toberlone-robbery-caseQuoteThe court heard last year that three men conducted the home invasion in the town of Blantyre, southeast of Glasgow, and one repeatedly beat a woman at the property with a personalized Toblerone bar and threw her into a bedroom.The victim, who isn’t named for legal reasons, testified that he awoke to find a man standing over him with a machete before he was forced to transfer Bitcoin.The man who beat the woman then made a “throat-slitting gesture” with the bloodied Toblerone bar before all three fled.This thing takes a top place in weird crypto robberies for sure.",

Feature like dures mode on Unstoppable wallet can be helpful.One of the main reasons on why i dont really like on making myself trying to expose that i do engage with crypto even with my siblings or even into my friends. Im not boasting up that i have tons of coins but at least the amount would really be something significant or you could really be able to say that someone could abduct you or something that would be in similar with these kind of wrench situations. This is why its really that important that you should really be mindful on the actions that you are taking because it could potentially put yourself into possible danger or trouble. Its better to make yourself that lowkey so that you would be able to avoidthese dangers and there's no point on boasting up your crypto holdings because we do know that criminals would really be just that lurking in the shadows and just waiting for the right opportunity to strike.So its ideal that you do keep it secret as much as possible and even telling into your friends or family members should be avoided and this could give that peace of mind.",

One previously very modest and seemingly not very wealthy person suddenly began to buy clothes in \"Brioni\" boutiques. The end of the story is quite sad, but many have concluded. If you suddenly become rich (there are many reasons), be more modest. Another case was when a girl met a guy who did not spare money for gifts, but she could not remain silent and took pictures of his property and posted them online. The photos against the background of expensive furniture were appreciated by scammers. The result is a burglary, and it no longer matters whether the guy had bitcoins or he was simply rich.Your tongue can sometimes be your enemy.",

No one needs to know about what you do or what you own, if you have a bunch of cryptocurrencies or a lot of money in the bank, you don't need to make that public, I wouldn't even recommend discussing such things with close ones as well because the era we live in, no one can be trusted. You never know who is a double-faced person who is always around you and you entrust them with your secrets and the second thing that happens is you are getting robbed.So I agree with what others are saying about not showing the world what you have. If you have something, keep it to yourself, use it moderately, and live your life so that it doesn't catch the attention of the evil in society. Some people don't have mercy, they won't even clinch before killing you because they don't value life, all they want are the resources you acquire and they can go to any extent to get that.",

I addition many posts have been made by people of the likes of 1miau about keeping you hodlings more of a secret. Personally I believe the $5 wrench attack is a result of some HODLERS inability to ensure privacy of their funds. Some people get too carried away that they begin to broadcast their potential hodling to people unknowningly to them. Some of these victims are usually just naive and not trying to boast about their hodlings.Quote from: hugeblack on September 03, 2024, 12:51:10 PMIf you had 23.5 Bitcoins (which was worth $144,017), you would spend $10,000 on home insurance, but it would be better to be private, as your friends and community should not know about your Bitcoin wealth.Let's just say this is the perfect warning and example of avoiding the mistake of putting all your investments on a single asset. Of course bitcoin is a nice investment but still that doesn't call for a reason to pump in all you investment into it. Other investment plans like buying a residential property to get some passive income is also a good idea.Let's not forget that the security of every HODLERS coin is their full responsibility.",
