It has proven this with its technology and price. This process will continue as long as Vitalik does not quit the project and they do not face any lawsuits. To see this, we can also support by example that almost every newly released cryptocurrency uses the ethereum network. However, I would advise you not to give investment advice to people in this way.",

If ethereum did a 500% market movement previously,  there is no guarantee that it that will happen again and if unless on the long term basis.",

But if we are talking about long-term investment, ETH is considered as one of the best coins to hold and suitable for such a thing. However, thinking that it grows fast and give us a huge profit, is something you don't need to think of as it is never like that. What is best for this when we are in long-term investment is that we know that it never turns scam, unlike these hyped and new projects.",

We don't know how high it will be but people who think that it's a good investment will buy it. And those that don't think it's not a good one will ignore it.",

I have some ETH already but this current drop doesn't encourage me to buy more but just waited for the next bull season because I realized that having more ETH is not a good idea rather than having more of Bitcoin. Why? Of course, we know that ETH is also a promising coin but considering how it grow and make recovered (very slowly), we can never expect big returns, unlike Bitcoin. A reason why even if it drops, the buying demand is still low.",

Aside from the hype that the ops is trying to get around ethereum,  we can not deny the fact that etheruem is a good coin to hold and considering it current price ethereum a indeed the most suitable to hold after Bitcoin,  but the present market crisis is giving a lot of concern to many of us and making us to rethink whether or not to buy more of those potential coins since we don't know the direction the market is going to take in the next coming days since the market is full of surprises. But if you have to hold for the long term Ethereum'ss current price is the best-discounted price to buy more of the coin for long-term usage.",

Also, it wont really be sitting out on rank #2 in the entire market for nothing.If ever they would really be able to solve out that high gas fees then it would really be surely be staying up next to bitcoin for longer years but if not then i wouldnt really be shocked nor get surprisedif ever this one would be overtaken by something new but its unlikely considering about its demand and recognition then it would really be that hard.ETH is a good one and there's rumors about getting x5 for this upcoming bull run.",

There’s no doubt about the success of ETH, you just need to timing your buy so you can have more chance of getting more profit, right now I’m waiting for the real bottom of this bear trend.",

All my altcoins from ERC20 that I claimed and sold for Ethereum were also sold for cash without me thinking about the future. My very mistake and one of my biggest regrets after Bitcoin. All I can do now is just go back to all my records of how much Ethereum I made and wish I could go back to the past.Right now, I am just trying to accumulate as much as I can because like you said Ethereum has more possibility to break records than other new baby coins that are being created in this era. The trust is high for the top altcoin and investors are still buying without any doubts. As long as the demand is high even with their high transaction fees, it can become an asset that won't be sold for a long time. The only question is when but I am willing to wait for what the future brings.",

Is that really the only reason for it to moon? How about the fundamentals of it and why those other coins useless? Because they didn't moon.I see this kind of low effort meme-like \"technical analysis\" as a worthless angle when we could list actual use case reasons for it to moon. And compare it to other coins as well in some other way then saying they are \"useless\"",

But if this means overtaking the position to Bitcoin, I highly doubt. Bitcoin is the largest crypto in most aspects. One moves, other one follows. Also, I won't suggest putting all of your fund in one bucket, diversification would be more advisable. You may also try other altcoins which you think have potential. The point of diversification is to save you from risk 'coz it would be all or nothing by choosing to invest only in one token. Some tokens moves in a different manner which could give you profit than to risk it all into one.",

Ethereum is a great utility token built with robust attributes especially in the Defi sector. Yes, I will say Ethereum have good potential to grow in the future especially with its unique DeFi and Smart contract initiative that have impacted the crypto space in recent times. However, just as every other investment, it is still wise to thread with caution in the crypto space, and only invest what you can afford to loose. We all remember what happened to UST, so invest wisely. Remember not to put all your eggs in one basket.",

That being said, for me personally, the current price of Ethereum is not really that attractive for me to really buy into it yet. As you already said, only 3 or 4 years ago or so Ethereum was even below 100$ per coin for a short period of time and it even lost his second place in the marketcap ranking to XRP if i remember correctly for a while.So to buy an asset now for 1600 $ that was below 100$ a few years ago is still not really tempting to me.",

And investing with ETH at different stages we can look at the story that I mentioned, I know the information problem makes us scared and nostalgic about investing in crypto, but to be more honest the volatility of this market is based mainly on news, in the face of bad news new buyers and losers will panic, but having experienced at least one bull cycle in this market automatically people will have a more pleasant view. With ETH I understand that the bigger the market is, the more its value will increase, so over time, its position has been evident over the years, altcoin competition can't beat the position. This.",
