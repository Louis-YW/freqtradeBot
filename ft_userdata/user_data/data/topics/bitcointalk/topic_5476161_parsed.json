Will they do it though, I am sceptical. The last I saw, the US was selling large amounts of Bitcoin that they had stolen confiscated from Silk Road & other illegal schemes.",

But if they print a lot of dollars, for sure, when there is too much, they will have problems because the value of the US dollar may fall when that happens. You get what it means.The more they print money, the circulation of their supply of dollars will obviously increase, and this will lead to the problem of inflation. When this happens, the goods in the market will not be able to increase again, and there will be great pain and problems. It's back to the people.",

      "body": "So you are telling them to get rid of the power of being able to print money whenever they want? I mean if they print money and buy bitcoins with it, that means they will have a limited source of bitcoin, they can't buy it all, which means that they will have a finite amount, whereas the dollar printing has absolutely no limit, they printed like %50 of all dollars in the last 5 years, isn't that the power they need?I mean it looks like inflation and terrible but they are still doing better than most, their parity against other currencies of the world is still quite strong and even after printing that much they are still not losing any economical power. So, they know what they are doing when they print. If they printed a lot and inflation ruined them and they did terrible then I would say that was a bad idea, but they print and still keep their power which means that they did had the leeway to print that much and doing fine with it as well.",

Why don't you guys talk about what will happen when the price of bitcoin goes down? Don't you see that other commodities and stocks goes down in value and the government are always helpless on how to recover them, when bitcoin goes down, the economy will be in big trouble because the volatility will bring them Bach to worst era they are trying to avoid for the past 170 years.Bitcoin is a great asset I really believe in butnits very constrain to some adoption because it's decentralized which is very great but the government don't like anything they can't control, they don't want to invest into asset that will be threaten by external country.QuoteSame time fed can print and only small fraction of this printed money goes to people or economy most of the funds must go to the btc and btc will be accepted as form of payment to settle payments.

Why would the U.S. raise some bitcoin that it does not \"produce\", thus raising the stocks of countries where bitcoin is generated or accumulated in large volumes ?  The dollar is demanded by the whole world, and in fact any amount of dollars will be absorbed by the WORLD economy without problems. At the same time, the U.S. will quietly, and only for its own benefit, print more dollars, as much as they need. At the same time, bitcoin reserves are limited, and bitcoin has no concept of an additional mission, which means that it will not be easy to cover any needs.Bitcoin does not provide any advantages for the economy, and every country has the interests of its budget and a CONTROLLED (CENTRALIZED) financial system in the first place....",

If a nuke war happens and all major countries evaporate, we will elect you as the president of the world and you will then implement this rule of restricting fiat for export/import businesses. Because otherwise I don't see it happening and even if it's happening, I don't see it solving the inflation issue. It needs a completely new world order.",

Unless they control the market in the country which I think is already happening. They already have control of Coinbase through the stock shared with BlackRock and other institutions and then Binance.us where CZ recently paid billions to US authorities. I think they could back the USD by Bitcoin but the issue would be China and Russia are also ahead of their time and they also have a huge BTC market. China alone has Hong Kong prepared to capture the crypto market. Interestingly when Blackrock applied for BTC ETF, China was also leaping to reopen crypto in China.",

That is not something that bitcoin can cover.Besides, the whole point of printing money out of thin air is to not have to spend money! If they want to acquire bitcoin they would have to first spend a lot of money and then have a restricted budget that they can no longer surpass.
