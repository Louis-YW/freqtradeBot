  "content": "Hello,I'm looking to buy crypto (USDT, USDC, TUSD, DAI, EURT) with Payoneer, 10k+. I'd prefer a 1:1 rate but I'm willing to pay a premium as long as it's not some crazy percentage. Deal will be done through escrow, in this case using localcoinswap (link can be found in my signature). I'd like to keep all communications on the forum but since I can't be here all day, you can PM me your Telegram.PS, no sending first, no sending second, ESCROW ONLY! Don't waste my time if you're not going to use escrow.",

Usually Payoneer to Payoneer transfers aren't as bad as when you received from outside their ecosystem so it is only in rare cases when the above happen.I know I can withdraw and so on but that would take over a week for me, I am looking for something that's faster.",
