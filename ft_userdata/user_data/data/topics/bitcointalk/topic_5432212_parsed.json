It then got me wondering how this could potentially be bad for bitcoin wallets, specifically NFC storage. Thoughts?  The webpage actually tells you to what extent this device supports NFC.Quote from: https://flipperzero.one/allowing you to interact with NFC-enabled devices — read, write and emulate HF tagsSince hardware wallets using NFC absolutely should not be 'HF tags', but rather employ a more complex protocol between host device software and hardware wallet, such as a challenge-response protocol, it should be pretty difficult to hack them.In any way; since you asked whether 'this could potentially be bad for Bitcoin wallets': making an NFC reader accessible & fun to use is always going to be a good thing for Bitcoin wallets. You never want to rely on your technology being hard to access as a means of security.Another example: someone using USB for data transfer shouldn't rely on USB sniffers being uncommon & expensive as a means of security. Someone using Bluetooth for communication should not rely on frequency hopping and a wide frequency band and hope nobody will intercept the communication.Always assume that someone has the hardware required and build your system around that.In this case: NFC tag sniffers and 'emulators' have been around (even for cheap) for a long time. If you have a look on Amazon or AliExpress, you should find them as 'NFC duplicator', 'NFC reader writer' and similar for very cheap. What's in Flipper Zero is not really anything more, from what I can tell.",

There is a difference between using NFC and being an NFC tag; the latter is a subset of the former.An NFC tag for instance will typically return static information, meanwhile a more sophisticated device might want to transmit PSBTs and potentially even perform a key agreement step with symmetric encryption afterwards. I have no idea whether e.g. ColdCard does all of this, but it would be possible and make sniffing / copying a hardware wallet a whole lot harder.Your main attack scenario in that case would be NFC tunnelling; something that Flipper Zero is not really made for.Quote from: dkbit98 on December 29, 2022, 06:43:00 PMIt can even serve as infrared device controller, but I am not sure if it can copy data from QR codes, so this remains safe option in my opinion.To copy QR codes you only need a camera. You can do that with any old smartphone; IR will be of no help here. My only recommendation for QR codes is: make sure to scan your own phone's screen when signing the unsigned PSBT; and not some malicious PSBT off of somewhere else. Just.. you know, don't scan random QR codes with your hardware wallet. I don't think that's too hard.Quote from: dkbit98 on December 29, 2022, 06:43:00 PMI see there is high demand for this devices so it's only matter of time when cheap alternative clone device will appear from China.

The tesla cars all share the same remote to open the charging port at the charging station and literally anyone with a tesla and phone can do this. If you park your car to charge it often it will open other charging doors as well. No crimes committed video was shot in a misleading way to encourage tesla to fix this problem.That goes back to my first sentence in this reply. The charge doors basically are stationary 'tags' of some sort; therefore you can access them all with the same stationary code, on some RF frequency. Also do note that this seems to be done over something other than NFC; possibly 433MHz, 915MHz or some other ISM band, due to the obvious distance between device and car.Quote from: DaveF on December 30, 2022, 08:47:16 PMMakes you wonder how many credit card skimmers were installed by the operators themselves.....Good point!

It is in my opinion the trickiest attack to mitigate; but 'copying an NFC tag' requires your target to be, well, a 'dumb' tag that just transfers a fixed data set whenever it is energized.Quote from: https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/nfc-tag.htmNFC tags are passive, meaning they don't have any power source. Instead, they literally draw power from the device that reads them, thanks to magnetic induction. When a reader gets close enough to a tag, it energizes it and transfer data from that tag.I wouldn't know how to implement an NFC hardware wallet without an actual protocol, that receives an unsigned PSBT (through NFC), decodes it, signs it, encodes it in some way and transmits it back. It has to be some kind of 'active' process. Intercepting and saving one NFC interaction shouldn't reveal any part of the seed, therefore not allow you to sign other PSBTs.More about NFC tags directly 'from the source':Quote from: https://nfc-forum.org/learn/nfc-technology/NFC Forum Tags are contactless memory cards hosting a specially formatted data payload specified as an NDEF record (NFC Data Exchange Format) defined by an NFC Forum Specification.Quote from: dkbit98 on January 01, 2023, 07:35:23 PMI know you need camera, but main thing about QR code data is decoding the signal.You can for example get code from Safepalk wallet but it won't be compatible with any other wallets so you won't know what you have, so not all QR codes are made equal.You mean decoding the data? As far as I can tell, Safepal is the only wallet that encrypts the PSBTs; other wallets transmit them in the clear.Quote from: dkbit98 on January 01, 2023, 07:35:23 PMQuote from: n0nce on December 30, 2022, 11:10:01 PMAgain; they've existed long before Flipper Zero.

You want a set with a bunch of cards and / or keychains and a programmer device. Some programmers are more restrictive and self-contained running off batteries, and others allow you more programmability / control through an Arduino.Here you can see the NFC copying capability of Flipper Zero:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZMU4kPJ_zQYou can actually clone some NFC tags with your phone and the right app:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-uwPh1dgkEYou can also have a look here how people use the old RFID / NFC cloners:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SewclaC8Y4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsZLFqE_iLcAnd here something about the 13.56MHz Arduino modules:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMTPWwRxgQgQuote from: dkbit98 on January 01, 2023, 07:35:23 PMQuote from: n0nce on December 30, 2022, 11:10:01 PMYes, you can do that with the existing NFC readers and some scripting long before Flipper Zero existed.

In any case, the private keys are never exported outside of the chipcard!The firmware running on the card is open-source and available on Github, so you can check in details what is being exchanged and verify that it is secured: https://github.com/Toporin/SatochipApplet We also provide 2 other products based on smartcards: * Satodime (satodime.io): a bitcoin bearer card to store bitcoin like a physical note with the private key stored on the card* SeedKeeper (seedkeeper.io): a backup solution for your seedsThanks for all the info. I would imagine most btc NFC wallets run a similar pattern as you guys? Curious if you know any (you don’t have to mention by name if you don’t want) that are currently available out there that don’t use encryption, and would be vulnerable to tools such a flipper? I think you or someone from your team donated a wallet card to a charity auction I ran a few years back. I don’t see it in your past posts so maybe it was someone else with Satochip ? Either way it was much appreciated!",

We will probably never know about the wallets that are closed-source (unless someone does some reverse engineering research on them). You could have a look at Coinkite's implementation for instance, though: https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware",

It's hard to tell. I don't know that much devices that use NFC, and the only way to know for sure is to review the code (if available) or reverse engineer it (which is more difficult)...Quote from: ChiBitCTy on January 20, 2023, 07:30:02 AMI think you or someone from your team donated a wallet card to a charity auction I ran a few years back.

That was probably Tibu (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=160007) that donated the card, he is much more active on the forum than me! Glad that you liked it :-)",

Thoughts?  I saw this interesting device few months ago, and I have it in my bookmarks but I never managed to write anything about it in forum.This can certainly be used as some kind of  Bitcoin signing device, but there are two problems at the moment for this.First, Flipper Zero is Sold Out currently, and second, price of $169 is way to expensive for me to even consider doing this.I wouldn't consider it is very safe to be used for Bitcoin, since it has antennas, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth, etc.On positive side, it's cool that code is released with open source firmware.Wanna buy mine?",
