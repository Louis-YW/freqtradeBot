It was first 50 BTC. After 210000 blocks, it reduced to 25 BTC and so on. It is 6.25 BTC now and it will reduce to 3.125 in the next halving and so on.The law of demand of a product, is that the higher the demand the higher the price of the product. The law of supply of a product, is that the lower the supply the higher the price. Satoshi made bitcoin total supply to be 21 million. It is not increasing.As people buy more bitcoin with the constantly reducing supply into circulation and total supply of bitcoin of 21 million, the price is increasing. People know this and they buy more bitcoin.",

And those factors are also affected by some other things like the news that spreads quickly through the web.Like what you're seeing today, the price plummeted a lot and that's how that news of Space X's sell off affected the market entirely. There are also other factors but that's the majority as of the moment.",

Bitcoin is decentralized, so there is no way to force anyone to sell or buy it.Accordingly, your question goes deeper, what is the reason for the rise or fall in demand for bitcoin at some points in time, which then affects its rate. And, as mentioned above, there are many such reasons: from the expectation of the arrival and actual entry of large players into the market and, accordingly, the exit of other large players from the market, to the adoption or ban of bitcoin in individual countries. Also, large players can engage in buying or selling bitcoin to stimulate further buying or selling on some informational occasion. And there are many other natural or artificial reasons for increasing demand or supply.But in the end, it still depends on supply and demand.",

Market sentiment occurs automatically without anyone being able to control the increase and decrease in the price of Bitcoin. The negative issues raised in various media also greatly affect supply and demand. As happened today, the price of Bitcoin began to fall due to whales releasing their assets on a large scale. Supply and demand are part of the factors that occur (Negative) and (Positive).",

Bitcoin is very volatile since most of its traders and investors are very sensitive on a little bit of news. This is a double edge sword since Bitcoin price dump hard for a big issue in crypto such as FTX and Luna saga even though Bitcoin is not directly connected to it. While this kind of sensitivity is good too whenever there’s a hype in the market such as the ET application of Blackrock which is not yet effective yet people keeps buying due to the news. Supply and demand is still one of the reason of rise and fall especially if there’s already an established trend in the market. S&D is a constant factor that affects the price changes on any asset.",

Even though bitcoin is decentralized in it operation the my price is still influenced by the whales because the more bitcoin acquired by people, the more the price rise and the more people left, the more it reduce so yes the buying and selling by whales have an influence in it.",

When there is unfavourable news about the sector investors begin to sell off their coins which drags the price down. Unfavorable news like potential hacks, sell off by major investors, country bans, and strict regulation, are all instigators of FUD. But favorable news like bitcoin adoption by nations or big corporations, Bitcoin halving, and flexible policies will lead to higher demand and less selloff. The bottom line is that just like every other good or service if there are more sellers the price will drop, but when there are more buyers than sellers the price goes up.",

The laws of demand and supply are two things that cannot be separated from all forms of products that have a sale value and both are always influenced in any market including bitcoin. Another reason may be that some events occur which may affect global financial stability, market sentiment, Fud news and others. But sometimes the process of decline is not always affected by it, more precisely it is the process of supply and demand that might work bigger in terms of the rise and fall of bitcoin.",

And I've seen in the previous year that the price of Bitcoin is also always affected by bad events and also bad news which can make many people panic.So that factor can also be the cause of the decline and increase in the market for Bitcoin apart from the demand and supply sector which is already the basic influence for anything. I am sure that over time you will also see the effects arising from events and news for Bitcoin so that you yourself will realize that basically there are several factors that can cause a decrease and increase in the price of Bitcoin.",

But behind this three factors are hidden trends that triggers this moves. Take demand for example been that Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset class and highly volatile, there could be draw backs in demand and if the demand falls it will always result in a directly proportional draw back in supply thereby affecting the percentile  change in the quantity demanded.",

The price is formed by the current active supply and demand. It changes all the time. If someone decides to dump hundreds or thousands of their coins, they suddenly increase the supply, if they fill the existing buy orders below the current price, the price will go down. If someone brings a lot of fiat and starts buying BTC from the market - they increased demand and the price goes up.It's hard to predict where the price will go, because you can't predict the actions of thousands or millions of individuals. You can't predict how people will react to certain news or to market events. Sometimes Bitcoin is correlated to other markets, sometiems its not. Sometimes it reacts to global events, sometimes its not. We know that Bitcoin tends to have long-term trends, but those trends might not repeat in the future.",
