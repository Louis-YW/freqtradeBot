  "content": "I have come across many posts here where people in posts and replies say something about who they look up to on bitcointalk platform in the course of engagements with other members in thread conversations and arguments pertaining to a topic raised or area of concern and that has long been on my mind to start something of this nature whereby everyone member would be privileged to say something about their mentors here and maybe their mentor too can reply their post with a remark of how they see their mentee and how they have been following up with them and making sure they are successful and are creating impart on this platform.I believe many people here were reffered to this platform by someone and in the course of going through posts and thread you saw someone's writing pattern which you like or maybe how creative a particular poster is and you decided to follow that person's step here onboard as your mentor. It is possible that everyone here has that particular person they always look up to to developing themselves here and it would be nice we have this opportunity to say something meaningful and remarkable about that person.In other for there to be orderliness and coordination, I would state some steps and guidelines to achieving this here and they are as follows;Write the username of your mentor.Paste their profile link Link to post that first caught your attention to them.You can the write something about your mentor after you have provided the above so that other members can read about it.Note: This thread is not to put anybody in a bad way but to steer up more commitment to this platform and to help build more people in the course of engagements and contributions.I would welcome more ideas to develop this topic further so as to create more impart on this platform through it.  If you feel this is not the right thread for this topic you can say it for directions.Looking for to hearing from you all.",

      "body": "When it comes to mentorship or coach, it is nice one have that particular person or group of persons  possibly in different field they are looking upto to learn more from. It doesn't necessarily mean that one must be close to them or know them in person but the ability to follow their foot steps by applying the same measures that they have used could guide you to achieving  the same or similar results as they have done or you surpassing them as a result of the principles you learnt from them and applying it to your own life and endeavors. There are lots of high ranked members here  whom I have been looking upto although I am still learning and coming up but I will still need  to learn more because there are still things to learn from posts here as every one has their unique ways of writing and information to dish out to the community which they have in stock already and this has kept me  growing  since my coming here. Although I am trying my possible best to be active here and I will continue to make sure I devote my time being here regularly irrespective of the situations i find myself in. Like I have said earlier, there are lots of members here I have come across their posts and profile and I have been able to learn something from them in one way or the other which I am gradually taking the steps to building my capacity here as I  continue my stay on this prestigious platform. I have been taking my time to read most of their posts one after the other while I learn  from them as I engage in other thread and topics. I think I am just testing the microphone. I will mention but just a few of them;JayJuanGeeDdmrDdmr.There are lots of their posts and replies I have read in the course of my stay here and they have been much educative and informing. As a matter of fact, there have some information the are very much educative that i have been able to apply and it worked out. I have no doubt, they are absolute voices and authority that speaks in their field.",

I think there was a similar thread about an user praising his mentors here in the forum but it seems like the post was moved to archival or prolly abandoned since it didn’t receive the kind of replies that the Op sought for. We all have mentors or those that we read some of their replies and it has helped us one way or another but I really don’t see any reason to created a dedicated thread to start praising them, if you ever want to praise them then earn merits so that you can send the Smerit to the thread that helped you rather than mentioning them unnecessarily.",

      "body": "It’s funny you started this topic and still did not tell us who your mentor is. I would have expected you to start with yours. When I first came to the forum, there were many users whose post caught my attention, their writing style and knowledge was intriguing. I don’t have to mention their names, they need no introduction and I’m sure you know most of them by now. I don’t know of any mentorship in bitcointalk, a role model would be more appropriate because a mentor is someone you have some sort of personal relationship with. I doubt that’s highly likely to happen here because of how much members value their privacy, though it is possible to build relationships here especially in local boards. I also do not see the need for a mentor, bitcointalk isn’t as complex as newbies make it seem.

For a long time both of the accounts were in the top 10 for most posts on the forum (which means he posted a damn lot). He was very abrasive toward those he felt were scammers or dishonest and very much a friend to those who encouraged his scambusting activities or engaged in camaraderie. He had an interesting tactic: instead of making use of the trust system at all, he would simply yell at scammers and roast them into oblivion, until they left the forum. He was also one of the only people here I ever conversed with IRL, off-forum. A really cool dude once you got to know him. He spent his final years fiercely protecting Bitcoin yet died penniless... I just found this post as an example at random of his type of humor, and it is somewhat prescient for today, in a thread titled \"Would you accept and Artificial Intelligence as a member of the forum?\":Quote from: Gleb Gamow on June 12, 2018, 05:14:53 AMOkay, I'm gonna reply sans reading the OP, commenting on only the wording of the title.In answering, ONLY if the AI speaketh gooder english.",
