NFT itself is a great revenue generator if you are doing the right way. Which means that at first when it is minted there will be some money coming to you, secondly when we are talking about a great NFT that means people will be moving it around. I will buy, you will sell, this will create a market that is constantly changing hands and that means if you put like even a 1% tax, that could bring you a lot of money depending on how much trading happens.So at the end of the day, you do not even needs tokens or anything else, all you need is all your NFT's to be minted right away, and then constantly traded for a long time which will bring you a steady income.",
