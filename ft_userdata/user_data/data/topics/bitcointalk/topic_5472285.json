All of the keys in the wallet should be encrypted with the same mkey.Note that a wallet contains multiple keys, not just one key. You need to decrypt them all in order to spend all of your funds as each key corresponds to a different address in the wallet.",

What you want is an output something like this:mkey was found @   45016 : 0xafd8mkey offset - 72   44944 : 0xaf90Encrypted mkey: 7784b2306edd18536689f31e0e08f49d02fac009c7298c142c27aaf52a10b984bb578f124cb1ed0 854fe460f16aa9cf4IV: 02fac009c7298c142c27aaf52a10b984CT: bb578f124cb1ed0854fe460f16aa9cf4salt: 1dabf1816b34e175nDerivations: 62719encrypted ckey: e8a4f5010e1ccee267592ec9d488db13ea19985ea5e9bffa5262fd0d39fae0c637c338d4df92a57 76709d489c8f03f34public key    : 02ecfa1b5b5d513c136cd5926308ed949debdcb5e1007f66dc53eef2f1c24775cfpublic address: 14Xe8m1NwHnpcpdqDZV8psTnKQg2NH2Xgrencrypted ckey: c6663ccd1d880386f5bfc4e5049dab541c844ec5a12fcf90d34238636e2af97d9aca5dcb6eaa226 e80483b8adc1e8368public key    : 02ec04626fb4c25314c7b82a7b0fa4ef2867ed3b57bc2558c4bba251485a1d2517public address: 1Jxtg991gSidyd1UMMBM9oE5nR7vCEqCeGand lots more...Given the age of the wallet, you need to check all the uncompressed public addresses to see which one holds the funds. Once you know that, IF you have the password, you decrypt the Mkey and use the result to decrypt the associated ckey which is the 'spend' keyGood luck",
