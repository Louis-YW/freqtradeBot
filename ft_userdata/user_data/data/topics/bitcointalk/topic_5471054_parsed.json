If you added a passphrase to your seed when you first setup the wallet, then you should use that, otherwise, there's really no way to know. If you use your seedphrase with or without the passphrase, you will still be able to generate a wallet.Do you have one of the addresses you used to receive funds? Maybe you could use that, to see if you have it in this wallet you just restored. If not, it means you restored the wrong wallet.",

Does it work? Can you run Electrum on it?By the way, it's better to do wallet recovery on a new computer while you still have access to the old one, just in case something goes wrong, like in this example. But as long as you have saved your seed phrase, you should not have any problems with wallet recovery. I suggest you try again, slowly, step by step. If you can, take screenshots of each step (censor sensitive parts like backup seed phrase, wallet address, etc.) and post them here so we can see. I dont know what the problem is in your case, but it is probably something trivial.",

If the address is different, it means you entered a different seed or you have forgotten the seed passphrase (password after electrum seed).So if the address is correct, and there is no history on your wallet, you just make sure the internet is connected and the wallet is connect to the Electrum server.Quote from: rocnogu on October 20, 2023, 09:18:19 PMIt seems like the wallet location is in C drive.

Should I try with them?Both options aren't available when creating a new wallet.Those will only show during restore (I already have a seed phrase).SLIP39: https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.mdIt's basically multiple seed phrases from your BIP39 seed. It should be provided with enough required shares to be restored.\"BIP39\" checkbox forces BIP39 derivation to the seed phrase which changes the default passphrase from \"electrum+extension\" to \"mnemonic+extension\".But unlike in actual BIP39 wallets, Electrum wont enforce the checksum or wordlist, only displays if it's valid or not; even invalid seed phrase can be restored.So unless did something 'special' during wallet creation like going from \"create a new seed\" (copy) to \"I already have a seed phrase\" to enable the checkbox, you wont have to bother with this option.Note: Some users do that to generate P2SH-SegWit with Electrum.Quote from: rocnogu on October 20, 2023, 02:25:52 PMAny idea what's going on?How old is the wallet file?Do you have a screenshot of the original wallet that shows the wallet type next to the wallet name?",
