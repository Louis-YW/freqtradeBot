In this paper, we conduct a systematicanalysis of the impact of macroeconomic and monetary policy news on Bitcoin’sprice. We model Bitcoin as an asset with no intrinsic value for which its currentprice depends on the discounted value of its future price. In our empirical analysis,we find that Bitcoin is unresponsive to both monetary and macroeconomic news. Inparticular, the result that Bitcoin does not react to monetary news is puzzling as itcasts some doubts on the role of discount rates in pricing Bitcoin. Given the shortsample used in the analysis, however, more evidence is needed to assess the disconnectbetween Bitcoin and macroeconomic fundamentals.\"",

      "body": "Bitcoin market participants, especially the short-term traders, have noticed that Bitcoin wasn't strongly reacting to news that don't directly concern it, so they also don't react to them in the future. The cause and the effect are reinforcing each other. I believe that right now the halvening cycles are the biggest factor for Bitcoin's price, and even years after the halvening the price fluctuation are the ripples of the previous rally and crash. But in 3-4 cycles halvenings will play smaller and smaller role, so maybe in 12-20 years Bitcoin will start having a different price pattern, like actually reacting to macroeconomic events.",

It would be biased if they only analyzed BTC's price descent over the past year, in which case it would look really bad. I doubt they have super high tech crypto people on their team, but I wouldn't see it as a bad thing by itself.",

Some experts argue that this disconnect is due to the unique nature of Bitcoin as a decentralized and unregulated asset, while others believe that more time and data is needed to fully understand the relationship between Bitcoin and macroeconomic factors.It is important to note that this report only used a short sample period and more evidence is needed to fully assess the disconnect between Bitcoin and macroeconomic fundamentals. Further research and analysis is needed to arrive at a definitive solution to this issue.",
