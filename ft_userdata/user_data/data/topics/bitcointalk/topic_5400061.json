  "content": "I ve got scammed 3 years ago; they have stolen 5,6 btc from me. Fake exchange web/MT platform as later seemed out; invested 5,66 btc, with profits (?demo version..) to 10btc: unable to withdraw not even my initial share...nothing; web page gone, email gone, etc. Got kilos of doc and 5 txt that were made on sending them my btc funds... all proof on PM if you encounter suspicious behaviour on names /platform/offshore/experienced trader calls for those names below, I hope not of someones id stolen... Any info, on \"Nathan Levin\" , \"Pavel Zinger\" , \"Ruby Abramson\"; pls; any new info appreciated to find, locate, identify them; as they probably operate uder other offshore company...(Marshall Islands registered) as they could get floppy... Maybe if you have any data on seized digital volumes, web pass, etc to get me some info... Reward follows on full exposure..after Europol compensation. On serious info you wil be contacted (me or officer in charge); on positive outcome, rewarded. I hope for best. Thanks d",

It's likely that they've moved to another domain with a different identity.It is sure there are not real names of scammers, but someone is that name real, and hope scammers did not harm them so much as they are protected from law...but names as characters can be sourced out from suspicious lists, disk drives, private web conversations to link them with fraudsters, etc if IT experts deeps into it...(perhaps someone have some three+ years old data, not deleted, monitored them at that time and is familiar with them to have some additional useful infos to help), as - What it has been on internet, stays on internet, just to look at the right place...I just hope some of the scammers within their life time and most important within ours, wictims lifetime, they would have come to an urge to reconcile with themselwes, to have some peace/clean of their mind/consciousness for themselwes as also from us have some induldence on them...to end in peace for both..to compensate back to us, what had been stolen from us.",

They lie to you about your potential profit, why do you think they left the actual info anywhere? All names which you mention here, IQOption, Longsdale Capital or whatever are just your suspicions and you haven't any proof of that (to be clear, I believe in your words). Unfortunately, we can't provide much help to you, especially not after 3 years. I believe scammers also already forgot about your case.",

Scammers can even hogriding someone's LinkedIn profile to boost their credential.Yes it was 2019, but after reporting to Actionfraud, local Police - Europol later, website was shutdown; but the pattern of this kind, repeat itselfs throught different kind of proroviders names, with same looking sites, even therms of use and policy...never trust this kind...As for credentials, it can be tracked by ip, who downloaded (and took) whos credentials if deep search of expert is done on this job..P.S. I have at that time looked on alexa.com and mxtoolbox.com to find identical servers/time of lease etc to compare it with the web site/newborn of that kind ones...the pattern is there, just to look behind is a task for an IT and authorities that have the power and assets to look into it...and a will for small people victims..",
