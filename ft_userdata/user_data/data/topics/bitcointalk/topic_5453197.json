  "content": "Hello everyone. I don't want to sound pessimistic, but it looks like bitcoins ideas are dying.I spend a week on this forum talking with people about Bitcoin and asking their opinions in threads. And I came to the conclusion that the whole idea of Bitcoin is being killed in front of our eyes. The problem is that most of the people in crypto see Bitcoin as an asset like a stock to invest in and then sell later. No one even thinking about the future of Bitcoin as means of currency. Bitcoin was created NOT as an asset, we use it as one, it was created to solve a banking problem and create money of freedom that can't be faked and printed. And somehow people are literally forgotten about this whole point of Bitcoin. I created a thread asking people what they think bitcoin will stabilize enough to become a currency for people to use and literally everyone said to me that it's an asset and it will never stabilize. And, don't get me wrong, sounds logical and I agree with that. But if we treat Bitcoin like this, why are we waiting for the \"mass adoption\" and want businesses to accept Bitcoin that is not stable in any means to use it as a currency?Another big problem is that everything in crypto spaces becomes centralized. Recently I tried to sell my crypto without KYC and I didn't find any good platforms to do it! Just think about it...nowadays you need to pass KYC to sell crypto without high fees. That's crazy.Almost all platforms and even some wallets require your ID which is the opposite of anonymity. And because of that there are fewer and fewer platforms that offer you services without KYC and therefore because there are not many of them here they hike up their fees to the sky. Add to that the fact that even wallets are not safe. Ledger literally offered people to save their seed phrase in the cloud. The mere fact that they CAN take your seed phrase and upload it somewhere is a reason to never use ledger anymore. So considering all this, it looks like crypto right now is moving to centralization and control over our funds. Bitcoin is just an asset to people and I don't see how everyone can use it as a currency. That's why I think that bitcoin Ideas are dying.",

I don't want to sound pessimistic, but it looks like bitcoins ideas are dying.If the bitcoin protocols does not changes, the blockchain does not go against it consensus and the value of bitcoin does not go to zero worth, then nothing to fear or get scared about.Bitcoin ideas and work done are completely finished products that needs no addition or subtraction frombthe system with the use of blockchain technology, there may be volatility anyway but that doesn't change anything concerning bitcoin being what it is not.Quote from: crypticj on May 18, 2023, 12:30:05 PMit looks like crypto right now is moving to centralization and control over our funds.

We've got a lot of people that are optimistic with Bitcoin's future and if you don't like people owning Bitcoin because they see it as a store of value and will just eventually be sold later on, that's fine. We've got different purposes and desires why we are holding Bitcoin. The idea of Bitcoin being a future payment and currency isn't being removed and gone. You're just noticing that there's a division for those people that likes it as an investment instead of a payment method. But you need to realize that neither of those are being gone, Bitcoin is still being used as payment by many and we're all optimistic of its future. And as for these KYC, it's these companies jurisdiction and responsibility to do it because they're being required by the government. Do not forget that we've got options to opt-in whether you want to use a service or not.",

Meaning I never used one and also never actually needed one. I did KUC only once for an exchange and actually never used it anyway.

There are many talkers here that would find your intelligence on the Bitcoin subject very contributory if you could raise one and the response would be swift.  It depends on what you actually want to know.BTC gaining mass adoption is the strength in numbers philosophy that gives it longevity. It is still decentralized although the government through various agencies are trying to make it centralized so they can monitor it, until that happens the only far cry right now is just KYC. BTC may not make much gain now, but it remains a steady and stable coin surviving various Market volatility, hence why it still tops among the best cryptos to invest in.",

Fiat is fast depreciating and people see bitcoin as a store of value. Initially bitcoin was to give financial freedom to people and to be use for payment beyond boarders. As time goes on investors noticed that it has other great potentials which I will say is more beneficial than just using it as an alternative payment,which is that it is volatile. Investors decided to take advantage of bitcoin volatile nature to use it as an asset to resist inflation and also to make profit. I don't see how this has affected the ideas of bitcoin, because the profit aspect of it was later on discovered by investors.Quote from: crypticj on May 18, 2023, 12:30:05 PMSo considering all this, it looks like crypto right now is moving to centralization and control over our funds.
