Not only does it align with the vision Satoshi had for bitcoin , but..2. Nothing is as sweet as one being free.Giving the government access to my coin through tax or whatever means will only mean one thing, and that is, \"more money for them to loot\", while i who owns the money continue to wallow in hardship caused by un-development and high inflation, i will rather keep control of my Bitcoins than grant government access to it, even if it means that the price of bitcoin will rise and fall, and never go past $30,000 again, a good trader can still make a good living buy and selling bitcoin.",

That first part was a fucking delight to read like why in the hell are you out there looking for used fleshlights lol. Anywho I'll humor your thought experiment (kind of) and give you my answer: I'd choose the latter. Everything that the government puts its finger on dies and shrivels eventually. That happened with real estate, it happened with taxes, and now if bitcoin is to be handled by central government for sure some time in the future its death will be for certain. It doesn't matter if you're fiat-rich or bitcoin-rich anymore, cause wealth is going to be seized by the government to make up for the losses they will incur after just absorbing cryptocurrencies. The latter, while it would stagnate bitcoin's price, is not going to really do anything bad since you can still use it as a payment service that doesn't track you or anything, plus you can easily trade it for other cryptocurrencies with price points that are not as stale as bitcoin for a quick buck. So profit is still not kicked out of the equation or something.",

That doesn't sound unreasonable since the government will control its price and won't let the price rise like that if bitcoin becomes centralized. Looking at how the government controls and manages fiat, it will depreciate over time, not increase over time.In contrast, bitcoin is not controlled by the government, its price is completely dependent on supply and demand, then the possibility of a price increase will be higher, like what is happening now. So your hypothesis won't happen.",

And I'd definitely want to see a lot of the world that the status quo otherwise wouldn't allow me to (those who don't play by the rules I mean).I wouldn't be half mad to be forced to go for Option A though.

If I were in the situation I would ask the genie if he could just make the decision for me and I would accept it completely. But, okay, if the genie won't allow that, perhaps I would just go for the second option. The only problem, to be honest, is that many have invested into Bitcoin. That includes me. Many of us spent money not entirely so that we could use a currency way better than fiat but because there is this mathematical supposition that 21 million coins versus the world's 8 billion people means each coin will rise in price.",

It will surely move up and down, but it won't remain stable.I'm sure that most people will choose the second option. Being free seems way better than being a rich servant of the status quo.",

Both options you offered have limits, very serious limits I should say. Total government control is unacceptable for Bitcoin it kind of defeats the whole idea of Bitcoin, but so is the price limit, because Bitcoin was designed to be deflationary and only be worth more So, what I'd do in this case? Most probably I'd quit Bitcoin, cash out etc. Bitcoin won't be so fun and exciting for me anymore...",

But the consequence of having more is loss of freedom. And financial freedom is better than having all the money. If Bitcoin's price grows but it is highly regulated, it is like having more and owning nothing. Centralization gives the government total access and control over your coin. Just like a savings account in the bank, you can't claim ownership of funds in the bank. The government can decide to enact a law and confiscate all the funds in banks. So I will gladly choose option B that gives me total ownership of my money. I might not have much from my Bitcoin investment, but I own and have full control over my coin. Privacy is a priceless asset. I don't want people to cheaply know how much I own because living a private life has many advantages.",
