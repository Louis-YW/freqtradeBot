  "content": "The Central Bank of Nigeria have amended the policy on cash withdrawal. The CBN bin ealier this month release new policy on cash withdrawal, wey some of the limits be say you no go fit withdraw pass 100k every week for ATM stand and from PoS service, and OTC go be 100k and 500k for individuals and organizations respectively, with charges of 5% and 10% respectively if you decide to withdraw above it.Well that policy has been amended by the CBN after the National Assembly intervene, and Nigerians bin they complain about am, the amended policy now be say:QuoteThe new directive which was communicated through a letter addressed to all banks, and signed on Wednesday by the Director of Banking Supervision, Haruna Mustafa, now allows individuals to withdraw up to N500,000 weekly and organisations, N5 million weeklyThem don increase/raise the limits, so now you as an individual go fit withdraw up to 500k weekly on all channels (ATM stand, PoS service and OTC as well), whilst organizations go fit withdraw 5 million weekly as well. Them also lessen the fee/charge for people wey go wish to withdraw above this limit, the new charge/fee now na:QuoteIn the event of compelling circumstances where cash withdrawal exceeds the limits required for legitimate purposes, such requests will attract a processing fee of 3 percent and 5 percent for individuals and corporate organizations, respectively.But if you wan withdraw above the limit, no be only this charge/fee wey you go pay oh, e get some information/document wey you go submit to the financial institution, these documents/information are:QuoteThe information includes a valid means of identification of the payee (National ID, International Passport, or Driver's License); Bank Verification Number (BVN) of the payee; Tax Identification Number (TIN) of both the payee and the payer; and the approval in writing by the MD/CEO of the financial institution authorising the withdrawal.I think say this amendment they more lenient, and e make sense pass the earlier policy wey them bin release, they even talk say them go make sure say them assist rural and underserved communities in understanding this cashless policy of a thing, as them go carry them for mind for anything wey them they do via this cashless policy matter, see where them talk am:QuoteThe CBN recognizes the vital role that cash plays in supporting underserved and rural communities and will ensure an inclusive approach as it implements the transition to a more cashless society.\"How una see the new amendment, una fit read the tori here for unaselves: https://allafrica.com/stories/202212220014.html & https://leadership.ng/cbn-bows-to-pressure-reviews-cash-withdrawal-policy/",

Taxes is very vital for the sustainability of a country so if government get anyhow dey go use they bill dis business make them implement am and leave the common man. The matter tire me Broz, how we except to be like other country in terms of infrastructural development when almost 80% of the businesses in Nigeria are either not paying g tax or sub charging their tax amount. But the koko with tax invasion in Nigeria which is popular among small/retail businesses and politicians is because Nigeria's tax agency being federal inland revenue (FIRC) is highly corrupt and the staffs are more involved in the corruption, to the extent that government have his own receipt and tax official have their receipt in some places. So the matter of taxation comes to be like the case of robbing Paul to pay Peter e no fit work. Na why we no fit make any progress in that direction be that. Take countries like the United States for example one of the major sources of government funding is via taxation and since the citizens are seeing the result of the tax in the area of provision of social amenities, infrastructural and other government programs that have a direct impact on the citizens which have build motivation in the citizens to prompt compliance reverse is the case here in 9ja because instead of taxes be used in providing more services by the government to generate more taxes the only thing we see is, one government official walking away with billions of Naira taxpayers money, stolen for personals gains. This practice has destroyed Nigeria's tax regime, instead to see infrastructural development what we see is government officials with stomach infrastructure building their stomachs instead of building the Nation.",

The problem i had with the policy was earlier on when the limits were set at 100k (for individuals) and 500k (for organizations) weekly OTC, and 100k weekly at PoS services and ATM stands, i felt that it would greatly affect individuals whom the government have provided nothing for, but have made out things for themselves through running PoS services, it would have ruined their businesses, though this amendment isn't a panacea to that, but it makes things better for them; other than that i don't see anything wrong with the policy, you don't have to withdraw/hold cash to spend it.Having said that, holding your cash in your home is too risky an option, banks are relatively safe for you to keep your funds and if you are struggling to withdraw as much as you want, you can basically pay through mobile transfer or with your ATM card; a better option if you don't want to use the bank would be the Bitcoin network.",
