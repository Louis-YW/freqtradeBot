  "content": "Hello, Around seven-eight years ago I downloaded bitcoin core and had some transactions just to try it out. I saved the wallet.dat file and forgot about it. I recently found the file and is trying to download the blockchain once again but it goes so slow and I dont have the ability to let my computer be on 24/7 for weeks. Also it obviously slows down the computer so I cant work as fast as I am used to. In adition to this, some of the possible solutions to this is rooted in using the command line in the bitcoin core app, witch seeme to be very problematic since I have to wait everywhere from 5 minuts to an hour before the app responds to my actions.  I have research the web for solutions, one of witch is finding my private key and importing it to a wallet such as electrum. I dont know how to do this, and I find it a little scary to trust some of the sources that explains it. The other solutions I have found seeme to revolve around the same principle, but on the other hand it also seeme a little scary for my that is not an bitcoin expert at all. Do you guys have any experience with this? Any solutions (easy or hazzle) that could solve this problem? I would even love some tips on how to download the blockchain faster.Info:Bitcoin Client Software and Version Number: Bitcoin Core 22.0Operating System: Windows 10 64-bitSystem Hardware Specs: Intel Core i3 5005U @ 2.00GHz, connected to external harddrive with 1TB free space.",

This will solve your problem.Electrum is SPV wallet and you don't have to download the blockchain. Electrum is one of the best open-source wallets and is secure. Make sure that you have downloaded it from its official website and do not forget to verify your download.If you want to be completely secure, you should create your electrum wallet on an air-gapped device and sign your transaction there.

Go to help and look for debug window and then go to console tab or you can go to window then console then type this command belowCode:walletpassphrase \"your walletpassphrase here\" 600Make sure you still know the exact password of your wallet.datAnd then send this command to get the private keyCode:dumpprivkey (Bitcoin address you want to export private key)It will show you the private key and then open your Electrum wallet and import/sweep it there.",

Whether punning is enabled or not, it has nothing to do with the keys stored in the wallet and you should be able to export the private keys.",

How to I differanciate between the keys that I want? Yes, the dumpprivkey  command is used for exporting the private key of a single address.Use that command, if you know the address(es) containing bitcoin.If you want to dump all your private keys, use the following command. It will create a text file including all your private keys.Code:dumpwallet XReplace X with your desired directory. For example if you want the private keys to be saved in a text file in drive C with the name of \"walletdump', replace X with C:/walletdump.txtQuote from: theo_dor on September 06, 2022, 01:47:33 PMHow to I differanciate between the keys that I want? You should add your address to the command.

We should have not used this type of wallet, descriptors should have been false when wallet was setup. We moved funds into two addresses on the newly created wallet now we can't get them out.  It is beyond my tech ability mostly and I messed up.  That's the root problem. I understand keeping everything public -- I have done this for years so 100% sold on that. Are there any open source (read: trusted) utilities that will just let me import this wallet.dat file, read what's in it, and give me a private key for all the addresses with funds or let me move them out?",

Then once you have that key, go download electrum wallet from www.electrum.org. Start create standard wallet, then next select use master key then type your key from bitcoin core. Your address should show in view tab im not sure if it support bip32 but well see. Maybe you can find your address you had the money in. If it doesnt work we can try something else.

You can use iancoleman's BIP39 tool; but do not trust, validate it; it's open-source so you can ask someone in your company to audit its code.Link to the source code: https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39In Bitcoin Core:Use the console command that I've suggested with \"true\" flag.Open the menu: \"Window->Console\", select the correct wallet in the console's wallet selection drop-down menuThen use the command: listdescriptors trueTake note of the results, you need to find the correct parent descriptor among the results that can derive the funded address' private key.If your address starts with \"bc1q\" (default), get the descriptor that shows: \"desc\": \"wpkh... and \"internal\": false,.The latter tells that the descriptor is for your receiving addresses and the former shows that the script type is for bc1q addresses.If the address starts with '1', then get \"desc\": \"pkh...; if '3', then \"desc\": \"sh(wpkh... (should be internal false for both).In BIP39 Tool:Open it in your \"Air-Gap\" machine's browser.Paste the descriptor's master private key in the \"BIP39 Root key\" text box (\"xprv...\" do not include the following ' / ' and the rest),scroll down a little and open \"BIP84\" tab (for 'bc1q'  address) / \"BIP44\" tab (for '1'  address) / \"BIP49\" tab (for '3' address)The default derivation paths of those tabs should match to the descriptor's path so the addresses and keys should be listed below the page.You can click \"show ___ More rows\" below the addresses to generate more addresses if it's not included there.Quote from: Bitarock on July 15, 2023, 12:52:04 AM-snip- Start create standard wallet, then next select use master key then type your key from bitcoin core. Your address should show in view tab im not sure if it support bip32 but well see.Electrum will derive the child key of the provided master private key with the derivation path of m/0 (receiving) and m/1 (change) which is different than the descriptor's derivation path.And with that restore option, the user can't select the path Electrum should use.",
