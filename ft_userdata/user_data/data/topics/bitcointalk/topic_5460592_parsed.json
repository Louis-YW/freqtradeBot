  "content": "AbstractMost people use the Internet without thinking about security and privacy, they don't bother about the kind of site they visit, where they download their Applications, movies and other files/ documents, they give every authorisation a software or website request for them without checking them and others. The truth is that the Internet is not as save as we thought it was, as time goes by it becomes worst and most people still don't see the dangers until they become victimised and then they will know indeed that their device is part of their that can hold a large part of their life's. So many security threats online but some of the most common and dangerous is the phishing scam and malware threat, phishing scam can be called as the most dangerous because most of the cybersecurity threat can come from it, through phishing scam malware can be sent to a device and this is among the reason we have to be cautious of the link we clicked online, especially from email, social media and other platforms like this forum.MalwareMalware are code or program that are usually attached to a file or software that disrupts the proper working flow of such device. This is also called malicious software, hackers implant these in order to get access to the victim device and do as he/she feels and can be to steal the victim coins, money, important documents/files or even blackmailing or requesting for ransom from them and others.some types of malware There are various types of malware, This include :Spyware :  This malware makes itself hidden for you on your device, It observe your activity on your device and can send this to the hacker.

In summary, all of these attacks most of times are caught either through been in a hurry or carelessness. The most common way of getting all this is through phishing links or downloading fake apps (most of which are mostly through our carelessness to download cracked versions of them or not verifying the site well).

Most at times when you copy an address and about to paste, it actually pastes something different. In most cases just a digit or two changes and if one is not careful and doesn’t bother to check, you may end up sending funds to a different address. Here are tips by LoyceV on how to  prevent losing your bitcoin from clipboard malwareOverall security tip is; be careful how you use the device that stores your bitcoin. If it is possible that device should be offline until probably you want to broadcast a transaction.",

In most cases just a digit or two changes and if one is not careful and doesn’t bother to check, you may end up sending funds to a different address. Since I learned about this through a post I came across last year on this forum about the clipboard virus, I have always been very careful about checking any address I copy before sending funds out, or even if I am copying  account number, I always check too.Quote from: Amphenomenon on July 21, 2023, 05:55:25 PMI think that the best way to avoid all of this harmful malware is to just be mindful of the sites we visit and not download apps that we are not very sure have a good review or reputation. I also think it's wise to just have two devices, one of which you can use for any form of browsing and texting of apps, and another device where you only browse on verified sites and can also keep sensitive information without much fear about malware. OP, your topic is very informative.",

I would like to mention a thread in which OP said, crypto users have to learn cybersecurity in order to stay safe here on BTT. (Source) But i think if the people came to know about only mentioned types here in this topics and the new types of scams in market. Which are in the following thread,Have you ever been scammed ?Then, we all can save ourselves from all type of scams which are already happened. So, basic purpose is to remain up to date with current and old scam and hack types when you will be aware of them you will save yourself from them too. the process is easy and we dont even have to learn the cybersecurity.",

      "body": "Here are some key tips for protecting against malware and improving security:1. Use antivirus/anti-malware software - Install programs like Malwarebytes, Windows Defender, or Bitdefender to scan for and remove malicious programs. Keep them updated with the latest definitions.2. Exercise caution with links/attachments - Don't open links or files from suspicious emails or questionable websites. Verify the source first before clicking or downloading anything.  3. Keep all software updated - Run regular system updates on your OS, applications, browsers, plugins and hardware firmware. Updates often patch security flaws.4. Use strong passwords/passphrases - Create long, complex and unique passwords for every account. Use a password manager if needed. Enable two-factor authentication when possible.5. Back up your data - Use cloud backups or external drives to create regular copies of important data in case of infection. Test restorations periodically.6. Avoid suspicious websites - Stick to well-known legitimate websites instead of sites with lots of intrusive ads or popups. These sites tend to distribute malware.7. Don't override security prompts - Pay attention when your browser or OS warns about unsafe conditions or requests elevated permissions. Malware often lurks behind these.  8. Monitor accounts for unusual activity - Keep an eye out for unauthorized charges, password reset emails, strange posts, etc. Report anything suspicious.  Staying safe requires proactive security habits. The threat landscape continues evolving so our defenses have to keep pace. But with thoughtful precautions, malware and intrusions can be minimized.",

Whenever you visit them, they can identify you. A VPN connection hides your IP address, which allows you to maintain anonymity on the Internet. In order to protect your presence on websites, you should connect NordVPN for additional protection against malware, dangerous advertising, sites and trackers without the need to install an antivirus program.That's true and that's why there are cookies. But if you've been a regular user of a website, and you think that you trust them, you either think if it's necessary to have it or not.Aside from NordVPN, there's also the ProtonVPN.Most of the free VPNs aren't safe and they're just recycling the IPs there and there is no IP that's only dedicated to you and that's the premium with the paid ones.",

It has become such an integral part of our life that it is almost second nature. But in reality, the internet is such a dangerous place and thus we must take extra steps in order to make sure that we are safe.",
