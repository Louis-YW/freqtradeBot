When learning trading, it is so easy seeing everything in hindsight; it is when reality dawns on you that you realise you did not really grasp the concept of apply it correctly. I will never recommend trading for a newbie rather I will encourage them to buy and hold Bitcoin as that I see as the best way to make something magnificent from Bitcoin.",

Obviously, it seems that you still lack the experience even if you says that you have gone a lot to learn and analyze.There is a dedicated thread here, Trading Discussion, maybe that is where the best place that you can start.Or if you doesn't want to complicate things on your end to become a trader, maybe what you can do is just simply buy and hold for a long term. So just think about it, at least there is an option for you and you won't go and be stress like every day trying to squeeze and make some profits every day trading.",

It will be so easy for you to invest in Bitcoin rather than to trade it. However, I am not a Bitcoin trader. I am just an investor that is applying the DCA strategy so I can accumulate more Bitcoin, and my accumulating process is going so well for me because I am not being affected.So I am trying to say that one of the best ways for you not to lose your money in crypto currency, you just have to invest in it with the little capital you can afford to lose, then use the DCA method to accumulate more Bitcoin and you hold it for dear life, although ways, profits are not guaranteed, but it is one of the best way to invest and accumulate Bitcoin.",

Losing is part of trading so expect that in every trade you made, there will always be inevitable losses that you will surely incur. However, with your current position as a trader, I can't say that trading with less knowledge and experience will be a good decision to trade. You are not supposed to be trading in the market because you're not even capable yet, the moment you decide to trade, the risk even becomes higher that made you lose your capital while trading.This is not only happening to you but to all the newbies who decide to quickly enter trading believing that it could be easy for them to make profits. But in reality, there will be more possible losses than gains when newbies decide to trade, simply because they don't have enough skills and strategies that will make them protected against the risk of losing.",

Trading is certainly hard most especially for newbies that don't  have enough experiences in trading. Although trading is open for everyone, but not all those who decide to trade will be given chances to succeed and be in profits. Of course, everything depends on how knowledgeable and skillful you are, and how can you beat the market with your honed strategies and developed right attitude towards in trading. And obviously, newbies don't have any of these yet.While you can say that your knowledge has been sufficient enough for you to decide to trade, but trading itself is not all about knowledge but more on practical application and skills. And for newbies to achieve this, you need to widen your experiences first and definitely learn from all the mistakes and losses that you have experienced.",

However, my question here is ' what is the best strategy to trade without losing my initial capital ?.I'm not a crypto expert, but let me share my experience.Basically, every investment in crypto, especially trading, will have risks. The worst risk is losing our money.But actually there are several ways to anticipate it:1. Do you trade in the future market? If yes, then the risk will be higher and it is better to avoid it. because, our cash capital can really run out quickly even if we trade Bitcoin.2. However, if you trade on the spot market, with Bitcoin as the asset, then in fact you will not lose as long as you are still holding and not selling at a cheaper price than when you bought it. Basically, the amount of Bitcoin we have is still the same, but because the price of BTC is volatile, sometimes its value goes up and down, as if our assets are decreasing and we are making big losses, so we panic and sell. So, when we sell at a lower price, we actually lose our money, including our capital.3. For this reason, to avoid trading risks, regardless of market conditions, if we have not yet made a profit according to our target, it would be better to continue holding or keeping Bitcoin as our investment. Don't be fixated on converting our fiat value because that will definitely make us more stressed because of the ups and downs in the value of our assets in our fiat conversion. Be patient until at least we reach the target price. Don't panic easily when a market drop or market correction occurs. As long as the coin you choose is Bitcoin, it will continue to be valuable if you hold it.",

Because if he did it already, then you are aware that every time you trade, you can't make sure that your money will get back fully, or might lose some of it. I will tell you OP that there is no perfect strategy in trading but you can practice more using spot trading. You can also use a demo account to further enhance your trading knowledge and skill but still, this won't give you the assurance that you will never lose as it seems possible, in fact, even old traders still experiencing this one.",

You cannot do without loses, no matter how knowledgeable you are in trading. What really happens is that, good traders will always have to get more wins than losses on the long run. So, for you not to lose your capital is that you must device a strategy that works for you and stick to that strategy. This doesn't happen instantly, the losses you are having is accumulation of knowledge, you have to build on that to become a successful trader.But then, avoid lossing money unnecessary. That is where the problem lies. If you lose money out of your careless and continue to lose and call it part of the process, you will not be profitable on the long run.",

When it comes to Cryptocurrency, there's always a risk in what you are doing even if you are only buying Bitcoin to hold how much if you decided to trade or invest which is more risky than holding but if you're willing to risk then there's a chance for you to earn money if you are lucky and have good skills and knowledge about what you are doing. Also, don't  forget that if you have a chance to double or triple your money then there's also a chance to lose some of your capital or maybe all of it.

Every business man is bound to loose. business is all about profit and loss, it can never be a win win. The best thing so far is to apply the DCA method buy accumulating Bitcoin for the next bulrun or investing for future purpose just like @adultcrypto said  buying the dip and hold is the best strategy. Trading can cause you psycological trauma expecialy when you lost a huge amount of money due to price fluctuation.",

Greed and emotion are what can easily blow your account. If you lose your temper due to repeated losses, you will definitely be tempted to take a great risk if you can recover all your losses. That's where greed comes in play. You are chasing a big profit, while you are still a newbie who is still trying to get familiar with the market. Don't trade with your emotions, and if you don't get so greedy, then you will likely not blow your account.",

So my advice is try out as many strategy as you can find and pick that which best suit your trading style and risk appetite, then make that your best strategy by staying consistent with it and watch your trading take a new shape",
