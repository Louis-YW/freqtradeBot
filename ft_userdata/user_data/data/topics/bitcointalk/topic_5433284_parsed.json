But i earned by 50/50 share in  selling paints. As i am curious how can I actually earn that 100% with the share since the other share helps me to find customer that could actually buy my painting then I did some research online. i found out that he gather customers in Twitter and i tried to sell by my own it actually worked. The money i got it solo of course i felt bad for my midman for the share but i also need money for my needs that i came that far. After that i earned a lot and decided to join crypto since it's been introduced by my friends. i did crypto a long time ago and it gave me a good benefits for investing and holding. If you really aim to mske it big then your money shouldn't be save much better to invest it for future goals!",

      "body": "Micro-earning sites such as a faucet or PTC is a waste of time since you'll earn pennies only, except freebitco.in of course, because of the gaming feature. I mean you waste time there but it's rather fun and who knows if you win something. But still, it's not a good source of income.I think most of the people here earn from renting signatures and offering online services (freelancers).",
