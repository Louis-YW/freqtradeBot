  "content": "Hello everyone,There is a question that often came to my mind but I never much asked around, so I'm hoping some of you can give me feedback/opinion.I was wondering what the security trade-offs are between 12 word vs 24 seed words are? I personally like using 12 seed words since you can also memorize them yourself more easily, but I was wondering if the less entropy/randomness of such a seed would be a problem vs the 24 variant?I see that wallets still offer support for 12 word seed, even some of them let you generate them (making me think they are still very secure to this day).So in essence my question would be:Am I doing something horribly wrong by using 12 word seeds and not the 24 word one, not realising risks I could be exposing myself to? (I will add that I do use a password on top of these words as well)Thanks for your time, hope to get some insights from you all.",

Example:Code:Card 1: weapon diet kick XXXX XXXX still XXXX welcome address hedgehog XXXX travel circle XXXX XXXX XXXX behave slush tree salute age hawk learn XXXXCard 2: weapon diet XXXX fine drill XXXX work welcome address hedgehog duty travel XXXX ozone game load XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX hawk learn amountCard 3: XXXX XXXX kick fine drill still work XXXX XXXX XXXX duty XXXX circle ozone game load behave slush tree salute age XXXX XXXX amountAccording to Ian Coleman's site, it takes a few million years to brute-force the 8 missing words if you have only one card. With 12 words, you'd miss only 4 words and that's much easier to brute-force.",

You are using an extension to your seed, also called a passphrase. The passphrase should be stored separately from your 12-word seed. In case a thief successfully finds the hiding spot of the recovery phrase, they shouldn't get the second essential element to recover your coins (your passphrase). The passphrase losses its purpose if its written down on the same piece of paper, for example.

(I will add that I do use a password on top of these words as well)The biggest risk you are exposing yourself to here is relying on your memory to back up your seed phrase.Note that \"password\" and \"passphrase\" are commonly used to refer to two different things. Password is generally used to refer to the password you would use to unlock your wallet software, while passphrase is used to refer to the seed extension or additional phrase which is combined with your seed phrase to derive your wallets. If you lose the password to unlock your wallet, you can recover that wallet from your seed phrase and passphrase. If you lose your passphrase (and don't have a back up), then your wallet is lost forever (just as if you had lost your seed phrase).Quote from: hosseinimr93 on November 04, 2022, 06:20:32 AMA 12 word BIP39 seed phrase provides 128 bits of entropy. Since a private key provides the same amount of entropy, with increasing the number of words to more than 12, you don't really increase your security.Private keys provide 128 bits of security, not 128 bits of entropy. The entropy of a private key will depend on how it was generated.I'd point out that BIP32 recommends using 256 bits of entropy (i.e. a 24 word seed phrase):Quote from: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawikiGenerate a seed byte sequence S of a chosen length (between 128 and 512 bits; 256 bits is advised) from a (P)RNG.",

Keep your 12 word seed phrase safe and don't worry. If 12 words is enough for security, then why waste ink writing 24 words?  12 words take up less space on a physical storage medium, be it paper, cardboard or metal. It is easier to store and hide, because it takes up less space. Recording is still half the trouble. More trouble comes when you enter 24 words on a new wallet every time. So it turns out that from the point of view of the user in terms of practicality, 12 words are better.I have another question: if 12 words are enough, then why were 24 words created? Shouldn't that provide some sort of benefit?",
