I have received 0 rewards but I have solved multiple blocksWe reviewed this with FHpool and it appears that miner was not setup correctly to mine to Diabase. Miner was set to coins port but c=DIAC was not set so pool had no way of knowing who, what or where the blocks should go. Please review that address on the pool and you will see it was mined incorrect. Unfortunately, this is not the pools falt. Diabase Dev Team",
