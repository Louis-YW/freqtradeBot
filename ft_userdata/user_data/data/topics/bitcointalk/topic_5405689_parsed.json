That's a lot to discuss so I will just pick one and that's the last part. Merchants first. Most Bitcoin bag holders are itching to spend their Bitcoin even for just once in their life. Some may already be dead without even experiencing it. Merchants won't risk it with a volatile currency. A problem that had been unsolved for years. But there are those who will do retail, like if there's really no option and you have only Bitcoin in your wallet then we can do it just this one time instead of the merchant buying Bitcoin the long way.",

Fundamentals and news doesnt really give out precised or assured effect on the market but it cant really bedenied that words from known people could neither shake off or wouldnt give out any effect in overall crypto space and also bear market is normal and i dont know on why people do freak out on times like these?",

Most of them a nothing but ponzi schemes clothed with crypto names and frameworks. More shitcoin would phaseout or keep merging but Bitcoin has gone through this challenges times several times and came out stronger.  Quote from: mRTHroo on July 09, 2022, 07:47:53 AMMajor adoption of bitcoin as ligal tender.It is too early to rate the impact of the adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender by El Salvador and Central African Republic. These two nations are putting efforts to put in place different mechanisms such as infrastructures and education to ensure that Bitcoin operation in these nations are effective and efficient. Just recently Nayib Bukele the President of El Salvador announced that the country is buying more Bitcoins.This little action has the tendency of building the confidence of Bitcoin holders. Be patient in few years you would see the impact. Quote from: mRTHroo on July 09, 2022, 07:47:53 AMIntegration as a payment option by a large company.I cannot deny that the acceptance of Bitcoin by multi-national companies can impact positively on both the price and acceptability of Bitcoin. But any cryptocurrency that constantly depends on the hype or recommendation of these companies and owners to break new grounds would never be successful. These companies might not support them forever. The day these companies fail to accept the currency as a means of payment,there would be a grave negative consequences. The companies or owners can also be used by politicians and anti-crypto forces to undermine the progress of these currencies. Bitcoin is moving towards the path of freedom and independence from unnecessary external influence.",

Country after country are considering bitcoin and other crypto as a legal tender and various applications and integration has already been made through business such as crypto payments.

I agree that neither Bitcoin adoption by some companies nor recognition as a legal tender did not bring mass adoption of Bitcoin, so if some expected it, they were wrong. But these are still factors contributing to the growth, not decline, of Bitcoin. Just not enough growth to ensure that the bear market never comes again. It does nothing to prove that the current bear market is any different from previous ones, that it will be the end of the market or anything like that.",
