But all of that if the rumor was true, until I write this reply the only news I got is this https://www.cryptopolitan.com/huobi-and-tron-executives-allegedly-arrested/ and it only based on the twitter thread by Adam Cohran. This is not the first time Huobi executive has been allegedly arrested, but the previous allegation has been denied, so I would still be skeptical.",

Binance only sell USDT that linked with Tron network, so USDT will not collapse yet.My answer: just one less exchange.",

This was reported to The Block by Tron co-founder Justin Sun, who is credited with controlling the bitcoin exchange.He did not cite specific values. Sun acknowledged that Huobi spent \"too much\" on marketing, advertising and salaries, but by now the platform has optimized costs.With the exception of the previous four quarters, the exchange's operations since its launch in 2013 have been profitable, he added.https://forklog.com/news/dzhastin-san-priznal-ubytochnost-huobi",

That's a bad news for crypto industry, i hope things will not become bad due to this. You have made a good post here and it is really a good point which we all should keep in mind before taking entries into market. Overall, Justin Sun is also a very greedy person he did some foolish acts before which caused him to pay huge fine as punishment. Balance that has dropped from 700$ million to $90 million only in a month is a huge alert for all of us. I hope people will not panic and will not start to withdraw there funds from this exchange because once people got panic then this exchange is gone and it will be another exchange going down but leaving some bad impact on the market and another slight or i think big dump in the market too.",

When Justin sun lastly punished by authorities to manipulate the price of Tron along with 12 celebrities. Thanks for the assessment. Unfortunately I can't provide any links to official information right now, they just don't exist. But there is information from the outside... But as they say, there is no smoke without fire.To be honest, until today I didn't know about the \"specific scheme\" implemented on the Huobi exchange, with \"collateral\" USDT and ETH and pseudo-tokens stUSDT/stETH, but it really seems quite dubious to me, especially given the information about the misuse of these funds. At the same time USDT became a \"hostage of the situation\", as the amount was notable.I don't think this will have a negative impact on USDT in the long term and globally, but there could definitely be some problems in the short term. ETH will not suffer so much, because the amount of \"borrowing\" in ETH is not that significant.",

Not financial adviceYes, if the information is now officially confirmed - the mass \"escape\" from the exchange and withdrawal of funds - is guaranteed. And there will be a very delicate situation - if the assets on cold/hot wallets of the huobi exchange are not enough to cover the demand, this will really lead to the same blow to the crypto market, as we had an example of the recent collapse of another exchange. And what is very bad - Huobi is not a third-rate, local exchange, and this will cause an increase in distrust of cryptocurrency and crypto exchanges in general. In today's situation - it will be clearly not the best event, when the prospects of cryptocurrencies are already not the most stable. At the very least, it may increase the pressure of regulators and/or introduce stricter rules for the market, which obviously will not add to the attractiveness of cryptocurrency either",
