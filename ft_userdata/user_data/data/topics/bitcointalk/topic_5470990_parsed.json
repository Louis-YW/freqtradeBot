I found a website named https://www.asicminervalue.com/, which gives real-time mining hardware profitability. I don't know how accurate the information is. The most profitable Bitcoin miner I see is Bitmain Antminer S19 XP Hyd (255Th), which gives $0.31/day after the Electricity cost. The top two Bitcoin miners Bitmain Antminer S21 Hyd (335Th) and Bitmain Antminer S21 (200Th) is not released yet (According to this website).

It seems the most profitable coin to mine is Kaspa at this moment. Currently, Bitmain and Iceriver produce ASIC miners but when I search for their official website. I found two websites for Bitmain: https://www.bitmain.com/ and https://bitmain.org.cn/. Which one is legit?

How anyone can start Mining Bitcoin with this profitability while the block reward will be divided after the halving? From what I read online, most miners have cheap access to electricity, or they never sell their Bitcoin directly and speculate that the price will increase later on and then sell their mining results at that time. If you just start right now, it is naive to expect that your mining results would lead to profit directly. It is impossible unless you somehow spend nothing to get your RIG and energy.",

So, if I run ASIC miners, I will likely use a lot of energy, and the price of Electricity will increase to $0.15 where I live. Thanks for the info, by the way.

Unfortunately, Kaspa mining won't remain this profitable due to its block reward-reducing system and the number of miners adding to the network every day.

If you have access to cheap electricity, buy a miner that consumes as much energy as possible but also generates as much money as possible. Usually, you'll find miners that consume a lot of energy in cheap price.According to whattomine, MicroBT Whatsminer M53S Hydro generates -$16.23 if your electricity price is 0.20 cent but it generates $16.23 if your electricity is free.If you have Bitmain Antminer KS3 and you pay 0.20 cent/kilowatt, then your net profit will be $109.96 but if you have free electricity, your net profit will be $127.00. You see the difference? KS3 is a great choise for absolutely every person on the earth, so, it's price will increase and ROI will decrease but since MicroBT Whatsminer M53S Hydro consumes a lot of energy, no one wants it, so people try to get rid of it but there are people who have access to free electricity, so, it's a great option for them.But since halving is in less than 200 days, I would be extra careful. You also have to consider when Bitmain announces new miners because that will have impact on miners market.",

I took Kaspa as a miner that uses less energy and generates much profit right now and in this case, let's forget my old words and imagine that Kaspa is a new antminer created for bitcoin. This was only example to demonstrate that you can find a miner that can consume a lot electricity and generate tons of money for those who have free electricity and there you can find miner that can be so energy effective that those with free electricity and expensive electricity will generate the same profit. If someone has free electricity, they can not use that advantage by mining with energo effective miner.Quote from: stompix on October 22, 2023, 06:12:11 PMI see it more like1) Don't mine!2) Ready for headache number 2, how much of that cheap energy you have, and how much money you have in your pocketToday I wouldn't mine. It's a headache to buy miners from Bitmain, it's headache to send damaged miners back to bitmain and explain customs that they shouldn't ask you to pay tax again when you receive it. Mining is full of headache right now.  It doesn't worth anymore for individuals, it's only left for big corporations and for some mafia who has access to very cheap electricity and doesn't pay import taxes.

There is uncertainty about whether Bitcoin will surpass the 31,000 level, considered a significant support level but I am of the opinion that it is going to rise. As Bitcoin prices rise, Asic miner prices and profitability are also expected to increase. The coming days and months for bitcoin are going to be a good one because of the potential for higher profitability in Bitcoin mining and the importance of low electricity costs for miners to maintain their profitability.",

As you can see, Bitcoin already touched the $34.5K mark today. I understand that Mining Bitcoin with high electricity costs like mine is not profitable at all. I don't know how philipma1957 still continues and what his electricity cost is at this moment. But I can assume that he is holding his Bitcoins until the next bull run which will start slowly just like this morning. Today, I woke up and saw Bitcoin touched the 34K range while it had been between 25K and 29K for the last couple of months. But it's hard for people like me to continue the business with such electricity costs. I didn't even start, so why am I thinking about continuing?",

So, if I run ASIC miners, I will likely use a lot of energy, and the price of Electricity will increase to $0.15 where I live. Thanks for the info, by the way. Now, I understand that mining is too profitable for those with cheap Electricity. Learn Bitcoin, are you planning to mine? In here in Bangladesh? I don't think that's a good idea. You know how unreliable electricity is in our country. We don't have enough electricity to fulfill our demand. Where I live in load shedding is happening all the time. Electricity price per watt also went up recently. So I don't know if that's a good move.Also there are some rules with consumption of electricity. The housing and factories (Basically commercial) have different price chart. So if they see unusual consumption of electricity in your end they might get a little suspicious. You know how power hungry a miner is.My suggestion would be try to reach out the miners of Bangladesh. They might be able to show you the current reality of mining in Bangldesh. Mining gig is can be very expensive. So before investing, you should consider those, cause the amount is big.",
