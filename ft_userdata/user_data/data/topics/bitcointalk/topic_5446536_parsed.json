As every body has their own opinions. Let's see what will happen.",

Let's see what will happen. I believe that both solar power and water source energy have their own unique benefits and drawbacks, and the best solution depends on the specifics of a particular area. In some regions, solar power may be more practical due to the availability of sunlight, while in other regions, water source energy may be more reliable and efficient. If it were up to me, I would choose Zero Point Modules (ZPMs) as an energy source. ZPMs have the unique ability to extract energy from the vacuum of space, making them incredibly powerful and long-lasting. With their ability to power entire cities and even intergalactic spacecraft, they would be the perfect solution. Unfortunately, despite their potential, ZPMs are not yet widely available to the general public.  Quote from: TalkativeCoin on March 27, 2023, 07:42:30 PMAre there any commercially available solutions for water source power harvesting to buy from like an AliExpress, or is it all DIY?Sure, you can find a water source power harvesting kit on AliExpress right next to the \"Build Your Own Nuclear Reactor\" set. But, if you want something that actually works and won't break down after a week, you might have to put in a little effort and DIY it yourself. It's not rocket science, you know?",

Good one  I know it's not rocket science, I've built my own 9 kWp solar power plant, I was just wondering if there are some out-of-the-box options in this field because I haven't actually got into it that deep.",

      "body": "The use of sunlight to produce electricity through solar panels is called solar electricity.  And the electricity generated by turning the wheel using the current of water is called hydroelectricity Since Bitcoin mining requires a lot of electrical energy, you will definitely find this idea positive. But for solar power generation, a place should be selected where sunlight falls diagonally on the solar panel from morning to evening. And for hydropower generation you need to use mountain rivers and drought rivers to generate electricity in many streams of rivers.  But these are just a lot of incidental costs if you can afford those costs and choose such a place then this move is right for you.",

As for the drought rivers, eh!Quote from: Maxre on March 27, 2023, 07:00:53 PMToday I was thinking that what could be the best way to mine crypto with cheaper source of energy and than I searched on Google and I found our the Solar Power or Water Source of energy could be a better option mine because they need Lower maintenance and lower cost to other source of energy.Yeah, except that in practice, when you need 24/7 all year long cheap electricity and you're not receiving thousands of dollars in government incentives nuclear and dirty old coal-generated electricity beats the crap out of any solar-generated electricity.That's why without proper government cash and solar feed-in grid tariff plans nobody would even dare to mine with solar, or if they are doing it they don't realize how much they are losing or are going to.",
