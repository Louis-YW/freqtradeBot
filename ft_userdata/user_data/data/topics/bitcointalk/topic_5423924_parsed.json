  "content": "It's important that you have good habits so that you can progress and we don't just depend on motivation. Because habits stay with us for a long time because we are used to them while motivation only has a short-term effect.But there are also bad habits that we should avoid and some of them are:1. You are always awake       This is one of the habits that most of us are guilty of because it has strange adrenalin or high when we wake up. There is a part of our brain that is triggered called \"Dopamine\" as if we receive a reward or satisfaction when we stay up watching series on Netflix, playing games until morning, watching movies, and so on. And the exchange of this the next day is that you seem to be low on energy because you lack sleep and we get up late in our bed. Sometimes we are not in focus and sometimes we even become forgetful. If we just close our eyes or lean back, we will fall asleep immediately.       So if you want to have a better day, you must have enough sleep, we must also give our body the proper rest so that it performs well the next day. And if you can perform well, you will be more productive and you will be able to do well for your progress.2. You move backward and forwards      Some people have become this habit, and don't know what they want to do in life. Is it the type that says yes, but later, it turns out not? The important thing should be done today, but it will be said later that it will be tomorrow. But what's worse is the one who starts doing a job or business and then suddenly stops or doesn't come back or do it again, We will waste a lot of time, physical, mental, energy, and in other cases even money if we are not sure about every decision we make.So it's better for you or us to be decisive so we can focus on the things we want to do.3. You are a perfectionist      This is also a habit that can slow you or us down as if there is always something wrong or lacking in what you do. Your standard is so high that reality can hardly keep up with you. Sometimes you want everything to be perfect before you think or start or plan, but because you waited for the perfect timing it never came and others overlooked it. Yes, there is nothing wrong with wanting everything to go well, but sometimes there are opportunities that you can do right now but you think twice because you have a perfectionist habit that you have to meet it first before you do it. But even if everything isn't perfect, it's okay to start with it, and then just adjust it along the way. It's like perfecting it instead of doing nothing.4. You always say it's later      This is lazy, because you always want to delay the things you should do that can improve your life. The words \"That's later\", \"That's tomorrow\", That's next month\", That's next year\" and so on Until you can't do it anymore. Sometimes the reason for this is just laziness or just being afraid of failing at what you do, so it's just later. And if they do it at the last minute, we're good at cramming, so the result of the work is sloppy, or maybe it's an obvious rush that's just done, instead of being done right away so that the result is good and has been planned and not the It's more stressful to do things quickly, especially if there are deadlines.5. You don't have a schedule or routine     Another habit that you don't notice that is often wrong is this. Because it worked for you before that even if you don't have a schedule, routine, or plan to do today or even this week, that's okay. Because you crossed it even though there was nothing like that. But if we do this, you will be able to see the direction or organize well because you will notice your progress if you have a routine or schedule that you follow instead of the decision you make in haste as if you just \"come what may\".    Sometimes if you don't have a schedule or routine, you can easily get distracted because you don't follow anything. Or just play games, open Tiktok, or Facebook, and so on because you have nothing else to do. But it's important that you have it so that you can have time management so that you can see that you have time to work out, think about things related to business and other good plans for the future, and so on.This is a personal opinion based on my experience, I tried to research these habits on google and this is the only research I have done on the subject, if you have any other additions, it will be accepted for further information on each one of us here. Thank you and have a nice daySource: https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/these-5-unhealthy-habits-may-block-your-success-they-are-not-that-difficult-to-break.html",

You are always awakeI don't think there's a person commonly known for this kind of habit because it's a serious illness that is found to have resulted to this health imbalance, it's a serious and complicated abnormality for one not to be sleeping regularly because it's what should come naturally except if something is wrong somewhere else withbthe healthiness of the person found with non sleeping habit, but no man with his complete sense and in good health conditions will wanted to keep awake while others are sleeping because sleep comes in inevitably after rigorous stress of the day.",

      "body": "Inadequate sleep can lead to so many disorder in the body system such as worsten your memory i.e you might have a brain disorder,it also slow your thinking which will now have an effect on good decision making. You can't cheat nature that is why,when you don't have sufficient sleep,you will be dosing in anything you are doing.Sleep is very important to the body so much as it improves your brain performance and makes you healthy in the sense that it makes the body system free from diseases and stress. Those that are depriving themselves from sufficient sleep are damaging their body system bit by bit unknowingly to them. Staying  focused on your goal makes it easy to be achieved and procrastination is a barrier to anything that is worth doing in life.",
