I believe we are having a harsh momentum between June and July due to some recent news involving high flux of Bitcoins for sale in the market, but as soon as we get rid of such sales and investors absorb the supply of BTCs being dropped in the market, Bitcoin will recover its price once again towards a new ATH. By my experience, the final months of a halving year have been considerably good for our investments in Bitcoin.I expect that from September or October on we start seeing some interesting fluctuations. It means there is still time to invest in Bitcoin, while it's still below the 60,000$ price mark. If my predictions are right, you have come back in time for the banquet.",

As one who is returning into the Bitcoin space, one thing you shouldn't let go off is your optimism, it's one piller of your investing force, when ever you stop been optimistic, a whole lot gets to happen with your investment as panic and emotional stress could set in and affect how profitable you can be with your investment.In the midst of your optimism, you should aswell try to making sure that your are not over leveraging so you know when best to exit and when best to enter especially if you get to add trading along side, also make sure to stay informed a d following the trends and happenings around Bitcoin so you don't get left out at any point.",

The majority of us here are very well optimistic about the approach to Bitcoin for its future potential. My personal view won't be that much and that's the same as the others. We're just going to hold it effortlessly and wait for the time to come. Mentioning my mistake in the past, I won't do that again because I've sold too early. So, you've got a good initiative there by ordering a trezor hardware wallet and that shows that you're ready to the game for the long term holding. But don't forget to enjoy it as well and take some profits but make sure that you're already decided and won't have any regrets upon doing so. Set yourself some goals and be confident about bitcoin's future potential. Some have already mentioned that there's no way that they're going to have some thoughts of selling but no one knows what will happen in the future so for you, you just have to be ready for it. The speculations that I have read is that we might see some good ending by this year but it's not the actual ending of this bull run. This is still going to be long run until 2025 so, set up your mind and keep accumulating as much as you can before we get those high prices that we've never seen before.",

For the past years we've witnessed a consistent bullish periods with minor bear that has led us to the last $73k ATH we just saw not long ago and with the halving that happened not quite long ago, we're all bullish as we walk into the future and hopes are high and expectations aren't going down at all. Regulation issues hasn't gone out of the way but the level of adoption globally has increased to a very large extent so if we're to look at a comparison of the effect of regulation to the extent of adoption, then there are more institutions and individuals that have come into the space than negative regulations that have stood against it. Like in my country  Nigerian  which has initially set out regulatory policies that discouraged people and exchanges from operating in Nigeria has now shifted to a new part and have now shifted into accepting and collaborating with the exchanges while accepting to take a percentage of VAT from users which has increased the level of Bitcoin being bullish for the Bitcoin Nigerian local ecosystem. While anticipating the bull and an upward movement of Bitcoin, it's necessary to start buying at this current price and ensure that you're security is well sorted out and taken care of so you don't get involved with the bad eggs that are looking for account to hack and funds to steal. The sphare has also had a lot of bad eggs that are out to steal your coins so you've got to be careful as you start up your journey in this space again.",

In terms of acceptance in countries, I don't think so. Just yesterday, I learned that people who use centralized exchange in my country would have to pay Value-Added Tax (“VAT”) at a rate of 7.5%  on transaction fees in each trade for users whose KYC information is registered in Nigeria. Ans these monies will then be remitted to the government. This is what makes me less optimistic about bitcoin's potential in my country.Globally, I am riding the fence, since the time of the halving.

And what brings you back to this moment ? As you said, you have read many different news sources about bitcoin so you probably have most of the current situation of the market so I think there is nothing more to tell you . I think you still see the potential of bitcoin when you read that news and that's why you bought yourself a hardware wallet. Right?     I can only say that you are back at the right time and there are a lot of opportunities for you and everyone who wants to enter the market, we are not yet officially into the bull season and things are still very cheap to collect .By the way, I don't know if you plan to invest in bitcoin or altcoins, but I want to tell you that altcoins still have many risks and there are still many scams like in the old days. You should be careful if you intend to invest in altcoins.",

I will not be at all surprised that beginners have completely unrealistic expectations, but everyone who has been there for a few years should have understood how the market works. The fact that the price is now going down is actually good, especially for OP and all those who want to invest at low prices.",

The only thing we'll experience for the time being is the negative effects of worsening global economy and increasing tensions on the price.So in short term I may not be optimistic but long term is all optimism... P.S. Don't forget to stake an address here for this account, it makes recovery easier: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=996318.0Also as pooya87 points out there is \"more\" of everything.Also just to highlight that things have taken a turn over the last year or so in that institutionalFIAT based investors have and are looking to move into Bitcoin and Crypto which obviouslyincreases demand and adoption.Quote from: axel20 on July 03, 2024, 09:49:07 PMI just ordered a Trezor Safe 3 to start \"hodling\" again.  When you get your Trezor do make sure you stake your address as pooya87 recommends, most of us have done so already.",

You can still rely on Bitcoin as in the past even though the conditions are slightly different now, but there will be no obstacles that can discourage your good intentions as long as you still have a very strong belief in Bitcoin. BTW it's a pretty good wallet (Trezor Safe 3).",
