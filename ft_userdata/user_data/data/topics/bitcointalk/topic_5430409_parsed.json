However, I've heard that there is a priority listing for Coingecko and Coinmarketcap, where dev need to pay $$$$$ to get a fast listing. So I'm no longer surprised if this is happens, since going from a strict listing process to a paid listing will result in a large number of dead coins. After all, 2021-2022 era is the era of memes which makes a lot of sense that many will die, despite the rumors of the priority list.Note: I'm not accusing, just hearing rumours. please correct me if wrong.",

Crypto is not exactly unregulated, scammers could still get jail time if you know who scammed you. The difference is that when you are dealing in fiat, you usually know who you are dealing with, and who to sue when something goes wrong and even in the fiat world scammers are running rampant as we all know.However, in the crypto world where we are talking about something that is delicate, if you know the scammer then you could go to police and report them and open a lawsuit against them and they will be punished for it. Look at SBF, he scammed everyone with his company and now he is being possibly jailed for it as well, which means it's regulated just like fiat as long as you know the scammer.",

There’s a lot of trick with the altcoins, many are a failed project in the first place while some are struggling to get investors even if their intentions are clean. If you are hesitant to buy new altcoins then better to buy top coins instead.",

I think that the crypto space provides many opportunities and it still is possible to make great profits in here within a relatively short amount of time. That being said, the chances to lose your investment are probably higher than the chance to actually make a profit with it and the many scams that are going in the crypto world are a big reason for that. Even if you are doing your research and you check everything about a project that is available you can still fall victim to a scam and lose all your money. My advice would be to not touch meme-coins at all because their only purpose is to make the team behind it reach without any effort.",
