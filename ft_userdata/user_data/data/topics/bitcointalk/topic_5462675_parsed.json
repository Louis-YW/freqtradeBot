What I also believe is that these thresholds will be lowered over time, in the same way that cash payment limits have been lowered, or the limits above which bank transactions are reported to the IRS or equivalents in other countries. The public authorities want cashless societies and totally controllable, economically speaking, and they move towards that path little by little, slowly boiling us like a frog that does not realize it.",
