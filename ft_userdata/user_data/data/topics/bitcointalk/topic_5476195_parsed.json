Unless you are trying to imply Ukraine is supposed to be an state or part of the Russian federation, which in my opinion it is not. Also, you are not supposed to talk so slightly about the beginning of a WW3, like you are doing. Because it is very likely all the habitants of the planet would suffer from such scalation, because of either suffering collateral damage or chemical/radiation poisoning... One is not supposed to underestimate the suffering caused by conflicts of that magnitude. Shame of you.",

People talk about world war 3 like it's a latest model of video game that's about to be launched or some upcoming blockbuster movie, that's about to premiere soon. I guess it's ignorant people that lives in peaceful counties that will speak about war like it's a cool thing. Anytime that two countries are in conflict or war, some people will use it as a propaganda to predict ww3, I think that this is a very sad development which should be discouraged. Even when one or two developing countries are having conflicts, same prophets of doom will speculate how powerful nations are backing each country, and how it can escalate to ww3. My information to this set of people is that if ww3 were to start now, it'll reach their peaceful domain.",

This is not to say that World War III does not currently exist, but that it is so close that such an assumption is very scary. Although tensions exist between the countries. Today all these conflicts have been questioned and criticized due to the massive human suffering, loss of life and displacement of people in today's world. War is a very real and serious threat, and it is not something to be taken lightly or used as a sensationalist topic. This is not something that should be considered a prediction. Let's focus on promoting understanding and cooperation instead of scaremongering and sensationalizing the idea of ​​World War 3.",

WW3 has been in anticipation for a very long time that I can remember and looking at what happened in the Russia and Ukraine war and the recent one involving the isreali and Palestinian, I doubt ww3 is what the world needs now. I know putting an end to war isn't something one can just wish and it just happens but this consistent war we are having here and their is a serious problem that is affecting the world in a serious negative way. Are we to talk about the kids that are being killed on a regular in the process of this war or the millions of infrastructure that took some state a reasonable number of time to build and it would just be demolished within a twinkle of an eye.Ww3 is not something we should pray for or even have a thought about because it would be very disastrous.",

It can be speculated that it will take place this century, which is everything I don't want.- Every ongoing conflict and even places where there are sparks of war have their own problems, conflicts of interest will only end when one side wins. Those who are lucky enough not to belong to this area will probably only partly understand the fierce feeling of war.I lived in Vietnam for a long time, so hearing about certain wars always makes me feel creepy. Maybe in this day and age, information is difficult to access, but in historical wars, then the gloomy death brings fear to the next generations for a long time, and it also takes a lot of time to restore stability.",

A potential WW3 would not be solely battled with troops on the ground. It would involve nuclear weapons & they would be fired by multiple nations involved in the war. I don’t think even Putin, China or North Korea would start firing nukes at a super power like the US or UK due to the instant retaliation. Yes we have wars in Ukraine & Gaza/Israel but they are very unlikely to evolve into a wider scale WW3.",

If some country decided to invade that it would have to face a lot of resistance and then deal with the crazy and the poor. Nobody want to take over a country where buildings have no staircases above certain levels because they wanted a skyscraper but did not plan that anyone would occupy it. Also, who are the countries that might launch an assault? China would not bother, Japan would have to attack by sea and it has ongoing conflict with China, so starting a war with another country that's China's neighbor is suicide. The only other country is South Korea, but it would start the Korean War all over again. I don't think that anybody will ever attack North Korea, everyone will wait for them to eventually self-destruct because that's what communism eventually leads to.",
