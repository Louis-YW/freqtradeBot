The address 1Ay8vMC7R1UbyCCZRVULMV7iQpHSAbguJP made four separate purchases of over 100 bitcoins each, bringing its total holdings to 71,587 bitcoins, with a total value of $4.49 billion. The unrealized profit from these holdings has reached $1.25 billion.https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*6ebltHx_qZkdwEOxV3wNDA.pngSource: https://search.ichainfo.com/bitcoin/address/1Ay8vMC7R1UbyCCZRVULMV7iQpHSAbguJP#activity1Ay8vMC7R1UbyCCZRVULMV7iQpHSAbguJP prefers to buy Bitcoin in units of 100, which is why he is known as Mr.100. Looking at all his purchases, it can also be seen that the range of 100–110 BTC is his favorite trading range, with transactions in this range accounting for more than half of all transactions.https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*7sqIx_q0Dt3sCA8PSource: search.ichainfo.comHowever, what is most astounding is not his relentless persistence in continuously buying in units of 100 BTC, but rather his timing in purchasing Bitcoin. His first purchase was in November 2022, which can be considered the bottom of the previous bear market. He entered at the bottom of the bear market, accumulating a large amount of Bitcoin at low prices.https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Ov03PmIjZUdef0SdxLsKuw.pngSource: tradingviewIn the recent bull market, as the price of Bitcoin continued to rise, Mr.100 has been consistently buying Bitcoin. However, during this process, he also sells off small amounts at appropriate levels during peak points. Looking at the charts, it can be seen that he reduced his holdings slightly at several peak points in February, April, and July 2023. Furthermore, when the price of Bitcoin reached a high point in June 2024, he stopped buying.https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*CNp4zLcF9tseYu0WSource: search.ichainfo.comHowever, in July, with a slight dip in the price of Bitcoin, Mr.100 resumed buying Bitcoin, increasing his average cost to $45,000. His unwavering buying behavior reflects his confidence in the entire Bitcoin market.https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*AbFkgfw4XUBGyBQISource: search.ichainfo.comMr.100’s total profit has now reached $1.68 billion, with realized profits of $430 million and unrealized profits of $1.25 billion. The timing of when he will realize these profits will be a significant trend for market participants to watch.https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*AU5kGzQFde6OIYSM0MbBKg.pngSource: search.ichainfo.comiChainfo Search：https://search.ichainfo.com/Twitter：https://twitter.com/iChainfoDiscord：https://discord.gg/AaVKSHewKwTelelgram：https://t.me/ichainfo_globalMedium：https://medium.com/@ichainfoiChainfo：https://ichainfo.com/Written by Auguste",
