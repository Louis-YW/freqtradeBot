      "body": "Yes, usually interest rates vary from its terms. In my country, the government standard looks like this.So the interest rate on shorter terms is always lower. It could be taken advantage but it also depends on a country's inflation rate. If the inflation is higher then going for a longer-term loan is just fine. However, in rich countries, people are mostly capable of taking short-term loans.In developing and poor countries, it is nearly impossible for normal mid-level citizens to pay their housing loans in the short term. I noticed that most here in my country, went for a 30-year housing loan term. Nonetheless, the rate is still lower compared to a regular bank loan which is around 18% to 24% here.",

The average cost of a five-year fixed rate today has fallen to 4.98% from 5.05% yesterday.",

So this may sound great, but not be available for everyone.yes definitely worth contacting the debt supplier. if already in debt and want to renegotiate a dealbecause usually the amount you pay in is not all going towards the principle debt, but instead the interest they lump ontop. especially in the early years of paying off debts. so see if you can pay more that goes straight to lowering principle or re-negotiate debt to an extended length. reduce the monthly demand, lower interest. but then paying the excess to then go straight to the principledefinitely contact them if you have more then one debt with the same company because if you did pay more on one debt they may consider that as paying into another debt where you were making just interest only payments on(minimums). so ensure the extra funds go into paying the correct intended thingobviously dont explain the trick to them. just ask them for the amounts that change if you extend life of debt,if there are better rates to refinance to.. and ask if you can pay back more then set demands early/regularly. because they might decide to mess with the interest by re-financing into higher interest out of spite rather then giving best deal available if you explain too much about trying to pay off debt while giving them less profit",

Use your extra money for something else more productive. stretching the length can lower the monthly payment meaning you are lowering the REQUIRED DEMANDS thus de-risking defaults of the min demand that can get you in trouble if not paid.. however dont then waste the excess cash you can be left with. if the mortgage rate is 5% but you can put that excess into a 7-12% investment. then you can be better off investing. or you can pay off debt sooner",

But can't you like pay directly to the principal monthly so when the due for the amortization comes, the interest gets smaller? What I mean is that you can pay the principal amount if you only have an extra money though but I don't know about in your country but that's how some people do it in my country when they do a housing loan although it can only be done when you have an extra money left after all the expenses for the month.",
