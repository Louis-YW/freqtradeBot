  "content": "Greetings dear friends!Need help in answering from knowledgeable and excellent people in crypto trading?The gist:There is reliable information about the release of a new crypto token. I have been involved in social media promotionâ€”maintained pages on Telegram, Twitter, and Medium (quit).Within a month, the team will realize this token for the first AirDrop, then pre-sale, and finally release it for trading on exchanges.The token's price will definitely go up - they invested a lot of money in advertising. Also, the manager plans to attract a world celebrity to the advertisement.I am not very well-versed in cryptocurrency trading, so please answer the following questions:Question:I have some amount of these new tokens, already in my Meta mask wallet.How would it affect the token price growth if I sell, for example, $5000 worth of tokens when the price reaches $1?Will the price growth slow down a lot? And is it even worth selling tokens until the price rises to the maximum (for example, Doge Killer is currently at $400)?Thank you in advance for your reply.",
