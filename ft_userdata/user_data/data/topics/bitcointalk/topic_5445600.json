      "body": "You are barely making sense, but I can guess what you are trying to ask.  To answer your question, I think sharing your private key with someone is a big deal as they will have full access to your bitcoins. If you want to do so, make sure it is someone you really trust and who understands all the risks. It might be tempting to share it with a family member, but they might not know how to keep it safe. As for someone who introduced you to bitcoin, I see no reason why you would do that. If you want to show gratitude, there are alternative and safer ways to do so. So, think carefully before sharing your bitcoin key and make sure you are comfortable with the person you are sharing it with.",

      "body": "Trust can be betrayed most times, so sharing a private key out of love is risky, but by the way, before taking such a decision, you should probably know the person you are dealing with well before disclosing your key to them. If it's your spouse, then you and her may have known yourselves so well for years of marriage because if it's a new marriage, you never know if there will be a breakup. If you want to disclose your seed to your kids, then it can't be only one child you disclose it to. Unless it's only one child you have. So long as you are alive and healthy, you should keep your key to yourself. You could also write things down in a book to keep a record so your children or wife can access your crypto assets if anything happens to you.",

Your private key is essentially your password to access your Bitcoin, and if someone else has access to it, they can potentially steal your Bitcoin or misuse it.However, you can share information about your Bitcoin with someone you trust, such as a close family member or friend, without actually sharing your private key. For example, you can tell them about your investment in Bitcoin, how you manage your Bitcoin wallet, and your overall strategy for buying, selling, and holding Bitcoin.If you want to ensure that your Bitcoin is passed on to your loved ones in the event of your death, you can consider setting up a legal will or trust that includes instructions for how your Bitcoin should be transferred to your heirs. You can also consider using a multi-sig wallet, which requires multiple private keys to access your Bitcoin, and give one of the private keys to a trusted family member or friend.Ultimately, the decision to share your Bitcoin information with someone is a personal one that should be carefully considered based on your individual circumstances and the level of trust you have with the person in question. It's important to remember that once you share your private key or any other sensitive information, you lose control over your Bitcoin and the risks associated with it increase.",

Each bitcoiner has the right to do with his btc whatever he pleases and can share information about his keys with anyone. Of course, this should be a trusted person to whom you are basically ready to leave your btc as an inheritance or simply give it away. It doesn't matter at all who it will be, a relative, friend or stranger. An important point is trust and willingness to give him bitcoin. In particular, one should not forget about this person's awareness of BTC. He should know the basics of using and safely storing bitcoin so as not to lose it. Just make sure you choose the right person. I see it as a combination of trusted custodian and heir.",

While people should be generally careful regarding these things, I don't think that its a smart thing to not have a contingency plan in case something happens to you. In my case, my wife has the access to the Ledger's seed phrase and instructions what to do in case something happened to me as it would suck if all my effort in all these years goes in vain. Now someone might say \"your wife might end up stealing your crypto and running away\" and while that's true, if I don't trust her with money, why the hell would I even stay married to her?",

Even the person who introduces me to Bitcoin knows the risk of sharing such data with him/her, and as such, even if one wants to make such a mistake by sharing the key phrase with his/her mentor, the teacher will definitely reject it, if he/she wants to be on the safe side. Because if I have access to your private key or phrase and something happens to your holdings in that wallet because of your carelessness, your first suspect will definitely be the person whom you know has access to your key, and that will spoil the good the person has done for you. To keep a healthy friendship or relationship, we should always keep those from them.  But to some point I do recommend sharing key phrase with a few trusted party either spouse, blood or anyone just as @Rikafip have said, who you know can grab access to your wallet when one have some kind of issue which might restrain him access to the wallet, either bad health condition which ever the case maybe.",
