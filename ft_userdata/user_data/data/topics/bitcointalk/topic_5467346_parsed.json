  "content": "Hello friends, I'm new here and I want to briefly tell you about my journey in getting to know cryptocurrency.I first became familiar with crypto because I was introduced to it by a friend of mine who was already involved in the world of cryptocurrency, and when I was told by him, to be honest, I wasn't too interested because I thought this was like a fraud scheme like I had experienced before, yes, several times I had to deceived because they entered a world that lured investment. However, I tried to find out through several platforms such as YouTube and others, after I watched it I thought this was different from the offers I had received so far. After searching for some time, I found several Telegram channels that discussed crypto and focused more on airdrop hunting.After finding out about crypto for a long time, I finally decided to get involved in it, and to be honest, it changed me in several ways, one of which was my habits in managing finances. If previously I only focused on saving fiat money, I slowly allocated it to buy some coins. Yes, even though the journey is not that smooth, sometimes I can make a profit and sometimes I also lose because I bought the wrong coin which in the end just becomes a decoration in my trust wallet (FYI, the trust wallet was the first wallet I used).I remember when I bought BNB at that time it gave me a profit even though I had to be patient to wait. Yes, it's not easy and sometimes I also doubt whether I should sell it back or hold it, and I was lucky at that time because I decided to continue holding it until it finally gave me a profit. The reason I can continue to hold it is because I work and have a steady income, and even when I have to lose I still have a stable income. From there I also learned that patience is one of the keys to gaining profits.I joined this forum because I was introduced to it by a friend and I also studied this forum for several weeks and finally I decided to join it. I see that I will gain a lot of new knowledge here, exchanging information and that can improve my literacy.",

Altcoins investment isn't about Risk and Patience only, you can have all the patience and in the end you choose the wrong coins.With Bitcoin you don't have to worry about a coin dying on you on the long run, or a coin getting rug pulled on you, Bitcoin is far safer than other coins, but altcoins are not completely bad either, you just have to know which one you are willing to risk money on. Be picky when it comes to altcoins, because majority of them are scam, some won't survive this altcoin which is even the most sad part for altcoins, so do your own research and pick the good apples out of the legions of bad apples.

I'm glad you've understood that crypto investment is all about risk and while you have recorded some losses, it hasn't dampened your desire to hodl because if I have to be honest if you don't have a stable source of income, hodling will be hard because needs may arise that may tempt you to sell. Cryptocurrency investment is risky but Bitcoin is safer and has more potential than some of these altcoins which don't have longer shelf life but might look promising.Â Anyways, just understand that in business, you lose some and gain some and just as you've mentioned you're patient bit I'd take the advice @Z390 gave to heart.",

There are a few important things you might want to learn as you continue your journey in the world of cryptocurrency. Firstly, understanding how to secure your wallet is crucial. Additionally, consider diversifying your crypto investments more effectively, and stay informed about trading regulations in your country of residence. Some exchanges that once didn't require KYC (Know Your Customer) verification may now do so due to increased government regulation. If you prefer to avoid this, there are decentralized exchanges, known as DEX (Decentralized Exchanges), where such verification is not mandatory.I see several qualities of a promising investor in from you. Keep up the learning, best of luck, and welcome to the forum!",

At first, you had no interest and time was wasting, then when you did develop some interest, it was with some altcoin that didn't perform well. Having patience with the wrong coin, is always a time waste. If, Op, showed some dedication in cryptocurrency, by reading or researching before investing, he'll would have made lesser losses. As all those money invested into some shitcoin, would have been allocated into bitcoin, then patience will be the best tool for Op, as a stable income earner.

Always follow it slowly and observe how the market works; the bull and bear market fluctuations",
