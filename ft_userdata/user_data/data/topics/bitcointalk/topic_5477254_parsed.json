The sustainability is what matters if you are looking at a long time update.Or what is your intention for it, you want to introduce something else to it on a later time?You could rather merge it up with some of the existing threads. We have both leagues prediction threads already.",

Girona's recent performance well but mighty Barcelona far better in his home ground. I am damm sure about the Barcelona match. Chelsea  don't let me down....",

Other things being equal, it is a sure bet because Chelsea will not want to lose two matches at a stretch. However, Everton have not been doing badly in their current form, having defeated Newcastle 3:0 in their last match, an outcome no one saw coming. Giving Chelsea the advantage in this match is more of a psychological thing and not based on present realities. By this I mean that Chelsea might be more business minded, knowing the psychological damage they will incur losing to Everton after losing previous match to Manchester United. They will also be disappointing their fans I no mean way should they allow Everton defeat them even though they are away. Therefore, I will give Chelsea the upper hands in this match and hope there are not surprises.",

Therefore, I will give Chelsea the upper hands in this match and hope there are not surprises. Everton have performed very well this season. As Chelsea is a strong team, the visitors will surely enjoy a nice competitive game today. Dominic Calvert is very good and experienced player of Everton team who scores goals with very strong powerful kicks. And meanwhile Nicolas Jackson is in the Chelsea team as he scores in most of the matches. With such players in the team, the audience will definitely enjoy a competitive game. But today I will bet for Chelsea team because I think Chelsea team is definitely the best this season.",

You have been around for a while and you have even made some replies on the La liga prediction thread so you must be aware of similar predictions threads already. If everyone was to create a new thread for every match then the gambling discussion board must have been over flooded by now so it’s good to keep the board clean and not make irrelevant threads that will flood the board.",

So this is just picking the bookmaker's favorite. It's not so bad to pick the winning teams after all bookies provide hints all the time. And that's what he reasoned above.But we shall see, threads like this are appreciated though. I could have done this myself as I have done it before but I am no expert in this sport, I'm just gonna bet a small amount on the suggested teams. Hope he is going to keep the thread active. Keep the fun rolling, we'll see how far the thread will go.",

      "body": "well, chelsea lost in the game against everton, your prediction failed, but it's not something unusual because chelsea hasn't been doing well for a few years and even when they change coaches they continue to perform poorly, it seems to me that chelsea's problem will be resolved so early, even though they have money, the coaches who work for Chelsea have not been able to make good hires, they are the same as Manchester United, while Everton is improving a lot, in the last 3 games Everton has had victories and has not lost in any game and in the last 5 games Everton had only 1 defeat and they are already leaving the relegation zone, if Everton continues like this then they will be able to stay very far from the relegation zoneabout your prediction of the barcelona game against girona. This is a game that for Barcelona to win, they will need to have a very strong defense, Girona has conceded goals in many games, so in my opinion they have a very weak defense, but Girona has managed to score goals in every game they have. done and barcelona has managed to come out of games without conceding a goal, which shows that barcelona has an acceptable defense, so I see barcelona coming out with victory in this game, I have the same opinion as you in relation to this game between barcelona and the Girona",
