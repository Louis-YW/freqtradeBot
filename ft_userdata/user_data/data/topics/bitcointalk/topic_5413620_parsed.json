But I am assuming the most profitable would of been renting some GPUs and mining ETH with it. However ETH mining is finally coming to an end in about 2 hours. With CPU the most profitable is Monero.",

I am looking for something unique  Are you sure you can use your aws code of $100k for mining? These codes are given for other tasks such as supporting startups and others. As soon as you start mining on a cloud server, you will be blocked because Amazon does not allow you to use their equipment for mining.",
