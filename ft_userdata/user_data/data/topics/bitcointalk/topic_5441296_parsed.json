      "body": "Without getting into how unintelligent someone is or isn't, I don't think Bitcoin is so complicated that an average person with at least a high school diploma can't figure it out in a very short period of time. By that I mean maybe 2-3 hours of lectures, with the condition that the person teaching knows what he is talking about and knows how to make a presentation, because pictures sometimes speak a lot more than words.From my personal experience, I didn't conclude that people can't understand Bitcoin because it's too complicated, but because the idea itself is quite meaningless to them, considering that they are too deep in a system that suits them (most of them). Being your own bank is not something most people want, or better said, people don't want that risk or responsibility.I would therefore conclude that we don't need a simpler Bitcoin, but we need people who think outside the generally set frameworks, and there are very few of them in the world, to be honest. For such a drastic change in thinking, children should be taught from the moment they start elementary school - but it is hard to expect the authorities to work against themselves and suggest to anyone that Bitcoin is something better than what they represent.",

I don't know if that is possible...like some sort of 2nd layer?Also I think once banks start allowing bitcoin exchanging like directly on their website that would be huge. If people no longer have to sign up for a crypto exchange but can transfer fiat into Bitcoin straight on their bank account that would really grease the wheels of adoption. I mean obviously hopefully people would have the bitcoin education to then know that they need to transfer the Bitcoin to their own wallets.

It's an extra step. Which ones have you tried? I believe using Breez (Lightning) is the easiest way to privately use Bitcoin.

It's not a question of complexity; it's a question of desire to learn.Some good points.I think the keys thing makes it seem harder because you can't just remember what you key is and you have to worry about losing it. And then in terms of Lightning there is probably a technical hurdle for most people that makes it a good bit harder than just going to a bank and opening up a bank account.I think we really just need like a standardized education. A few resources that quickly explain things and everyone knows where to go to learn. Instead people have to just google around trying to figure out how things work and hope they are doing things correctly. Basically Bitcoin usage education just needs to enter the common domain where itrs very straightforward to learn how to use it and new people aren't worried about screwing things up. I mean just a few years ago a friend of mine asked me how I get bitcoin and if I can just sell it when I want and I was like what yeah of course i just open up the exchange and can buy or sell at any point. So even just the basics of like hey there are online markets operating 24/7 isn't even well understood by the general public.We need a base level of common knowledge about how to get bitcoin, how to use keys and setup new keys, how bitcoin is stored, how to get on lightning (for the future, not needed yet), how to secure your keys and how to use wallet software. All of (other than maybe setting up lightning) could be taught to someone in 30 minutes, less time than it takes to go to the bank to set up an account. But there just isn't a sense of common knowledge around Bitcoin because there is no single place to go figure it out like say showing up at a bank and they walk you through setting up an account. We need a standardized resource of knowledge that everyone knows about so that when people want to get into Bitcoin they can just go to a website or something and in 30 minutes understand everything they need to know.",

I disagree.People don't really understand a lot of things they are using including fiat. Nobody knows how \"dollar\" works, majority of people don't even know the difference between money and currency or the fact that dollar is not money.The thing is, what people refer to \"understanding\" is just being used to something. You may not know how your computer works but you are still using it to post here.It's the same with bitcoin. Under the hood it is complicated but for the end user it is actually pretty easy and straight forward to use. The only thing is that bitcoin is different from what people are used to and they all want to understand it at technical level.For example you don't really see people ask about the cryptography used in the credit/debit card most people use every day, yet they use it. But you always see them question how 256-bit elliptic curve is secure when it comes to bitcoin!",

The advantages of banks becoming crypto exchanges would be that clients would not have to do additional KYC with various private companies, and that in banks Bitcoin would be secured in case of hacking, as is the case with deposits in savings accounts which (at least in the EU) are insured by the state in the amount of EUR 100 000.But that kind of approach to owning Bitcoin would be completely wrong for me, because if you don't own your private keys, you don't actually own anything. Therefore, it might be better to leave banks aside, because as much as it seems that banks would be a system that would allow Bitcoin to become available in a simple and easy way, let's not forget that one of the reasons why Bitcoin exists is precisely to bypass banks.",

But I don't think it should be the only beginners' resource out there, and other people will prefer different sites and different guides. The fact is that bitcoin is too big a topic to be covered by one guide. Someone could write a great beginners' guide about how to set up and use Electrum, and someone else could come along and decide that Electrum is the wrong wallet for newbies and they should be using Sparrow instead, for example. There will never be complete consensus about the contents of such a resource, and so alternative resources will continue to exist, as they already do.I think it's also a good thing to use a multitude of resources.

      "body": "People only understand the very basics of fiat currencies. The actual process is quite complicated behind the scenes. I've said it in the past, but I believe Bitcoin's biggest problem is it's complexity, and jargon. When new users are asked questions, they're bombarded with jargon which isn't helpful at all as it adds time onto their learning. Bitcoin probably does need to simplify for the end user if we want mass adoption, not because Bitcoin is massively more complex than fiat, but because fiat has already been established, and thus it's taught in schools, universities, and basically right from a young age. Bitcoin isn't, and at the moment there's no real use to teaching young people about Bitcoin, since it's likely not going to be their primary concern. I think wallet UI/UX has already achieved a pretty good standard. Hardware wallets are pretty easy to use. The idea of seed backup might seem alien at first, but is pretty easy to explain, and understand. Security is a big issue, whenever you have the users themselves looking after their security, who don't understand a whole lot about security then that's a problem. However, users are also absolutely awful at fiat security, and the only real backup they have is the banks can reverse any fraudulent activity. Although, the banks can also plain stop you from making transactions, so there's that. Most wallet software adjusts the fee accordingly these days, so there's no real need to manually work it out, unless you want to save as much as possible since they do tend to overestimate. There's a little bit of knowledge required when waiting for confirmations, but that's pretty easy to grasp. I think the main problem is securing your seed, but people have been securing other things for decades. It should be pretty easy for most people. When you start delving under the hood of Bitcoin, then yeah I'd agree it's very complex, but so is fiat currencies. The thing is most people don't really need to delve into it that far, and they don't with fiat currencies.",

In my opinion Bitcoin is fairly simple. In the end, an owner can only keep/store it (a.k.a. HODL) and transfer just like ubiquitous so-called \"digital assets\",Â  money, tokens, secrets etc. I think that irresponsibility (pride and sloth - \"ceasing to utilize the seven gifts of grace\" or the \"brain power\") is the predominant cause of loss of bitcoin/errors by people. The current state of software and hardware tools seem to be of secondary importance and improve with time.",

The easier it is to buy Bitcoin the easier it will be to lose it. Some learning curve is necessary, if you have to use your brain to buy Bitcoin, you will also use your brain to not lose it. I got to know Bitcoin back in 2010 and for me Bitcoin is as easy as FIAT. Even easier in fact. I suspect that people don't want to buy Bitcoin not because they don't know how or they don't want to learn but because they don't want change. Change is frightening, change is uncomfortable. You get used to things, get stuck inside your comfort zone. And no hardware wallet or reversible tx will fix this.",

People are interested of bitcoin because of its price going up rapidly. This being said, many just keep their coins at exchanges without knowing nor caring about the wallets and whether it's easy or not to use them.Now, about the wallets. It can be made easier, actually afaik some custodian wallets use/used to be pretty easy. But yeah, custodian plus made by some developers paid by that company.I kept saying some months and years ago that easier to use wallets should be a plus. It should have been, but that time frame has closed.Now we need safer wallets, then, if possible, easier. And since some hardware wallets makers are going to the direction of making them like credit cards, your wish may come true faster than you'd think. It won't be the wallets people will advise because you won't have the control the established wallets provide, but for some that's OK. You won't reach the safety of the hardware wallets that have their own screen, but again, for some that's not a biggie.So it won't be perfect, but may be something.",
