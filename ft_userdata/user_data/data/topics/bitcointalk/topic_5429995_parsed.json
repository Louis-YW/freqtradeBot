He certainly hasn't played badly, but I doubt he can make a move to a really top team in the Premier league. There are still a number of players from Argentina who play in lower divisions but do play in the national team. There are more examples of this in other countries as well. Now it is time to focus again on the European Championship in 2024.",

If Ecuador had seen further tours we would have heard more of it. Are there any football players or players that caught your attention?Argentina showed that every player both in defense,midfield and attacking had great skillset which helped Argentina win the title since the distant year of 1986 and that undeserved lost game in 1990 against Germany.I also think Mac Allister one of the best players for Argentina together with De Paul they kept all the pressure during tonight final as the battle is won in the midfield.Enner Valencia was already well known compared to Mac Allister but also that substitute player in Holland which I forgot the name,the number 19 who equalized Argentina in quarter finals in 13 minutes is going to be noted.I don't think any other players beside these because all others were already well known.",

The Morocco goalkeeper only conceded three goals, one of which was an own goal.Bono has already been named man of the match twice in the elimination phase, and in the round of 16 the goalkeeper was one of those responsible for preventing Spain from scoring, guaranteeing a place in the quarterfinals. Do you remember that he took two of the three penalties beaten by the Spaniards? The guy is a very good goalkeeper, the best I've ever seen in this cup.And in the Portugal game, the goalkeeper was a \"wall\" against the opponents, preventing the Portuguese team from scoring their goal several times.It is for these reasons that I believe he should be recognized and named as one of the best players in this world cup.",

The full team need to make a good effort to made a good shots. Messi became a World Champion at last before the fair well. It was great game by the team for his experienced player of the team. Because the same was reverse one in Indian Cricket team at the retirement of the world class player M S Dhoni. Even I was a big fan of him, even though I was not belong to their country and their team players doesn’t made a good game for him.",

They are very likely to make a good transfer in the winter transfer window or at the end of the season. I also liked Amrabat's performance very much. There were talented football players in Morocco that stood out. The transfer fees of Boufal and Unahi may be at reasonable levels, but the numbers spoken for Amrabat are very high.Also, I really enjoyed watching Mohammed Kudus from Ghana. He has the potential to mark the coming years. He could have a career that will escalate the Mbappe and Haaland rivalry.",

Morocco's gesture was beautiful when they eliminated Spain in the dressing room towards Nouri, a young player who suffered from a heart problem and will probably never walk or talk again. You don't see other teams doing that very often. Morocco's team spirit has also ensured that they have come this far. Kudus hasn't been able to show enough because Ghana as a country just wasn't strong enough to get through. I haven't spotted many real talents, but Gvardiol from Croatia has made an impression and Morocco also had 2 midfielders very strong. A nice transfer awaits them.",

For me however, Mbappe had always been the focal point of my interest and he proved today why he should be in the spotlight as one of footballs greatest with his impressive performance and goal average. His wages is sure going to skyrocket after this and we hope to see more of his impressive play being replicated in the league cups.",

Correa. in the final match vs France, he really appeared extraordinary, his enthusiasm was tireless. and he contributed an assist, which was continued by D Maria to make it the second goal for Argentina. he deserves to be given the stage to play in a bigger team.Ernest Valensia, this Ecuadorian player. his appearance is truly extraordinary, even though he has entered 33 years of age. but his contribution to Ecuador deserves a thumbs up and he has scored three goals. unfortunately, in the last match against Senegal, his condition had gotten injured before.For goalkeepers, besides Livakovic, Bono, Andries Noppert must also be appreciated. yes he is the goalkeeper of the Dutch national team.  and one more, Emeliano Martinez, absolutely brilliant.Another one, one of the young strikers owned by Portugal. Goncalo Ramos, I think his career will be brilliant with big teams and I'm sure of that.",

There probably are better offensive players than Mbappe, but rules are rules.We could also argue that Argentinian goalkeeper didn't deserve a golden glove.

In the regular games, I also thought Martinez didn't play too good. But, that's how things are. They just gave it to the World Cup winner. I can't agree with that decision.",

Croatia had problems with scoring goals but because of good defensive play and good goalie they finished third.",
