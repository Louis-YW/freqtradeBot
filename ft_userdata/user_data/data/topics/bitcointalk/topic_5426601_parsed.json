They're mostly the people that will really take care of the status that they've made and as in anything that they've achieved because they've worked hard from it.But those that go easy on their lives even if they've come from nothing and turned into a hero but without discipline, they're the ones that falls at most times.It sums up to the idea that the biggest and most important thing in terms of money-related topics should be studied well like from having the basic knowledge on money handling and also to monitor the spending habits.",

      "body": "There are numerous reasons on why a wealthy individual or investor could suddenly lose all the accumulated wealth and go bankrupt overnight. Greed plays an important role in investors losing out on their investments. When an investment looks too good to be true, it most likely is. People fail to realize this early enough and only when it’s too late and impossible to back out, that is when the most clears from the mind. I think greed is the no 1 and most important factor that makes investors lose out. There are numerous reasons, of course but greed, in my opinion trumps all.",

Its easier to look from the outside and say the person squandered his money or didn't invest well or was greedy.I've seen a rich man spend all he has in the treatment of his daughter when she got sick. In fact it was all his family has.It may be that the person didn't invest well or he did and lost his investment like the case of FTX  or a nasty devorce. There are so many possibilities  so you cant just pick out one or two and say here it is, here is the reason this person lost all his money. Life's not black and white. A devorce can lead to depression. Depression can lead to drugs and alcohol. Drugs can lead to bankruptcy. So there is no definite reason why people go from \"grace to grass'\".",

When you're young you can change as much as you want and have less you need to spend on too but as you get older you become more static and fixed (if you fall into the trap I guess). This is for the few % of people that don't fall under mk4's 3 other methods.Some people just get bored and give up or try to find themselves in younger people and lose their money that way.",

The exceptions being company owners who do not cash out and diversify before their company crashes for some reason. Besides that you tend to find the people who start with big money and end up with nothing are 2nd or 3rd generations within a rich family who never actually had to learn how to make money but will fritter it away very fast. It's extremely easy to spend money even when you have lots of it, but understanding how to retain it and live within your means can be too much for certain people who never had to go out and grind it.",

Surely, they will soon bounce back and will reach the status again of being financially stable as long as they will be serious about overcoming the problems they have encountered.",

They were bad investors in the first placeThe points you said are correct and apart from your response I have read some response who only looking at the individual, that is the person fault that couldn't grow beyond the nose and push his business far and more. I have know that some business also crash not because the individual has no good plan or his fault but that government policy can crash someone out of business. I have see this happen different times. If the government policy is hard on your line of business the rate of survival for the business can get affected. Banning some kind of goods commodities into the country is example.War can also affect business and we can all see what is happening in Ukraine as example. Some company will crash because of war.Disaster both natural and human, disaster like flood can cause even a community to crash, lose everything etc A business location in the flood area is not surviving.",

So sometimes when people that were doing so well financially start reducing to nothing then it's not just that they failed to strategize perhaps it could be that they put forward a wrong strategy as  financial plan.2: Yes, failure to put more effort to keep maintaining their financial status could be one reason for a financial downfall of an individual. There's so much competition within the business environment and any one that slacks in effort is giving room to the upliftment of another at their own peril. It's just like the saying goes \"if you snooze you lose\".",
