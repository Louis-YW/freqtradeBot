I think that Bitcoin will go to $50,000 but not in 2025, maybe in 2026.$50k seems possible in 2025. Because Bitcoin has already crossed $68k once so crossing $50k is not a big challenge for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a very potential currency for the future.  Bitcoin is constantly making great records and so Bitcoin will make a record in the future that we cannot even imagine. Bitcoin's popularity is increasing because it is completely decentralized, so its transactions cannot be deleted in any way. A bank account can be hacked, bank servers can be hacked, physical money can be stolen, but Bitcoin is almost impossible to hack if it is kept in a non-custodial wallet or a hardware wallet. And there is no accountability for using or trading Bitcoin. If you keep huge money in the bank, you have to show the source of income for it, but in Bitcoin, huge amount of money can be kept hidden. And that's why Bitcoin is very popular with almost everyone and its popularity will continue to increase in the future",

I think that Bitcoin will go to $50,000 but not in 2025, maybe in 2026.It’s not bad to coat your expectations low, at least it will help curb the anxiety of selling when your expectations are really high. If you really want to accumulate bitcoin now na and your thinking of setting the price to $50k in 2025 probably that’s when you will like to take profit I would say it is a realistic goal considering that bitcoin has been way up there before, the current ATH is $69k and from the past bitcoin halving, the bull run occurs after it and bitcoin usually surpasses it’s ATH a year after that. So with this it seems that bitcoin will be above $50k that year and was of it be around that value then. My advice is do not only use the profits eye to invest because this could lead you to invest more than you can afford to lose which is not a good idea when investing into bitcoin. Investing what you can afford to lose doesn’t make bitcoin a pump and dump project but just to make you feel relax while holding them. So do not be afraid and start accumulating using the DCA method. Quote from: Peter3493 on September 25, 2023, 08:04:41 AMBitcoin's key features include decentralization, security via blockchain technology, limited supply (21 million coins), and peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.The subject of the thread seems like an error in spelling probably because OP isn’t an English speaking person.

And going along with the question content, I believe Bitcoin can surpass $50k  when the bull run market in 2025 rampages.  2025 is the year where most of us thinks Bitcoin will break its all-time high.Aside from that, this topic should be moved to the Speculation.",

And it can be 50,000 dollars, but when that will happen another time is hard to say. Halving should set a new course, and I think it will be higher than now.But the current development in America and Europe is not so good. A few exchanges will have to stop their service, or changed. The MiCA regulation of the EU is to be fully implemented at the end of 2024. Binance had to stop their service in a few countries and they are only allowed to use their stablecoin until the beginning of 2024.",

Bitcoin has always exceeded its past ATH in any bull run, so I am expecting the coin to at least be above the last ATH of  $69,045.00 next year. Maybe the price might settle at $50,000 after the bull run. I can't really predict what the price will be in 2024 and 2025 because many unpredictable events will affect the price. The US election, the approach of the new president towards Bitcoin, and the state of the global economy amongst others will play some key factors in 2025-2026.",

I don’t think the predicted bitcoin price is low, considering the current price of bitcoin and the fluctuation of world economy, which is also a contributor to the increase in price of bitcoin. What should be considered as a thing is the price it’ll fall back to after the bullish shift in price. After hitting 50k for instance will it drop down to 20k again? With the rate at which users and investors are talking about the next bullish run, it sounds to me as a take your profit investment plan. Once the price rises everyone pulls back their investment and profit, causing an early bearish market. Quote from: Shumyl on September 25, 2023, 07:30:10 AMWhat do you think about what is the feature of Bitcoin, can Bitcoin touch $50,000 in 2025? I think that Bitcoin will go to $50,000 but not in 2025, maybe in 2026.This is just speculation and I don’t have a personal exact prediction for the price of bitcoin, but the possibility of bitcoin hitting $75k is there because it’s beginning to trend that bitcoin will pump, but the investment outcome may not be like the 2021 bullish run, as a lot of people who lost money during that period may not throw money into bitcoin again. The crypto market crisis; hacks, rug pulls, etc have taken away multiple investors out of the market. Couple with the fact that these crisis keep happening often during the bull run. People are expected to stay careful, especially those who don’t understand the market. Unless a fresh audience of investors comes to try bitcoin, I see a lesser turn up from those that bought bitcoin at 50k and lost it all down to 20k+.",

Of course yes, the reason is that bitcoin last ATH was 69k and from history bitcoin ATH has always been higher than the previous ATH. We might start the bull run in late 2024 or early of 2025 because after the halving the next event is the bull run, and the halving will be on April, 2024.

With all the indications and with all things being equal, we are very much hopeful that it will get to $50,000 and even surpass it.The awareness of bitcoin has been growing in leaps and bounds, so are more people adopting and investing in it.Right from the Inception of bitcoin till now, you can see how successful the growth rate has been consistent over this year's.  In the nearest feature, a lot of people would want to keep their financial transactions very private and personal and Bitcoin avails you with that kind of option.So I'm very optimistic that there is more success to attain in the nearest feature.",
