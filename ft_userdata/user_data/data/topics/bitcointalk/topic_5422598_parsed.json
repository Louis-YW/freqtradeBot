  "content": "Hey,I did put some of my BTC into the BTC/USDT Liquidity pool at yobit half a year ago and did accumulate 120 USDT in YoFarm Rewards so far.When I try to claim my Rewards I get the Error message: \"Please wait...\"After receiving the Error message a few time I contacted Yobit Support at 11th April 2022.No answer. One month later I tryed again (10th May 2022). Again no answer. 2022-11-10: The issue is still not fixxed and I decided to remove my Liquidity and withdraw it. Worked fine but my Reward is still pending and support keeps ignoring my messages.Does anyone have similar experience whith Yobit?",

You can visit the scam section of the forum and try the search word \"yobit\" and you will see the huge number of complaints against the platform.By the way, Yobit has never been interested in establishing a good reputation. Even the Scam projects it manages have created their own forum to promote them. I don't know if that forum is still working today, but surely many of the members here remember how Yobit used to run a signature campaign here on the forum to promote its forum.Honestly, it did not occur to me that there are people who are still using this fraudulent platform, especially among the members here in the forum.",

I have gotten any significant money i got in there out in the past without problems, but everything they do screams a ponzi and scam. Promises of high profits from their weird virtual mining system was just stupid. And that was first exchange that advertised their \"icos\" by email, just by saying there's a new ico. Without at any point explaining what they are selling.They are even selling \"tokens\" without tokenomics or decentralization, so basically they are just numbers on their screen without possibility to withdraw.I never got one response from their \"help desk\" (or what ever it was called) when i lost tiny amount money that i deposit. It's the scammiest exchange out there, yet ironically it has outlived many reputable exchanges.",

Although it's likely they buy fake follower since the engagement number (like, reply, etc.) is very low.Yobit is one of the early exchanges, I think they started somewhere in 2014. after 8+ years, it is to be expected that they have a large number of followers, especially if we know that they had several campaigns where the following was one of the conditions. The importance of their Twitter account and how realistic that audience is is best shown by the fact that despite having 170k followers, they only have 15-20 retweets. they seem to be completely irrelevant like 90% of their followers.",

Maybe someone introduce him to this kind of shit and deceive newbies that they can earn by yofarm reward on yobit. Starting up people on crypto need to know that yobit is bad exchange and they should always do their research and never invest there money base on their first impression only look only for quality review or advice coming from experience people especially coming from people here in forum.",
