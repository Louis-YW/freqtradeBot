Then FIFA announced and appointed Indonesia to be the substitute host for this World Cup, maybe this had something to do with the cancellation of the U20 World Cup which was to be held in Indonesia, so FIFA considered Indonesia because it had previously prepared everything for the World Cup in the age group.This may be medicine for Indonesia after the previous big disappointment because they failed to host the U20 World Cup.",

Talking about favorites, I don't know which team to favorite because Indonesia (my country) will also be playing in this tournament. Of course, there's no doubt that I will favor Indonesia regardless of whether they are a weak or strong team.BTW, It's quite a surprise to see the U-17 world cup taking place in Indonesia after the U-21 world cup was canceled in this country.",

Previously, the Indonesia youth national team successfully won the U-16 AFF Cup last year, I think the squad Indonesia U-17 this years will be filled with young players who have won achievements at that time.But in reality it will be very tough for Indonesia, because reigning champions Brazil will probably have a higher chance to win the title, considering their are also having produced a lot of professional players.",

I just feel with so much talents on this young team it will be hard for other teams like the Brazilians to come close.",

Only UEFA hosts EURO U-21 tournaments for the youths in the European countries. Also Africa only follows FIFA model, U-17, U20, U-23 (Olympic Squad). In few months time, we will find out the country with the best footballers in teenagers football. I think France would do well to win the competition.",

Some examples: the Mali team was runner-up in 2015, and 4th place in 2017. Switzerland was champions in 2009, and Nigeria has won the tournament 4 times.What I can say is only what I know, the Brazilian team. They are the current champions of the tournament and also the current South American champions (without lose any match). The team is really good and if anyone is interested, the team will play on the June 27th (tomorrow) and the 30th, two friendly matches against MexicoDuring the championship I will analyze whether the bets will be worthwhile. I believe Brazil will be the favorite",

As mentioned by OP, CAF qualified teams are Burkina Faso, Mali, Morocco and Senegal.",

Actually little difficult for predicting which one national teams are favorite with junior level competition, as Indonesian not get impressive performance last edition with U17 squad and we don't have junior competition right now. Its difficult for Indonesian teams can talk more in FIFA U17 because other teams participants they have competition for junior level and make their head coach easy build teams. However, I have big expectation with FIFA U17, Indonesian teams can qualify from group phase because seems realistic target.",

So, I think, this is just like the early world cup where each talented player meets in a tournament, and we are not surprised if we can see several football agents will take a seat on supporter stands to look for a future talented player.My favorite is Indonesia, but I can't force it, because I know how they play, So I think Brazil will be the champion again, and meet Argentina in the Final.",

A lot of people are going to complain that UEFA is under-represented, but I am quite OK with the current setup.
