Só your transaction is not stuck and the btc is still with you.What do you mean by \"get your it back\"?? Can't you see that money in your wallet?Do you have the transaction id?If you can't see the money, the transaction might have Confirmed or you just need to resend/rebroadcast it You can rebroadcast here https://www.blockchain.com/btc/pushtx",

      "body": "It is a little bit odd that you have been in the cryptocurrency space for so long and haven't yet bothered to read how transactions behave after they get into mempool. If the mempool was congested at that time and you accidentally had set a very low fee, there was a little chance that your transaction got through. Bitcoin full nodes allocate a limited amount of memory for mempool and keep only those transactions that pay above a certain limit. This limit depends on how congested the bitcoin mempool is: transactions with low fee rates may never appear for some nodes, and, therefore, never get propagated to miners' full nodes. Transactions that never get a confirmation get removed from the network as if there weren't any actions on your part. Only those transactions that miners add into a successful block will matter due to the immutability of the blockchain, but other transactions lose their significance forever.",

If he/she decides to broadcast it again, your funds will be gone. So, if you abondon the transaction, then spend the unspent output, you should be safe.Now, in all honesty, if you just abondon the transaction, you're probably fine...

Next time, be sure of the payment, mempool and fees associated before pressing the Go button.It has nothing to do with time... If you interprete the op's posts, it seems the transaction isn't confirmed. If the op makes sure it's never broadcasted again and he is able to spend the unspent output in a new transaction, his funds are safe and he doesn't have to \"forget about the transaction\". If the transaction ended up in a block 7 years ago, you would have been 100% correct since a confirmed transaction with more than a handfull of confirmations could be seen as irreversible (even a single confirmation makes it irreversible from a normal user's point of view, unless they're willing to spend a lot of money on a 51% attack or if they're extremely unlucky and the block including their transaction becomes stale whilst the block in the longest chain doesn't include their transaction)Also, a transaction is wallet-agnostic, if you are able to access or export the private keys from the initial wallet, it doesn't matter if said wallet was created 7 years ago, you should be able to use the unspent output in a new transaction. Sure it's possible it'll require some extra steps, but if the value of the unspent output makes it worth your wile to take these steps, it shouldn't be impossible.",

With wallets, private keys etc.I spent the whole weekend, and I moved tiny 0.0006 btc from old Core to new Electrum, and I did it a \"strange\" and complicated way. But I learned so much about wallets and private keys.And I have similar approach concerning this stuck transaction. If I accomplish this task, I'll learn a lot.I'll try different ways to do it, and I want to start with a simplest method which can be available to try.If it doesn't work, I am going to try a more complicated way, and so on.Until I either get those btc back to my wallet or discover that it is impossible.This is my plan :-)I understood that the easiest option is \"to abandon\" transaction. May be it will work, may be it will not, but this one is simplest.

You won't need to abandon it from Electrum because it won't exist in Electrum in the first place and Electrum will be entirely unaware of it.

The transaction in question was never broadcast, and so the coins it spends were not spent in that transaction. However, it seems that this transaction conflicts with another transaction which did go through normally. This means that at least some of the coins used in your stuck transaction have since been spent in this other transaction with 30,000 confirmations. However, it may be that all of the coins from the stuck transaction have already been spent.Since Electrum is completely unaware of this stuck transaction, then any coins it spends which haven't since been spent by another transaction should show up normally in your Electrum wallet. You can also look up each input from the stuck transaction on a blockchain explorer to see if that input has since been spent by another transaction.",

(LOL).I'm not sure if you are misunderstanding or there is a translation barrier, but transactions cannot be spent and also disappear. Either your transaction is successfully broadcast to the network and then later confirmed (in which case it is spent), or your transaction is only saved locally, never broadcast, and therefore never spent. If it is only saved locally and no one else in the world knows about it, then you can also delete it locally without having any effect on the wider blockchain. Rarely a transaction can be broadcast and later invalidated, but that is another discussion and not really relevant to what is going on here.Quote from: Gorilla22 on September 26, 2022, 05:39:37 PMAsking just to upgrade my knowledge.  Is it so that any stuck transaction can be spent in blockchain?If a transaction has been saved locally and not broadcast, then you can broadcast it at a later date provided you haven't spent any of the coins being used by that transaction in other transactions in the meantime. If a transaction has been broadcast but is \"stuck\" because the fee is very low, then there are a variety of options available to you in order to bump the fee and increase the priority of your transaction.Quote from: Gorilla22 on September 26, 2022, 06:00:26 PMPreferably using Electrum, as I try to avoid sync.May be to import more keys from Core?
