I tried bypassing it but have had no success so far.@theymos, is this here to stay? loyce's and bpip's scraper also seems to be down? (paging @LoyceV, @suchmoon, @ibminer).",

I may have found a possible workaround, but I didn't have the time to test it.1. If Cloudflare pops up, calls a function that invokes a puppeteer page (an instance of chrome) to the forum and waits for CF to clear out.2. Grabs the cookie from CF that lets you use the forum normally and passes it to all my other headless requests.There is a chance that CF could ask me to solve a captcha though, so that would be a dead end.",

I use cookies for other tasks, but none of them were running so I can't tell if it would have worked.Bpip fed cookies under Vod's code (it probably still does) to get user info so we probably already know the issue still persisted during that time.I wonder if this was resolved by whitelisting everything or just the bots, we probably won't find out similarly to if this was something automated by CF, an accidental kill switch triggered or was implemented for a reason (all are quite likely).Based on the up time of this forum, there has to be multiple people with access to all connection information (there's probably more that could do defensive operations too - such as a controlled rerouting or changing certain cloudlfare settings to improve performance or limit some more intense pingers).",

If Cloudflare pops up, calls a function that invokes a puppeteer page (an instance of chrome) to the forum and waits for CF to clear out.I have a prototype of a parser that works entirely via Playwright/Firefox and even solves captchas but it'd be quite absurd to use it. Not only because it needs an ungodly amount of RAM to work, but also because it looks like we're going against the policy (unwritten as it may be) of Cloudflare and/or Bitcointalk. This needs to be solved properly, i.e. by implementing some sort of whitelist/key/whatever. Not by trying to hack the damn thing.Edit: my other parser that I use for plagiarism checks is still running albeit intermittently, not sure what the difference is that makes this one kinda sorta work.",

(paging @LoyceV, @suchmoon, @ibminer).True, I can't scrape anything - getting 503 errors.Strange it may seem but this is what I figured out for now if you navigate to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php you will still get 503 error. However if you navigate to to any other page or only https://bitcointalk.org/ it bypasses Cloudflare For example: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php                         Error 503https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=stats      Error 503https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1634314          200 OKhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422131.0                       200 OKhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;stats=recent          200 OKI think only theymos can guide here more.Edit: Strangely enough you can bypass Cloudflare for the home page just by adding any parameter e.g. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?s=1",

I guess it redirects to index.php and throws the error, but at that point the login is completed and cookies should be good so I'll try to ignore that error and see if it can load any other pages afterwards. It just sucks having to code all these sketchy workarounds that will probably break the next time Cloudflare tweaks something.",
