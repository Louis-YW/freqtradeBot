I thought this was 18 months low right? We have never seen bitcoin going less than 30k since last December as far as i can probably remember. I am sure it is not because of this anti environment fallacy and definitely not because of fed doing some random things with dollar because if that would have been the reason I am sure bitcoin would have pumped instead of going down. It's just mere market manipulations that are going on and won't stop until there is some good bullish consolidation.",

      "body": "10 month low was in May when we fell below the lows of July 2021 This is the problem of bear markets and bull markets. In bull people buy at the top thinking that since it was going up for the last X months there's no stopping it now. In bear people do the opposite, thinking that if it kept falling for X months it will continue forever. That's why most people never make money and I personally know a guy with that exact mentality. He always waits to buy at lows because he wants to see a reversal. When it reverses he never buys because he waits until it's confirmed, not a fakeout. Then he finally buys at the end of a bull market because it's finally confirmed to him and holds because he wants big profit - at least 100%. Then it corrects and he holds as long as he's in profit because in his mind it can bounce back at any minute. Finally he sells it all at a loss and goes into this state of depression where he doesn't talk to me for months. He suddenly appears when we're well in the next bull market to ask if he should buy because bitcoin is starting to look good again, and so it goes for the last 8 years, or so. Believe it or not, he first bought bitcoin in 2015 and after all these years made not more than 10%.",

I think even a newbie trader would spot a consolidation phase which usually takes a long time before we enter a bull market.",

Again, this argument will continue to go in the next 10 years and I doubt that the anti-bitcoiner will stop.

If we look at the bottom of March 2020 we see that those who bought at that time, it was very profitable, and those who sold, did so at the bottom. The problem is that when it goes down a lot, you can't be sure that it won't go down any further. The fact that the price has not fallen from the previous cycle's peak (at least significantly and for some time) is not a universal law that cannot be broken. The best thing to do is to make several staggered purchases at the level you consider cheap.",

This is a situation that may not be favorable for previous investors but will certainly be very profitable for those who arrive late because the opportunity to buy at a discount just appears. But traders' concerns and the panic they experienced had sent prices lower as support was unable to withstand the heavy selling pressure. I'm sure sooner or later the price will form a new pattern, this will be good in the future.",

I'm sure sooner or later the price will form a new pattern, this will be good in the future.The aggressive interest rate hikes are because of inflation. We have been in an inflation for a while now, due to pandemic free money printing period. Not that this is a better option, but at least it is more controllable situation. With the interests so high, people would take their money out of the markets, and into the interests, which will leave a lot less money available for the world to use. In this regard, everything will stagger, the growth will stop and inflation will go down.Of course, it will bring poverty with it as well, people who are wealthy got the money and put it on interest, people who are poor, will be living in fear of not knowing when the next money will come, but it will get better hopefully.",

Like the others are telling, they can wait even more before the price goes down for some more because all of them believes that this isn't the bottom yet and there's more that will make the price even lower.",

Even if bitcoin was at its peak, they still created black propagandas for bitcoin so its either we ignore them, or believed in them and lose instantly. I guess they don't realized that this is what we have waited for long to happen, to see bitcoin in a very cheap price so we can buy a lot of bitcoin for our portfolio and see us profiting in the end, while them leaving in envy.",
