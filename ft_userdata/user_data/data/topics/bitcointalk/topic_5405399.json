  "content": "To join this year's Premier League prediction pool please send 0.0025 to the following address:bc1qqwars3nf5hpa93an33pwyw3a9qvxzu3qztaenyhttps://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qqwars3nf5hpa93an33pwyw3a9qvxzu3qztaenyOr scan and pay with the QR code:Once you've paid the 0.0025 to the above address please PM me with the txid and I will send you a link to join the pool on superbru. You can sign up to superbru here: https://www.superbru.com/tournaments/football/premier-league/The Premier League starts in a month's time on the 6th of August so you have until then to pay the entry fee but please pay as soon as you can. I may give a week or two grace period to pay if you can't pay by the start of the season but a month should be enough time. You can sign-up to Superbru now and you can always join the pool at a later date and your scores will carry over. If you're unfamiliar with how the tournament works please see the previous thread here, but basically we will be using the Superbru website which is free and easy to use. You input your score predictions for every game and you get 3 points for predicting the exact score, 1 for the correct outcome (win, lose or draw) and 1.5 for a close prediction. The winner will obviously be the person who gets the most points at the end of the season. Sportsbet.io are sponsoring the pool again and have put BTC0.2 into the pot along with offering a free $50 bet to every weekly winner who scores the most points that round so that's 38 chances to win a free $50 bet. Big thanks to jeremypwr and Sportsbet for sorting that out. As usual, 100% of the money received will be split between the top ten placed users at the end of the season. The first place jackpot prize will be a guaranteed 0.1BTC and then the rest of the money will be split between 2nd-10th places. If we get 50 users signing up that will be a further 0.125 in the pot so there should be over 0.3 in total. 48 users joined last season so we should be able to get 50+ this year especially as the sponsorship pot has doubled. There will also be a small consolation prize for the person who gets the highest overall weekly round score so even if it becomes clear as the tournament progresses that you're unlikely to win a paid spot you still have a chance of winning something along with the $50 weekly round free bet.",

This means I'd prefer not to freeroll any of the regulars who join in every season anyways You got the merits for free-rolling new people. Just wanted to point it out since I quite like Superbru and actually prefer 3 points for correct score way more than 5. If you raise points for correct score you are just giving it all to lady luck. I feel like close scores actually reward knowledge to the maximum and would like to see them rewarded more.I am in of course for premier league pool. Looking forward to fighting it out with all the usual suspects once again.",

I'm not sure about my participation though, mostly for the reason that it significantly affects my enjoyment of watching PL.
