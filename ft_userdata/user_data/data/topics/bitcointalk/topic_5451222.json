While I like the optimism of the OP I can really understand the post of the OP because it is simply a statement that has no question or new statement. Maybe you can explain more how you come to bitcoin and what is your motivation to write here?",

There are still not so many people using cryptocurrencies, so mining infrastructure is not able to work properly with number of transactions greater than it is now. So there are still problems to be solved. And, in general, there is also a way for fiats to become crypto-like. Now fiats are digital too, and it's possible to develop blockchain and decentralised network for them. This can affect the price of BTC.",

Is there any research to do before knowing the risk involve? Those who not not participated yet also know that there is risk. And those who are the opponent of bitcoin take bitcoin as their enemy because of the risk involve. And for those who are bitcoin fans invest in it and see the goodness from it at the end of the their patient investment. Every bitcoinner must know that bitcoin is an alternative asset to the fiat currency. And if the fiat currency do well with bitcoin it will be nice.",
