But i'd like to mention the private key/address is overlapped on my browser (Firefox).Quote from: AlexanderCurl on July 13, 2022, 07:54:26 PM- Check address balance from bloomfilter file database with play sound when foundI add address from 1st page to bloomfilter and restart the server, only to found out the sound is quite loud. A warning would be appreciated in future .Quote from: AlexanderCurl on July 13, 2022, 07:54:26 PM- BloomFilter file creation (first download txt database from http://addresses.loyce.club/)I only try it with small txt file, but what's RAM usage of this tool use when we use list address from Loyce?",

I believe that keeping something you found isn't illegal everywhere.Let's keep is aside, as it is very difficult problem. Owner may have strong proof that he owns coins moved, but on opposite it will be difficult for him to proof that it was not him who moved the coin. On the other hand, talking about about keeping what you found - in some jurisdiction you are obliged to return it to the state - if for example you find a 500 year old coin on beach.Project is interesting, especially idea to create a \"subsets\" of results modifying generator point. However I am not sure about any practical use (in terms of BTC).",

If the private key isn't random, it can be brute-forced much easier.It goes off-topic but when I think about it, I think it is not worst than brain wallet. At the end, what we receive from brain wallet is not \"random\" too. And knowing part of brainwallet we may try to brute-force the rest. At the end in one case we talk about sha256 and in other case as a base58 decoding.The idea behind Vanity WIF (do not blame me, I have never did that personally, I was just contacted by some people who use my program to generate that WIFs) is to be able to remember WIF partially, knowing that it is technically possible to restore the missing part. That way we may have known \"human readable\" part (date, sentence, etc). and have part which is calculated by program, looking for a correct (importable) WIf. Of course one may decide to do extra steps, like prepare WIF in uncompressed form, extract private key and then use it in compressed form - but it is an extra complication, which could cause other problems (\"I forgot how I did that 5 years ago\").As a Post Scriptum I may add that we all are humans, years of evolution caused we have ability to find patterns. We may say one text \"is random\" while other is not. We may say that WIF cannot contain the same characters repeated 10 times, because we feel it is unnatural. But the chance for that is exactly like the chance for any other combination. Additionally, let's do not forget about different languages. English words has no meaning in Dutch or Spanish and vice versa. Random letters would mean nothing for me, but they could be a \"Hello World\" in Chinese.Like they say, if you take many monkeys and they will press random typewriter keys for a long enough, one of them will finally write the whole \"Hamlet\".",
