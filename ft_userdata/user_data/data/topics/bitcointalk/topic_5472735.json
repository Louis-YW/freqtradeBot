  "content": "hey guys, I was watching this video, where a popular twitch streamer who used to gamble and stream on twitch, had betted millions on slots and on online casino and losing till now.watch and listen that video he tells why he thinks slots is rigged, the games are not random as the website shows. if you will see his more videos you will understand why is think like that.I think he just talked about slots, but I also think games that are told provably fair by casinos are rigged in someway. Here's a example what happens with me:When I bet big suddenly on crash game on stake it every time stops and seems like the computer is thinking about results after waiting for sometimes i bust at 1x to 1.10x, I would had believed that it is random when this incident happens with me once or twice but it happened with me more than 10 times, I betted my all funds but every time on crash it waits and think to how to bust me on short time.other incidents are with mines when I bet big on mines even when selected on one bomb when i click to flip that box, the computer thinks and gives me small two or three wins then bust my all funds.this incident is happened with me more than 6times on stake. dragon tower is father of all games here I never won on even taking lowest risk.what do you think about this? are games which are played by computers are rigged? don't answer like we play for fun, we are responsible, we are bitcoiner we know to verify bets, etc.",

      "body": "With hundreds of players placing bets on Stake, there could always be another bettor winning on the other end, so I wouldn't say it's straight-up rigged. I've experienced the same losses whenever i'm upping my bet size, but I think it's more about the house edge tipping the numbers in favor of the casino than the game being rigged. Also, slots have one of the worst win probabilities, so it's expected to see gamblers lose frequently. I've heard a similar discussion where they said the developers can cause bigger betting sizes to lose more, but I can't tell if it's true.",

Then, all-of-your statement is based only on opinion because you're losing like my favorite quote for gambling:- Win = I keep playing on these casino- Lose = This game is rigged.If you playing type game like (Slot) or something like that (computer), you should know is not good against the player. 98-99% you are gonna to lose money, go to casino and playing (card-games) like BJ with card-counting skill at least. One more favourite qouteQuoteMost gambler are quit before they hitting the jackpot, remember you only 1% way to hit the jackpot ~XD",

I doubt they will rigged the game while they can be caught cheating through their probably fair system. You only feel this because you bet big. You will notice everything if you are wagering what you can’t afford to lose since you will just ignore that bust bet if you only bet a penny on that round. Your luck is just bad at the time you choose to increase your bet. Check your bet history, You will notice that experience tons of this kind of early busy multiplier but you just not paying much attention on it because the amount involved is too small.",

      "body": "The randomness of games has nothing to do with graphics. In fact, crash games are some of the few that run on provable fairness no matter which platform hosts them. Learn how provably fair works, you can yourself verify randomness without any space for doubt this way. The thing with streamers though, is that it's a whole other level of deception. They will never teach you about provable fairness, they will never tell you when they're on someone's payroll and never disclose that they are playing with provided funds. It's a crazy industry. You shouldn't trust what gambling streamers say, their shown winnings or anything. So trainwrecks is right on the first part of the video, but when he talks about seeds it gets confusing. In a normal provable fairness setting you should be able to reveal your seed when needed and also add your own inputs for generating one for extra randomness. Also RTP doesn't work on an individual basis, it works all across the board. If you lose all of your balance there's no way you're getting  it back but the RTP means that whoever is winning gets paid more than their balance. In the long run, a game can be profitable even with 1% house edge. There's tons of games that work with such a low house edge in crypto and a good example is dice sites even prime dice and bustabit which are some of the sites with the largest potential win. Both sites are provably fair and you can test the fairness of every wager if you'd like. The streamer you linked is a good guy, but like even the scummy gambling streamers, he doesn't explain things in a way that would teach people to stay safe. Yes, blanket statements like saying \"don't gamble\" throw the issue out of the window but they don't address anything. People are going to gamble anyway so they better know. So my suggestions would be:a. learn about provable fairness b. check your bets and verify their fairnessThis way at least you won't have any doubts next time.",

If you are really that having doubts about someones legitimacy then it would really be just that right that you should really be sticking into those places on which you do see that most people been playing because this is something that you could be able to trust on.",

The problem I think comes from the people who expect to have a lot of payback because of how much they have spent and that could be true for some case but what if you don't?",
