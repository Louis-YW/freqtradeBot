  "content": "Since 2009 when Bitcoin was launched by satoshi, Bitcoin has performed better than most physical currencies. Why I create this thread is to define the role of decentralized digital currency like Bitcoin as an alternative currency in the economy, and to dispute the claim by some Bitcoin haters that discard Bitcoin as a none physical represented currency and only exists on the Internet.But Bitcoin has out performed most physical currencies such as the dollars and the rest of other centralized currencies. Due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin it allow bitcoin to be use anywhere and at any time without any restrictions. Bitcoin perform the role that other currencies can not serve any purpose, take for example if you leave and saved your money in your local bank currencies and it happens that you traveled to another country you may have problem with apending your money and tou bank savings may become useless and the only option will be Bitcoin as the only alternative.Note: this explanation was born out of my own personal experience, and i hope others here will share similar experience too!",

At the beginning people feared and have a different opinion over bitcoin as an asset developed for the purpose of gambling and illegal transactions. With time people started to accept the true value as the price of bitcoin started to grow.Inflation is experienced all around, and people are moving much towards cryptocurrency. Some banks out of bankruptcy doesn't allow people to withdraw their own money in the bank. Bitcoin have served as people's own bank securing our holdings.",

It's very hard to use a currency that has an unstable value to replacedthe current currency we are using right now. For me Bitcoin is best to categorized as an asset and not pure currency since its value is increasing like Gold over time but Bitcoin has an advantage since its supply is limited while Gold, Fiat and other precious metal has an unlimited supply.",

So even though Bitcoin does not have a physical value its digital value is still a.high against other assets in the exchange market.That is why, Bitcoin is referred to as digital gold since Bitcoin have increased in market capitalization in recent time, and also the rate of Bitcoin adoption is also on the increase, bitcoin serves as the best alternative in both currency and assets.",

It's not a great idea to have a million dollars in your bank account and just watch it getting eaten by inflation, but it's also not a smart move to put it all in Bitcoin and risk losing a big portion of it.

It would be best to wait a while, and compare it once everything has settled down. Usually, prospective investments whether that be stocks or Bitcoin tend to have massive inclines, and declines at the beginning, as people are still feeling them out. Obviously, Bitcoin is designed this way too, and while the idea is it should be deflationary over time, and therefore already suggesting it will perform better than any other currency which is inflationary, that does remain to be seen, and confirmed. There's a lot that can happen between now, and then so I'm not counting my chickens yet.",

Of course bitcoin has no physical representation, being a digital currency but that haven't stopped it from playing its role I'm the economy.One thing you got right is the fact that, bitcoin is an alternative currency. As an alternative currency, it should be used when the needs arises and I think that's what bitcoin holders and holders are doing. The lack of used cases as per merchants that accepts bitcoin is what have made it less rampant but the currency keeps striving to be known and continues to solve problems in our today society.",

It may be convenient because you don't need to prepare foreign currency when traveling, but have you taken into account the volatility of bitcoin? we know that bitcoin is volatile, and can even drop 20% to 40% in just a few days, how can you travel comfortably when your assets have almost halved in value in just a few days? It is true that bitcoin has many advantages over fiat but in some cases fiat is still useful and beneficial to us. To me, bitcoin is more suitable as an asset or a commodity than as a currency.",

It's true that Bitcoins came a long way from it's initial price of less than 1 USD, but these prices are long gone. Most of the investors we have in the crypto market today haven't been around in 2009. Me personally I only started with crypto currencies in 2016, that is why I think it's wrong to compare the prices we are seeing today with the prices over 10 years ago. Looking too far back into the past makes you feel bad that you haven't invested earlier in Bitcoins and somehow let' you hope that prices will fall again to a similar level to get a second chance to buy so cheap again. This second chance is not realistic and we shouldn't be hoping for it. It's better to look at the more recent prices of Bitcoins, we see that up until 2021 the price fluctuated around the 10,000 USD level. Comparing that to today it's still a pretty got development for any currency.",
