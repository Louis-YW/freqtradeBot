I do let my wife phone which has no important data at all to mine Pi although I know it won't get far.Just read the news all over coinmarketcap and other similar websites and they all have a red disclaimer suggesting to anyone to be cautious and to do due diligence before investing in such coin.I honestly believe this will go nowhere as it lack community support and it does not solve any real life problem at all.I strongly agree that this post will definitely not age well.",

We had plenty of these and most are quickly forgotten after a short while.The fact that it was written in poor English with spelling mistakes and crazy exaggerations leads me to believe that they are paying people to shill this token.",

Bro enlighten me more why won't it age well for me , is it against the rules of the forum? There have been many before you promoting the same pyramid scheme. You're late to the game so you're just a bag holder. Do a search, the mods usually let one thread run at a time but those scammers were similarly ridiculed.",

What he means is that what you said won't come to be true. Not many will turn into millionaires because of accumulating pi coins as you said. You did nothing against the forum rules though.",
