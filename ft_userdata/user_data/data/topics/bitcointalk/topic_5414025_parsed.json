  "content": "Often we need to connect wallet third-party sites for various reasons. We should always ignore connecting our wallet to an unknown and unsafe site. That's how your wallet would be drained. One of my known person's wallets has been hacked a few days back. Then he contacts Metamask about how it has happened. They said the metamask was connected to a couple of sites for a long time and users didn't disconnect wallets. Hackers took this advantage and take control of full wallets. So funds have been drained from all the addresses. Metamask doesn't disclose which Dapps and how happened. I learned from him that we shouldn't keep connected any Dapps for a long time. It would drain wallet funds after a certain period. Always disconnect your wallet even if you connect for any reason. Don't just leave it as it is. Hackers have powerful tools to trace you and drain your wallet. Don't give that chance.",

The essence is connecting the wallet into a platform won't make it viable to hack, but if you were interacting with a shady/unknown smart contract, it likely increases the risk, even if the issue didn't raise in the meantime.Metamask blog covers those things nicely: Disconnect wallet from a dapp  and What is a token approval?",

Unfortunately, beginners do not realize how much risk they are taking just because they have not been exposed to any accident. Most of them do not follow the news of the cases of sepsis that occur almost daily.The most that I can recommend is to keep your money in a cold wallet and use the hot wallet to perform short operations only and then transfer it back to your cold wallet if you do not want to disconnect the wallet from the applications you use .",

Metamask isn't supposed to share your wallet seed or private keys with the website it's connected to and you need to manually sign the transaction by clicking the sign button so it gets broadcast.If the dApp can access your seed (although I doubt it) then this is a critical vulnerability and metamask team should've patched it since they are aware of its existence!",

I now think the person has put their seed in on a different website or installed a fake version of metamask - this shouldn't happen without them signing a transaction. It's possible malicious code was put in by the website and signed by the user without them knowing too but I doubt metamask gives away the seed as that'd have been discovered a long time ago.Also a transaction history not being available on metamask but on the blockchain is more evidence that the wallet is malware because what reason would metamask have to not show you that transaction?",

Some tech have capacity to hide some meta transaction data, in a transaction. So highly possible that the hacker is an expert and must have done a thorough process in order to execute the crime.",

Your friend may not know how to keep his funds safe or maybe he trusts the platform too much for his funds. We have heard a lot of suggestions that any platform is not a safe place to store funds, connect wallet at one platform without disconnecting after completing trade is a fatal mistake.I don't blame hackers in this because someone forgot about the responsibility for his funds especially about the security of his funds and wallet.
