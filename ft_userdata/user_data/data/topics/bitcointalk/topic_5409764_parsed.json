  "content": "So after going through the verification process, I log into the Discord Channel for my token only to be prompted by a Verify Bot to do further verification which requires me to create a new account outside of Discord . WTF !! I tried to skip that, and somehow got into the boards, where I posted ONE message, and then got blocked for some reason. Tried to post again and encountered the following garbage:You have no friends on this channel.You have no servers in commonYou have to wait for 24 hours for ....You have to be online for at least 10 minutes to post ( did that twice, didn't work )Needless to say, this is total $@&%#^text only boards from 1995 were more direct and useful than this garbage.",

      "body": "Yeah, being on Discord can be very frustrating. Honestly, I praise those who chat there and know their way around it. On a few times I tried using Discord it was either I was missing chats I needed to respond to or I was missing those I needed to quote. However, I believe it's a process one needs time to acquaint oneself with. I used to feel lost with Twitter too when I nearly got on that bird app. So, I think you should take some more time on it. I believe all that delays and restrictions could be the hurdles you might have to climb before being allowed a free hand. Just endure it for now.",

Just endure it for now.I mainly use Discord for me and my friends to communicate (through voice call)  while we are playing different games. We also use it to stream our games. Similar with the OP's experience on Discord, I also encountered some of his concerns. I could add that it is hard to log in sometimes to verify your account. I'm not sure if it is on my end but sometimes it is frustrating when some errors like these happens.",

      "body": "I always face something like that where when you join a channel you have to do something first which I don't know what before I can chat on the channel though there are part of the channel where I can chat but you can only post after the time runs out (timed chat). I also encounter the verification when you log in and I didn't know how but the next time I log in, I didn't go through verification but If I did then I have to complete the captcha first.",

Somehow bots in Discord in are really buggy when it comes to verification process and it is annoying af.Is it possible to contact the mods in the server just in case?",

Servers that are poorly ran cryptocurrency scams are exactly that, poorly ran servers. If a shitty scammer is hosting a shitty discord server and you expect professional grade scam service, well, too bad; discord scams seem to be organizing those shitty pump & dumps and whatnot.Discord, the app, doesn't control 'servers', those are hosted and moderated by individual members of the discord community.Join the unofficial bitcoin discord; https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5247383.msg54403124#msg54403124 - there's less scammy / shady stuff going on there.
