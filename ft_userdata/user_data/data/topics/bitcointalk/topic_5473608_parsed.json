  "content": "After BlackRock application for Ethereum ETF, we saw the market reacting positively. Ethereum price rose to $2000 for the first time this year. Currently  it is still going strong and I am not sure where will it end. The below are the list of top 10 cryptocurrency projects that are providing layer 2 solution on the Ethereum Blockchain. Which one do you think from the above list is the best in terms of speed and fees? Which one do you think would pump in the bull run and why?",

      "body": "So far, it seems only Arbitrum have the highest tendency of blowing up soon. It has the massive support of its ecosystem with active governance in place and looks primed to pop of. IIRC, the all time high for ARB was around $1.8 so it won't be surprising if it starts going up again.After Arbitrum, Next on the list is going to be Optimism. They have good fundamentals. While I have never held OP or indulged in its community from the inception, I do think it has potential especially in the bull market where everything is popping off. Op also has something called the \"OP stack\" and it is a widely used tech.If Zksync was live, it would be the first on my list. Mantle might do well because of Bybit affiliation.",

The support from the community is massive and it is obvious that they are providing a solution better than it's competitor or at least they are well preferred by the community in using. I personally has a an arbitrum in my portfolio and I am anticipating that I can get good profits from it as it is well supported by their own community and people are making hype out of it. I hope that they make it up till the bull market and won't have any issues with in their project.",

Real supporters or just pumpers?I trust more in Matic (Polygon) than any of the others because it has been showing steady growth all year and has been enjoying quite large pumps. It is also Matic that has been in the top 15 in contrast to Arbitrum being in the top 40.",

      "body": "well my best bet would be the one with highest TVL of course, but whether L2 gonna get pumped still not clear though, considering the fact that L2 has been quite weak in term of performance after hitting peak around listing time.right now i just prefer investing in L1 that already showing signs of bullrun.but if its L2 definitely arbitrum and OP gonna take the lead for the simple fact that its among the most used L2 around, zksync shouldn't even in discussion considering the coin hasn't even out yet but maybe the team is waiting for bullish season so that their coin could just hit all time high at the same time of listing considering past L2 always going so high at initial listing, it'd be massive if they do that, moreover there's not even clarification of retrospective airdrop.",

Which one do you think would pump in the bull run and why? Personally, I think that L2 still has a fairly low capitalization, especially in the near future when we talk a lot about a new price increase cycle. The old problems will continue to repeat, and the way L2 operates can be seen as a solution effective application. Perhaps the competition for market share in this field will not be too intense when big names are gradually appearing and letting us know that it will be a place that many people are interested in. I personally quite like the way OP works, but if you look at the ecosystem, Arbitrum is bringing a more diverse place of products.",

      "body": "Layer 2 solution is what Ethereum ecosystem made out of the issues that Bitcoin is facing. These projects are the reason why Ethereum is still so successful and would remain unless a new projects come up with something new. I doubt that as before there are projects that are good beyond expectations and they still lack what Ethereum offered. Which according to me was unique solution. They are all just copy and paste with some new features. Whereas layer 2 projects are giving Ethereum the ability to live long and foster. Considering those views of mine, I feel these two are the best two invest, I still think the first two have good potential in the upcoming bull run. If I am correct both the top 2 went beyond $1 in the first bull run. I am expecting them to go beyond $2 this time.",

Which one do you think would pump in the bull run and why? Layer 2 speed and fees are almost close to each either since they are just side chain and using almost same technology to solve Ethereum scalability. I believe their marketcap just differ due to the VC involved behind them that’s why some of them have more marketcap because VC inject huge liquidity on this project.Optimism and Matic are the most promising project for me since they have a very strong community. But I will go for Matic as the top Layer 2 project since they are the oldest and solid community so far. Most the layer 2 project now is just hype because of their airdrop.",

Do you think that will hamper their development as there were three founders originally and now only two? I think it would hamper their development and I also feel it would have a big impact on their price in the future. I feel Matic is now overhyped and I do think they won't make a significant difference when the bull run comes. They would only achieve ATH which they did earlier as there is not anything unique happening with this project.Other than Matic which project do you think or those reading my reply should pump in the bull run?",

Arb and OP are the L2 I used most and can also say are cheap and fast enough in transaction. I always have this believe that arb hasn't really shown the crypto community a satisfactory price pump. I think arb will do well in this coming bull because it has such huge community and more interest than the rest.",

I've got a few of it and bought it when it's few. I know that many of the folks here have also Ronin. It's still not that much to think of and way below the launching price but it seems their ecosystem is on the development and likely to have more.What's good on this is that they're trying to revive the community that they have and once it's established again, I think that we'll be able to see the difference of it in the past. It also haven't pumped a lot unlike the other projects that have their own chains and other L2 projects.",
