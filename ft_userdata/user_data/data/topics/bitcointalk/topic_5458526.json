It will give you a timelocked address. Take note that there will be no way to spend fund from a timelocked address before the specified time. So, do this only if you are sure that you won't need to spend the fund before the specified time. You can also create a wallet for your children, make a timelocked transaction to that and give your child the raw transaction. Your child will be able to broadcast that transaction after the specified time. The difference with the previous method is that, you will be able to make a transaction before the specified time and make the transaction to your child's wallet invalid.

Most wallets set the nLockTime to zero or the last mined block, in the case you haven't specify any locktime. I think OP is asking if it's possible to spend the fund before the locktime. If you have set the nLockTime to a future date or a future blockheight, the transaction can't be broadcasted until the specified time or blockheight and for broadcasting a new transaction with the same input(s), you don't have to wait until the specified time.",

This doesn't mean the fund is locked and you can't make a new transaction. You can make a new transaction even before the specified time. Also note that with disabling RBF, you only make the transaction unreplaceable after it being broadcasted and there wouldn't be anything stopping you from making a new transaction before that transaction being broadcasted.(It may worth mentioning that with full RBF in future, transactions can be replaced by a new one paying higher fee, even if they haven't been flagged as RBF.)",

But for smaller year I would say it is safer to share this recovery with some family members it was actually intended for or the children so that when you might be no more someone still has access to it, at least even if they have this keys they won’t be able to spend them till the specified time. My advice again could be set a shorter date like in the space of 5 years then if you get it broadcasted you can initiate another one again.

Can they keep the private key safe for 125 years without losing it? :/ that's the second issue after the timelock the redeemersYou need to specify the exact procedure on how to spend the locked funds.If you just sent them private keys, they will likely import or sweep it to a wallet and restore the standard scripts a.k.a 'legacy', 'nested-SegWit', 'native SegWit' or 'TapRoot' address.Those wont restore the correct address; normal sweep wont find the associated unspent transaction.But there are issues:The main issue is the current support for such script which is limited,AFAIK, it's the only wallet that I know where you can spend it, there's no other option aside from manually building the transaction.So you're stuck with that option for now and just update the provided procedure if a future wallet or existing wallet's new version adopts importation of such script.Another slight issue is coinb.in server availability since without it, the claimers will have to manually input the correct data to spend it.Spending it using \"Load\" (Redeem Script) may be working for now and actually simple but you'll never know what will happen during the time your bitcoins are locked up.So the steps provided should be thorough with a link to its source code (and a backup of it online/physical),the buttons to click, the data that should be inputted on the right positions, what will do if \"x\" doesn't work anymore, etc.",
