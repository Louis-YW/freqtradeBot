Are there any special offers for you guys who advertise and promote this casino with the crash gambling option? Will you have to gain some special benefit for inviting people in?

      "body": "Welcome to bitcointalk platform. I so much like the fact that sites of these nature are beginning to find their way here to getting registered. I was amazed when I checked the website to see for myself what you offer and it is nice that majority of the casinos listed ¬†on your website are well known casinos fully established here. Here are my observations, I think your \"Top-Rated Crash Gambling Casinos\" should be at the top of every others and possibly should be the first to be listed separately on its own before the general list of other casinos inclusively.Of a truth articles are good to add more value and features but it is not clear whether you want prospective visitors to continue flipping through articles or to see and access casino through your website because it might turn out to make your site boring as the articles are much more than the casinos listed.Lastly, as a site of this nature do you not think or have in mind that gamblers would want to reach out to you for more information about the listed casinos and possibly other questions as it bothers them to know more about. Knowing this fully well don't you want a large customer base and followership? As this will get you more traffic to your website.",

If it would be easy, there would be no point!The point is, our tournament ranks players based on the highest multiplier they can catch. Your everyday casino tournaments all evaluate players based on the amount they wager, which is completely unfair to players that don't have $1000 of $ to spend.Thank you to everyone else that comments, and I guess we really need to invest in that Copper memberships!",

It's hard for me to figure out if your goal is for people to get lost in them or find the casinos. That's a fine line. Also, since we're talking about amount, don't you think it's time you made that $2 no-deposit bonus more clear? A cute message that said \"bonus link deactivated\" appeared when someone tried to use it. Could there be a surprise on more surprise in the future? We can only hope.It's also an interesting choice to only focus on crash games. I'm really interested, and by interested, I mean completely confused. Why do you care so much about this niche?However, I'm not joking; good job on the Crash Clash Tournament. It's a new idea to focus on the biggest multiplier instead of just bets. I hope the best for you, not that you'd need it with the way you do things",
