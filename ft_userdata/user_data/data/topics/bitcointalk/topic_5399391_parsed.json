  "content": "IT'S TIME TO REBUILD, DEVELOP, LEARN, INVESTI know, it doesn't seem that way.1️⃣ #inflation is eating our savings (if you have savings...).2️⃣ #Shortages of food and other goods are likely to get worse.3️⃣ There’s no visible end to the war in #Ukraine and #Russia (plus we have no idea what #China might do).4️⃣ #Markets keep falling again and again (isn’t everyone’s portfolio in red?)🎆That is the end of the bad news show. #History thought us that situations like this do not last.As painful as they are, #bear markets are survivable, and are even necessary for a market. Unfortunately, some good smaller projects get in trouble during a bear cycle in #crypto, but a lot of bad projects needed to go.#Bearmarkets have come (and go) plenty of times over the years. And on the other side…there’s another #bull market coming, like always.Some #cryptos did not survive the bear market of 2017-2018. Plenty of them did.Just like the .com companies that got wiped off the map after the 2000 crash… While Amazon and Google went on to rule the world.👍👍👍Time in a bear market could be well spent.🧠 Focus on #learning about #blockchain, develop useful #skills, create a #network with like-minded people, and all of that while building your #portfolio during a market experiencing some amazing #discounts.📱Do Your Own Research (AKA #DYOR). Understand why projects as #Bitcoin, #InternetComputer, #Ethereum,...will stay at or rise to the top, while others are long gone from the top 10 of 2017.#Cycles like this give good projects time to develop, build bigger teams, work on mass adoption plans,...as they don't care about price. They will survive anyway, as they have a #longterm vision. The ones that focused on hype...well....❗❗❗Don't get caught two steps behind.If you are focussing on the good projects, you can just relax.This is #crypto and cycles are normal, they don't last. See it as #discount moments.Without more words, I will let the historical graphs hereunder speak...They say it all.Have a great day and chill 😁Main article with graphs:https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6932339971592781824/#ICP #Develop #MassAdoption #Quality",
