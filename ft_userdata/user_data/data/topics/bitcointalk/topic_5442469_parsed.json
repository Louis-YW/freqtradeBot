  "content": "In 1845 America x Russian have a unified relationship because of exchange ideas of technology which the two countries benefits from each other. America are good in communication technology while Russian is good in weapons technology, they both learn from each other but in 1956 Russian united that Americans are very intelligent if they happen to be the best in weapons then no nations will withstand them any time of wars and crisis, this where relationship between the two nations begins to experience withdrawal of interest. Americans x Russian has war before they became at peace again but no longer trust each other. Because of this countries outbreaks NATO was form to bring back Europe's, Asia and Americans together, Russian refused to join NATO and Ukraine been the small countries among them feels they're always be threatened by other big nations and Russian are encroaching their boundaries to take over their lands but Russian new if Ukraine join NATO they will have support from countries that form NATO so several messages were send to Ukraine from Russian not encroached the lands that belongs to them as claims which happens to be original owners.When the initial crisis developed wings, Puttin never wanted to invade Ukraine because of NATO but Ukraine were bold enough to pushed forward clipping their trust from NATO if Russian eventually raised war. Finally the war breaks out and Russian invaded Ukraine and trochaic their lands, buildings and lives but NATO did not intervened earlier not even Americans because Russian is one among the big five that can not easily be defeated. China are strongly behind Russian incase Americans wants to support Ukraine. Lands, boundaries dispute was the real issues.",

I know the conflict between Ukraine and Russia has some historical and political background. For me, the main cause is that Russia doesn't want the expansion of NATO, while nations want to join the alliance because of Russian perceived expansionist agenda.",

      "body": "Russia and Ukraine have a deep history but the main reasons are Ukraine were threatening to join NATO and Russia did not want Nato on their border and Ukraine as proven in the war have a good military and a lot of land to conquer so it was a threat for Russia if Ukraine did join but this does not make it right they could have negotiated with Ukraine to provide protection and trade deals without causing violence.",
