  "content": "Where does your state rank in gun ownership? We analyzed all 50 states, gun ownership rates, and ownership percentages to bring you this article. Of course, we’ve also included the answers to some of your most burning questions about gun control, ownership, and crime.Report Highlights:The United States has the highest per capita rate of civilian firearm ownership at 120.48 firearms per 100 people.American civilians own 46% (approximately 393.3 million) of the world’s 857 million civilian-use firearms. (Source)Montana has the highest amount of gun owners (66.3%).Wyoming has the most guns per capita, with 245.8 firearms for every 1,000 residents.The top 5 states for gun ownership comprise only .8% of the nation’s firearm-related homicides (185 homicides between all 5 states).The bottom 5 states for gun ownership comprise 4% of the nation’s firearm-related homicides (1,038 firearm-related homicides).According to surveys, 36% of gun owners are white, 24% are black, and 15% are Hispanic. The remaining civilians do not personally own a firearm but do live in a home with someone who does.Recent polls show that 32% of adults in the U.S. own at least one firearm.72% of gun owners say the main reason for owning a firearm is for protection.According to this poll, 32% of US adults own at least one firearm.New Jersey has the lowest rate of gun ownership at only 8.9% of the population and the least amount per capita (1.1 for every 1,000 people).Global Civilian Firearm-OwnershipGlobally, it is estimated that more than 857 million civilians own firearms for personal or defensive use. It’s likely that this number is much higher than the registered firearms that local governments can track.Note: This information is based on a survey. The information given is only as accurate as the respective government provides.Continue reading Gun Ownership by State (2023 Statistics) on Ammo.com!",

As a Finnish citizen i noticed that under \"Global Civilian Firearm-Ownership\", we are not in the list, even though 1/3 of civilians in here owns a firearm for hunting.Actually i just had to check it and according to worldpopulationreview it's 32.4 guns per 100 citizens, meaning that our civilians have total 1.8M guns.And that's not even on the list. I haven't cross checked other data but imho that kind of mistake makes the whole data invalid.",

Are you saying that a person can't possess a firearm license until his as accepted as a soldier or employed by the armed forces? I never agree with that, sorry. I want you to know that you don't have to be a servant in order to achieve your goals in life. If I may then ask, does vigilante that also possess a legally owned firearm with license Do they have a military background? The focus of modern life is money. You can accomplish everything you set your mind to if you have money.",

In most of the west, cutting someones hand off because of robbery, would be considered to be too extreme and the capital punishment depends on the crime committed and the gravity of it.Since this is a thread which is about the ownership of Guns by civilian populations, talking about Saudi Arabia in this thread sounds rather irrelevant, since as far as I know in that country people do not have rights to bear arms, unlike in the USA. That latter country is rather a special case in this hemisphere.",

People own firearms just cause they’re allowed to. If you ask a gun loving touting American on why he has and carries a firearm, he’ll probably tell you it’s his right to own a firearm to be able to defend himself from a tyrannical government which in a sense I find quite ironic. But I agree with you that it would be a lot safer to live in a country where the civilian population has very limited access to firearms.",

I did not know we have people from Findland around here, by the way.I have seen some documentary films about the lifestyle of people who live in the flatlands of the United States, in deep red States and counties and, in my opinion, it seems to be that the original purpose of the second amendment of the constitution has been distorted in the mind of many people.We could argue that originally that part of the constitution was supposed to serve for people of the just-born USA to defend themselves against a possible English invasion, in the lack of a formal army.Nowadays, there are people who bear arms and believe it is a God given right and power which is not supposed to be infringed, not matter what. Some people in the USA seem to mistify the constitution and that amendment in particular as part of their bible, instead of words writen by human beings, like anyone of us.",

There are many 'neighborhood watches' and other similar organizations throughout the USA that are organized by the local police. These are the militias.The Federal government is made up of people. If there were no people in government offices, the government could do absolutely nothing at all... being only paperwork.So far, most of the organization by the people against government officials is being aimed at government offices rather than at the people in those offices. When it gets bad enough - like it is getting now - the people will start aiming their lawsuits at the people of government rather than the government offices.When government people are ousted for not obeying their Oaths of Office to uphold the Constitution, other people will get into government who WILL obey their Oaths of Office. The Constitution will be upheld, and the people will get their weapons (arms). The petty crooks will be too scared to remain as crooks, because all the good people will be armed to the teeth.

I believe the society can be much more peaceful than ever if and only if people will be stopped from carrying guns for owning sake. Since there’s no country run by human beings that is faultless, then I don’t think it is okay for the US government to allow the use of firearms by individuals, therefore, the Gun Ownership should be banned and all sold guns to individuals and other citizens be retrieved by the government.Due to the nature of Guns, which are dangerous weapons, not everyone, have the psychological capacity to acquire firearms or go near them and that’s why we have recorded an increased gun related violence over the years. All these can be stopped if the goverment reduce that access to guns, regardless of the type of gun.Alternatively, instead of issuing these guns to people for protection, can implement very strict laws against citizens who break the laws and ensure serious implementation of local police.",
