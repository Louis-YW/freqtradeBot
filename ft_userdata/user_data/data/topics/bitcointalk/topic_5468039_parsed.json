  "content": "- The eSIM is meant primarily for receiving incoming calls/SMS, internet connectivity is not guarantied- You get a regular UK mobile number (not google voice, virtual number etc)- Works everywhere- Your phone should support eSIM, the number of supported models is limited (mainly to Apple iPhone and Google Pixel along with few other devices); it is your responsibility to check whether your smartphone supports it before purchase- No documents/KYC, no registration, no additional apps to install- How is this better than a one time virtual number you might ask; having an eSIM means you get a valid phone number which is not detected as a virtual/VoIP number, additionally you could use one eSIM to verify (and re-verify if needed) any number of services. This is like buying a SIM card but without delivery hassle & costs.- Renewal of the eSIM is your responsibilityPrice: $9Payment method: PerfectMoney, BTC (other crypto could be negotiated)Contact me via DM",
