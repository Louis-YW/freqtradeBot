Do you even think Bitcoin was designed for such a complex purpose? The answer is NO. Bitcoin was designed to serve as an alternative payment method, not to replace the existing one; the Bitcoin supply is too small to serve and replace a specific country's financial system because it is the only currency that can be used to make payments. It can be globally accepted as its adoption has already spread, but the traditional financial system will still be there. You have the choice to choose what form of payment system you want to make use of and leave the rest. I know you might say bitcoin is divisible in nature, which makes it a perfect fit for replacing the old monetary system, but there are really a lot of limitations to bitcoin in respect to that. Such limitations are; Access to the internet in order to complete every single transaction, high cost when you want to buy goods that are less than $1, network congestion can also be a barrier, and many others, which I don't have the time to elaborate on.",

The world is slowly but surely moving to a purely internet-centric world. If you're thinking of the poorest areas that don't even have establishments and such, well, I'm pretty sure a lot of those places don't even have fiat money in the first place; they just do barter.2. Most people won't be making transactions on the Bitcoin basechain. They don't do it now(the likes of Coinbase txs, sucks but yea), and they won't be doing it in the future.",

      "body": "Bitcoin was never meant to \"replace\" the existing centralized monetary system. I don't think Satoshi ever introduced it as such either. In fact from what I've seen, Bitcoin is introduced as the alternative payment system which means it exists side by side of the existing payment systems. For example we have banks, we have PayPal, we have Credit Cards, and we also have Bitcoin.This is in compliance with the nature of Bitcoin too. Bitcoin is the \"option\" provided for those who care about their financial sovereignty and not everyone cares. It's like a lot of other things in this world. For example people who care about security don't use Windows and meanwhile Linux wasn't created to \"replace\" Windows, it was created as that alternative option for those who care.",

The other things like scalability is still something that is discussed for further improvement, so that can be left aside. Satoshi projected all this things and that’s why he practically called this an alternative",

What you could have done better is to declare it without external people knowing about it. I believe they would have given you a form to fill, which if you had filled it correctly without omitting the space initially, the bank official would just read it silently instead of asking you again to fill it for you to the point that people could hear your conversation. That's the only place I know you did wrong.As for those who are advising you not to declare it even as this is your source of income, do they know that it's a criminal offence to falsify such a claim? It is still easy when you are nobody, but in the future when you become somebody, if you continue falsifying claims on your documents now, it might affect you badly then. For this, my advice remains that you continue to say the truth but just keep it as discreet as possible in an official environment.QuoteNow, the governments are in charge of the banks and other centralized monetary systems in a centralized networks while BTC and the cryptocurrencies are decentralized networking system of transactions which obviously the governments has no place of power on it.So how can it be possible for BTC to ascertain this great height of advancement?

I want you to note this today, though people often over-hype Bitcoin, it can never do the work of fiat in the economy and will not be able to do all the work of fiat in payment services. There will still be an end remittance after all which will always be the function of fiat.However, Bitcoin has reached the peak of what it can do as far as I am concerned, you may only expect some reduced operation afterwards due to regulation. Regulation is inevitable in the crypto world and it has just started, we should not deceive ourselves, the world government are cooking enough that is still not open to many because they can't think deeper. Or do you think the centralised system and ETFs are a joke? They are further steps to oversee the transactions involving Bitcoin.And the last time I read the Chainalysis remark about Bitcoin transactions, it was clear that a centralised system has the largest percentage of Bitcoin transactions. So expect more knowledge and control by the government even as Bitcoin will be decentralised but the government will force more oversight one way or the other.",

This leads to questions about the possibility of BTC dominating global financial trading trends. But I also recognize the harmony without wanting to separate them completely independently, when both decentralized and centralized systems need harmony to promote common development. Every issue has positive/negative aspects and based on how people perceive it, I can be very supportive of crypto but cannot deny the importance of the banking system.",

Some folks think its rebellious nature gives it the power for revolution.  They see regular money as rigged by big banks, while Bitcoin is the underdog that'll bring financial freedom. Others see it more as digital gold - a store of value that doesn't care about borders or inflation.  Theyre betting on the limited supply driving the price up over time. But here's the thing - most people just need money that works.  And if we're honest Bitcoin isn't exactly easy to use day-to-day like getting a cup of coffee.  So, most likely, theyll coexist in a multi-currency world, serving different purposes.  Bitcoin might be your fancy investment piece, while regular money remains the trusty daily option.",

Banks are normally private, although there can also be some major banks owned by the state (at least, in my country). Then there's the central bank of a country, and its relationship with the government is a trickier thing. I came across this article about this relationship. It has interesting info based on the surveys of 24 central banks, such as how much they annually meet with certain officials and the purpose of those meetings. Overall, it seems that central banks usually have some form of autonomy from the government, but they also cooperate closely when it comes to sharing information and monetary policies.Bitcoin can coexist with banks and governments, as long as it's just an alternative to banking or perhaps even an asset (so, competing in a completely different category, so to speak).",

After much comparison and deliberation concerning how risky and unnecessary it is letting the bank know about your Bitcoin personality because the government whom are biased and grudges against the technology approaches have full control over the banks so they wouldn't even give it a chance to have such possessions at the fiats.Besides Bitcoin inventory technology has been able to reach this fair far due to it challenges with the fiat over massive adoptions as the alternative source of payment including its investment potentials that brings about income so, if Bitcoin should eventually takeover then it value would have such valuable influence again because the tussles of its increase on massive adoptions would be depreciated.",
