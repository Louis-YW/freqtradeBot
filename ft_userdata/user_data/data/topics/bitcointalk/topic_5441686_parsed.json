  "content": "I am assuming the study was done based on ratio system where they took some number of participants and then factored it to give proper estimates. I am really not sure if we should believe these numbers or not but the study is really positive about Americans loving the Bitcoin. The number of participants in the group were around 2,202 and study conducted based on the weightage of various factors of US based age group, education system, region etc. Now this study translated the numbers to approximately 52.3 million Americans adult owning crypto while 75.5 million Americans are willing to buy the crypto in next 12 months. I not sure if such study is viable or not but going further they also stated that overall 76% people from the American Soil think that Crypto and Blockchain is the future. Considering the fact that they already think current financial system need major changes and also upgrades, they would prefer crypto as their next big thing. QuoteA national survey commissioned by Coinbase suggests that about 20% of U.S. adults currently own crypto. In addition, 29% of U.S. adults plan to buy or trade crypto in the next 12 months. “The vast majority of Americans want to see the financial system updated and they believe crypto can be a powerful part of the solution,” Coinbase said.Crypto Survey Commissioned by CoinbaseA nationwide survey of 2,202 participants from the general population was conducted by Morning Consult from Feb. 10-14. “The data were weighted to be representative of U.S. adults based on age, race/ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, and region,” the market research firm described. “The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of the global financial system and how U.S. adults and cryptocurrency investors view the future of the crypto market and exchanges.”Citing the survey results, the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which commissioned the study, commented:The vast majority of Americans want to see the financial system updated and they believe crypto can be a powerful part of the solution.Noting that “80% of Americans think the global financial system unfairly favors powerful interests” and “67% of Americans agree that the financial system needs major changes or a complete overhaul,” Coinbase wrote:The survey found that 80% of respondents believe the current financial system is unfair, with the overwhelming majority expressing frustration with the current financial system and a hunger for change.The crypto exchange added that the survey further “indicates that most Americans remain optimistic about the future of crypto and understand its potential to be part of the solution to bring about meaningful change to the financial system that would benefit society as a whole.”Coinbase Survey: 20% of US Adults Currently Own Crypto",

It's just a few people in the world that don't know about crypto; knowing about it simply means they know what it's all about, especially in an advanced and exposed country like the United States, who are also lovers of technology. The survey might not be accurate, but they are correct about what the people believe. It's just the ignorant ones who will want to deny the fact that crypto is the future and that it has come to stay for the betterment of the payment and financial systems.",

The numbers and the percentage might not be accurate, yet there is a sense of truth in these facts as my different researchers attest to a similar claim. Coinbase is deeply rooted in the US and I know that they have all it takes to conduct reasonable statistics that would give real thought of the masses. That said, the US is a country that is rich, and judging by the news of the success of some of them in crypto investment in the last 4 years, I believe that they might be ready for a huge investment in the crypto space, Guess what? They are capable.",

A probability sampling method would be the best option to have been used, ideally done systematically, then the research could have some credibility as it would show the thoughts of different demographics in the population.

      "body": "@aboveall,Interesting output. Idk, but I am also having similar thoughts on the statistics. Unless and until they are using some sort of proven theorem to give a conclusion its all in vain actually. I mean proving a point against group of 2k people and concluding what 60-70 million people are thinking is itself a big crack in the methodology. My whole point of posting this article was to get views on how it works. May be a statistian amongst us might like to enlighten the theory behind this. Moreover, when I read this article, there more google results stating about the same survey(s) and made me think how can we claim what others might be thinking. I think such surveys needs to be done on larger groups. Like at least 10-20 million people to get right answers. But obviously it's practically impossible. In addition to this, many times few of them would just give random answers causing huge errors in the calculation for sure.",

But it is still encouraging to see that 29% are willing buy and 20% are already holding bitcoin. It all takes to have a favorable legal framework to encourage people to get into the crypto market. As of now, US didn't say anything strongly negative about cryptocurrency. If this changes, then the ratio of willing people would change too. But overall the data is encouraging for sure!",

These are already old stories in which they always try to create some kind of illusion that tens of millions of people will buy something just because tens of millions of people have already done it before them (allegedly).It's just an attempt for CEX to promote itself while motivating new potential clients to invest in whatever their platforms offer, all in order to ensure future income. If we know that the US population is about 330 million, it sounds incredible that even 75 million of them plan to invest in Bitcoin in the next 12 months, and so far only 52 million have done so since 2009.I think the guys went a little overboard, especially considering inflation, people have less and less money to invest in anything.",

I don't think any other generation has been this outspoken about the Federal Reserve and how much of a scam it is, nor has any generation ever grown up into a mature internet setting where they can talk about it on forums like us online like us with anyone anywhere in the world and at any time!! Certainly this coin will be flipped and in 10 years time only 20 percent of american's will not own any bitcoin while the other 80% does. I guess we shall see what happens.",
