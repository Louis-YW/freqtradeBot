Did it hit desired audience?This African competition only benefits a few countries and does not improve the domestic league in many countries. for example, South Africa, due to their good economic situation in relation to many other African countries, allows their teams to be able to sign good players, while teams from Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria are able to have good domestic players and do well in this competition and their internal league, thanks to their economic situation, which is superior to many countries. while in many countries people live in extreme poverty and high corruption, football is at a very low level to the point that local leagues have no quality and as a consequence when these teams arrive in African competitions, they are unable to perform well and are eliminated. earlyso with these countries that have these very corrupt governments and football is not evolving and the financial power of the people of these countries with corrupt governments, they are poor people, it is very difficult for African competitions to see many countries well represented in this competition, we will not see many fans in the stadiums when the games take place in many African countries. In my opinion, although this competition has good quality teams due to the fact that it has some well-developed African countries economically, it is still far from being compared with European and American competitions. African news channels don't give much coverage to this competition and the same happens for European and American news channels",
