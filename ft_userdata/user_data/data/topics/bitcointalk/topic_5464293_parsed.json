But if bitcoin price did not fall below $20000 and it is getting close to halving, that would be a good time to buy.  DCA can not pay for now for those that bought at $30000, but those that continue to DCA and wait till 2025 will make enough gain from bitcoin holding. Bitcoin has stayed above $30000 for a long time before falling, people that DCA around that price are losing now, but not loss if they do not sell their coins, they should continue to DCA which will bring the price for profit making down below $30000.",

This is erratic but I always think about the DCA road plan to keep going for a week/month when I can.Sometimes with this speculation there is also a little influence like now is an example when bitcoin was long in the $30,000 range for months and then now fell to $25,000 of course at this discounted price want to buy more at once instead of DCA, but I don't think it will be forced considering the finances are not enough to do this.As long as we don't sell at a time when there is a lot of speculation that bitcoin will fall, we will panic and sell midway.",

But if bitcoin price did not fall below $20000 and it is getting close to halving, that would be a good time to buy.  You made a very good point in your analysis of the best DCA approach to use in preparation for the next bitcoin halving.But then what i noticed in you overall views on DCA is that, you seem to focused on a single market trend in your presumption of the best DCA trend and you have only pointed to DCA on the line of buying all the way down abd what the base price that is best to take discount buy which you point at the bottom being 20,000.QuoteDCA can not pay for now for those that bought at $30000, but those that continue to DCA and wait till 2025 will make enough gain from bitcoin holding.

I also think that Bitcoin will reach $100k in the upcoming halving, everyone seems to agree bitcoin ATH will peak later. Some speculation that is done will have an effect, but the FUD that is spread will also prevent Bitcoin from continuing to rise. There will be a lot of FOMO and FUD that will emerge ahead of the Halving, we have to be prepared for everything. We only need to buy and hold, then we will enjoy the benefits.",

For sure you would really be considering on taking up some DCA to lessen out that kind of losses which you had commited earlier and lessening out via doing DCA but of course this isnt something that anyone could do since not all would really be having the money on doing so. This is why it would really vary on each person on what are the decisions that they would be making whether they would be sticking into their plan or would really be making out some additional steps or movement so that they could be able to take advantage on whatever market conditions that they would be able to encounter.",

My aim is to have as much satoshis as possible before the halving.While some people may not prefer DCA for various reasons, I feel it is what works for me. And I'd do what works for me. We will all make gains from bitcoin. For some it may be big for others, it may be small but profit is better than no profit.

But why don't you buy bitcoin directly? I mean, we're in bear season and with many big drops like bitcoin down to $15k, it's a great time to buy bitcoin on the cheap. Since I think the opportunity to buy cheap bitcoin under 20k is not too much, we should take advantage of every opportunity we get. Just like many people were scared when they saw bitcoin plummet so did not dare to buy, and now they have to buy at a much higher price.",

None, as you have said, it's DCA so regardless of the price then you will have to buy at certain put to continue what you have started. Of course when the price goes down, you might accumulate an additional sats.But the end goal here is accumulation, so you do whatever phase you can whatever the price will be and just continue with it and fatten your wallet as much as you can thru DCA strategy.",

Yes, I do agree, with signature campaigns, you can accumulate it every week and so this could also be consider DCA in my book. But for those who have the capital to begin with, when the price goes down, then maybe it's time for them to buy more. And inversely, if the price goes up, then their budget could only buy that much bitcoin in their wallet. So there is no risk in that method, you can continue to do it as long as you can with little risk on your end. You just have to be careful that you put it in a wallet that you can control.",

Payments are made on a weekly basis, and due to some personal stuff going on now, I've missed a week or two. However, despite me not buying Bitcoin myself, this is still a form of DCA, because I could potentially withdraw every payment that went through. If I was in a dire financial situation and needed the money, then I guess I'd be forced to do it.The last time I checked, my DCA, or average purchase price, was approximately $28,000, which means that I'm at a loss now. Although I don't find it significant enough to bother me, In my opinion, a decent average purchase price is somewhere between $24,000 and $25,000, which isn't too low nor too high to not be presented with great opportunities in the future. Unfortunately, even though I was in the Bitcoin scene quite early, I didn't have the chance to own Bitcoin when its value was significantly lower.Accumulating bitcoins from signature campaign payments isn't too bad if you haven't sold any bitcoins yet. But why don't you buy bitcoin directly? I mean, we're in bear season and with many big drops like bitcoin down to $15k, it's a great time to buy bitcoin on the cheap. Since I think the opportunity to buy cheap bitcoin under 20k is not too much, we should take advantage of every opportunity we get. Just like many people were scared when they saw bitcoin plummet so did not dare to buy, and now they have to buy at a much higher price.I honestly could have purchased but did not, as I don't have a stable income at the moment and will not have for at least two more months and possibly even more, apart from signature campaigns and another minor source, which isn't enough, especially if you consider that signature campaign earnings strictly remain in my wallet untouched till the market recovers. Thus, at least for now, I prefer not to use any of my own money towards such investments because that would be risky and reckless. I have savings that are enough, so I could justify an investment; I'm not currently struggling, but as I mentioned earlier, I don't have a viable income. Thus, I prefer to play it safe and avoid using my own money, at least until I can afford to spend more without depleting my savings.I'm possibly going to regret it in the long run because Bitcoin is quite affordable at the moment and the capabilities of a 100% yield are extremely plausible in the next year.",

Even if the signature campaign fees you use are small, at least you still have the opportunity to continue collecting Bitcoin. I myself continue to collect Bitcoin from the signature campaign that I use. Do DCA every week and it is the best way instead of having to use savings for other purposes or sudden needs. Always use unplanned money for future needs. That's everyone's advice here and it's the right thing to do.",
