Altcoins have always been the target of pump and dump'ers and shills and hence they are glared on by bigger market veterans. Whatever media buzzword that they add to their project, the core design never really changes and the common \"genres\" explored by such projects will never be able to compete with their mainstream counterparts.Hence even if newer tech comes into view, altcoin project leaders only use them to promote their project and not actually develop something on it.Still it would be worth a watch if they actually manage to go bullish after 2024 or early.",

You cant precisely determined if the current top altcoins would really be outranked in a short time.This is the survival of the fittest and to those coins or projects who would really be mainly supported by the community.We know that this market is totally unpredictable, there's no way that we can tell which one would be lasting and which new coin will really be placing itself on the top.Beating up those established coins on high ranksis never been easy.Unless if a new project will really be getting soo much hyped and people do see its relevance of its utility then there might be chance but the odds or chances to seethis one is not that high.",

But for me, I'll take the chance now to invest while the prices are in huge deduction but of course, it was not all for altcoins. Even if you think about investing after 2024 is safe and profitable, this won't give you the assurance as well nor you will exactly get potential altcoins. It is a matter of choosing altcoins in any market condition as thinking about earning profit relies not only on the coins we choose but also on us who manage them.",

I understand the disappointment on some altcoins but if we are talking about top coins here I’m sure you can see the golden opportunity to buy it cheaper. Yes, there will a new good project in the future but still no guarantee for that so better to deal with the good coins currently listed in good exchanges, you can still make good profit with them.",

If they are solid like in the top 10 then definitely something big might happen in the next bull run2. But if you invest on shitcoin and meme coin and hype base project, then definitely, sooner or later they will die in this bear market and a new coin will appear to replace them.And I do agree that as much as we love some alts like ETH, BNB, ADA, Bitcoin is still the king and I would say the risk is not that big as compare to altcoins.",

That said, we cannot also dispute that there are strong Alts in the market that have proven their project in the past years but we investors are also eager to look at buying in New Alts because they believe that the top 20 Alts CMC might now be repeated in the next Bull market plus those looking to cash in from this new projects, but timing in investing in any of those Alts is very important.",
