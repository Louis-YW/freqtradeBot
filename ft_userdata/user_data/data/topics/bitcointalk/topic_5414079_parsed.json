  "content": "After having a series of observations, I discovered that there are no formal rules governing the buying or selling of Forum accounts. Despite how large the forum is, there are supposed to be some rules that must be adhered to when accounts are sold or transferred.I discovered this thread  account change hand, and checking the trust feedback of the affected account  trust feedback. I realize that if there are standard rules governing the transfer of account and the victim complies with the forum's standards for account selling or changing ownership, there won't be any problems with such trust feedback.By the way, I don't see any reason why account selling or transfer of account should be allowed in the first place. It's not that difficult to create a forum account so why should account selling be allowed? But Since the forum already permits account selling, who am I to challenge it?Quote18. Having multiple accounts and account sales are allowed, but account sales are discouraged.You cannot allow and discourage something at the same time. This is a contradiction. I believe that particular rule should be reviewed; either selling accounts should be completely prohibited or allow for the avoidance of future issues like this.What is the way forward?In my opinion, the following methods and procedures should be followed when changing account ownership.- Formal announcement should be made prior to change of account details such as email and password with a signed message - All deals should be completed with prove if possible - Accounts from hero to legendary rank should not be allowed to change email in order not to be able to sell such accounts. - Accounts not active for a year should be temporarily disabled and can only be activated after passing some verification that seems suitable by the administrators.- Change of account email should have limit to avoid multiple change of ownership within a short time. I believe that the above will, in some way, help to reduce the scams associated with account changes and to also discourage account selling.",

When you join a platform, you must accept its rules, terms of service.Account exchange (buying / selling) is allowed but discouraged. Do you know why it is discouraged?- Unfair. Account exchange should happen with higher ranked accounts like Hero member or Legendary member. Even before the kick off of merit system, it needs months to reach to these ranks. After the kickoff of merit system, it is more challenging to collect enough merit to rank up to these ranks.- Possibly scam. Posting on behalf of higher ranked accounts make your posts and especially thread announcements look more trusted. That can be abused by scammers who want to get a Hero or Legendary account for thread announcement for easily scam efforts.Most of exchanged accounts are from past hacks years ago and most of them used for scam or bounty spam on the forum. Discouraged!It is not prohibited entirely because it is impossible to verify ownership of past accounts as lot of things have been changed many times on the forum, from head admin role to code and security.",

Either you can buy it or you can't. But in the rules, we see there is a small note that this is not welcome, so the one who bought should be prepared for any outcome in the future. I know purchased accounts are tagged on a case-by-case basis, although buying and impersonating someone else is a sign of fraud. And such accounts need to have a negative tag by default. This has been brought up many times, but until now the rules remain as they were at the beginning, so OP, you have made fair comments, but they will not change anything.",

I think that sometime during 2015, a change was introduced where such practice became undesirable, but not prohibited. Then some members started tagging all the accounts that would be involved in such activities in any way, even if it was only about the intention to buy/sell, without it actually happening.I think that the current way of dealing with this problem is not ideal, but since there is a merit system, it is much more difficult, so to speak, to produce high-quality BTT accounts that would then be offered for sale. No matter how the rules are set, there will always be people who will find a way to do what they want, but there will always be those who will detect their bad intentions.Quote from: Yawa2020 on September 19, 2022, 09:04:51 AM- Accounts from hero to legendary rank should not be allowed to change email in order not to be able to sell such accounts. That rule would not make sense, because what if a user who is a Hero/Legendary comes to a situation where the provider through which he has e-mail no longer exists? Therefore, the option to change the e-mail must always be available, regardless of possible manipulation. In addition, some sellers of BTT accounts even offer the option for the buyer to receive an original e-mail with a password and private key of the signed address - and the only way to notice that the owner has changed is in the writing style.",

I also expect that most of those buying accounts for using them in bounty campaigns will actually spam.A honest user can learn his way in bitcoin and bitcointalk ranking up normally.Taking shortcuts will lead to problems and, even if the reason is bounties/campaigns is still shady; just imagine (paid) posts made by a high rank account talking about things he has no idea at all (of course, I know, it can happen sometimes even with honest/not bought accounts). Then, if the user is knowledgeable, the bought account may be a secondary account. Using multiple accounts in campaigns is prohibited; using multiple accounts in campaigns can easily lead to low quality posts. Hence, again, shady.I hope you can agree with all this.",
