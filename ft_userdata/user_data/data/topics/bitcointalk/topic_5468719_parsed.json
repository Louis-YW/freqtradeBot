At least we still know about the jakpa syndrome, the cheating is too much.Driving by to church today through the city gate Abuja Nigeria I was greeted with a view boards of pictures of Nigeria past president and at the city gate a crowd where gathered as early as 6am to celebrate Nigeria @63 there is no doubt the fact that Nigeria may be lacking in some areas but the fact still remains that we have to celebrate Nigerians for being a strong Nation where God have blessed with abundant human resources,  because even though the government have failed us,  we still remain resilience as a people in pursuit pf our individual despite the numerous economic crisis. So for the fact that Nigerians are strong survivors is enough for us to celebrate the birthday of the country being 63 is not a joke and we pray and work for a better Nigeria.",
