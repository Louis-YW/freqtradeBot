  "content": "Someone amuze me today, I was so cold somewhere in my town thinking about my life and someone walks to me and ask me a simple question! Didn't you have someone to talk to? And I say yes, he reply I will give you my time today let's gist our worries and you'll discover your case is better than mine. I laugh to stupor. But then we have a nice time together with good gist, life, politics and family. That's how I realizes we are holding many people happiness not talking to them, you're always so cold and scary to approach. What kind of person are you? Friendly, introverts or extroverts? Why are different to people?",

      "body": "Well I am a very talkative person when I am around people. I want to be the center of attention and I like it when people listen to what I am having to say. I make funny jokes and I know what to say with some groups of people and how not to say things with other kinds of people.I do not like to spend my time alone except for when I am sleeping. I think there is nothing more boring then to be by myself with no one to socially interact with. I did a test online and it told me I am a Extrovert so this is what I call myself.",
