In a Twitter statement, Zhang Jingna, the U.S.-based plaintiff, said she was “devastated” by the decision, writing that it set “a dangerous precedent” for European copyright law. The ruling comes six months after she first accused Jeff Dieschburg, an art student in Luxembourg, of copying a photograph she’d taken for a 2017 Harper’s Bazaar Vietnam cover. Dieschburg’s portrait, which Zhang claimed was an uncredited version of her work, was put up for sale after winning a prize at a state-supported biennale earlier this year. “Am I crazy or is this insane,” Zhang wrote in an Instagram caption alongside a side-by-side image of the two works in June, clarifying that she was “happy” to allow students to reference her work, “as long as it’s not for official portfolios, commercial gain, and always credited.” Zhang’s attorney, Vincent Wellens, confirmed to a Luxembourg news outlet that they would appeal the ruling.",

There have been a countless amount of portraits of attractive Asian women that look really similar to hers. Art students should have a reasonable amount of liberty to create work without having to be harassed by copyright trolls.",
