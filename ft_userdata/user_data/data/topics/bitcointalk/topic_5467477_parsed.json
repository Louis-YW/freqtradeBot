Naturally this could help for someone people but to me I see no reason one should used a bot for trading what if the bot malfunction what would be their benefits and what solution would you offer to those who starts making use of the bot after incuring huge lost with little technical issues on the bot. As beginner who is venturing into trading aren't encourage to start using bot at present moment rather should build themselves and understand the some fundamental principles of trading before exploring additional measures to guide and monitor trades.",

Yes I confirm this I just commented on one of their posts its a team effort to shill this project, I thought the guy on another post was asking legit questions asking if it's ok to whitelist his wallet it turns out they are part of the shilling team  should i have to get my wallet whitelisted or not ? need your suggestions I don't recommend that people invest in this.When a project is being shilled or they hire people to shill their project it ends up a shitcoin, so I'm sure this one will end as shitcoin too.",

Nothing convinces more convincingly like results. Results or not, gullible newbies can still fall victim to cheap scams like this one. There is this belief that trading is the best and quicker way to make good money in crypto especially during bear season when the market doesn't bring back much returns. Desperate investors will unintentionally seek out scams like this one in the bid to make fast returns, trading is a difficult act and making good money out of trading takes years of practice, but the short-term investors of these days want everything to happen faster than designated time hence it won't be a surprising thing to see some newbies fall victims.",

Beginners have to go on a normal process where they will start learn about trading and if they are already knowledgeable about the market then using bot might be a good option especially if they are too busy to trade. The project looks interesting though, its just that the risk are high in trading.",

This might be genuine as well but nowadays it's very difficult to trust such projects and tools and I personally had negative experience in not trading.",

I'm not sure nor I don't think this would help them because they need to become a good trader first before making this bot project run efficiently.  Even if you will say that they working well on your end but these bots works depending on its command and that is a problem if you don't have deep knowledge about trading as it will still fail.",
