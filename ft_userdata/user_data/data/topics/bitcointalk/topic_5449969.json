  "content": "I recently recovered the old laptop that I'm using in college when I visit my old room when I'm still living with my parent. My laptop is very old but it's functional when I turn it on. I have a sentimental attachment to it because I use it during my college days for research and watching ....  I'm planning to convert it to an Air Gap Laptop to become useful again. I'm always read Air Gap as a suggestion to have a secure Bitcoin wallet so I'm trying it myself. I already backed up my files and planning to reformat them with a fresh OS. I knew the basic procedure such as removing the Wifi and Bluetooth driver. After that, I don't know what's next. I list below the question I need help with.1.) What Bitcoin wallet will I use to generate seed phrases offline using the air gap laptop? 2.) How can I maintain my laptop functionality since I don't have the option to update my driver? 3.) How can I transfer funds from my Air Gap Laptop to my external wallet without the internet or at least a way to safely transfer it?4.) Is this worth it?",

Its very easy to maintain your laptop functionalities all you have to do is act safely, avoid malwares, don't click on links, don't connect to the internet.Question (3). Creat the transactions on you online account, transfer it to the offline account for signing, then transfer it back to the online account for broadcasting.",

What Bitcoin wallet will I use to generate seed phrases offline using the air gap laptop?I will also suggest you should use Electrum.Quote from: AbuBhakar on April 24, 2023, 08:57:18 AM2.) How can I maintain my laptop functionality since I don't have the option to update my driver?You mean to keep updating it? Not necessary to update it until there is a need for it, just to be using it to sign a transaction.If there is any need for update, you will update it the way you first send the wallet to it using a new or formatted card or flash, using a clean device to download it. But you do not need to update it until the version can no longer sign a message.Quote from: AbuBhakar on April 24, 2023, 08:57:18 AM3.) How can I transfer funds from my Air Gap Laptop to my external wallet without the internet or at least a way to safely transfer it?Read this:https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlQuote from: AbuBhakar on April 24, 2023, 08:57:18 AM4.) Is this worth it?Cold storage wallets are always worth it. They are the safest if you get the security right.",

Electrum and Sparrow Wallet are good option since both are open source and support sign transaction on offline/airgapped environment.Quote from: AbuBhakar on April 24, 2023, 08:57:18 AM2.) How can I maintain my laptop functionality since I don't have the option to update my driver? If current driver let you operate/use your laptop normally, there's no need to worry about it. I would worry about whether how long your laptop hardware would remain operational. You might want to make multiple backup of your wallet on different location.Quote from: AbuBhakar on April 24, 2023, 08:57:18 AM3.) How can I transfer funds from my Air Gap Laptop to my external wallet without the internet or at least a way to safely transfer it?Usually people would use QR Code and camera/webcam to transfer unsigned and signed transaction.Quote from: AbuBhakar on April 24, 2023, 08:57:18 AM4.) Is this worth it?Yes, especially if you have decent amount of cryptocurrency and always perform good security practice.",

Be always careful of your watch-only wallet, always avoid malware, despite having a cold wallet for signing transaction.",

Electrum wallet is a good option, but you can also use Sparrow wallet as alternative, both are open source wallets.There is third option to generate seed phrase manually and calculate last word, but you don't need to go that far if you ar3 doing this the first time.Quote from: AbuBhakar on April 24, 2023, 08:57:18 AM2.) How can I maintain my laptop functionality since I don't have the option to update my driver? First you should buy new hard drive or format old one and install latest Linux operating system, Fedora, Debian or Mint are solid options.You don't need to update any drivers for Linux, but you can do offline update every year.It's important to keep seed words in safe place written on paper or metal, so you can easily recover your wallet.Quote from: AbuBhakar on April 24, 2023, 08:57:18 AM3.) How can I transfer funds from my Air Gap Laptop to my external wallet without the internet or at least a way to safely transfer it?Easiest way is by scanning QR codes for transactions, you need to have working camera and secondary device like your smartphone.Quote from: AbuBhakar on April 24, 2023, 08:57:18 AM4.) Is this worth it?You wont have any financial benefit if you are thinking about that, but you will have better security if you set up and use everything correctly.",

The list below is my chose answer project:1.)Install Electrum2.)Use Linux( although I'm not much familiar on Linux, I will use it since the laptop sole purpose is for air gap laptop. I like the offline update)3.)Use QR code to scan wallet address4.) Definitely Important note to myself: I will backup seed phrase outside the laptop. I'm planning to use washers that I saw on one of @Fillippone thread. Thanks again everyone.",
