It could also be related to the advocacy for bitcoin to be used as a general payment method for all services, i.e. when bitcoin becomes legal tender around the world. Bitcoin does not need to be integrated specifically into the health sector as a means of payment when it becomes widely accepted; it will suffice there and function perfectly, just as it will in other sectors. All other benefits of incorporating bitcoin into the health sector can be hectic, but they will serve their purpose once accomplished.",

What other benefit can you think of.All other benefits may be enjoyed, apart from the data & security. I think this is very easy to think of and say, but establishing it may seem impossible. Despite the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized, you can still track everybody's transactions from one wallet to another. What you cannot tell is the identity of the person who signed those transactions. So, now, let's bring block chain technology to the medical system. You cannot keep a medical record of someone without adding a name to that medical record. You definitely must add the name of the patient to enable you to identify which is which and for which patients. Some patients can have similar illnesses and diseases, and the only way to identify their records is through their name. So, there is no confidentiality when using the Bitcoin network in the medical system. The way to use Bitcoin in the medical system is if hospitals and clinics agree to accept Bitcoin payments as another payment method. The best system in which I think we need to introduce the use of blockchain technology is the government sector, during elections and also during donations. If Bitcoin is used by the government during an election, the result will be public, as every individual can count the votes from their home. If the government also employs Bitcoin for donations, the public will be sure that the government is not lying about the amount they have said to donate.",

Normal payment processes with traditional banks can be time consuming and delayed especially when it involves a large sum but with the help of Bitcoin technology, seamless payment transactions can be carried out.Bank payment is instant now with the help of several improvements in the banking system.  It is even faster than Bitcoin transaction confirmation since local bank transfer is just a matter of seconds.  Bitcoin only shines when it comes to international transfer but I doubt a person will have his health taken care in a foreign country unless he is wealthy enough to cover the expenses of healthcare abroad.In addition to @OP's information and probably the source of @OP's topic,  here is an open letter from Shashank Bishnoi also calls himself Chief Crypto Nomad from LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/impact-crypto-healthcare-industry-shashank-bishnoi#:~:text=CryptocurrenciesIt was discussed in this open letter about the impact of not only Bitcoin but cryptocurrency in the medical field.",

And it was that day I came to notice that the Blockchain has a multifunction dimension which can be used to store data and information for future use. As for me the best sector to use Blockchain is the electoral college body because the nation corruption starts from there and once that body is well secure then all the other departments will adjust and the right thing because if they didn't do the right thing then the next election you will be vote out from the system.",

It’s got more to do with the blockchain technology and the blockchain technology isn’t something that is peculiar to Bitcoin. It might have started with the cryptocurrency idea but, it’s been adopted across various fields today for data storage.Meanwhile, there isn’t any privacy about that.

However, I believe Bitcoin can greatly benefit the healthcare system in two main areas: accessibility to the global market and research and development.Medical records are the most useful part which requires daily records within 24 hours. In the field of medical records, recording never stops for a day.Then, in my opinion, the procurement of medical equipment is the most beneficial because the data collection can be seen at all rather than using an e-catalog.Quote from: iBaba on March 07, 2024, 11:12:12 PMFirstly, Bitcoin’s accessibility to the global market can be advantageous, particularly in international payments and medical tourism.
