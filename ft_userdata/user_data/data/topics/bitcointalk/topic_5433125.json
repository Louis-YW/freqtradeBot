From now on, all digital infrastructure should be reviewed and improved or build newly from experienced coders from scratch because like it has happened now repeatedly multiple times, it can't continue or some people will suffer again. An improvement is really due!",

Always wonder why someone trusts those third party tools to keep their sensitive and very important data safe despite events like those has been happening for years. I guess most of them are just too lazy to type in their password. If you can't remember your passwords, safe it somewhere offline, at least those that are very important to you. No matter \"what security grade\" stuffs they use, there are always a chance someone will breach it and cause massive damage.",

No matter \"what security grade\" stuffs they use, there are always a chance someone will breach it and cause massive damage.You are spot on with the reason that they are lazy. They do not even want to remember their passwords. Some think that is is more secured to keep passwords in an online password lock than a physical locker. With time, people should realize that these are also prone to hacks and leaks.",

      "body": "To store such an amount by trusting a third-party application is completely absurd. Even for such a sum, LastPass itself could come up with a legend about a leak or a hack. Quite suspiciously, LastPass is said to have warned customers about the hack, but the person who filed the lawsuit against LastPass failed to prevent the theft. There have also been accusations that LastPass issued this warning quite late, while the developers were trying to understand the magnitude of the disaster. But, again, third-party applications can monitor all the saves that customers make, make thefts, and subsequently attribute this to hackers, bandits, UFOs, and other entities.How can you have such a sum and not have a sound mind to entrust your money to a stranger?",

Wasn't worth to create a separate thread for a nothingburger like that.Â  The main issue here is not how much money is lost, it shows the risk when storing important data with 3rd party software or using online storage services. Not only for these password storage applications, but we also absolutely do not store private keys or important passwords on online storage platforms. Talking about LastPass a bit more, I advise everyone to stay away from this application, in the past, they were very vulnerable to hackers, and although they did not cause any serious problems, it is clear that their service has issues.",

One more lesson from this incident is that we should not trust every third party tool especially if we deal with crypto. These tools might lack our data in future resulting in financial crypto loss. From the article:\"In December, LastPass admitted that if customers had weak Master Passwords, the attackers may be able to use brute force to guess this password, allowing them to decrypt the vaults.\"Duh! What else do people expect. Of course an insecure masterpassword will render your account at risk.The article in question does not make it clear weather any other data was stolen as a fault of lastpass or if just this users master-pw was too weak and thus allowed hackers to (brute)-force their way into his account.Is there any more information on which data was actually breached regarding lastpass?In any case: A PW manager should (if at all) only be used to store insignificant data for convenience. Leaving any important passwords / creditcard or passphrases on there is a risk noone should take, imho.",

What is the point of removing your bitcoins from a centralized exchange, keeping it in a supposed noncustodial wallet only to save the wallet's keys in another third party app?2. On realizing that there was a data breach, the best thing he would have done was to sweep the bitcoins off the wallets he thinks might have leaked to fresh addresses, but no, he thought deleting the keys from the vault was the way to go.",
