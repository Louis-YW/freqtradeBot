  "content": "Wireshape - To Disrupt the Monopolized Product Registry & Empower the CommunityCurrently, a staggering a quarter of global online purchases are returned, with a striking 64% of these returns attributed to mismatches between online product descriptions and reality. This mismatch not only leads to customer dissatisfaction and high cost of reverse logistics, but also has a profound environmental impact, contributing to an alarming 5 billion pounds of waste in landfills each year. Wireshape's mission is to rectify this widespread problem, fostering transparency and accuracy in product data to enhance customer satisfaction and promote environmental responsibility within the e-commerce sector. Web3 Community Anchored by L2 Blockchain Dedicated to Supply-Chain TransparencyWireshape is an open Web3 Infrastructure anchored by L2 blockchain dedicated to supply-chain transparency, ensuring a new decentralized product data standard, as a GS1 on Web3. Championing consumer empowerment through decentralized reviews, a community-curated product registry, and seamless integration for platforms, all while prioritizing transparency and data fidelity.Open L2 Blockchain NetworkWireshape open L2 blockchain network is dedicated to meeting the needs of transparency and management in the supply chain. Serving as a safe and fast environment with a low gas fee guarantee for carrying out transactions that involve everything from product data registries, inventory control, traceability of the manufacturing process, recording transport stages to payment processing.dAppWireshape dApp is a web3 system committed to decentralize product data, with a new standard, open and audited by the community. Consumers themselves, as well as manufacturers, are able to add and validate the fidelity of product information that is publicly registered on the Wireshape blockchain and stored distributedly. By providing easy-to-use APIs, we are able to provide integration of the distributed products data to ERPs, ecommerces and marketplaces, and transparency and consumption awareness to the buyer, who is able to have access to complete and relevant information about a product before it is purchased, ensuring greater satisfaction by acquiring what was really expected. Taking action against climate change is imperative and we take care to include data about the product/packaging's material as essential information, so that consumers are aware of their carbon footprint and will be able to arrange for proper disposal after consumption.Global Product Registry Tutorial Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjPseFt5u61DubvwjheuXPUZuUIpUOGU_Our Progress So FarWireshape Floripa Testnet running.Blockchain explorer for Wireshape blockchain networks running - https://floripa-explorer.wireshape.orgWireshape dApp Web3 platform running in beta - https://beta.wireshape.org50k community members.1.72k product registries on the blockchain.1K+ users accepted and participating in the beta test as contributors.2K+ contributor applications to the community.A Web3-Focused DisruptorWhile traditional competitors like GS1 and 1worldsync have established a presence, they remain rooted in traditional practices and lack the agility to leverage the advantages of Web3 technology. Wireshape, on the other hand, is uniquely positioned as a Web3-focused disruptor. While these traditional competitors possess significant resources and industry presence, their centralized approaches lack the agility, community engagement, and adaptability that define Wireshape's approach. Our commitment to embracing blockchain enables us to offer a more transparent, secure, and community-driven platform, aligning perfectly with the evolving demands of consumers and industry stakeholders. And to serve the current market not yet immersed in Web3, we provide APIs for easy integrations with ERPs and ecommerces.TCPR - Token Curated Product RegistryThe Token Curated Product Registry (TCPR) is our decentralized mechanism for curating product information, forging a reliable database on the blockchain, and empowering the community with intrinsic incentives in WWIRE tokens.In the TCPR, token holders are given the responsibility of curating the information in the database. They are incentivized to do so by earning rewards in the form of tokens for accurately and truthfully curating the information. This incentivization mechanism ensures that token holders have a vested interest in maintaining the accuracy and quality of the information in the database. In addition, the decentralized nature of the TCPR means that there is no central authority or intermediaries that can manipulate the information, providing a level of trust and transparency to users.The TCPR system is being built by Wireshape around the TCR concept and the pioneering work done by Mike Goldin from ConsenSys in his Token-Curated Registries 1.0 paper.More about Wireshape TCPR: https://wireshape.org/docs/whitepaper/tcprOfficial Links & SocialsWebsite: https://wireshape.org/Block Explorer: https://floripa-explorer.wireshape.org/Docs: https://docs.wireshape.org/Whitepaper: https://whitepaper.wireshape.org/GitHub: https://github.com/wireshapeMedium: https://wireshape.medium.com/Twitter: https://twitter.com/wireshapeTelegram: https://t.me/wireshapeInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wireshapeYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/c/WireshapeReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/wireshape/Discord: https://discord.com/invite/pP6PATrAGZGalxe: https://galxe.com/wireshape",
