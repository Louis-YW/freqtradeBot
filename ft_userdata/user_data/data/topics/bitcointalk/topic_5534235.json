Therefore, with the launch of a crypto currency strategic reserve by President Trump with the backing of the U.S government, of which they said would include Bitcoin, XRP, SOL, ETH, and other notable cryptocurrencies for store deposit, don't you think the idea of what a strategic reserve stands for is kind of skewed in this regard? Because clearly, the gold reserve stores only gold, therefore Bitcoin which is known as the 'digital gold', should be easier, and a simpler successor of gold and should be the only crypto currency to be kept in the crypto currency strategic reserve that President Trump with the backing of the U.S government, has mandated to be implemented.Your thoughts are welcomed!",

What we were hearing was a bitcoin strategic reserve, which everyone was only expecting bitcoin to be what we will see, but as we all know, bitcoin always comes in the front line even when they have other hidden agendas.Now if they labelled it to be a cryptocurrency reserve, then all those altcoins that are included are a clear indicator that they are selected based on biased interest, which either their creators have some agreement with the president, all because those altcoins have been chosen because it's easier to manipulate them and take advantage of whatever comes of it.",

      "body": "Fully agree with @headingnorth.In general, it could even be a good idea to include altcoins into a strategic reserve, but these altcoins then must be decentralized as Bitcoin, i.e. not controllable by any entity. At this moment (apart from Bitcoin obviously), I think only XMR could eventually fullfill this requirement. But it's still too weak to really be interesting as a strategic reserve.In addition, most of the other altcoins mentioned for the reserve are typical utility tokens. This means that the tokens fulfill a purpose, like \"gas measurement\" in the case of ETH. This could lead into situations where the coin project would have to decide to expand its supply to ensure there is enough liquidity for gas payments, which would counter the interests of hodlers, including the nations holding it as a strategic reserve.Quote from: headingnorth on March 05, 2025, 12:40:34 AMNo government wants to buy as a reserve asset that is run and controlled by a foreign entity, and can be easily manipulated or seized by the foreign entity at any moment. Good point. While I can understand that other countries may be interested to \"race\" with the US to get Bitcoin reserves for the cheapest possible price, the centralized US altcoins aren't interesting for any other country for this exact reason you mention, so there will be no race -- and thus there is also no purpose of the \"strategic reserve\", as no other Central Bank or nation will compete with the US for these coins. The only exception may be Ethereum due to its relatively established nature, but I believe ETH won't be as interesting as Bitcoin for other countries because it has the problems related to utility tokens I mentioned above.To @OP: you're actually not correct, many Central Banks do have silver reserves for example, although these are much smaller than the worldwide gold and US dollar reserves. There are even countries holding strategic reserves of edible commodities like rice.",

The average fineness is 916.7.Under the currency reforms enacted by Roosevelt, the federal government owns the gold and holds it as security for $11 billion in gold certificates issued, in book-entry form, to the Federal Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve Banks use these certificates as a small fraction of the collateral for Federal Reserve Notes.In addition to the gold, the depository currently holds ten 1933 Double Eagle gold coins, a 1974-D aluminum cent, and twelve gold (22-karat) Sacagawea dollar coins that flew on the Space Shuttle.yep only 17% of gold in the gold depositary are the gold standard of 99.5% purity..so 83% holdings are alt-bars",

Bitcoin is decentralized and not a company that is own by one man like the other altcoins that are centralized and controlled by individual like you and I, which means that nothing is guaranteed about the projects, it's very possible that the company could have financial challenges and when they file for bankruptcy, the coin will suffer it. The government does not need to use a one man's business as federal reserve, it's just a dumb idea.",

There is no general formula/rule that says only gold or bitcoin should be used as national reserves. In addition to gold, other assets such as oil, foreign currency, government bonds...are also used by governments as strategic reserves. So we cannot just rely on this aspect to say that Trump's cryptocurrency reserve strategy is somewhat skewed. People are giving special love and favor to bitcoin more than any other coin, that's why people are not happy with this idea, IMO. But SOL or ETH investors are happy with this idea.",

It generated a good profit and I think it has a big potential but everyone fights privacy coins.From the point of view of 2025, for sure you're correct.However, political ideology can change, and while currently it doesn't seem so, I have some hopes that in the next 10-20 years the stance of governments towards privacy coins like XMR could change. It could become, for example, more important for democratic countries to be able to support opposition movements in autocracies, as autocracies are the world's primary drivers of insecurity (wars like in Ukraine, poverty due to corruption, etc.). This feature of privacy coins could be considered much more important than the quite small damage done by criminal activity \"laundered\" through these coins.Thus I don't see it as impossible that in several years, some countries could consider XMR reserves.However, I had mentioned XMR only as an example for an altcoin which could fit into the \"commodity\" category, which of course is not limited to privacy coins. LTC for example is close, but Charlie Lee still seems to have some influence in the foundation. There are some smaller (and mostly relatively old) coins like PPC and NMC which are fairly decentralized and thus could fit into the \"commodity\" category too, but are way too small currently to be of interest of any nation-state as a reserve currency.",
