      "body": "I don't see much difference between mining solo with your own pool vs the public pool.The only difference is that the public pool takes small percentage of the block reward once you've successfully mine a block like ckpool they take 2% of the block reward unlike mining solo with your own pool the block reward is all yours the only downside is you will need to maintain your node and pool.",

The hashrate of others doesn't count, there is no \"competition\".The more hashrate you own yourself, means the more shares you send, so the more likely you are to find a block. That's the only thing that counts: what others do on their side will never concern you in solo mining.To answer your question, it's best to use an honest solo pool that has been paying its users for a long time:-solo ckpool-viabtc-kanoThis doesn't really change anything compared to building your own pool, but at least with one of this 3 solo pool you'll be sure that from a technical point of view everything's ok, and you won't risk investing energy, time and hope, for nothing.",

Yep, 100% agree on that.I also agree almost completely with ur point or recommendation of ur pools.Ofc u are right that the stated solopools have proven themselves over years and there is no worry about the payout and constant performance. But there is a small \"disadvantage\" - if u can call it like dat - that comes  with using one of them.The pool fee (for CK's pool it is 2%, for Kano only 0.5%)- To be honest: It is an obsolete point coz it saves u a lot of work and u are on the safe side. Nevertheless, I wanted to have it mentioned once.To clarify again, the fees are used in return for maintenance and server costs.",

Nevertheless, I wanted to have it mentioned once.Yeap of course.  I sincerely hope no beginner refuses to use a well established solo pool because of the 0.5 or 2% fees on the block reward, while risking a 100% loss with solo mining via their own!",
