I know what has been happened in the past with imgur but since now the service is restored, then why imgur links are no longer suported on the forum ?Perhaps the admins of the forum do not want us to use imgur anymore.",

I didn't change anything on the forum's end, so imgur must've loosened up their limits. I guess it's not necessary to convert img images into links as long as imgur keeps working. But to prevent this from happening again, you'll get an error if you try to embed imgur images in posts from now on.I'd like to create a page which recommends services for hosting forum images, and mention this in the error message you get when you try to use imgur. Other than TalkImg, which ones are good?",

With margin to adjust some point, according to the need and eventually an extra cost.It will then be possible to move up to a much higher level, where the annual cost would be around 2k$/year.
