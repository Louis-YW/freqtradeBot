People used to do work for their selves more accurately, but if someone else will pay them then the same work will be done more accurately then before. Because this time the person/developer has the responsibility as he is charging money and he has to do a good work.Well, I have a question for Op, you mentioned some basic steps to create or start a crypto wallet, but you did not mention anything related to Law and regulation, I mean, don't they have anything to do with crypto wallets. I know, if you are following all the legal norms then you are ok but what happens when you got hacked or your wallets got hacked. Then what type of policy one should adopt. I know this query is not some basic thing instead it is dealt when things started and completed 50% but still, if you have shared this topic then you must have some decent knowledge about it too and I am looking to get a reasonable answer. I hope you won't mind.",
