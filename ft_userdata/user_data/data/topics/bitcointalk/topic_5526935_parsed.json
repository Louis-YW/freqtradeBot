  "content": "Hello all,I made an animated video during the holidays related to bitcoin, and it was kind of successful (not that much though   )Here is the 1st thread, and the video: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5525071.new#newhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH35Ri9Bi34(this was even retweeted by Bitcoin news, https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1875921242567680403 )And this is the 2nd one I made:And here is the link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9nSiR2cbYQIt is related to bitcoin wallets, self custody options and security, and the main ways to obtain bitcoin, it is also thought for beginners.Now, I have a bunch of videos I still want to make, would you guys give me some advice about which ones would be more interesting?- Bitcoin vs. altcoins/memecoins, I particularly like this topic, I think it would be the next one- Advanced self custody, metal backups strategies, passphrases, multisig setups, steganography...- Other bitcoin layers, lightning, liquid...I would love your feedback on the current videos, and if you find these topics interesting",

We even hear that once someone talks about crypto, that points directly to Bitcoin, even if it is just altcoin/s. There are a lot of things that are needed to understand, which I believe this suits for beginners. Actually, tutorial videos are more interesting than watching movies...The easier to understand, the better, because not all viewers want to dig deeper. Instead, just having some knowledge of what to invest in and where to invest is good enough.",

      "body": "Good job OP, the videos you made are very easy to understand, just a suggestion from me maybe it would be better if video thread 1 and 2 are combined by updating every time you make a video. This will make it easier for anyone without having to jump from one thread to another. all videos collected in one thread will be very easy for me to bookmark.I hope from video to video will see animation in cartoon form by making simulation so that it can be easier to digest without having to use the automatic translation feature. So where this video can be represented by certain character animations.",

      "body": "The first and second were cool, very audible and the animation wasn't unnecessarily too informal, no wonder it caught the attention of Bitcoin news, I strongly believe those videos would be of help to many newbies and beginners out there who aren't properly guide in the Crypto-currency space.So OP would this be like a thing for you, like would you be dropping more videos like this? If yes you too have a lot of research to do so that you ensure you only deliver the correct information out there.",

      "body": "Nice compilation OP. The video is quite nice and the animation is very simple and direct. Anyways I think one major thing you should consider makeing a video for too is not just about how bitcoin works only but also what the concept of decentralisation and privacy is all about and most especially how the bitcoin network makes use of it and how to maximise it as a bitcoin user.You find out that one of the major problems that newbies usually Face In the case of venturing bitcoin investments or the bitcoin ecosystem in general is privacy related issues and also security issues too. You have more cases of failed investments out there because of security issues faced by newbies.",

Although the animation is not like the other animated videos but it's more simple, the explanations are good, overall it's 8.5/10 to me. The main problem now is how to spread it to the different parts of the internet so anyone can see it for them to learn it.",
