  "content": "Majority of the beautiful places I have been to has always had a taste that defines the excellence of the owner or builder or creator. Be it a house, a nation, a museum, a casino, even a person among others. The ability to keep ones living space tidy, organized and beautiful with ornaments, arts/artefacts, nice scents, will help one make more money, stay more focused and would improve productivity all-round.My living space is beautiful to my taste, although there are still one or two things I need to add up to improve the touch. Here however, I can think, and be naked and free and if I have a task to complete, the space is set up in a way that suits the task in hand. Same goes for casino houses, and other beautiful places that are money making ventures. Those that make more money take time to beautify the place that it becomes very alluring, and it makes those who patronise such a place feel good about spending their money.I have no doubt about the subject matter that a beautiful place assures excellence in business and personal life, because,  I have seen in this life time how ones environment and conditions of living can be a motivation to do better or do worse. One other point to note is that, a beautiful place/space can be too comfortable in the long run and you know how harmful it is to be in ones comfort zone for too long. Furthermore, a beautiful place/space isn't just a house, it is more than that. It is a place where one finds peace of mind, harmony and where thoughtful reasoning is possible. It could be a garden, it could be anywhere so beautiful that it enchants the goddess of luck and inspiration.What other ways do you make sure that your place/space remains beautiful and attract good luck?When you visit a beautiful and well decorated place, do you spend more or less?Are there any other points you would like to add?",

      "body": "Is change not better for concentration and remaining focussed than static beauty? You can get change by merely venturing outside or into the wilderness for a few hours but it might do better for your concentration than staying in one place.Brightness and sunlight also generally have huge affects on how productive people can be. A comfortable environment can keep you focussed still though, I think it matters more how your environment changes than your comfort level (ie opening the curtains or turning on a lamp at a desk can still make a bedroom a more productive space without needing the venture further).",

It might not be expensively decorated or smell good due to nice air freshener but it must be free from dirt and properties should be well arranged. I prefer to work or stay in a hut that is clean and well arranged than to stay in a dirty mansion. Customers would always prefer to visit places that are free from dirt and germs.Another factor I consider is the serenity of the environment. I prefer staying in place that is not noisy and too busy. Playing load music or having loud conversations highly distracts me. I prefer to stay in a quite space where I can concentrate and carryout my tasks. This environment makes me more productive.",

      "body": "I think that in general, all natural spaces are better than artificial spaces.  The more natural the place, the better.  It would be good for the space to be equipped with the basics in terms of cleanliness and safety, but a prerequisite is that it be as natural as possible.It is these elements that have always made me think that investing in an agricultural project is the best opportunity that can achieve financial and psychological stability for me. It does not have to be a huge project, it is enough to achieve self-sufficiency financially and economically.",

      "body": "My storage areas might be described as disorganized and messy. But I can find what I'm looking for and know where everything is located. Everything has a purpose. It only appears messy and disorganized as its an attempt to store too much capacity inside of an area that is not large enough to hold it. Wide open spaces are a luxury and design aesthetic. Utilitarian demands could represent a higher priority. While many architects love uncluttered design. They might fail to realize their designs are uncluttered simply due to them not having anything in them. Some things are supposed to be cluttered to capacity for them to be useful. A hammer should have scratches from hammering things. The area around a saw should be cluttered with sawdust from sawing things. The beautiful uncluttered aesthetic can sometimes only be maintained in areas which are not seeing real world use for their proper purpose.Organization however is excellent. Categorizing. Proper storage with labels. That is a great aesthetic to implement and maintain.",

Often times, people look out for a well-tidy business place, for example, an eatery, bar, or barber shop. If this place is well-arranged with good fragrance and designs, it attracts customers more and they make more money as long as their service is solid. But by right, a business environment is meant to be kept tidy with a pleasant fragrance; that's the number one thing that makes a customer feel more comfortable and relaxed whenever they come in for business. I may not actually spend more than I expect to, but I can make that place a frequent place to visit any time I need their service. Some people don't take good care of their business environment because all they are concerned about is making money and don't care about customer satisfaction.People are different with how they respond to the environment they find themselves in; I love a serene place with a touch of free gift of nature, like near a stream where the gentle breeze can be so hard on the skin. and some birds making different sounds; that's for out doors, but for indoors, I don't think anybody likes a distressful place; everyone needs a place where they can have rest of mind, and so long as the rest of mind is there, nothing else matters as nothing else can interfere with their productivity in reasoning. For me, I love my peace, and tidiness is a priority.",

I don't believe so that a beautiful and comfortable place can be harmful. Such beautiful place can only be harmful if in the real sense there are other beautiful place better than the one we have or are in. In other words if we have reached the pinnacle of our career and acquire all the good things that can make us comfortable and are not looking for more, making it our comfort zone so how will it now be harmful or dangerous to us? No it won't if we have reached the peak of our life and identifying, providing and making somewhere our comfort zone, that is what it is.",

And the point is that creating a comfortable atmosphere will indeed allow us to think more calmly and encourage better inspiration. even a restaurant that has beautiful and comfortable architecture will make visitors addicted to coming back and becoming regular customers. and so it is in other types of business. But I personally prefer everything that is neat. with the layout decorated as neatly as possible. A neat office makes my concentration better.",

Just because a place is beautiful gives no assurance of success, success in business and personal life is the final outcome of many inputs and not just a beautiful place.The environment has a huge impact on a person's mindset and optimism. As we can observe, people from overpopulated places with toxic and disastrous environments are having a hard time dealing with life. They can't focus on reaching their goals because of the distractions around them. While people living in a peaceful and beautiful place could focus on what they want in life either in business or career growth. A person with a safe and peaceful environment could live a successful and peaceful life.",
