  "content": "I think that bitcoin will never become mainstream due to the nature of it. The only possibility I can see that it will get mainstream is via centralized parties, like easy-to-use exchanges managing the users coins.What are the arguments that support bitcoin will go mainstream? Any argument I can find online is something non-related to bitcoin itself - For example, if the US government buys bitcoin, or Tesla accepts Dogecoin it isn't something that (in my opinion, at least) makes bitcoin more accessible for the normal, non-technical every day person.I think bitcoin became a scam not by purpose. see, these days people on social media just tell you to buy it, because it's a currency and its price will go up. but what makes bitcoin a currency? its community? but most of its community just bought it as an investment, not as a currency - as an asset. it's like a pyramid scheme.Bitcoin does bring some good things to the world, where free (as in freedom  ) digital money is inaccessible, but to the western world, what it brings? gambling? crime? mostly. some will argue privacy, but what exactly is private about bitcoin?It also grows exponentially in terms of energy and resources needed to operate it, which is a total waste.Some will argue it's a \"new kind of global currency\". but again, most bitcoin users don't use it for daily transactions. you might say, how do I know that? simple - because all the data on the blockchain is completely public.And it's overpriced.Leave your comments.",

Bitcoin always get to ATH. Also compare bitcoin to gold and other assets, not pyramidal scheme.That's not true.

You need a lot to learn.This is nonsense, because that energy could go to things way more important than mining bitcoin, like feeding hungry people, or warming their houses in the winter. Overall, the energy is wasted because it is used to accomplish something that can be accomplished without that heavy used of energy, hence it is wasted.By the way, I didn't say that these arguments can't be made towards gold. I'm just saying they can be made against bitcoin.QuoteAlso compare bitcoin to gold and other assets, not pyramidal scheme.It is wrong to compare bitcoin to gold since bitcoin's whole purpose is to be a currency, not an alternative to gold.",

Did you know that Libra (the coin developed by Facebook) was going to enable decentralized payments just like Bitcoin, but in Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp etc? Kinda like TON for Telegram now but back then, the US Federal Reserve killed it because they did not want such a mainstream decentralized coin. I can provide a source for this.And they tried to kill Bitcoin like that too, in Operation Chokepoint 2.0, shutting down the mixers, exchanges, etc, harassing Binance and so on. But they failed. That being said, they are currently trying to do everything possible to prevent Bitcoin from going mainstream. They want a CDBC like China.",

Eventually, the whole system collapses, and the founders run off with the money.So you're comparing that with Bitcoin?
