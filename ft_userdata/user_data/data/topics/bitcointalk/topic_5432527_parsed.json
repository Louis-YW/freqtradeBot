The hack on Ronnin bridge of Axie Infinity is from North Korea too.I can not know the accuracy of news but if we connect it with sanctions, money spent for missile research and launches from that nation, a fact is they must have a source of income for expensive cost of missile launches. Cryptocurrency is sensitive to hacks and can be a favorite target for North Korea.Axie Infinity hack highlights DPRK cryptocurrency heists",

Anyway, if there's a counter attack against those hackers I hope they will succeed on this so we can finally eliminate those hackers and free cryptomarket from any hack.",

It will be impossible for the cryptocurrency ecosystem to be free from scams and hacks. We should not direct the problem specifically to some group, instead, the only things that one should thrive upon are to educate the masses about basic digital security. Relying on them to stop those scammer groups will hardly give benefit since everyone else can simply do it. If only people have a basic awareness and be sceptical about what they are doing, I believe the rate of people getting scammed will be significantly reduced.",

Soon it may become normal and relatively safe to justify some negative events in cryptocurrency by saying that North Korea was involved and throw the blame on them. Very convenient, and most importantly, no one will demand any denials since North Korea is in world isolation",

And why do i know it's the government and not some individuals ? Because individuals in there don't have an access to internet.I honestly think that this is just a start. I know i said that in 2019 about nfts, but i really feel the same feeling of underrated",

That's how insane these guys are, they seem to have advanced knowledge when it comes to hacking.That's why it's really important to learn how to prevent ourselves from becoming victims of this kind of scamming technique and also learn the right thing to do before purchasing any altcoins or NFTs.",
