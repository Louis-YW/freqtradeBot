The FTX issue and the other CEX hacks affected the cryptocurrency market in general and not just Bitcoin even though Bitcoin have been the major asset targeted during those events. They never put doubts as to the authenticity and reliability of Bitcoin because the problem is with those platforms and not the assets stolen. So, in line with the caption of this thread,  Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin.As for the future of CEX, they will continue to be there because they play key role in the entire cryptocureenxy ecosystem. As  a matter of fact, the percentage of people using DEX is still smaller than those using CEX. The only advice that should be taken serious is that CEX should not be used as place to store your assets; it should just be a place to buy and sell, then withdraw to a wallet where you control the private keys.",

Centralized exchanges are very good in marketing and more of the newbies are using the exchanges.As for noncustodial wallets, best to move your coins out of exchanges into noncustodial wallet to have full control over your coins.",

There have been the bubble and disappearance story of bitcoin from people like Warren Buffett and his likes but bitcoin is here already.Moreover, the FTX wasn't particular about bitcoin, it was a scam of an exchange that was predicted to affect the trust in the crypto market and yes it did at the time which is normal and crypto is back because all those are past like others before FTX.And FTX scam didn't affect forex market, I don't think it had any effect on the largest market with a daily volume of about $6 trillion.Quote from: Amphenomenon on November 07, 2023, 02:50:45 AMDo you think will soon stop using CEX and opt for DEX and non custodian wallet? Nope. The two exchanges will exist side by side if at all the total active users of DEX will equal half of exchange users. For now, CEX is the most popular. Some newbies see binance as the only crypto exchange. But be sure to store your coins on your personal wallet.Those users who mind their privacy and the real nature of decentralized cryptocurrency look forward to DEX.Lol....I just remember. I don even 4get say na home I dey self, I 4 dey blow my pidgin dey go. The tin dey sweet my skull.",

OP, FTX collapsed around November 2022, and there was no way anyone thought that Bitcoin was going to die just because of the collapse of a centralized exchange. Although the incident caused the price of Bitcoin to plunge, no one thought it was going to kill Bitcoin. Have you ever looked through the great crash of Bitcoin some years ago, which almost got most Bitcoiners then to believe that Bitcoin would die, but it never did? If Bitcoin did not die, then it's not just the massive collapse of a CEX that's going to cause it to die.Although it is very recommended to use DEX because one is not required to carry out KYC, I do use CEX mostly for P2P, trading my bitcoin or some stable coin.",

The price crash out of panic and unto say we dey bear market wey be say the market dey wait for may negative news to take a dip and that's what FTX with other projects wey crash during dat period cause to just make every where scatter but still the crash no reach other bear market correction wey the market dun get before. We need to understand say any centralized services or project wey dey the industry go fail one day. Dem go either fail from hack or one team member selling out the project. Human being dey greedy and this market no dey regulated so if dem plan am wey dey can get away with most crimes. QuoteDo you think will soon stop using CEX and opt for DEX and non custodian wallet? .To be honest, not likely anytime soon but e no mean say e no fit happen. With the way I dey see this industry dey go wey be say everybody just dey ask for regulations, e go increase the need of centralized exchanges and wallet providers because na one of the ways wey the government go fit regulate the industry be dat (by regulating the exchanges and wallets provides wey dey centralization like dem Binance and trust wallet). So if we want DEX to shine wey no suppose dey follow ask for regulation, make we allow the industry dey like this but work on decentralized ways to make the market more secure as scammers just dey feast for this side as na people's wey no know how to handle demselfs full here.",

I don't think people will stop using CEX. mismanagement of one person will not affect another. Although DEX wallet is more preferable than CEX I would have said Binance is more secured but I just remainberd that even Binance was once hacked. So the point there is that there is no need putting all your fund in CEX rather put in a non custodiall wallet. Whenever you fell the need of making a coin withdrawal you send to CEX and withdrawal that is my own opinion.For the Bitcoin aspect, Bitcoin is Bitcoin according to op. No matter what happens to crypto market Bitcoin can not fall to the ground. If the pillar of a house falls definitely the building will collapse. meaning if Bitcoin fall to the ground all that ends crypto currency. Thats why it's the father or mother of cryto according according to some people.",

It's true regulation is inevitable because of all the scam and shit crypto projects. I may not be wrong saying 90% of cryptocurrency are of no value/use. If it was only bitcoin then it would be easier but I guess in the long almost all bitcoiners will opt for non-custodial wallet. So trustwallet is no longer a DEX?Quote from: Gozie51 on November 07, 2023, 09:34:24 AMLol....I just remember. I don even 4get say na home I dey self, I 4 dey blow my pidgin dey go.
