  "content": "Due to the ongoing war, inflation along with fuel prices have skyrocketed among the globe, with households not being able to keep up with the increased living costs. However, the impact of the increased living costs differ from country to country. Let's take Greece's case for instance, which is the country of my residency. According to CNN Greece and MurciaToday, it has the third more expensive fuel in Europe, averaging 2.17€/liter of 95 unleaded, right after Finland and Denmark at 2.218€/liter and 2.208€/liter respectively. On top of that, the average mentioned price isn't that accurate anymore, due to the article being two days old already and the prices are increasing on a daily basis. The average is close to 2.20-2.22€/liter, but that could also be valid for the other two mentioned countries.However, Denmark and Finland have one of the highest salaries and considerably best living conditions in Europe. Denmark on the one hand, doesn't feature an official minimum wage, but statistics show that the average income per individual is $2580 (~2450 euros). Finland on the other hand, also doesn't have an official minimum wage imposed, however the minimum salary someone can expect starts from €1.500 to €2.500. Greece's minimum wage however, doesn't exceed €713 before taxes. It's pretty obvious that you can easily see the difference.The Greek citizens are suffering from the increased living costs, since everything has skyrocketed in price, from daily expenses such as gas and going to the supermarket, to electricity and utility bills. Personally, in my area petrol costs €2.35/liter, while I had to pay €300 for my electricity bill (4 months period), while increases in daily groceries have surpassed 20% in some products, such as meat and vegetables.Sources: https://m.murciatoday.com/diesel_prices_in_spain_exceed_eu_average_for_first_time_1776291-a.htmlhttps://www.cnn.gr/oikonomia/story/313066/spaei-ta-konter-i-timi-tis-venzinis-aplisiasta-ta-pratiria-sta-nisia/amp",

      "body": "Generally apart from Greece, I think the cost of fuel on a litre is increasing by the day which is further deeping inflation and the cost of living and maintenance of the home and paying of utility bill is proportionally growing. This is keeping hardship unabated. For countries that the government decide to pay a little higher wages, they may not feel the hard times badly like Denmark or Finland as reference point but the countries with lesser paid salaries, the poor are getting poorer. Overall I also think this inflation is the outcome of wars from golf war in 1990 over thirty years ago.",

      "body": "I may be wrong, but I always put Greece in the context of what happened in the not-so-distant past when Greece was saved in what is called the biggest financial rescue of a bankrupt country in history. Given all the measures and the huge debt that will not be able to be repaid until 2060 at the earliest, Greece is in great disfavor with those who bought its debt.All this that is happening all over the world in Greece can only be more pronounced because the country does not have a free hand to deal with the crisis but must listen to what the bureaucrats from Brussels will do. The fact that the ECB only has a meeting in July where it could raise interest rates only deepens the crisis and raises inflation. My country is in the EU, but fortunately, it is still not within the eurozone, which gives the central bank room for maneuvering to make some decisions together with the government. Fuel prices have been frozen several times already, which means that the price of 95 is about 0.40 EUR lower than in Greece. In addition, despite the sanctions, we are one of the countries that increased the most Russian oil imports after the Russian aggression on Ukraine. I'm not happy about that, especially since I know that part of the oil goes to another country, but that's another story.Inflation is inevitable, and those who can keep it at around 10% will be considered lucky - others will have to tighten their belts even more. When it comes to the EU, I have no doubt that the countries in the west will fare much better than those in the east, but we should not be surprised, given that in the end everyone has to take care of themselves.",

      "body": "Greece and Italy too are \"in my book\" somewhere at the \"far end of the pipe\", i.e. I think that logistics may be playing an important role in the price, no matter it's a real pipe or it's about transportation on the road.For those living near the northern part - close to Macedonian border - refueling abroad is a real deal.Many tourists also do the same - refuel in Macedonia, just before entering Greece.All this is known and it's not new at all. Of course, in the same way the fuel prices skyrocketed everywhere, they did - most probably proportionally - also in Greece.I'll tell about Romania. The incomes are also far from great. Romania also extracts some fuel from own soil. And still the price now is over 1.63 EUR and keeps rising (iirc it was under 1 EUR last summer)Now the northern countries: from what I know at least one of them has huge offshore resources. This means that those countries pretty much near the \"start of the pipe\". It's, unfortunately, not so much related to how much do people earn, although that fuel price ends up soon in the shelf prices for everything.And something more: it's interesting to watch how much is the fuel price taxed. In some countries (including Romania) the tax is overly high. It may be the same situation in Greece too. And then it's the government that has to do something, even if it's temporary.LE: One chart I find pretty good is: https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/gasoline_prices/Europe/ (just make sure you set price to EUR)",

Maybe not aim to have a car fueled by gasoline/diesel these days. But try checking out electric vehicles like electric bikes or tricycles.And if you are just doing short distances, why not just walk, use bike or use the public transportation?If you have the option not to use a car, then don't. Aside from saving money, you are also lessening your carbon footprint.Everywhere seems to increase the fuel prices, not only in Europe area. So be smart these days, look for alternative and better options.",

I can't claim that we were \"saved\" since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) admitted that they hadn't assessed the situation correctly, making a few mistakes in the measures that were taken. Anyway, I believe not being in the Eurozone as a benefit anymore, since most countries I've seen that still have their own currency are in a way better standing than we are.

It's true, people living near the Macedonian border are opting to buy petrol from there, I would too, provided that I had the option, it's way cheaper there. Unfortunately, those living in islands, like myself, are met with extravagant fuel prices, in some islands it has even surpassed €2.5/liter.Fuel prices have certainly skyrocketed everywhere, however, due to the unfair taxation here, which always took place, and the price increases in every aspect of our daily lives, have become unbearable. We always had expensive fuel, but we're now on the top of the list with countries that have double or triple wages compared to ours.Quote from: adaseb on May 24, 2022, 04:16:48 AMIn Greece they don’t travel as much. I commute to work and university every day, meaning that I do over 30-40 kilometers a day, it might seem a little for USA's standards, but it's not only the fuel that has skyrocketed.
