I mean this is the real deal since it doesnâ€™t connect on internet like what you mention. My worries if this team provide a rigged cartridge which all the seed phrase in already on their data base. Thereâ€™s no way for a normal guy like me that doesnâ€™t have enough understanding on code to check if the cartridge is same to generate seed phrase at all.Thanks for sharing. I already sign up for the first batch. I hope that they can let us choose the game for the cartridge which they will insert the seed phrase generator. AFAIK, they will use the random click on buttons while playing the game to generate seed phrase.",

How will the company distribute the firmware? Yep. You will have to buy the cartridge and have it shipped to your home, place of work, or a PO box, depending on what is supported, where you live, and what shipment options the company supports. It's no different from when you purchase a standard hardware wallet. You have to pay for it and have it shipped to you or someone/ somewhere else.

The reason is simple: If you are not able to access you bitcoins at some point, because you are old/dead or anything like it, your family will pretty much not be able to find your bitcoin storage device at all. It's the same as any other physical backups you have. If you die and your family doesn't know where your recovery phrases are hidden, they lose access to their coins. If they have the seed backup but you didn't tell them where the non-crackable passphrase is, they again lose access to the coins.",

Although I believe that for a device that will only sign transactions and view time on the screen will be short, there is no need to have a color screen. Gameboy with a black and white screen will be a cheap and affordable solution.Oh yeah. A cheaper option may be to search on local Internet websites selling various junk, shops, flea markets, as well as from individuals. For many, this device can gather dust on distant shelves waiting for your purchase. A second life for Gameboy can be a useful solution to the problem of owning a hardware wallet device.The appearance of Gameboy can be neglected (broken case, buttons, etc.), the main thing is that the filling is intact and functional. The case can be changed by ordering from a well-known Chinese marketplace.",

If you have the necessary hardware, yes. As their GitHub page mentions, you'll need a flashing device for the job. No idea how much those cost and which ones are compatible. You also need a cartridge. Again, I am not sure if it needs to be an empty cartridge (where would you get one for Gameboy in 2023) or if you can use one you already own with a game on it.If would surely be cheaper to buy the finished product if you stand there without the necessary tools to do the flashing yourself.",
