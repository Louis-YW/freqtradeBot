  "content": "Tomorrow, the work of the World Climate Conference begins in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. It will last until the 18th of this month.During the previous conferences, its results did not result in a significant change in the health of our planet, and the goals that were agreed upon to work on were not achieved. Especially after the withdrawal of the United States from the climate agreement during the rule of Donald Trump.These are the topics that will be discussed during this conference:Providing financial support to developing countries to help them adapt to the effects of climate change.Stop subsidizing fossil fuels.Work to reduce the risks to the planet.Work to reduce the rate of global temperature increase to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius.Climate finance on a regular basis of $100 billion.Determine the price of carbon.Reducing the use of coal to reduce the increase in gaseous emissions into the atmosphere.Gradually phase out coal.In your opinion, will this conference succeed in achieving its goals, and will the participating countries commit themselves to work to reduce global pollution?",

      "body": "These climate conferences never end up successful because it's just another form of global wealth distribution under the guise of climate change action. Take larger and developed countries and force them to sacrifice their cheap energy production while developing countries are allowed to use cheaper energy forms for development of their own country. Even if the carbon emission reduction goals are met, there aren't any guarantees that there'd be a reduction in global temperatures anyways. And of course, that's making the stipulation that these countries meet their reduction goals. No penalties are ever instituted for agreement violations.China won't be at the table, they're the world's largest polluters. They just laugh at the rest of the world while they continue to strengthen their economy.",

They just laugh at the rest of the world while they continue to strengthen their economy.The unfortunate thing is that China suffers from a very high pollution rate and is required to find solutions to overcome internal environmental problems, regardless of the global warming situation that threatens the entire planet. Despite this, she does not seem really interested in the global climate.Indeed, your observation is valid, as long as there is no sanctions regime for countries that violate the outcomes of the global agreement on climate, then all conferences are meaningless and will not reach a significant result. I began to believe that these conferences are prepared only for popular consumption and to silence environmental organizations.",

      "body": "These conferences come up with a lot of viable policies and recommendations that are hardly implemented. This is because most of the financiers of this conference are big-time polluters. Their sanctions would only be targeted at weaker nations that are not key players in the global political or economic environment. You can't tackle global warming without eradicating poverty and poverty can not be reduced without financial accountability. Even if developing nations are given the needed financial support, their corrupt leaders would embezzle these funds in Western banks and others would be used to buy chosen properties around the world. Except the government of these nations are held accountable for the misuse of these funds, there would never be any positive impact.",

It’s just a normal summer, I think governments are using climate crisis as an excuse to tax & control us more.It’s funny how these politicians & leaders who push climate change use private jets to travel. A private jet doing one moderate length flight uses more CO2 than the average guy does driving a car in his whole life.I will not be modifying any of my habits. It’s the middle of summer where I live, it’s 17C & raining. Climate change is a lie.",

In these international conferences, all of these countries participate as if they are all in alliance to deal with the crisis. But in fact, the major industrial countries are participating in the conference and pumping budgets in the form of aid to the affected poor countries, in order to say that they really contribute to confronting the crisis. And poor countries participate in order to obtain financial support that will be used to support their weak economies. I mean, the outputs of the conference are always in the form of countries that grant financial aid to poorer countries.But was this enough or did it lead to any results? Confronting a global crisis is supposed to be in the form of strategies that all countries of the world work according to, just as it happened during the war of confrontation against Corona. As long as a strategic plan of action that extends over the coming decades is not approved, these conferences are nothing more than a media show.",
