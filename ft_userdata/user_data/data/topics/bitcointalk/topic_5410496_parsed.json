But anything this would be, newbies would only fall for it and send you money in order for you to just scam them. No experienced trader would be so foolish and send you money to trade for them when they know that scam or money loss is the end result.Newbies should all avoid this. Old traders can not be foolish to go for it.",

Old traders can not be foolish to go for it.That's not how Fallen Apes work. We don't ask for deposit, the USDt you receive by staking the NFT, you can choose an investment pool depending on the history of the trader.It's like a trading wagon, you may win or lose but at the end of the day it's a professional trading for you, and it's the one you chose depending on his history.Also we have a cap for how much you can deposit per NFT, if you wish to deposit. To lower everyone risk, and limits will probably stay low until we have made sure the platform is 100% safe and got audited.",

It doesn't look straight to be understood and trusted except op does more to explain and paste a review of what has been going on from the website otherwise I don't expect that users here would visit that.",
