  "content": "EndBlock: A Peer-to-Peer Reverse Pool System._______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________          WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER | TWITTER  | MEDIUM  | TELEGRAM  |_______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________WHAT IS ENDBLOCK ?Gambling Finance (Gambfi). EndBlock is a decentralized protocol that utilizes a peer-to-peer network and a Reverse Block System to revolutionize the decentralized gambling and Defi industry. Users can reset a block counter on the blockchain, where capital invested goes to a pool. If the pool block counter reaches zero, the last person to reset it wins the entire jackpot. If no one has won the jackpot, when the lotto block counter reaches zero, the jackpot is distributed through a lottery and through the $Endergy Pool. Each “Reset Blocks\" also mints $END token to the user, which can be used to burn it to earn BNB or any other crypto used by the protocol. The $END token also is used to reset blocks in MegaPools and gets burned too, drastically reducing its supply and increasing the benefits of the $EndergyPool. EndBlock operates entirely on smart contracts ensuring 100% transparency and automation, as it should be, guaranteeing a new level of trust in the new gambling finance industry through its decentralized structure, and providing a tamper-proof record of all transactions and winners. EndBlock can work in any blockchain and be used to burn any blockchain cryptocurrency. EndBlock it's not only a Game. It's a Freedom tool.          WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER | TWITTER  | MEDIUM  | TELEGRAM  |",

      "body": "Hi Albam, of course. The truth is that there is no other game like this. I invented it, and patent it. First, everything works on blockchain, is not like the 99% of other \"crypto casinos\" that are normal casinos with crypto deposit. In the case of endblock.io the 100% of the interaction is by smart contracts. Now is using the Binance Network, but in a couple of week will be on Ethereum and we are integrating RSK for Bitcoin too. Also, the game allows to create strategies using defi tech, while users can recover their bets using the $endergy pool.Every time a user bet BNB, he resets the Pool Block Counter on the Blockchain and mint END, the token of endblock. If the block counter reaches 0, the last wallet to reset it win the jackpot. Pool Jackpot increases with every bet, as every thing are smart contracts connected between bets. If no one lets another person win, we have set a Master Pool Block Counter (normally 2-4h), when the Master Block Counter reaches 0, the Pool Jackpot is distributed to the $endergy pool and to a lotto (each bet gives you also a lotto ticket). With the END that a user generates by betting they can burned in the $endergy Pool and try to recover their bets (or even more). Up to 34% of all bets goes to the $endergy pool.Then $end token can be also used to burn it by participating in mega Pools and End Pools.Its a circular economy that uses Gambling and Defi 100% decentralized. I have been working on this for years. I hope you like it, give it a try and tell me! We are starting the marketing campaign and this first they we are guaranteeing pools once a day, like 12pm LA time every day. Thank you for your answer.",

What kind of technology is your project built on and why did you choose this particular technology?Hi BTTlobverss,We have choose the Binance Smart Chain Network tu run the entire site. As its built entire using smart contracts, we need a network that allow its use. We have everything also ready for adapt to any ERC20-Solidity based network. So let me know if you would like to have the Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche etc network and we will launch it.As is right now only on the BSC network, the user can only play with BNB and a Web3 Wallet like Metamask, Trust Wallet, etc. Let me know if you would like stable coins like BUSD, Tether or similar.Cost of gas is also an important part that we have been take in consideration to choose BSC network. Less Gas fees than Ethereum, but we are preparing the High Roller version that will run in ETH.Number of users is important too, and binance smart chain has millions.Finally Speed is also a part, because as much it takes to confirm the first transaction on the blockchain, as less quick is the platform interaction. And in this case of game is crucial.I hope this answer is good for you,Feel free to reach me with any questions,Regards",

Here you have access to the How it Works video: https://demo.endblock.io/how-it-worksHere is access to the Whitepaper: https://endblock.io/whitepaper.pdfFor participate first connect your wallet on the BSC network and have some BNB ready (min bet is 0.06 now but in 24/48h we launch a 0.01 Bet pool). Just Mint End by Playing with BNB. You will get exact amount of End than your BNB bet.Then you can win back your BNB or much more if the block counter reaches 0. If not, there is a chance that the master block counter reaches 0, in that case, the pot will be distributed to a raffle (each time you mint end you have a raffle ticket) and to the $endergypool (a pool in which you can burn end to receive BNB back).Also you can use the END token to burn it by participating in the megajackpots can give you BNB too or more END.Feel free to ask any other question,Regards",

Users can invite other users. Only 1 level. You will win 5% of all your direct affiliates bets. So if your affiliate bet 1BNB, you win 0.05 BNB, directly deposit to your wallet when they bet!Remember, every time you bet with BNB you mint same amount in END.You can use the END to Burn it and win BNB back in the $Endergypool or you can play the Mega and END jackpots with END.So its not really a bet, every time you play with BNB you are minting.So every time any of your affiliates mint end, you win 5% of that BNB directly deposit to your wallet. 100% decentralized.Here you can have your affiliate link, just connect your wallet and copy it! https://endblock.io/inviteLet me know if you have any other question,Thank you and Regards",

We are on the process to set the domains names at the License main route so we can show the Official direct link verification of it. It should be ready during February. Our system is more a DEFI than a Gambling site. But we have the license just for have fully coverage. Fell free to ask any other question,Regards",
