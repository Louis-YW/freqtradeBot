  "content": "The stock of Silicon Valley Bank, one of the biggest banks in the US collapsed to 65% before trading was halted. This is the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis.The bank's parent failed to get a buyer making the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation close Silicon Valley Bank and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver. Customers were scared and began to pull out their funds to avoid unforeseen circumstances.Economists are warning that the fall of SIVB might spread and have a bad effect on the entire banking sector. The shares of many banks in the US and Europe dropped because of this incident.  According to Reuter U.S. banks have lost over $100 billion stock market value in two days, with European banks losing around another $50 billion in value.I have always seen bad news about the cryptocurrency industry making headlines in national and international newspapers. The government and bankers criticize the industry and portray the banks as the only remedy to the financial problems of the world. SVB recorded six straight quarterly losses, why didn't these financial gurus fix the bank? Yet they claim to be the only solution.https://www.investors.com/news/silicon-valley-bank-liquidity-crisis-sends-shockwaves-through-financial-industry/https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-bank-stocks-add-losses-regulators-shutter-svb-financial-2023-03-10/",

I'm going to argue that they do have the knowledge and experience — until they get too greedy and try to maximize revenues of the company. Greed is that one thing that can royally fuck someone up regardless of knowledge/experience, and no one is 100% safe from it. Hence, bitcoin > banks.",

This is the largest ban....That's some sad news for crypto market. As market is in red mode now maybe this is one of the reason but single bank's failure should not effect the whole banking and finance system either its fintech. no oubt fuds spread out to manipulate alt to make quick money. but i think this incident might have open the eye of mentioned gurus. and they might come to a point accepting btc and blockchain. But until then no doubt both sectors have there own pros and cons with limitations that we are being solved over time and will improvise. but If experts of both sectors come to an agreement that could benefit both than the time of improvising might decrease and payment system might streamline more efficiently. Well i am amazed with the mentality of people who portray banks as only remedy while bank is the one that losses \"$100 billion stock market value in two days\" haaha. well i think they just ignored that. and will try to find ways to make crypto dirty but literate people know the difference and understand who is responsible for these crisis. i must say, gurus and expert of finance are only hire by banks to make there decisions more stable and accurate but it does not mean that they will be hundred percent accurate. so i must say they are humans too and can make mistakes by misjudging the potential of cryptocurrency and there own banking system. QuoteCNBC reported the company sought a buyer after being unable to raise capital in a Thursday offering. However, deposit outflows are outpacing the sales process as customers race to withdraw funds, making it difficult for buyers to value the bank and making any potential deal less attractive.sourceThe real question is what causes these investors or peoples to withdraw there money. like if we take example of ftt then there were fuds all over the internet and we can easily find that out things are crystal clear to understand. but here what caused this hyper shrinking deposit. well that might be the good question. Well if people in crypto trust the infrastructure that much and even in any condition they stand along it by not withdrawing assets/btc from exchanges to fiat. Well the transactional data also helps crypto analysist to mark down the outflow of assets from crypto exchanges to fiat which also act as indicator to make future decision of either holding or holding with patience. But in banking system there is not transactional outflow data provided unless authorities with permissions make it public.",

Prepare for bank closures, prepare for large amounts of money being injected into the money system to bail-out the larger \"too big to fail\" banks, prepare for rocket-high inflation and prepare for a harder way of life. This is a monumental event and marks the start of the next global financial crisis. If you aren't prepared, get prepared. If you don't hold Bitcoin, it's not too late to start holding some as a safeguard. These things don't happen in an instant but they sure do happen quickly. I give it 3-12 months before things start to go severely belly up...I wonder how they are going to deal with it this time. My presumption? Expedite CBDC's, ban cash, and eventually mint the sh*t out of it until confidence in the US dollar runs out and becomes worthless.",

I doubt when this gets reviewed there would be any legal finding of misconduct unlike with FTX.SVB had banked on U.S. treasury bonds for a sizeable chunk of their portfolio and were ripped when the federal reserve starting raising interest rates. They started trying to raise capital desperately and it caused a panic and everyone ran to withdraw their balances simultaneously. The fact is that this type of situation can happen to literally any bank if every customer decides to withdraw their cash.

      "body": "Quote   If they have the solution, why are banks still failing?Basic and fundamental principles can adequately describe reasons behind most banks failing.1.  Many financial institutions rely upon a forecast of steady growth to maintain viability of their business model. This is similar to the US real estate industry prior to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Many real estate firms created higher risk business models based on consistent growth. In the expectation that the market would never decline. This led to big crashes in real estate when an unexpected downturn occurred. 2.  Risk and reward are fundamentally correlated in finance. This leads to financial institutions in sectors which are historically deemed \"safe\" accruing larger amounts of risk in an effort to generate higher potential rewards. Banking is considered a \"safe\" industry. Which often leads to many banks taking on greater amounts of risk, in an effort to generate greater profits. This approach over time, if left unchecked, can lead to instability and unsustainability.3.  Recession, inflation and economic downturn often produce spectacular crashes. Many businesses and financial enterprise would forecast only a 0.02% chance of economic contraction occurring. Which would leave many unprepared in the event that it occurs.",
