  "content": "Gamepass Network: A Revolutionary Gamers EcosystemGamepass Network is a new project that aims to revolutionize the gaming industry by creating a gamers ecosystem where players can communicate with each other and buy and sell accounts or game-related items on a marketplace with collateral guaranteeing compliance with the rules or escrow. The project's coin, GPN, is based on a UTXO blockchain with the KawPow algorithm and has a block reward of 2000 coins. The miners' share is 51% of the block reward, while gamers receive 41% and 8% goes towards development purposes. The blockchain also features a custom halving algorithm that reduces the reward in block by 1% every month.Coin Specifications:Coin Name: GamepassCoin Symbol: GPNAlgorithm: KawPowBlock Reward: 2000 coinsMiners' Share: 51%Gamers' Share: 41%Development Purposes: 8%Reward Reduction Algorithm: Reduces reward in block by 1% every monthGamers can earn rewards by playing popular video games like Dota2. The rewards calculation is based on public game statistics from official public API related to the game and provided by official game developers. This innovative approach allows gamers to earn rewards while enjoying their favorite games.The Gamepass Network project aims to solve the problem of decentralization and interaction between gamers by providing an easy and quick way for them to buy or sell their gaming property to other players. The project also aims to provide transparency in its work and algorithms, ensuring fairness and taking into account the wishes of the community.With its focus on providing an inclusive gaming ecosystem and its innovative approach to rewarding gamers, Gamepass Network is set to become a major player in the gaming industry. Join us as we build a better future for gamers!Mining will begin on May 1st at 00:00:00 UTC. It will start from the first block to ensure transparency and fairness towards the community. There will be no premine, as we are firmly against it. Those who are interested can pre-configure their hardware by following the instructions provided on the pool.Note: Use Paper Wallet to start mining before wallet app release.

To participate in the PoG round, you need to register through the GPBot bot by writing to him in private messages and linking your Steam account and your Wallet.üí∞All coins currently in the main game fund will be burned as previously announced.üî• The PoG era begins on May 11th, 2023!üöÄNote:- All users need to register in the new GPbot.- User's data from the old GPbot is moved to the new GPbot.- We will watch for the \"honesty and accuracy\" of the GFRS protocol and fix it if needed.üõ†- All games from May 1st at 00:00:00 UTC will be calculated.‚è∞",

      "body": "Greetings community!So many events are happening lately in crypto space. TxBit exchange closure, Bitcoin drop, liquidations, drops of other cryptocurrencies, etc. But like we said before, we are developing and researching regardless of the market situation. So we have some news and updates :- We are working on improving the user interface and trying to make it more userfriendly. Now we are reworking the interaction with GPBot, you may notice that statistics, payouts and trust factor have disappeared from the bot. Now these data can be viewed on http://gaming.gamepass.network/. Your Discord, wallet, game accounts, recent payouts, etc. In the new user panel you may notice that there is now an energy bar. We have revised the trust factor system. Now it is battery energy and it works on the principle of a battery. The value of energy in the battery will drop over time and from the number of matches played. In order to recharge the battery simply re-bind your account. And you'll be full of energy to smash your enemies again.- We are aware of the problem with dishonest users and that's why we are updating the usage policy. We hope to minimize the number of such suspicious players. As of now, multi-accounting is forbidden. Multi-accounting is the use of two or more accounts in a project by one person. Renting out an account to mine coins in the project will be equated to multi-accounting. By using multiple accounts, you agree to accept any restrictions on you and your related accounts and have no claims regarding the restrictions. All our actions are always aimed at improving the user's gaming experience in the Gamepass.network project. The project should not be considered by users or players as a source of main or additional income. Do not pursue the goal of enrichment.- We are revising the user verification system on the server, so we are temporarily increasing the spam protection on the server to the highest level. Users who have confirmed their phone number in Discord will be able to write messages. Your data will be available only for Discord. We do not have access to your personal information. This is a temporary measure and will be changed as soon as we redesign the verification system to be more efficient.",
