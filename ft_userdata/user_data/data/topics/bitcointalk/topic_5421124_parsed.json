I hope that guy will be jailed soon along with alameda ceo. that shitty guy must be brought to the court as soon as possible. there's something wrong happened with him. i believe.",

In the US at least, it seems improbable during the Democratic tenure. Bankman-Fried spent around $37 million during the last election cycle, almost all of which went to boosting Democratic candidates and causes. That made him the party's second-largest donor, according to OpenSecrets, and the sixth largest overall.Sam has spent about $37 million on the current  government, and I assume the government will send him to a safe place to prove its loyalty to him.",

They both use and abuse capital from their users very incorrectly. In a crazy bull run with which price went up exponentially, they were fine. Unfortunately, when price went down and crashed, their models are paper in a toilet which is washed very easily and quickly.QuoteI'm surprised how well he's being treated currently but I guess it will be a while before the proper authorities get their hands on him.  Amazing how quickly he went from savior to demon.  The damage he's caused possibly millions of people is no doubt a setback to crypto adoption.It maybe just a beginning of something worse for him.

A sockpuppet of them to launder money and fool the naive to believe he was going to share all his fortune with people in need from every corner of the world. His last tweets make no sense and I even thought he could have been hacked on twitter. But maybe he is just too assured his back is safe and guaranteed by those influent personalities and groups of power he has been fueling with investors and customers' funds along the years, that he doesn't care showing some empathy and respect for people who lost money under his surveillance.",

Now, we are starting to see that Sam is indeed just another parasite in this industry...someone who is here just for the money and without maybe realizing it he induced one of the biggest chaos we ever faced. Sadly this will nailed the trust and confidence bestowed by the people to the crypto industry...and I would say that after FTX things will never be the same anymore.",
