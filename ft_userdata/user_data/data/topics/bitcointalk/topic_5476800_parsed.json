But this time it seems different,  you can still have money but still their is is no inner joy. Now even the people around are not real and genuine but fake, can even betray for free. That is because of the influence of technology and social medias. People are flaunting, flexing what they have this time and this gives you the pressure and rush to achieve necessary things because of your insecurity. I'm not saying you actually but it is for those people that have been reliant on the opinion of other people. This is hard to change when they've been too dependent to the opinion of other people.While these necessary things can be achieved slowly, easy and without having pressure at all, they chose what they think that shall rush them and then later on will complain that they're dealing with hardship through it.Quote from: Y3shot on December 06, 2023, 05:18:17 PMIs it that as the world is evolving people are changing too.Yup, that is the reality that the people are changing nowadays because of what we're adapting from person to person, and location to location. Thanks to the influence of modern technology that also changes people. Anyway, change is constant. Don't be too affected with what you want to achieve, take it nice and slow and no one's rushing you. Enjoy the ride as they say.",

Is it that as the world is evolving people are changing too.I would advice you to check on those things you are feeling, very closely. It may not be the case, but if what you are feeling persist through time and you feel could be worsening, I am afraid it could be the beginning of a depressive period to you. It sounds as if you are realizing negative aspects about life which you had not found before and the fact you mention money is not longer an escape to the lack of joy seems to be a pretty good clue of an incoming depressive period of time in your life. Hopefully I am wrong, though.If you can, you should talk about the things you are feeling with your family or friends whom you have trust in, it may help you to vent and feel a healthy state of mind, if that does not work as you thought it would, then the next step is to find more specialized help.Take care.",

Is it that as the world is evolving people are changing too.The world is ever changing and the rate is faster than ever. It's a struggle to keep up with the pace. Comparatively life has gotten better. There are overall improvements in transportation, healthcare and social welfare from state. Money has lost it's value. With rising inflation, people who are ought to earn for the family are spending more time to work than spending time with their family. That might bring the sense of discontended. Comparatively it has been safer to give birth to your child but costlier to raise them. Social media and peer pressure is what stressing people. The deteriorating mental health is another reason why our society is breaking down.",

Because I know the happiness we seek is not far away, but right at the moment we realize balance, maybe material ambition and fame make people chase after them without being able to satisfy them. In any period, joy always appears, so there is no need to blame the situation. I also see that everywhere there are good/bad people, rich/poor,... but that distinction is clearly determined by ourselves. And you also need to look back at the fact that you are not able to come into contact with many happy people, which does not mean that the current society is not happy. Look at your own mistakes first when talking about external factors that cause problems.",

Some people have only 1 or 2 real friends while others have no one because of how poor he is. I recommend knowing your purpose in this world so that you won't really have any problem with how people treat you and you can be the happiest man in the world even though you are with few real friends or alone.",

Is it that as the world is evolving people are changing too.as you struggle and hustle to make earns meet, try to also create meaningful bond and relationship with people. The reason most people feel very lonely at the too is due to the fact that they spent their whole life chasing after money at the detriment of every other thing and when money is no longer the issue, they discover it's just the money they have as a trusted companion.I know people can b selfish sometimes and it might be even difficult to find someone that believes in you at the point of your rising, the truth is that if you're unable to create quality relationship at the point of your rising, when you've risen, it would be very difficult to trust those trying to relate with you because you will always feel they are coming just for the money.Life is not always easy for the poor especially if he lives in the midst of the rich so strive as much as you can to creating a reasonable wealth while you are still young. You won't have all the strength and energy forever and will definitely work this jars forever so work hard now and retire early so you can enjoy your later life in peace.",

Before now everything was easy for the rich , poor, and middle class, you can even be happy without having any money with you. But this time it seems different,  you can still have money but still their is is no inner joy. I might not understand your comments that people don't have money but are still happy. Maybe you mean that people don't have much but are happy because I know that a hungry man will not be happy. The reason why many people are not happy even when they can afford basic needs is because of greed and materialism. People always compete and if they don't meet up to the competition they become unhappy. There are still rich and poor people who are happy because they are content with what they have. They are not in competition with anybody and are focused on their happiness.I have observed that another reason why people are not happy in my area is because of insecurity. People are scared of armed robbers and kidnappers which is popular in my country. So people are just afraid and insecure which has affected their emotions.QuoteNow even the people around are not real and genuine but fake, can even betray for free. Is it that as the world is evolving people are changing too.Envy and unhealthy competition are the reasons for betrayals and fake love in our society. There are still people you can trust, however, they are few. You don't have to trust people wholeheartedly now because you might be betrayed or disappointed. I don't keep too many friends anymore because the bigger your company the higher the tendency to meet the wrong friends.",
