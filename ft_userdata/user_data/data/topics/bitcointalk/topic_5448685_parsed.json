I want to broadcast a transaction with 1 Sat/Byte fees from my android device.You can only do that on desktop Electrum, or use Bluewallet.It has been long since mempool was less congested to the extent that 1 sat/vbyte will get confirmed faster. I will advice you to use at least 3 to 5 sat/vbytes.Do not import Electrum wallet on Bluewallet, else your transaction would not support opt-in RBF. But you can use BIP39 seed phrase to support RBF by default. But if you import Electrum wallet seed phrase on Bluewallet, you will still be able to edit the fee while broadcasting the transaction at first.",

If you change it to static, you should be able to select 1 sat/vbyte.However, there is no point at the moment. Your transaction won't be broadcast since most nodes are currently hitting the default memory limit.",

Bluewallet gives you three estimations (fast, medium and slow) and it also allows you to set the fee rate manually. Another good thing about bluewallet is that you can import your seed phrase to it even if it has been generated by electrum.",

I thought this was changed with Core 24.0 where nodes can support full RBF if they want to. I think it was o_e_l_e_o who explained in one of his threads that full RBF is disabled by default, but the option to enable it for the operators is there. The way I understood it is that each transaction is now considered as RBF-enabled instead of you deciding to opt-in or out. I didn't know that somehow Electrum and Electrum seeds were impacted if imported into Blue Wallet.",

If you want to enable full RBF on your node, then you just add mempoolfullrbf=1 to your bitcoin.conf file.Quote from: Pmalek on April 15, 2023, 08:19:12 AMThe way I understood it is that each transaction is now considered as RBF-enabled instead of you deciding to opt-in or out.It is, but only to nodes that have enabled mempoolfullrbf as above, which are still in the minority. At some point it will be enabled by default, but it's not clear yet when that will happen.At the moment, the only mining pool which we are certain is running full RBF on their nodes is Luxor, which have around 2-3% of the hashrate. So if you can get a replacement transaction broadcast through the nodes which are running full RBF and to one of Luxor's nodes, then you can technically currently replace any transaction.",

The option is still as before, using a slider with ETA/Mempool/Static options.You can still choose static to set a fee of 1 sat/byte. But I advise using the fee rate that applies during the transaction. I usually use https://mempool.space/ to see the amount of transaction fee suggested to avoid the possibility of stuck transactions, although the RBF feature can be utilized to increase fee transactions.",

Only what I saw is still freezing of addresses. What I noticed about the new version is how it now shows the derivation path of both receiving and change address, not showing the private key of the addresses again. I checked if the fee can be customized or edited, nothing changed, it was like before as you commented. The most changes is in the UI and layout which is better than before.The static fee slider is kind of helpful and may be the reason electrum developers are not yet ready to make the fee to be customizable, but as the fee is increase the bigger the range. I hope that Electrum will make customizing the fee possible one day in an update.",
