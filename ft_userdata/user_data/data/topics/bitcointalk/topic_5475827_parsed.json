All these is a result of lack of wealth preservation and orientation, and of course many of them don't want to learn and they don't care about their lives because possibly their government taking good care of every single citizens or maybe there is proper medicalcare which ensure the live of her citizens are always safe.The rich kids are founds of living a luxurious life without knowing if they don't plant or sow (invest) for more money they often ends up being a beggar why due to lack of planning and funds misappropriation which can easily leads to starvation that often stirs up to rehabilitation.",

Many of those homeless people are immigrants, while others are on the streets because of economic problems such as unemployment.

Many of them lose inherited wealth due to luxurious lifestyle. Parents should spend quality time with their children to imbibe the right attitude and values. Some rich folks prefer to pursue businesses and politics while allowing strangers to raise their children. These children will end up becoming addicted to several unhealthy habits that will make them lavish all they have inherited. Off course some hardworking people will take advantage of the condition of these spoilt rich kids to buy cheap houses, cars and other items.",

And getting drunk and gambling is not what they (young people) want, but it is an escape for them. because when they go home they don't get happiness or warm love from their parents, because both parents are busy with work.And that's not a small number, there are many children who lose their parents' love, so that when they grow up the child becomes someone who disobeys their parents. There is even a child who has not received parental love since he was born, because as soon as he was born he was immediately taken care of by the nanny.So, as parents, no matter how busy we are, we spend as much time as possible directly ensuring the development of our children, because they really need the attention and love of their parents.",

I don't know what the exact minimum expenditure is in Europe but clearly the demand to continue to meet needs will be a major factor. The habit of partying without having a stable source of income will gradually make us poor. That is why the role of financial management must be studied in order to survive.The children of rich people depend on how their parents educate them, whether they continue to provide them with all the facilities they ask for or whether they give them the right upbringing. But generally these children always behave spoiled, feel that all their needs are met and don't think about what the future will be like. The environment and friends you associate with determine which direction you end up in, it's not surprising to find several homeless people who turn out to be former rich people whose lives have gone too far.",

      "body": "Maybe this is true. But not all children from rich circles easily fall into a free lifestyle and waste money on partying. Because I also have many acquaintances with rich people whose children are well educated. Even though they are rich, in reality their children are not always given freedom, especially when it comes to finances. Many rich people actually encourage their children to live independently without relying on the wealth their parents have. Because their parents' property has definitely been passed on to them. But they must have their own pride in making achievements with their own hard work and hard work. One of my college friends even has to work part time even though I know his parents are not ordinary people. yes his parents are prominent rich people. But he said he preferred to live by relying on the money he earned from his own hard work. But yeah, I also had acquaintances when I was in college, they were rich people's kids who changed cars every day and showed them off in front of the campus. But I know their parents are rich people who are too busy with their business so they don't have time to educate their children at home. and only rely on private teachers to educate their children. so that the child lacks emotional education. Well, they tend to be lonely at home so they choose to look for fun and try to escape loneliness by partying outside and constantly wanting to be the center of attention among their friends. And one day his parents will realize that they were wrong because they were too busy with business and forgot to pay attention to their child. So it is possible that their children will not become heirs who can keep the family business successful.",

The unlimited filling of children with money is the best option to steal their future.... Better spend your time socializing with your children and educating your children. Don't \"buy\" their love and appreciation with money, it won't do any good !And the most important thing is to convey 3 thoughts to your children:- resources of rich parents are not unlimited (either money or parents themselves will run out), and it is not a fact that you will become an heir  - you should be able to earn money on your own, and provide for yourself on your own, and be independent in general.- and a very important idea \"money is a great servant, but the worst master\".",

In my region I discover that most rich kid always full victim of fraud like stealing, pushing of hard drugs like cocaine, raping, kisnaping, always taking loan from co-operative organization and others all this is as a result of no longer being satisfied with the money they are seeing. Emagine a kis at 17 years who have not made $30 of its own for the first time in life is spending $500 a week. Probably if he/she reaches at the age of 30years, h/s will be spending maybe $3k per week. And most of this unnecessary expenditure is on drugs.Most of the the real cause of money mismanagement amongst rich kid is because they haven't tested suffering in there life. It is good sometimes rich parents exposed there children to some sort of place where they can work and earn money and take full responsibility of themselves, sothat the will know the inportants of money and how to utilize it even when their parents are no more.",
