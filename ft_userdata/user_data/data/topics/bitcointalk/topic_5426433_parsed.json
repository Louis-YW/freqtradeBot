Another reason Trump's relevancy is in decline is how he handled the pandemic and buckled under the Demz guilt tripping the nation over it when it was a nothing burger. If the pandemic was real then whole areas would just stop and be fully shut down just like when Ebola hits African villages. The Demz have the senate to pass anything through so if things get worse don't complain or moan because its people like you that wanted this. As for you if I had to try to do the same math \"Pax\" + \"Mao\" does that mean you work for the Chinese government? Hope you like those FED stamps when they're worthless lol.",

He is willing to abandon his account that boasts of millions of followers because he wants to promote his own platform Truth Social. Donald Trump might be disappointed by Elon's remarks that he shouldn't run for presidency again. For now Trump is the only formidable candidate the Republicans' can boast of and twitter might not be their main communication channel because they want to be free to spread their conspiracy theories. Truth Social is now the new propaganda machinery of Donald trump and his large supporters. The challenge would be that twitter has far wider coverage than truth social.

At the same time, Musk is seeking to obtain a political incubator that will provide him with better options in the market and strengthen his position in front of his opponents of entrepreneurs and competing ideas.",

Same with Trump and Musk. However, it seems that Trump and Musk are doing very little together. They might be trying to overturn the stolen 2020 election, both in their own way. But probably they are not working together on it, as a plan, or even some sort of conspiracy.On the other side, Musk is revealing that Dems improperly used twitter by censoring many Rep communications, like the criminality of Biden through his son Hunter, so that Biden would have a better chance of winning 2020.SABOTAGE: Key data on Twitter’s role in suppressing free speech hidden and deleted without knowledge of bossesQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-12-09-data-twitter-suppress-free-speech-hidden-deleted.html#New Twitter owner Elon Musk has revealed that some important data regarding how the social media platform has been suppressing free speech was hidden from previous Twitter bosses and may even have been deleted.As part of Musk’s effort to be transparent about Twitter’s past role in suppressing free speech on the internet, he has been releasing the platform’s internal communications on the matter, which he has dubbed the “Twitter Files.” Unfortunately, some crucial documents may have been hidden or even deleted permanently.Musk made this revelation in response to a question raised by Twitter founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey regarding the speed at which the files were being released.“If the goal is transparency to build trust, why not just release everything without filter and let people judge for themselves? Including all discussions around current and future actions? Make everything public now,” said Dorsey in a post on his Twitter account.Dorsey was responding to a series of posts by Musk telling his followers to expect “Episode 2 of The Twitter Files” very soon. He then responded to Dorsey by noting that key data may have been hidden and possibly scrubbed.“Most important data was hidden (from you too) and some may have been deleted, but everything we find will be released,” wrote Musk.Twitter censorship of Hunter Biden laptop story reveals how files may be hidden from top executivesMusk first talked about releasing Twitter’s internal files regarding its role in suppressing free speech in late November. Days after this announcement, Musk followed through on this promise by lifting the lid on the social media platform’s machinations regarding censorship.The first file drop proved that Twitter managers attempted to block the spread of the Hunter Biden laptop story. They marked viral tweets regarding the story as “unsafe,” limiting their spread and even blocking them from being directly shared via Twitter’s direct message function....",
