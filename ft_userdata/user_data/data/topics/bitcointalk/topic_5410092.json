      "body": "That's good but. The only question is why should paypal add fork coin like bitcoin cash which was very shady to the its list of accepted cryptocurrency in the platform via mobile app? that looks so weird and this time people rarely using this fork coin anymore. They are focusing into first or second layer blockchain which were very cheap compared with that fork coin. That questions may become a big question for anyone. Litecoin is good enough compared with bitcoin cash.",

Maybe Ethereum will cost money but after Ethereum 0.2 it will be a bit different. But I tend if PayPal just BTC, ETH, and LITECOIN is a good alternative, or maybe BNB and Stablecoin for more variety.",

So anyone who has used paypay has money, and if they want, they can invest some of it in cryptocurrency. Just think that because of this update, lots of people have known about crypto, and we believe that if more people know about bitcoin, then more people will be interested in investing in bitcoin and crypto. Then, no matter if they are interested in investing, they might be used by other exchanges to buy other crypto too. So yeah, it's obviously good. That's my opinion. Thank you.",

I was not expecting them to adopt Bitcoin, since I believe that payment processors won't just accept something or adopt something that is usually volatile in terms of price.I did not expect other coins to be adopted though.",

Paypal did a good job for that but that would better if this payment service was removing the name of bitcoin cash from the list. that would be more attractive rather than mentioning shady scam coin like that to be supported by paypal mobile.",

What is certain is that the price will rise, due to increased demand.This is because people who don't understand how to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin they will be able to have it easily, just by using this Paypal APPSometimes things are not that straightforward, while a news like this is without a doubt a good one the markets do not automatically react in the way we expect, after all the whales have a lot of say when it comes to the movements of bitcoin and if they do not feel like supporting a positive movement right now then we cannot expect the price to move upwards for long, however over the long term this should attract more people to this market and this is without a doubt a good thing.",

This kind of news is good in paper, but most of the time, investors are going to hold and still be reluctant. Paypal is a still a 3rd party service, so we don't have control, they will support it, but what happens if they flag some suspicious activity?",

All good news about crypto will certainly have a good impact, big or small the impact depends on how big or small the news is. And I think the news about PayPal currently supporting several Mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ethereum is good news that doesn't get too hype because the hype about institutions supporting crypto has passed.In conclusion, this news does not have a significant impact on crypto as a whole.",

With support for crypto in their application, it makes it even easier for users to buy and sell crypto if the application provides that feature. If it works, more Paypal users will try to join the crypto, which will make the crypto even better. So let's wait for further news from Paypal and hopefully, it's good news to provide an opportunity for crypto to go in a better direction too.",

I'm sure that the news about PayPal having a support to crypto has been long time ago and this isn't a new news. Well, as for this news, it has a very good impact to the market but, AFAIK this support from PayPal doesn't really support crypto deposits and withdrawals and it's like you're just playing numbers and names on their platform.But with their TOS on that page and under it, it seems that they're already supporting in and out transactions which is totally a good news.",
