We should rather focus on what they coin (or rather the team being the coin) promises and what ends up delivering to the people who invested on it from the beginning.  If the coin has a roadmap, a vision and delivers what has promised since the beginning, it does not matter whether the market is green or red, the value of the coin won't get flatlined permanently. That is my personal opinion, at least.",

It is neither true nor false that is the basic nature of this market, the general background of most bearmarket periods is that projects are mostly discounted, but they are by no means labeled as shitcoins. To me some criteria to label a shitcoin include, following trends but only in theory, crowding backlash, hype, low quality content, poor liquidity, community full of people getting paid to talk well about it, devs use anonymity for security reasons but it's actually a scam and exit scheme... most of them don't survive on their own as the crypto market evolves.",

Usually yes. Most projects that have been released on the bear market have little chance to become successful because the market is sluggish and most people would avoid investing in any of these projects.",

      "body": "I agree that we shouldn't use the term \"shitcoin\" if the value decreases after being listed. Instead, I would say it's a bold move by a developer who genuinely believes in their project's potential to succeed. They are not afraid even in a bear market; they are simply focusing on implementing the project according to the planned roadmap and timeline. The developer has confidence that their project will perform well and is not concerned with short-term loss; they are actually looking at the larger perspective.",

You cannot call such project as a shit project and if you're more conversant with the network in cryptocurrency, you will discover that's the best time to set in for those kind of coins and invested in them, if you have make your research well about the developers and found out the required standard needed for you to invest on their project, then do well to buy the dip and expect the market to rise anytime in the nearest future.",

Well, its either you call them shit coin or meme tokens; their reputation usually does not go beyond those 2 options. So before investing in any token in the bear market; you need to check if it is a utility token, a meme token or a shit coin. Being able to differentiate this helps you determine which one you should invest in short term, medium term or long term.",

Shitcoin is a made up term and you can use it as you wish. People have been trying to find official definition for it, even investopedia has a definition page for it. But it's still vague term based on opinions.Some people call all altcoins shitcoins, some only meme coins and low caps, some coins that are performing poorly in the markets even though their development is on fire and fundamentals gold. I say that shitcoin is any coin/token that's isn't bringing any value or anything unique to cryptocurrency scene. The token that only exist because devs wanted to make money. It has nothing to do with charts or marketcap to meBut then again \"bringing no value\" is pretty harsh and vague statement. I can see meme coins bringing people joy and visibility to cryptos so even those are bringing something to the table.",

If I am not wrong shitcoins refers all the altcoins so you doesn't have to worry about the name and not necessarily a project launched in the bear market doesn't mean it's shit however if a project doesn't provide the results of what the project expected can be considered as failure. But don't come in to conclusions too quickly, cause if a project is potential enough to survive the bear market it can be worthy to take the bet.",

No, it's not the definition of shitcoin, there are good projects that is released during a bear market, and obviously, not enjoying a success. But eventually the devs keeps the project alive and then push it and eventually gain success.Shitcoins are those crypto that don't have any use case or utility for that matter. And they are just released by some devs in a hurry and being used for pure pump and dump scheme. Almost close to being called scam coins to me because after they make money, the project will suddenly die and no updates whatsoever is being done.",

Most altcoins if they started or are released in a bear market will be a high chance to come up with other altcoins that are dumping (even Bitcoin). There are no exemptions if it's on the bear market, I already experienced this multiple times, because some altcoins even how quality it is, if the bear market, is still bloody.Because if the bull market comes, this time quality projects will rise and you will see how they will also come along pumping with other quality altcoins too.",

Investors will bash it more when they see it got nothing to offer which its usually is with altcoins.",
