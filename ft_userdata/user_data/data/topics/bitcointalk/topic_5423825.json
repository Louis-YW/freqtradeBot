  "content": "I've been waving my hands around in the air, chanting, gazing at tea leaves and looking in a crystal ball AND drawing lines on chartsMy prediction, good times ahead for bitcoin bullsLets be real. bitcoin is deflationary. Most the coin supply is already distributed. Central bankers and globalists are shamelessly using their control of fiat for all kinds of evil. But at the same time they are ruining the credibility of their bits of paper. And inflating it until its value hits zero. They know they are on their last fumes in the tank.  They will try to push CDBC on us. Don't let this happen. Bitcoin is for the people. Can't be censored. Keep your private keys in your control. HODL Bitcoins dont give a shit about some DeFI centralised exchange going under. Seen  it all before, many times. Heres the chartWe are bang on the low. Forget stock market correlation. Forget alt coins. Forget stocks and shares.Buy bitcoin (and gold and silver)Hold on tightedit: My opinions though generally pretty good can be wrong. Your own trades or investments are your own risk.Update: Thanks for the comments on this thread, they are much appreciated. I think I'll try and keep it alive and monitor the progress of my idea that this is the  cyclical minimum. I'll be looking at the market from a technical perspective based on long term trends.",

Doesn't matter. Bitcoin needs a strong dollar when we get to 100k Bitcoin has been a very good opportunities for people like me in a developing country. Before bitcoin was created, it was dollar we were looking to be a hedge against inflation, but no matter what, fiat is fiat, just that one is better than another. When bitcoin was created, more opportunities came as we can now just hold bitcoin. Bitcoin is at its low price now again, if bought at $16500 and some sold in 2 or 3 years from now is a very good investment and a hedge against inflation. It is exciting to buy bitcoin now and hold for long.",

I think if the low is in, we'll be around it for a while before people gain confidence again - confidence in exchanges is likely depleting too (one of the biggest on ramps for crypto). Also, based on previous times, it looks like we might be due one more drop before we start to recover well again.",

Ofcourse it won't go to zero unless hyperinflation occur to a particular country such as with Zimbabwe. The market value of their currency did not deop to zero that would be impossible, its market value is just low. Also, given how volatile the msrket prices of crypto, it won't be sustainable for the economy to use it as a main coin 'coz there will be no consistency with daily transactions simply because the value of crypto changes from time to time. All in all, there is always a tendency for the price of Bitcoin to be as low as it can especially if demand will dictate it to do so. Whether it would go up or not, the demand would be the bottomline as it determines the market price of crypto.",

Rando altcoins collapse all the time, some huge ones too with mid-size market caps.Problem with major shtcoin collapses like Terracoin (what you said in your example) or whatever they're called, is that they interacted with Bitcoin... they had a huge Bitcoin reserve which they tried to use to shore up the peg their stablecoin lost.

I think it is a bit \"known\" that we won't hit 5k, that would be too little and it would be quite difficult to hit. I am guessing that it could potentially be a bit difficult to do when we are talking about how much bitcoin needs to be sold at the market price while going down, and that's not going to be that easy.I know that it will not be that easy but I know the \"possibility\" of it at the same time. I agree that there is a technically possible situation going on, but it is not going to be that much of an easy thing to do so I guess 15k or higher is a lot more likely.",

In While anything is possible in the Bitcoin market, one can also draw assumptions from previous patterns and use that to try and predict what could happen in the future. While the ATH has been progressively increasing with each market cycle, from below $1k to as high as $20k and most recently almost at $70k, that's the same way the bottoms we've been experiencing has also been progressively increasing as well, from below $1k to $3k an now above $10k. I would be greatly surprised if the bottom goes below the 10 grand mark.Quote from: fzkto on November 28, 2022, 02:59:57 PMNo one knows how the price will behave or what else might happen in the industry.

CDBC continues to be pushed to reduce the rate of Bitcoin, which happens on the contrary, bitcoin grows and develops to date. Many people are starting to realize that bitcoin can be a hedge, a promising investment and that inflation is not having much of an impact on its journey.
