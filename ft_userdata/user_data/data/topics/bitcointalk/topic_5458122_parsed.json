  "content": "Hello EveryoneHelp get started on trading without my husband! Asking 0.04BTC - 0.11BTC, 100% guaranteed payback with interest <3 Not sure anyone will actually borrow me money, I read the \"how to recognise a scam\" post and there was \"anyone stating they are a female\" (me and my stay at home mom wanting to start a new hobby) and \"anyone selling Apple anything \" (me putting up an extra iPhone for sale my husband got from work so I can use the Bitcoin for trading). But I'm not not a scam, I'm a newbie on this forum who's developed a huge interest towards crypto. I have spent the past year watching any possible video on YouTube and read hundreds and hundreds of articles whenever I have had time and listening to podcasts while doing housework. I was planning to find someone who's willing to Loan me the crypto so I can start trading. I have been putting aside extra money and will be able to pay back mid August. But I just registered here and I really want to start trading now. I have studied the trading AIs so well and I'm confident i can make this work, I have always been really good at math and even at school did the most difficult math studies and got a perfect score from all 20 courses (not so much from some others Â   ) I KNOW I can do this, I also want to show my husband that I can do this, after spending 5 years home with the kids my brain needs intellectual challenge. Not sure how this Loaning thing works or if anyone is even willing to take the risk to loan for such a newbie but if you are, contact me and I will provide the required documents (?) or we use an escrow etc.Edit: If anyone is wondering why I don't just use the money I have saved up. Loan is a different thing, I still need to have this back up money just in case something happens or surprising comes up. Let's say I completely fail in trading and by mid August the capital is gone and its time to pay off the loan. Then I go to my husband all humbled who can easily pay this off. I'm a stubborn woman Â  who refuses to ask for her husband for the money, I want to do this on my own, pay off the debt in Mid August. By that time I'm willing to keep this additional \"rainy day\" money I have in my trading and take the risks involved but not when I'm only starting out. Just trying to be smart here.",

I'm just curious, never done this before and I have no idea. The conditions are pretty straightforward. Usually, the lender requires you to provide collateral, which serves as a security in case you're unable to repay the loan. It's like a backup plan for them, ensuring they have something to cash in on if things don't go as planned and you default on the loan. Your documents or use of escrow means nothing if you don't have collateral of equal or greater value to secure the deal.The only way to get a no-collateral loan is if you have a notable history and reputation in the community. Given your current \"condition\" as a newbie, this is not possible.",

      "body": "Doing this on my own means that I'm not just going to my husband and asking for the money. I want something that I have done independently from him. While I am risking someone else's money and lets assume I lose it all, My husband will pay the loan back. In that case I would be deeply embarrassed and a bit annoyed. Because he's making the money in our household - and we are very uncomfortable - It just always feels like his money although its not. I know all stay at home moms can relate that there comes a time when asking for money starts to feel humiliating. I just feel that if I do this trading completely on my own and pay the loan back with the money I saved (and will save) by selling stuff and doing small jobs there and there. Somehow it would make me feel incredibly proud. 2 more years and I can finally get back to work but this is the situation now. SO my husband IS my backup plan which is why I wrote that 100% guaranteed. Maybe we can make a contract about this? I also changed the amount from 1000-3000e\"Just an FYI; only scammers (regardless of gender) use claims of being female to elicit special treatment on the internet.Â  The more emphasis you put on claims of your gender, the more suspicious you seem.\"Well Im not a scammer. And I haven't asked for any special treatment from anyone. I have been writing to this forum like I always write everywhere, my ADHD tends to impact a lot on my writing style. I just naturally saw myself as TheCryptoMom because Im always listening/watching or reading crypto related content and other moms have started to call me that as a joke already a while ago. I didn't know I had to hide my life situation, I like to add a personal aspect to my style of writing. I think most women do.",

Regardless of you as a woman allergic to advice, your proposal to ask for a loan is certain to be rejected because of collateral rules. Also your reasons, almost all users of this forum welcome the advice: \"Borrowing money to trade is strongly discouraged\". This is the basis for experienced borrowers supporting reasons to reject your request.Unfortunately, you don't stand a chance here, do it somewhere else.Quote from: TheCryptoMom on June 30, 2023, 09:47:32 PM-snip-I know my husband, this is just who he is.Is it also the other way around?

Trade with a smaller amount such as $500, or just buy $3000 worth of Bitcoin or Ethereum and wait until 2025 or 2026. And stay far far away from r/WallStreetBets.",
