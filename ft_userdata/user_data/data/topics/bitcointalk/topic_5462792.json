  "content": "The total amount of Bitcoin to ever exit equals 21million and and after this bitcoins have been mined there will be no generation of new coins into the system, and this will causes scarcity (limited supply) thereby increasing its price. According to the law of supply and demand in economics which state that as supply decrease, while demand remain unchanged the price increases. This theory can be used to predict that Bitcoin would be able to ascertain of height of price worth millions of dollar, having this knowledge I recommend that buyers should go into long term holding of Bitcoin as each halving comes with reduction of coin supply.Total circulated coins from 2009-2023there are 19,452,931.25 total circulation of Bitcoin in the world, remaining 1,547,068.8 to be mined for the next 116 years to come, and after these coins have been mined there would be no more block rewards for miners who successfully guesses the block number, the only payment they'll get at that time would be the transaction fee for every transaction in the block which they validates, and these transaction fee can only profit the miner if the fee surpasses the expenses of the mining farm, and this can be possible when the  acceptance of Bitcoin by nations, companies, businesses, etc increase to a reasonable amount whereas also increasing its transaction rate, though miners are now beginning to use renewable energy source for mining so as to increase profit but this will not guarantee their satisfaction.BTC circulation till the end of the halvingThe current block reward for mining is 6.25 Bitcoin for an average of 10minutes which is regulated by the mining difficulty so that coins are not mined too fast or too slow, the mining difficulty increases if it takes less than a week to mine 2016 blocks while it decreases if it takes two weeks to mine 2016 blocks, This difficulty will eventually frustrate some miners to quite especially when mining reward gets to 1satoshi per block, even it Ai are used in future mining to increase efficiency and speed they can not exceed the mining difficulty.ConclusionNow is the time to go into mining and buying of Bitcoin as each halving reduces the block reward by 2 which causes scarcity that has the potential of increasing price.Sourcehttps://www.statista.com/statistics/247280/number-of-bitcoins-in-circulation/ https://www.google.com/search?q=total+circulated+bitcoin&oq=total+circulated+bitcoin&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i13i512j0i390i650l3.17669j0j4&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8 https://www.coinbeast.com/post/bitcoin-halving-dates-clock-countdown-charthttps://stormgain.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-mine-bitcoin?amp",

      "body": "You have compiled a great set of information there full of stats that a newbie must be aware of. Because to convince someone to invest into BTC, these stats are enough i think. But every investor has there own mindset about investing. For example, most of the people wants full assurance and they want to invest on the shoulders of others. Because they will blame those shoulders when the price will not move according to the stats of yours.I am not saying it will not gain value and i am also not saying it will not decrease value. All, i have to say for a newbie or pro, is before investing make up your mind set like what are you expecting from that holding and you must have to admit or agree that the coin you have invested in, you might have to wait for longer period of time to withdraw them because nothing can be predicted accurately in crypto. I gave these advices to one of my friends who wanted to invest 200$ in BTC. Amount is not that much but he is ok with such money only. So, i suggest him the same and asked him to bear the loss too while not blaming me, because i am not convincing you to invest instead giving you the knowledge i have and your decision must be based on your mindset and the required needs of yours.",

I know very well that we have plug and play equipment's for mining purpose but let us not forget they are also very costly, they utilize high energy bills and also the ROI is always more than 1 year or something based on what type of miner we have and electricity cost we pay. Yes, everything is there, but ability to get started and go through the entire ROI period is unreal right now. Plus, the net halving is already going reduce the block reward and we have no idea whether the prices will hike or not. At least miners has chance to recover the ROI faster when BTC goes up but it's unsure. This is why I am always choosing to buy bitcoin and keep them on my wallets for long terms. I will now just trust the process and go for profiting along the way.",

So which of them are referring to?I think you are confused.  It was answered in the Bitcoin FAQ QuoteIf no more coins are going to be generated, will more blocks be created?Absolutely! Even before the creation of coins ends, the use of transaction fees will likely make creating new blocks more valuable from the fees than the new coins being created. When coin generation ends, these fees will sustain the ability to use bitcoins and the Bitcoin network. There is no practical limit on the number of blocks that will be mined in the future.So it means that after the last Bitcoin is mined, the mining continues but this time the reward is dependent on the transaction fee.  Miners will continue to mine and since there is a century  before the last Bitcoin is mined, it was speculated that the transaction fees will give miners a good benefit but of course this kind of speculation may happen or may not.",

Given that the price of bitcoin increases overtime even if we generate more bitcoin, the payments for the miners will still be profitable. I don't think that we will come to the point where there will be no miners for bitcoin, as I've said before, bitcoin goes up in value which makes it more lucrative for people to get bitcoin and what better way to get those bitcoins besides buying but mining them. Also, ease your worries about that thing because I am sure that you can't do anything about it anyways. The less you know the better as the title of the Tame Impala song goes.",
