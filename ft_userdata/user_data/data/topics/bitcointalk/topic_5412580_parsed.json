  "content": "Proof of Work is the only proper/true Consensus Mechanism for approving and exchanging value for a work done in a Trustless Network Proof of Work is simply about requiring proof that a work has been properly done (or a problem has been solved) before the worker who solves the problem receives reward. That is the right thing to do when dealing with workers in work environments that require little to no trust to participate. It's about requiring everyone to freely solve available problem in a competitive way, but the one with the proven/right solution get rewarded. That is how it should be in a Network that wants to be truely decentralized rather than placing hugh barriers to entry on people who are interested in solving available problems. The barriers to entry could be inform of requiring certain amount of money/stake that is unaffordable to majority of interested people as it is with typical Proof of Stake (PoS) .   With the right PoW anyone can aswell be a verifier in the consensus mechanism without high barrier to entry problem. Verifiers could also earn some reward in a more advanced PoW when they achieve high degree of accuracy in a certain period of time. The reward does not necessarily have to be financial, it could be inform of good/positive Reputation, Merit etcIn conclusion, a proper Consensus Mechanism for a truly Decentralized Network needs to have low barrier to entry for interested participants. Anyone should be able to easily participate fully in network consensus as long as they have full access to network database by running full nodes and making sure that works are done right. PoW keeps the network more decentralized and secure... and most importantly it doesn't violate other important principles of Blockchain or Decentralized Network. The Right or Proper Consensus Mechanism is PoW as it achieves Network Consensus for a decentralized and trustless system without creating more problems like PoS does.",

The man is actually telling you about some imaginary POW that would reward people like him, which of course is a fantasy that has nothing to do with Bitcoin.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5412147.0",

That seems only marginally better than storing your coins in an exchange. Ie. it seems more like giving the illusion of autonomy, rather than actual autonomy. I'm not really up-to-date with Ethereum though so I might be missing something.Quote from: bitmover on September 06, 2022, 11:58:37 AMAs basically all small miners join pool in BTC, we should compare BTC pools with ETH pools.Not comparable at all though.As a small miner, you have full control over at which mining pool you point your hashrate at. You're free to change mining pools whenever (e.g. when a mining pool is gaining to large a portion of the total hashrate or it seems like a mining pool is behaving maliciously). You can even go solo, if you feel like playing the lottery.As a small staker, you give up control the minute your coins move to the staking pool. You have to trust the staking pool to return your coins eventually (once unstaking has become possible, that is). And going solo is prohibited by design unless you have at least 32 ETH in the bank.",

Voting centralizes overtime with Proof-of-Stake. That's because in order for someone to vote, he needs to get the required permission by a coin owner. He can't just enter the system in a permissionless manner, oppositely to Proof-of-Work wherein to vote you just need to have hardware and energy.Not to mention that large corporations (like centralized exchanges) suddenly gain power over the protocol, besides their financial power.",

Exchanges are very susceptible to regulations and authorities, which can simple force them to apply to whatever any government demands or they just shut them down.Recently, Vitalik buterin was proposing high punish for exchanges that block address or do any other misbehave. He suggested that at the protocol level the staked coins from the attacker are destroyed. This is specially interesting if exchange are forced to apply to authorities. The only alternative left for them would be to not offer staking server, and their coins will be just sit in the exchange (not participating in PoS, because they risk losing their stake if authorities force them to do anything that the protocol do not permit, such as blocking address or coins)https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1559268027983593474/photo/2Anyway, let's see if such things will be implemented or not.",
