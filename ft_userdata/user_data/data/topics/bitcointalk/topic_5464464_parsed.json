  "content": "I was watching a documentary associated with historical economies and the richest people. You will be shocked to see how much money these people had during the period when having thousands of USD was worth millions to billions in todays conversion rate! I am going to list them from the lowest to highest. If you love it, then do checkout the Top #1 richest man ever lived and it's definitely mind wobbling how he lived and how much his wealth was. RankName of the PersonPeriod Wealth in $$ #10Henry Ford1863-1947$199 billion#09Muammar Gaddafi1942-2011200 billion#08William The Conqueror1027-1087$229.5 billion#07Mir Osman Ali Khan1886-1967$230 billion#06Nikolai Alexandrovich Romanov1868-1918$300 billion#05John D Rockefeller1839-1937$341 billion#04Andrew Carnegie1835-1919$372 billion#03Akbar I1542-1605Wealth incalculable#02Augustus Caesar63 BC-AD 14$4.6 trillion#01Mansa Musa1280-1337Wealth incalculableThe king Mansa Musa was the one with incalculable wealth while Akbar was the another person in line to be that much rich. Musa seems to be popularly known because he was the only richest person who donated so much Gold that it caused the gold rates drop heavily and caused hyperinflation in the Egypt. It was so high that it took almost 10 years to recover from this inflation. Guess how the inflation was controlled? Well, Musa himself bought back the Gold at higher interest rate and thus helped the Egyptians to control their inflations. Even with the help of higher interest rate and buying back the gold it took ten years so we can imagine how enormous this inflation was. He was so rich that during his commute from the Mali kingdom to Haj, they carried 60,000 people along with them and every time they stopped on Friday they built mosques and stays everywhere. They donated gold to every city they roamed through and finally it was Egypt where they stayed for long and caused the inflation just by donating the Gold bars. This is one of the interesting fact that I learnt in the Economic section and hence wanted to share it as fun story.

I am not sure about the others and what happened to them but I know a bit about Mansa Musa and Akbar I. Both of them were best kings of their time and their wealth was unlimited due to the fact that they had access to treasures throughout the region where they ruled their dynasty. The problem started when colonies started to form from the European countries. In case of Akbar I, it took lot of time since there were mixed colonisation from around the world in different kingdoms. However, it is said that in case of Musa, they came in quickly since the region was very small. They were able to destroy it just like they did in the fairly modern world.",

      "body": "Thanks for an interesting topic.The problem with those historic wealth estimations is there is a chance they can be completely inaccurate. Positions 1 and 3 are incalculable so not sure how are they ranked in those places. In the case of the rulers, there's often no distinction between personal wealth and the wealth of the entire empire, so we end up comparing apples to oranges. I had no clue Henry Ford was that rich. He was a decent guy from what I know.Quote from: Flexystar on August 25, 2023, 10:23:11 AMThe problem started when colonies started to form from the European countries. In case of Akbar I, it took lot of time since there were mixed colonisation from around the world in different kingdoms. You can't colonise a successful and well-run country, such would have to be conquered. Colonies were established where there in underdeveloped or unpopulated areas. I'm not an expert on African history but believe most of the African empires fall on their own or due to infighting.",

I don't know but those weren't able to provide proof though. But it's interesting to see on how these people have been too wealthy since the ancient times and able to mitigate inflation yet or when it was too little. Can imagine that if they're still alive right now, they are still not going to be problematic on how to deal with inflation. LOL, the reality has slapped me once again that there's more to life and there's a need to be more pushy in everything we does to achieve financial freedom.",

That's simply due to technological progress, access to running water, sewage systems, electricity, and most of all - to nutrition and modern medicine (the last one is much overrated but still).",

      "body": "It is difficult to compare the wealth of people from different times. That is why people are always regarded as \"the richest man of his time\"  as Mansa Musa is usually regarded. Mansa simply means King, so that translates to \"King Musa\". That means he was a monarch and we can't determine what portion of his wealth belonged to the empire and which was his personal wealth.Before Musa became king Mali was already a very strong and big empire. They were so sophisticated that they were able to send out 200 ships to explore the Atlantic Ocean, which was the \"first exploratory mission\". The second exploratory mission of the Atlantic Ocean by the Mali empire was with 2000 ships. I'm just putting this out so y'all can get a rough idea of how rich and sophisticated they were at the time. I don't think even the British Empire could afford that at the time. Some people argue that in those times, the wealth of the empire belonged to the ruling Monarch.Some claim that Mansa Musa's wealth was equivalent to about $ 400 billion, but like most historians love to argue, his wealth is impossible to accurately calculate.Some believe that Musa had more gold than people even imagined and I have to believe this. I believe if his wealth is calculated accurately it would be more than $400billion.When you read about the things that he did, and the amount of gold he travels with you'll understand why I feel that way.Musa went to the hajj with 18 tons of gold, that's like a billion dollars in today's value. So yeah, he might be richer than we imagine.",

Agreed that inflation may not be what will affect bitcoin but regards to dump in the price of bitcoin, that is very possible and it is happening. Just last week the allege sale of Elon musk SpaceX acquired bitcoin dump caused the price shield of 9% which is about $4k drop in price which is already huge for within 24hours. So just like an individual can use his gold to crash the market and cause inflation, so also that could happen with bitcoin. But like you have the view, bitcoin won't be affected by inflation because gold or fiat dumped which was evident during the COVID-19.",

The next inaccuracy is the years of activity of these rich people. They all lived in different periods of time (different centuries). Therefore, is it even possible to compare their wealth. And another nuance is that the majority on this list are the rulers of countries who had access to huge wealth only by birthright, with the exception of Rockefeller (banker), Ford and Carnegie (entrepreneurs), who essentially earned this huge money themselves.I am curious to know otherwise, if the people on this list lived in our time, then which of them would invest in bitcoin.",
