I will say that it's good to have more numbers of this kind of thread of merited posts or ranking up merit thread In the forum because it will help growing many others, like @ Ratimov thread of  Re: [Merit] Help newbies and those who have a little left to the next rank so if we have more ten person's that act like @ fillippone , @ Ratimov, @ The Sceptical Chymist and DdmrDdmr in distribution of merit's it will help more , this people I mentioned is people I notice for large merit distribution, maybe we still have others but I have not notice them. Summary: let us support fillippone to Merit qualified application in his threads. Thanks and remain courageous everyone.",

I get the impression that in the entire forum, the most talented and \"handy\" people are from Bangladesh.Even a blind person will notice that every second member of this section is a newcomer, appearing where merit can be obtained quickly and easily. And then everyone moves on to the discussion of gambling. Just a template for action.Therefore, I am sure that both Naim027 and LDL farms will grow faster as more competitions like this take place.",

If you look closely to each merit source we have on the forum, everyone of them have their own unique way of making their own contributions to see that merits flow accordingly throughout the forum on post deserving it, know that to merit someone is not by force but by choice, take a look at how LoyceV, Ratimov, JayJuanGee, Ddmrddmr, The Sceptical Chymist, NotATether among others administer their respective merits pattern to be different from each other, fillippone may decides to adjust his requirements for application maybe to ranks, amount of merits needed to rank up among other criterials in short or put it open for other merits sources to assist but i believe they all have enough to attend to on their own threads as well and only few may have some left by the end of the month.Quote from: Onyeeze on June 22, 2023, 08:21:56 AMI will say that it's good to have more numbers of this kind of thread of merited posts or ranking up merit thread In the forum because it will help growing many others,Also come to think of it this way that some members members will take it as their right to receive merit even when they aren't deserving for it because they giver has to be the one to decided wether their post has enough informative ideas that could make it deserves being merited, maybe sooner or later Theymos may take the go for making an additional number of merits source to make it more easier.",

What you don't get applying to get a post merited:The certainty of a merit for your submission.The timely assessment of the quality of your merit submission.The right to discuss my meriting choices. My meriting habits aren't under scrutiny here.I get the impression that some people are getting impatient to get a lot of merit after posting their request for review in the @fillippone thread. This is probably because according to them @fillippone is not optimal because many applications have not been reviewed even after several pages, but basically these people do not realize that @fillippone has committed to reading all posts and assessing whether they deserve an merit or not. It's clear that @fillippone took a lot of time to do, but I'm starting to get the impression that some people are getting impatient.In addition, some people are starting to focus on getting merit on the @fillippone thread, while they have difficulty getting merit elsewhere because the quality of the posts lacks weight. But despite all that, I also disagree that other merit source need to be encouraged to get lots of posts in the @fillippone thread, but everyone just needs to be patient to have their turn.",
