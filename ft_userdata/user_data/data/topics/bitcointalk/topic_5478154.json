Who can afford so high fees? Fees are so high and people still pay for it, mempool is clogged and getting even more clogged. I thought I was not a poor guy but now I feel like the poorest person in the world Does anyone know what's the reason behind these high fees? These are not ordinal transactions.P.S. Bitcoin miners are getting higher reward from fees rather than from mining a block. Has this ever happened before?",

It was intentionally built to do this. The problem is that blocks like this: https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000002f83ab72267be24e81ec374b726f94d2ae784fcd9c442 are full of transactions where the output is a 546 sats UTXO.Essentially the recepient won't be able to do anything with a 546 sats UTXO. At the same time, 546 sats is the minimum UTXO size allowed in Bitcoin, so it looks like people fill blocks with dust outputs.P.S I didn't check the past of these transactions to see where the money come from, but it is suspicious, in my opinion.Question for everyone more technically savvy than me: Could those be direct payments to the miners for some reason? Because if you think about it, you will see that these transactions pay for example 50,000 sats on fees (to the miners) and 546 sats to an address.",

Standardness isn't going to help. Binance essentially funds this, and Binance is literally mining. Newbies can buy and sell this nonsense using third parties, and maybe at this time it'll be worse, because we will have an inaccurate mempool.

But, this one is P2TR, where the dust threshold is 330.

It could be a miner payment, which saves space for another output. But, to me it seems more like someone testing taproot.",
