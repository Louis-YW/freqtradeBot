Buy it again when you will have money in pocket. You don't need luxury while your pocket is empty. exactly, I don't know why people like to use big phone when they are not working, and no food to eat. They can't use the phone to make money online yet they busy using big phones and still eatinf from their parents pots. I support you. He should sell the phone instead of using it as collateral.",

By stashing away a portion of monthly wage, you could easily save up that $500 in the year and a half that you've been begging for a loan here. We're talking about less than $30 a month here. Seriously, can you honestly tell me that setting aside such a small, insignificant amount each month is beyond your reach?",
