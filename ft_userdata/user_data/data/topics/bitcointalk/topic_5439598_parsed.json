This kind of behavior is concerning and raises questions about their integrity as a company, it will be interesting to see how this situation plays out.[...]Yes, but it's a very very very small campaign with as small rewards, one week only signature and reddit campaign with 600 USDT pool, 300 USDT each. If the amount OP stated is true, the amount they lost would almost equal to the amount allocated for that marketing. I looked at their spreadsheet, the highest paid for reddit was 34 USDT and signature was 28 USDT. It was distributed successfully, though.I wouldn't be surprised if they launched that bounty for the sole purpose of giving false credibility and tricking people into thinking they're a good platform.I would very like it if I can be proven wrong.",

Returning me only 100 usdt despite i deposited 340 it means only winning bets were abnormal bet, with loosing bet its ofc all ok. Also you remember to call upon abnormal bets only when i try to withdraw not before.That would sound resonable if you sanction with void after first suspicious bet not after withdrawal demand.And ofcourse loosing bet are all clear nth abnormal or suspicious 🤣After this explanation i can only say stay out of this bookie for sure.",

Where is the proof that this person's playing is unfair and matches with a predetermined result so that the members believe what you said?Frankly, it is the first time that I got to know about this betting platform through this topic, and what I saw on review sites, most of them are shill reviews.You can try to solve this situation and return the OP's deposits and winnings to him if you are honest and want to preserve your EUPHORIABET reputation, and you are free to close his account if you prove that he violates your platform Terms and conditions, but after he withdraws the entire funds that he deposited.",

Just claiming it is not good enough.It bothers alot when players are loosing heavily and casino would not do any thing funny or ack rashly or try stopping the gambler or bettor from further play. They would remain silent while the bettor plays and loose consecutively huge amount of money but when it is the winning things for the gambler and maybe the gambler wins a big amount of money, the casino puts their eyes on the gamblers account with various investigations and security operation waiting for results for which will take upto 1 week delaying the release of the bettors win and when it is over one week plus, they start telling cock and bull tails that holds no water just to justify their  delayed pattern of scamming gamblers onboard their platform. It is very disturbing and disappointing that one would take out their time to get registered onboard a gambling platform and after doing that while scaling through their registration process following the required steps and after a win, they would start demanding for things that were not stated on their terms conditions for signing up.",

Or is it that you win and then the casino decides that the amount won was due to abnormal activity? If you have decided and as you are the casino, your decision is final, why don't you post a proof of what really was done abnormally by OP? What made you reverse the winnings of him? How can OP know the outcome of matches for which you are accusing him?Any proof of websites where it was known? Is OP a match fixer? Would he fix games just to win $500?Stop giving nonsense replies, be responsible and show some evidence to prove that OP is guilty.",
