  "content": "I am still looking for someone to trade with periodically. My plan is to purchase near on 1 mBTC (0.001 BTC) once per month. Regarding the price, I am looking for a fair, even trade based on the current market rate on the day of the transaction.I will cover the transaction fees for Bitcoin (limited to 1 input and 2 outputs, with a fee range of 5–10 sats/vByte  this is usually 1 USD). I will send the payment in USDT, preferably via the Polygon network, immediately after the BTC transaction has been confirmed.To ensure privacy and minimize traceability, I prefer to keep the transactions private just for us. For trustworthiness, I can provide signed text messages with the instructions using my staked Bitcoin address.Questions:Why do I offer this outside of a CEX?- To avoid biggers fees (CEX charge fees when you buy it and also when you retire to an auto-custodial wallet)- To avoid KYC (On the bitcoin side)- To gain a little of TrustSend me a Direct message if you have doubts or if you are interested in trading with me.",

You're buying on the same Binance but what you get is always lower than what's bought. I think this is common with Bitcoin purchases. I haven't noticed it in all my stablecoin deals. This is why I've resolved to stay away from buying Bitcoin there. I rather buy USDT and then swap it for Bitcoin. Yes, I know I will be charged a certain commission for swapping it but what is charged is negligible compared to the throat slit I get buying directly.",

I would need to do it once a month or increase it from 0.001. It would make more sense.2- Covering/ paying the taxes doesn't matter to me and I would like a percentage of the market price of BTC.If you are interested, send me a DM so we can discuss it further.

Because you want a specific way of sending the BTC that makes my options limited. If I want to send you the BTC from another source than my wallet, simply I can't.Instead of paying me the fees of the transaction, I prefer getting a percentage that (depending on my strategy) will either cover the fees from wherever I send the BTC or give me a very small leverage to rebuy the BTC. By the way, I'm not talking about a huge percentage.Quote from: albert0bsd on December 07, 2024, 09:32:33 PMWhen people change their btc on for usdt or another coin on CEXs they usually lose some between 2% to 10% depending of the CEX fees.My accounts' biggest fee percentage in 6-7 different exchangers is 0.088%. As for their withdrawal fees, are all flat. I don't know how and why you have this kind of percentages.Quote from: albert0bsd on December 07, 2024, 09:32:33 PM- PrivacyUsing USDT, privacy goes out of the building...",

And always moving that BTC to another wallet outside of the exchange (Maybe this is my problem) because if I keep that virtual BTC inside the Exchange i didn't lose that amount.I already try many varitions of this like buying BTC directly in P2P Buying USDT and the converting to BTC and other like this.Maybe if you name a CEX and the method used to convert Fiat in to BTC to a self-custody wallet outside of the CEX and just lossing 0.088% on fees comparing the final BTC Amount againts the Fiat amount that you use it should be VERY COOL!Quote from: bias on December 08, 2024, 03:13:07 PMUsing USDT, privacy goes out of the building...It is private because i am not going to disclose which is your USDT wallet and I expected the same for my BTC wallet.",
