Usually they will complain when there is a change in the rules or anything that makes the bounty stop even though at first they don't mind anything based on their personal decisions. I know they understand the risks, but they are not brave enough to ignore them because usually most of them just rely on luck.I'm not sure that it's all the fault of the manager and his management [they can be weird or very nice], but some bounty participants also deserve to be blamed for the decisions they agreed to in the first place, especially joining without doing any analysis.",

The bounty manager has the right to stop or halt a campaign that's not effective because his job is to give a positive result to the client that pays for a quality promotion service. I don't say that he should not pay all participants but rather pay only the participants that he finds only doing the task properly.To clarify the situation, I'm basing my statement on what's the given proof above. Murat reason is there are only 3 legit participants on his campaign, Do you think this will happened on BTC signature? Bounty managers like Hhampuz will never accept low-quality poster and if ever this will happen, I'm sure the bounty manager will kick immediately the participants or stop the campaign because they are not giving a good result to their client. I find it crazy. Why do they have to wait for the campaign to be over before cancelling the campaign? Â OP said it run for 6 weeks and after 6 weeks which the campaign is over, they end with Â the Â cancellation while the participants are already expecting pay. Maybe they should have decided to cancel when they saw there were only 3 participants in the 1st or 2nd week at least. If they are not good posters, they could have been removed in the first week of participating the campaign.Maybe I did misunderstand this or did they wait for the 6 weeks to be over?",

      "body": "Honestly, it beggars the question of why scam accounts and activities aren't banned here but plagiarism is, at the slightest discovery. A few bounty managers are effortlessly disparaging this forum by their activities. They sign on to bounties and mostly only care for their paycheck. Hunters are often left in the lurch and this isn't good. Rewards aren't paid as when due. Most times rewards aren't paid out at all and that ends it. The BMs, knowing that DT and highly ranked members who could call them out don't participate in bounties have utilized this to go rogue. I remember calling a BM out a few years ago and all they could do was retaliatory, instead of amicably resolving the issue. I know there are users here who would argue that if anyone didn't like the way they're treated they shouldn't participate in bounties. Sadly, arguing that way won't be an approach to resolving this lingering scamming activity. In 2017/18, a few signature campaigns managers who wanted to go that route were severely dealt with and that straightened the whole thing up. That's why we see the type of sanity we have in BTC paying campaigns today. I think that should also be the call of action for rogue BMs. Enough of this maltreatment of bounty hunters.",

Murat should come and clarify this, because i think this needs more clarification from the manager precisely not by pointing out what he said. This a proposed that's campaign launched. and if that should be a cancellation is from the initial when the campaign started. And it's not supposed to be after the campaign has run for some weeks intervals.I know vividly that scam campaign's also come to way of managers and if they are not smart enough to detect the ability of the contract, they will end up giving their self debts. So it's unbalanced from my perception, if theirs is changes or you observe the level of competency from your participants your it make openly and remove them and is proper, but a process whereby you notice their default and you kept silent and allow campaign to run to an end before you deleting their file's, it's not legit theory. That's while i said that should not be the major factor, so let the manger portray it own view.",
