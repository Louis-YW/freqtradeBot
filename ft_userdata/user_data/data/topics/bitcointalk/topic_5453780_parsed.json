This is just US politics, both sides tries to push for its own ideologic vision of running economy - \"small government\" vs \"taxing the rich\". I would be surprised if there will be an actual default, it would create too much problems for both parties, not to mention the American people, because even if it would be a small technical default, it would undermine the confidence in US governmetn and US economy. As for impact on crypto, I'd say it will likely be bad, based how in the past stock market crashes and inflation and global economic turmoil was bad for Bitcoin's price. Despite the narrative of safe haven, it seems Bitcoin's growth happens when investors have spare money that they can put on high risk investments.",

I think that in the event of a default, in the short term, the price of bitcoin will fall into an area of increased turbulence due to a head-on collision of two strong trends - on the one hand, the price will drop sharply, because bitcoin belongs to the class of high-risk financial assets, on the other hand, the price will rise sharply, because that the network hashrate is stable, blocks continue to be mined at intervals of an average of every ten minutes, and a fall in the dollar automatically means an increase in bitcoin in the btc/usd pair.",

It is bad because in the case of an actual default by the government of the United States, there is no way the local and the global markets will stay unchanged to such unprecedented news, so I would expect the price of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies to go down in the short term. On the other hand, those who were a bit skeptical on Bitcoin and decentralization may start to see why such things are important, in the current economy, Bitcoin cannot default because it is a networks about debit and those network which allow debt through smarth contracts mostly work on over-collateral and not on printing money out no where.",

Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you. I am still trying to understand how an effect on the USD would affect the crypto-currency space? Yes USD is the general standard for value, the only effect it would have in crypto-currency market is the crypto dollar value. Coins like the stable coin which is pegged on the US dollars would definitely be affected in value because it takes the value of the US dollars.But in terms of stocks, and even other countries currency an effect on the US dollars would also affect them, I think that's why the decentralized system need to be in place to prevent the global control of the US dollars or any other currencies .",

But for discussion if I consider that will default on their debt, it will be an excellent thing for crypto market. Billions of dollars will be infused into the crypto market from various institutional investors to park their additional funds. Similarly Gold and other precious metals will also see a huge demand. Corporates are sitting on cash piles so they will need to find an alternative solution to park their funds for short to medium term is US government starts defaulting. But this will not be great situation for the rest of the world. The world economy may go into a deep recession which will take longer to recover.",

However, when viewed from a momentum standpoint, the impact is also a reversal of profits i.e. maximizing accumulation in Bitcoin. As this time approaches the halving, people will be taking much bigger risks even if the market conditions are unfavorable. They will not waste this opportunity by increasing the amount of their investment assets. After all, US economists have a huge influence on price spikes and falls. And after passing through the national debt phase, the surge will continue to increase the purchase value which is very significant.",

Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you. If politicians and economists talk about default, then most likely they will not allow it. Here it is necessary to proceed from the opposite. That is, if a default were possible, then it would hardly be talked about. Think back to 2008 and the mortgage crisis that created a chain reaction with crises around the world. Then after all, only a few voiced the approaching collapse. I want to say that the words of politicians need to be reversed. They are still talkers and liars. If they talk about something very often, then it will not happen. I won’t say that it works 100%, but this trend can be traced 100% of them.In any case, the default will have a negative impact in all sectors of the financial world, including cryptocurrencies. Another thing is that it is better to rely on long-term prospects with cryptocurrencies, especially if it is bitcoin. Then all current problems, such as defaults and crises, will not be significant.",

We will see a drop in business activity worldwide.  Countries that export metals and hydrocarbons will suffer the most.  In these countries, the situation with the economy will be catastrophic. The United States will also suffer, but to a lesser extent.  In Europe, everything will be quite stable, and the euro will rise against the US dollar.  Gold and Bitcoin will rise in price very strongly.",

Even tho country like BRICS and ASEAN says on the news that they will be using less and less US Dollar but it is still at the phase of paper/development and has not been realised yet, so the worst scenario when US is Default it would be huge hit to the rest of the world. Is it bad for crypto maybe for the beginning it would hit crypto market too but after this happen I would say the adoption of crypto will pretty much higher than ever that can drive the price to the moon",

And we know crypto in all exchanges is a lot paired with USD, especially USDT. I am pretty sure it will be affected. But, like many posts above, it's not long, it's the same as the correction market. If this continues, people will leave USD and continue to another stable fiat like Euro, Pound, and Yen. Or maybe get an experiment back to Gold. But, I am not worried so much, US Dollar is used in many countries for international trade. This means the US government can resolve the debt by printing the dollars. before doing that, they have to save the budget, they should not be involved in war anymore, don't send war guns, and not interfere in another conflicting country.And I hope the US government did not sell the 205,515 Bitcoin held. If they sell Bitcoin to pay debts, the crash will happen for a long.",

The US economy still plays a pivotal role in the world economy, and if they did indeed default, that would plunge the world economy into turmoil and be even worse than last year. So I think bitcoin is going to get worse, I don't see any positive impact on bitcoin in the short term. But again, I believe a US government default will never happen.",

On one hand, a default could lead to increased inflation and a weaker US dollar, which may drive investors towards alternative assets like crypto currencies. This could lead to increased demand for crypto currencies and potentially drive up their prices. Us debt default could also lead to a broader financial crisis and economic instability which could negatively impact all assets including crypto currencies. In such a scenario investors may look to liquidate their investments across all markets including crypto in order to cover up losses or to move into a safer assets.

But I doubt that America will fail to pay its debts later, even though news about this continues to be reported, many economic observers believe that America will be able to pay its debts on time because they understand very well that it will not only affect America but also globally if they fail, if they fail then the predictions for 2023 will be even tougher to come true.",

The thought of Uncle Sam going into default is enough to make your skin crawl, isn't it? To compare it to the shadow of Godzilla being cast over the happy world of global economics and cryptocurrency is an understatement. The fall of the dollar, the world's piggy bank, could set off a chain reaction in global finance.Keep Bitcoin in mind, our defiant friend. Bitcoin emerged from the ashes of the 2008 financial collapse and strutted its stuff like a punk rocker at a bankers' convention. As a result, in the event of a hypothetical breakdown of the United States government, people may flock to cryptocurrencies like bees to honey.Let's be honest, though; this won't be easy. Traditional market volatility can make investors concerned, leading to a crypto market clearance. The value of cryptocurrencies could crash precipitously in the near future. But hey, in the long run Bitcoin and its crypto relatives could be basking in the sunlight of a paradigm shift towards decentralised economies. What a surprising turn of events!",

The possible impact on the crypto market will be felt considering that currently the US market plays a major role in influencing Bitcoin price movements, this is evident from the several times The FED raised interest rates which also affected Bitcoin prices. And if the US were to default, it would also be able to affect the crypto market globally and it is possible that there will be many crypto holders who are affected by this and it will make the crypto market conditions even more unstable this year. Hopefully between the US government and their parliament will find a bright spot related to this problem.",
