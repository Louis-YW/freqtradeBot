  "content": "The fitness lifestyle media company’s “anti-metaverse” platform will give users incentive to ski, run, bike or hike using NFTs and other rewards.It's called “Outerverse”: A platform where hikers, bikers, runners, skiers – outdoor-doers the world over – can earn rewards for tracking their real-life activity atop crypto rails. Skiers, for example, could unlock chances at a heli-skiing expedition, Zoom calls with famous photographers, perhaps Warren Miller movie tickets  – definitely non-fungible tokens (NFT) – by notching days out on the snow.Outside Interactive, the conglomerate behind Outside Magazine and a raft of outdoor journalism outposts from Backpacker to Climbing, as well as fitness lifestyle brands such as Yoga Journal, is leaning into Web3 with an “anti-metaverse” NFT platform. The aim is to give readers incentive to spend more time among the trees rather than vegetating in VR.(Source: Coindesk)",

      "body": "That is a very interesting and creative concept which can encourage people to develop healthy habits while making some extra income from it. I'm really concerned about spending more time at virtual environments and less time in the real world.On the other hand, we must be careful with any services paying us for tracking our steps. It means you are giving your coordinates and routine details in real time to someone you don't know and don't know what they can do with this or to who they can expose it to.Moreover, payrates must be taken into consideration. I've seen similiar apps, and in my opinion it's fake propaganda what they offer, since people earn too little, being almost impossible to cashout a minimum decent amount of crypto.",
