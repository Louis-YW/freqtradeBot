Though this may sound like a good deal I discouraged him from making this investment for the following reasons.Firstly with the rate at which the traditional currency in my country is steadily loosing value and the proposed profit and initial deposit might just be valueless at the matured time this deal might be of little or no value.Secondly these platforms in my opinion cannot be trusted as different reasons can lead to their folding up and shutting down.

What happens is that they are usually different investments. A deposit is not usually for the long term, because you lose money due to inflation and Bitcoin should be for the medium term at least, because in the short term the price can go down very fast. Get a HW, preferably not Ledger or Trezor, and think about where you are going to buy the Bitcoin. If it is a centralized exchange you will have the problem of privacy basically. If it is decentralized or P2P you could have a problem tomorrow justifying where the money you have comes from if it becomes a fortune depending on what you do with it.",

We had of lot online banking folding up and what if they decide to shut down their operation what would you do at the cost of your investment?Meaning they go and your money lost, so investing in bitcoin is something that could give you a relaxed mind and it should be for long term not short time and it must be accomplished with patients, there are lots of people who called themselves bitcoin holders but yet can't withstand any bad market pressure or conditions they will easily feed the market with their investment.",

That's even higher than the highest bank offer in my country. It would certainly be a sensation here if there were a highly reputable bank offering such rates.So, it seems like the point that makes you advise against deposits on that platform is due to inflation and the platform's reputation, right? And you suggest buying Bitcoin for the long term.I strongly recommend providing advice based on the risk tolerance of your interlocutor. Personally, I would still opt for Bitcoin as an alternative, meaning I would diversify across multiple assets. For instance, investing in gold, stocks, BTC, etc. makes more sense because when it comes to savings, it's all your hard-earned money that's unseen in our lives. So, I wouldn't want to place it all in one place to avoid unforeseen collapse risks. Although Bitcoin has shown an upward trend every year, it doesn't rule out the possibility of a collapse at an unpredictable time.",

I take it all day long I were you since it automatically cuts you some loss due to inflation in guaranteed way. There’s no guarantee that Bitcoin will go up by the time your deposit unlock while there’s a chance of losing more. 13% is already high interest rate but I understand the concern about inflation. What I’m saying is there’s a chance to negate inflation through guaranteed way while you have job that can give you source of income for your daily expenses.",

Instead, I would say he shouldn't rush to put all that money in the bank, he should learn about bitcoin. I would tell him, in addition to better profit opportunities from bitcoin, bitcoin can also become its own bank, ensuring privacy...He can then choose what he thinks is good for him, I don't want to directly give financial advice to anyone, because I have nothing to guarantee them anything.",

I suggest you tell your friend to check how this company or bank is generating money and the types of loans they are involved in because that is where the money to pay interest on the fixed deposits come from. It usually remains under 6%.Now FD is not bad as long as you know what you are doing. A Recurring deposit is need for a spending that you anticipate. All these methods of investment have their pros and cons. Bitcoin is not the solution to their shortcomings, keep that in mind. You will need liquid cash at hand when an emergency strikes, which already happened with the pandemic and all.So advice your friend to manage asset like that fiat and crypto.

This is one of the strategies of many Ponzi schemes and scam projects in my country.

There needs to be more learning and strengthening in terms of mentality that must exist before investing in bitcoin. Even if it is for the long term this is still very good but whether your partner can mentally hold back and will not use the money for a longer period of time than thought.Often we encounter a mindset when someone new to bitcoin thinks that this is the easiest and shortest way to get money but it is precisely with thinking like this that we will be destroyed.",

Better he used the fund to take care of urgent needs than allow it to lose value in long-term fix deposit. Alternatively he could invest in something that can beat inflation within the period he hopes to take back the fund. Fiats or national currencies are really not the best things to invest in long-term, as they are notorious for losing value due to inflation. And it's not really a good idea to lock in alot of money on a custodial platform even with the high interest rate it offers. It's actually a gamble or a big risk not worth taking. Bitcoin is a great alternative since it's deflationary and allows investors to fully control or self-custody their funds. It's best to invest in Bitcoin longterm, and the right time to invest is when there are signs of potential strong price increase within the period you hope to see your investment grow to maturity.",

      "body": "Quote from: Bravethug on October 04, 2023, 02:14:20 PMYesterday my partner came up with an idea to deposit a good some of money in a fixed deposit account on an online banking platform offering a 13% interest rate, they offered to pay the interest upfront but the initial deposite would be locked in till the exact stipulated time. Though this may sound like a good deal I discouraged him from making this investment for the following reasons.Hmm, 13% interest rate is already showing red flags not to go ahead and invest in such platforms. Financial Companies like this give you enticing offers to lure you into investing with them and this looks too good to be true, he rather not go ahead than later going ahead with the investment and regret it later.QuoteFirstly with the rate at which the traditional currency in my country is steadily loosing value and the proposed profit and initial deposit might just be valueless at the matured time this deal might be of little or no value.Inflation is something to consider in a case like this, and since you know how your country currency is losing value and may not worth anything at the stipulated time to take his money, it is better he doesn’t even try it. This is a risk not worth taking. Where this pains the most is the fact that you’ll assume that you’re some amount richer whereby in the real sense you’re not just different from the way you are currently.QuoteSecondly these platforms in my opinion cannot be trusted as different reasons can lead to their folding up and shutting down. I understand that life's a risk but some risks are not worth taking.With what you explained above on how the platform operates and give out this high interest rate. I can easily conclude that they will exit the business in a short time when they are able to gather a lot of money from people’s investment. So, it is better not to even give a trial.QuoteOn the other hand I offered a solution. I asked him to invest in Bitcoin, now even though the price of bitcoin is volatile, in my opinion it is still more profitable to invest in Bitcoin especially for long term investment than in any fixed deposit scheme.If you were in the position to give financial advice to someone looking for a long term financial investment, what would you advice?...I would say he should invest in bitcoin because as long as this forum is concerned, we are all bitcoin enthusiasts and will love to see people invest in it to increase its widely use and adoption and not for just them to come and enjoy the benefit of long term investment which is an added benefit when they invest in it. Bitcoin is volatile but can get you more security of your funds if you invest through the right channel while waiting for your funds to grow for the long term.",
