The human factor can play a very cruel joke.This is a rather general question and different companies handle this in different ways, but my best guess is that most reputable and well-known companies keep the majority of their funds in multisig cold wallets.For day-to-day transactions, hot wallets could work but those tend to have hardcore security too.  The specifics likely differ between companies, but I'd bet access takes jumping through multiple hoops. Like layers of authentication approvals, audits, etc.But I'm no expert, just speculating based on what I know.  The inner workings of these systems aren't something they share publicly.",

The human factor can play a very cruel joke.Just as an addition to what fatfork already said about companies preferences in selecting which wallet that best meat their preference at a time, but primarily most companies will only use hot wallet for transactions but most definitely since most of their daily transactions will be in fiat so bitcoin won't be a big option for them so at that milti sig cold wallet is their best shot, just as fat fork said this is just an assumptions since most companies won't reveal such info.

If you've seen El Salvador's plan to buy bitcoins, you'll understand. El Salvador's president has announced that his country will buy one bitcoin per day. However, if you can buy Bitcoin and hold it for a long time in the DCA method, it will definitely be a significant plan of all plans.",

The human factor can play a very cruel joke.Why do you need to know where they store their Bitcoin and how they do it? There is something called privacy, this is what Bitcoin gives you that nobody can interfere with your investment unlike the banks where even the government can have access to the account number and the names of the account. The companies store Bitcoin just the way you store your own Bitcoin, they used hardware wallet like the ones you used like Trezor and ledger.There way of storing Bitcoin on their wallet might not be straight forward like a single spender, they do create wallet with M of N signature where 2 or more private keys are required before any Bitcoin can be spend from the wallet. This protect the compby from the fund been mismanage by one person or stolen by some. Even in a situation when one person who has the ledger is been compromised, the funds can be spent because of the M of N signature requirements.",

However, we can make guesses and think of the solutions they could use, such as multi-sig cold storage or custodians that take care of the funds on their behalf and charge them money for it. When either multi-sig wallets or custodians are involved, there is no human factor that can cause any harm to the company and its coins.Quote from: Samlucky O on December 15, 2024, 08:29:14 PMFor me there is no big deal on where company needs to store there bitcoin, they can store in a any non custodial wallet, provided the seed phrase is safe and  secured and also not accessible to anyone apart from the the person in charge of the company finance.

Giving charge of the funds to a single person or even a team with all the access to the wallet(s) can be foolish, as @examplens said, because if they can move the funds, what will stop them from doing that and running away with the funds? The company is not going to chase a few people around the world because they stole some of their bitcoins, even if they try, the odds of them finding the culprits will be very low.",

They will use multisig wallets for storage, cold wallets but there are entities that don't want to store bitcoins by themselves, but choose custodians for example Coinbase doing this for them.I don't say using a third party service, like Coinbase, as a custodian for your Bitcoin fund, is safe and best way of storage, but it's fact. You can check it with Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the USA and many of them choose Coinbase as their custodians.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsBitcoin Spot ETF Custodians.",

They might use hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor or even create custom solutions in strong and secure computers. For extra security, they often use multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets where several people need to approve a transaction before funds can move, and thus is in case someone could get access to that computer or hacked it.Accessing the wallet needs a procedure with private keys. In multi-sig setups many wallet should be combined and no single person has complete control on the funds. Companies also back up the keys in secure locations,like vaults. Honestly, I find that half or even the more important part on storing bitcoins is not just about the method or place but also avoiding many mistakes to let hackers easily get access to you and make the company vulnerable .",
