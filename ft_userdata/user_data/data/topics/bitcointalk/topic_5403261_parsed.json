It is true that not everyone in those countries likes to bet a lot on those matches that are mentioned in the schedule. Maybe it will help people who are interested in sports statistics. I think football is still the most popular sport to bet on worldwide. By the way, I had expected and also thought that Ice Hockey would be a well-known sport in America and maybe even be in 2nd place behind basketball?",

I've asked myself why this happens and I can't find the answerQuote from: Zackgeno96 on June 19, 2022, 08:48:52 PMI have not seen such an overview to be honestIt's also the first time I've seen such a thing and from what I see there will be few people who will comment and mention their country and which sport is more dominant in their country, that's because in this forum more than 50% want to be anonymous",

So they follow the sports by heart, and when the time they realized that they can't make it, then maybe they will go into gambling as they know the sports very much and gamble.",

In my country soccer is everything and the major sports bet platform. I have never heard or seen any gambler staking on any sports apart from football. And the European league is the most popular.

Heck, if I were to be asked what sport would be where people most bet on, it wouldn't even be basketball or the like, I'd go for cockfighting (which was recently banned, so it might be changed really but the norm is like that here imo). Famous sports as others have said would be basketball though.

I've been in love with billiards recently after I watched clips of the Magician (Efren) lately. Man, I'm still dumbfounded how this hasn't really been in the media like basketball or the like. I know the sports isn't for everyone but man, at least give it some coverage that's worth his reputation at least. Quote from: Oasisman on June 20, 2022, 06:18:17 AMI guess that's Rugby? I'm not sure if it's just a typo or the name of the sports is actually Ruby. Yea it's probably Rugby.

Lack of government support. I was also hooked on basketball in PH when I was young and that was my sport growing up. I played Sepak Takraw during my high school days but it ended there. Called \"Sipa\" when playing outside using a bolt washer combined with a plastic wrapper (supposed to be a wooden ball) which is known to kids during the 90s, I don't see kids playing that nowadays. The last issue that I had seen in the news was about the weight lifting sport that was also not supported well after Hidilyn Diaz won the gold in Tokyo 2020. Boxing though is where I think we are really good at. They should put more funds in that industry.",
