  "content": "Hi All!I'm a newbie in crypto-land.As most (wanna-be) traders, I search for daily news on different coins I'm interested in. To do this, I screen reputable websites, blogs, and YT channels every day.Having gone through this process for a few months, I've identified 3 problems:- Finding news for multiple crypto currencies is time consuming, meaning there's a lot of noise to filter out.- Reading articles / watching videos on crypto takes significant time.- Relevant information is scattered all over the place. Back to point 1 wrt investing considerable time to put together all the info I need for my trading decisions.To address these issues, I'd like to build a piece of software to automatically get in my inbox all the crypto news I need organised by currency (I'm a programmer). The system scans several info outlets, creates article summaries, and sends the ones that are relevant to me. Every day.I think I'm not the only one facing these problems, but I may be overlooking something, given I'm new in the space.I'm curious to know whether you also face the problems I've listed above? Alternatively, what problems do you experience when gathering news, if any?[Disclaimer] If I see these problems are particularly felt by the community, I may patch my personal solution into a product others can use.Thank you.Valerio",

There are many news sources that can be used as references for the latest crypto news, but when FUD has started to appear it will be the cause of the unstable market because the negative impact of FUD puts pressure on the market and this is the goal that was planned.I get all the crypto news from sites like Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, cryptonews, and several other news portals. and I also monitor through social media twitter, because there will be crowded with the latest news about crypto.",

      "body": "A lot of crypto trading is done in the background. By the time you have heard of a project's name, it could already have a market cap of $100 million. A lot of successful trading is done without the news on a lot of things and relies on other fundamentals (such as how much a coin is searched or if it's near a significant support or resistance level). A lot of altcoin projects this year have been playing games with their investors in a hunt for more capital and notoriety - don't be fooled by a short lived wave on some altcoins that can pump and dump or see significant claims the network will change only to post multi-year roadmaps because they lack appropriate competition. There are crypto based news outlets, this forum, twitter and YouTube to pick from for a lot of information, why not just pick one or two to focus on? It's more important to absorb different types of media than it is to absorb different media outlets of the same type imo. If you're using social media, you'll get accounts of events with less biases that aren't called out. If you're using a Web page or YouTube video, you'll get a more concise article but it might also fit a bias and be inaccurate (I'm not saying to only rely on one though because some social media comes with limited demographics of comments and you could get the same biased/inaccurate view from multiple people/shillers).As mentioned above there are sites like coin market cap, crypt exchanges and potentially search engines that will be able to deliver you news articles though too.",

I've also noticed some questionable sources from there so yeah hopefully there's a way to filter such things. Take note that some features may be paywalled. I'm also not suggesting to solely rely to them as we can't expect them to reach everything but perhaps it could make things easier for you.",

I don't want to scare you but knowledge is what is important in every aspect of crypto as a newbie you need to learn indicators like EMA, RSI, MA, and Bollinger Bands.In the meantime, you can follow reputable crypto enthusiasts like Apompliano, Rovercrc, and Woonomic on Twitter.

There is also on telegram but it's possible to detect them if you already have some experience here in crypto. There are still lots of valuable threads in our forum but maybe not all information can be found here. Doing some searching outside is also a good thing to do.I know there are now bots and groups which can send us signals, I think this was the same to what the op is looking for but he can still pursue his plans since he is a developer.
