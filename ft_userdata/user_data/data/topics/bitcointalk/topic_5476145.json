  "content": "With how inflation is, someone that makes 6 figures in the US isn't even that much money if you live in a very expensive state like California.  Also having 1 million dollars would not be enough to retire in the US these days unless you live in certain states and assuming you have no job.  Seems like you need 2 or 3 million dollars in the US for someone to retire so to speak if they have no other forms of income and you could live off the interest.  Now if you are living in a poor country,l having 1 btc is a lot of money already in some places.  But in most 1st world countries, 1 btc isn't much at all.  Now if btc hits 6 figures, the btc sending fees will 100% go up correct and by a lot?  Or would it actually go back to lower fees like $0.25?  The other thing is if btc goes up to 6 figures and beyond, would that mean the cost of rent and food and everything will rise as well or not?  Yes there is inflation and it has been going up much faster the last few years compared to years ago.  If btc hits 250k, would that mean bread would cost $10?  Always heard people say if btc goes up really high, things like coffee would cost $25 seems ridiculous but are they serious?The other thing I thought of was this.  If btc hits 6 figures and goes to say 250k or even 500k usd, well that would mean there would be quite a lot of new millionaires out there compared to now since you still need a sizeable amount of btc to be a millionaire.  I know there has been many millionaires due to crypto but for most people, it's hard if you don't have much savings to buy btc the last few years.  Now if someone owns 1 btc, and btc goes to 1 million dollars, would there be a concern for people who own more than 1 btc... let say they own 3 btc to make it simple... now that there are way too many millionaires so just too many rich people?  Or if btc goes to 1 million dollars, that means having 3 million dollars is no longer enough to retire on in the US anymore?  Would that make the number then say 6 million?  So after taxes, let's say you get between 2/3rd to 1/2 the amount.  If btc hits mid 6 figures or low 7 figures, would it mean everything would increase so much in terms of living cost and everything so people who have a net worth of 2 million dollars after tax selling btc wouldn't be able to live off the interest?",

Well definitely it will, but not for now. Bitcoin is uncontrollable asset as long as there are many who supported it. The private sector are probably threaten by its idea due to those hidden agenda they are doing. Tranparency is a key and using bitcoin it can be achieved. Its only a matter of time I guess.",

You can own 1 bitcoin living in a European country as easily as you can own a bitcoin living in an Asian country. So if you need 1 bitcoin after retirement in Asian country, you will need 5-10 bitcoin in European country it is normal",

There are two ways for the price of bitcoin to grow, the first one is very simple, if the demand increases then the price of bitcoin will increase as well, as its supply is limited, and this by itself will not push the price of other items upwards.The second way in which this could happen is if there was hyperinflation all over the world, and if that were to happen the price of bitcoin could in a way become irrelevant, and instead what it will matter is how much you can buy with it, this is the scenario you often hear about, however I really think that in that case the price of bitcoin will move up faster than inflation, and that is because at the time what people need is a way to protect their wealth, and they will be willing to pay a premium so you decide to sell your bitcoin to them.",

That's the scary thing because I'm sure that when that price hits, there's bound to be a lot of people that will probably sell their bitcoins at that price and with the expected high tx fees and those people that are going to do some transactions at that aren't going to be paying a big chunk of their bitcoin for the fee and the miners will definitely have a cause for celebration again as they're the one that's going to benefit in all of this which is awesome because they do deserve it and the rewards are only going to get lower in the future.
