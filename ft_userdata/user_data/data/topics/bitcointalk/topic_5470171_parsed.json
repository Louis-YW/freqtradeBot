Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was once also in one article on a crypto site demanding regulation in which crypto could also be their domain.SEC,  FSOC, and CFTC have to make it clearer which of them is really going to regulate crypto. I guess all of them have thier own grand plan to have a grip on this industry, they got to take taxes. The problem is that crypto is borderless and US doesn't own the biggest CEX.Quote from: bittraffic on February 08, 2023, 04:08:42 PMMore regulatory bodies are trying to fight over which of them will supposedly regulate crypto.

I wonder if there is a reason to why they do this method.At times spammer moves make no sense to me at all.Apart from joining the signature campaign, bitcointalk members can make money in other ways too like by in participating games and round sections, and free raffles for that they need to have certain criteria and mostly minimum activity and post numbers. Probably some accounts are farmed for that since signature campaigns become an impossible task for the spammers.@OP, Newbies will be nuked if they found spamming so an effective tool to fight them is Report to moderator feature.",

They spam their links everywhere they can in automated/semi-automated/even manual ways because they somehow think that would make their websites more relevant/popular.
