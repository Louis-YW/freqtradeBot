Geophphreighyou may have missed the posts - this project was scrapped entirely. the 4 winners were given or should have been given the option to convert their purchase to a 1kg mini MHC made from silver - he shared that on another thread as well. The cost was higher as well - I opted for and received my .05 back when he presented the offer to me.here it is:Quote from: BitcoinPenny on November 13, 2023, 08:32:19 PMQuote from: tldr-hodl on November 13, 2023, 08:24:41 PMWait what?? I can wait, but nobody told me it's been cancelled altogether?! And I've paid for mine...Don't worry. We've had to put few projects on hold until the start of the year, and this is one of them. We considered the possibility of issuing refunds to the 4 customers (and we still can, if one wished) and canceling the project, since it runs similar to another project that has been in the works for well over a year and is almost ready to reveal (finally!), but we decided to continue the project and just release at the start of our 10th year. But Mopar is right, we had considered canceling the project at one point recently. However, we decided against it.Thanks again, everyone.Regards,Chris@TBPCo.and as I read it, he is actually saying it was not cancelled... He told me it was and that I could get a refund or have it credited towards the silver MHC. I think I would have to pay .065 additional - with all the delays, I was not wanting to send more funds so I got the refund.So, I was wrong and it appears this project was not scrapped. I did get a refund - I do not know about the 3 other winners.",
