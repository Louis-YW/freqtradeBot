  "content": "Anyone can become a blockchain node provider in the Bitcoin network. All you need to do is to download and install software from the official Bitcoin website. Besides free public nodes, the Bitcoin network has BTC nodes which are not available to everyone. These are cryptocurrency nodes that are employed by exchanges, digital currency exchange services, wallet sites and other infrastructure projects. Additionally, the Bitcoin network contains cryptocurrency nodes that operate through hidden protocols such as Tor along with the implementations of crypto nodes in various programming languages. Nbitcoin implementation is written in C#), btcd is written in Go, bitcoind in C++, and bcoin in Node.js. Moreover, there are hardware cryptocurrencies nodes such as Casa, Lux Node, myNode, Lightning In A Box – the devices that only process transactions on the Bitcoin network.What information is checked by free blockchain nodes?The full BTC node checks all transactions in the block for correct signatures. Afterwards, the public node checks how many blocks have been created by Bitcoin and whether the blocks and transactions are displayed in the correct format. The full BTC node should also check that there is no double-spending of the same funds in a blockchain. With a full BTC node system, \"light\" nodes can accept transactions, putting a complete check on full crypto nodes. Besides, a number of full BTC nodes confirm the transaction independently of each other. Owing to this system of free blockchain nodes Bitcoin digital currency remains decentralized and protected from hacker attacks.How to Connect to Bitcoin?Here's a useful video guide which may help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujrvv-ztVjc&t=3s",

Confirmation is the process of including a transaction in a block and mining it that can only be done by miners.Your whole explanation of how nodes work is a little weird though.",

Not the ones running on Raspberry Pi (it's not exactly user-friendly), but if someone created a device that you could just connect to an Ethernet port and power on, as if it were some mobile router, then that would be very cool.",

Its like arm without the licensing and the industry is investing heavy in it, quite soon your phone and many other embedded devices will be running in this instead. I suppose nvidia will keep a hold in arm so for gpu things maybe, but i have already seen risc-v boards with nvidia ai acceleration chips in them so...If you haven't seen it, take a look at this video that explains it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhl9Rgu8HS4",

In regards to the bolded above, my response to that is if it's not available to everyone then it's absolutely not part of the Bitcoin Network. They are just things that depend on Bitcoin Network to survive. And Bitcoin can survive without them.So special care must be taken not to merge them with the Bitcoin Network unless they are according to the Bitcoin principles.",
