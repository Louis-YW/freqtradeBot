But then again, rumours.Crypto.com was in the news today as they had moved around 400 million of their money that showed that the money was not in cold wallets as they did promise to their customers but it was in hot wallets thus it is advisable to remove and withdraw any coin anyone might have on this platform.I just read the news now in this link.Again these are rumors but the fact that they moved around 82% of their Eth reserves to a wallet linked to Gate.io adds to this drama.https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/cryptocom-native-token-plummets-as-ftx-collapse-fuels-contagion-fears-2942505",

      "body": "to clarifyFTX.us and FTX international was not the largest firm based on customer numbers. its said that there are under 1.2m creditors/customers combined (some say under 200k in just the international part)where as coinbase for instance supposedly has 60m customers..but FTX international customers are not the normal users of 'minnow'' trade amounts/volume.. FTX.us/ftx international was a low user number but of large whale volume/investment amount(however math suggest 1.2m customer in a portfolio of $10b-$50b is only $10k-$50k average invested in the FTX portfolio per user)these whales did include the likes of binance and even kevin o'leary(sharktank) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxEFYqbOchcmany businesses (not small citizen level investors) had money in FTX international.so we could see some knock on affect of other businesses.. many people have been shouting about a binance downfall.. but binance  stepped out of its investment before the rug got pulled. i can understand other investors would be mad that binance jumped before telling them.. and then going public before telling fellow investors. but i dont see binance breaking due to FTX, they got out early and safeFTX is sister of DCG which is mother of coinbase, paxos, greyscale and multiple other exchanges. i feel they got their profits/stake out months ago too because SBF was buddy buddy with DCG ceo (however i could be wrong)..we may actually see scenarios of companies/exchanges not collapsing but using this event to rubber stamp their fiat accounting to do a \"paper loss\" as their tax avoidance methods on the profits they actually achieved earlier in the year",

FTT thunderstorm, who will be next? Does it even matter who will be next? Any of the large and mid-sized CEXs that find themselves in serious trouble will cause disruptions in the crypto market. And I don't know why you call CZ a hero? Maybe because he was only apparently trying to save the company that started to sink, but in fact at the same time he was just cutting ties with it so that there would be as little damage as possible for his company.Apart from that, is there anything serious about someone doing due diligence in 24 hours and saying that he changed his mind because the results are not satisfactory? Such things last for weeks or months and are not carried out in one day, so I would conclude that it is one thing to play the hero, and quite another to be the hero.",

We know DeFi 2.0 was very hot since 2020 but most  of us did not realize a fact behind DeFi 2.0. It is a perfect tool for Ponzi activities and it make Ponzi operations are more easily and it covers the truth about Ponzi activities by using a term DeFi.If we think deeply, we would ask answers like where are money come from for DeFi platforms? And where are money for them to pay to users in staking profit, in annual percent yields?It is clearly a ponzi model and APY is not real. You can not get that promised APY by staking your cryptocurrency in one year long. Your cryptocurrency will very likely lose its value, even in bull market and not restricted in bear market.",

However, CEXs have provided an ease and liquidity of exchange that has driven the price of Bitcoin from pennies to tens of thousands of dollars. As we have seen this year, however, in many cases these platforms, in addition to artificially pumping shitcoins and shittokens, have relied on leverage and fractional reserve, which is what Satoshi intended to avoid when he created Bitcoin.To think about what would happen if they did not exist I think it is not worth spending much time because they will continue to exist, but I think that from now on it will be with much stricter regulations, and we will see what implications this has for the Bitcoin that I fear will be in line with what the EU has in mind: more KYC everywhere, even trying to force hardware wallets to implement it,",

While I agree that we should be exposing frauds and those practicing mismanagements to the detriment of the people who believe on them, speculations can also be hurting those which are doing the right way. In the past, brands and businesses were wiped out due to uncontrolled speculations and rumor around them...with many became victims of circumstances rather than the making of their own. But since we can never stop rumor and the short sellers, all platforms involved with cryptocurrency should now start to be transparent and to provide the market with Proof-of-Reserve which Binance is now championing - which has a little irony on it but can be a big signature of CZ - so as to stop unfounded speculations that they can be the next in line to the chopping board. Right now, we don't know what can happen with the crypto industry after the smoke is gone but we are all hoping that this latest big debacle will only serve to make it much resilient and stronger into the future.",

There is a way that could be stopped, and that way is regulation. As long as SEC requires all these companies to show their reserves, meaning all of the money should be watched, and blockchain allows this to be even more public, just put all of the wallets and addresses out in the open, or if not open at least give the names to SEC, which means that they will be able to actually see it and calculate if all is okay.With all these people also be tracked, CEO for starters, but everyone else.
