  "content": "Today marks the 4.5th anniversary of the Merit Cycling Club, and on this admittedly arbitrary occasion, I am pleased to announce that both GazetaBitcoin and fillippone have proved themselves worthy of promotion to fully-felched fledged Merit Cycler with the full pay and privileges that that position bestows. Congratulations. Image copyright 2023 Foxpup. Model is over 18 years of age.(Now with a new image host free of Cloudflare's bullshit.)I can also assure everyone that this decision was based on wholly objective criteria and was in no way influenced by any ðŸ¦Š NSFW under the table shenanigans. ðŸ¦Š (To be clear, I'm not necessarily denying that such shenanigans took place, only that they influenced my objective decision making.)Local rules: You know how this works by now. No *phobic disparagement of my fox hole, no matter how infamous it has become at this point.",
