Everything, exclusively everything depends on you. How skilled you are, how disciplined you will be and how dedicated you will be to the whole job.Judging by what and how you write, I would rather say that you are a beginner than an experienced trader. In that case, you certainly cannot rely only on income from the trade, because there are no guarantees and you have a long learning way ahead of you. The moment you are ready to be independent and rely only on your trading skills, trust me you will not need this kind of advice from anyone.",

You can only answer this question yourself. Have you been trading for like a year and able to earn 70% or more, more than losing? If yes, you can try it. If you are trading with just little amount of money, do not quit your job. If you are trading with high amount because you are a professional now and earning, you can quit your job. If you have your own job as a means of additional income you can quit your job. Do not trade with the amount that is too high that can result to bankruptcy of trading fund. Assuming you have $100000, just use $5000 for trading.If you are a beginner, do not quit your job.",

We have heard this before, there are beginner traders in 2017 wherein they thought that they can just make huge money on trading because that time we are in a bull run. So not sure what happen to those who resign from their regular job and solely focus on bitcoin trading.Because as we all know, market is very volatile, it could be a day that you make money but possible that you can lose more in the long run. So very difficult in the beginning, and if you don't have experience, then it's better to just take it easy, in my opinion.",

Better save up for your white collar work and keep at it instead of resigning to trade. I am going to tell ya that it's going to be a mess once you started trading Bitcoin. I did day trade back in the days just like the story I mentioned in every trading related discussion and believe me that you'll be hella exhausted at the end of the day and it ain't just worth it. It's possible like examplens mentioned, but it is going to be a sloppy experience for ya. You could do trading as a side income as long as is it not breaching your contract in the company you're working at. If your 9-5 is not really paying well, it might be better to just job hop.Quote from: Yaunfitda on May 05, 2023, 11:59:36 AMFor me it's going to be hard if you are just going to rely on bitcoin trading as your sole source of income.

You cannot quit your white-collar work and solely rely on trading because you are new to trading and possibly bitcoin altogether. It has both terrible and beneficial effects, and if you're unprepared, they could cause you to lose all of your riches. You say you're still young, so I'll give you some advice: take things easy, pay more attention to your job, and learn how to trade progressively before you become an expert trader and decide whether or not to rely entirely on trading as a source of income.",

The funny thing about trading is, it seems easy. You buy low, and sell high. In reality it is very difficult. Now, since you are asking us, I assume you don't have (or you have very limited) experience in trading. Then the answer is don't quit your job.

With Bitcoin, you should start with investment that means holding it long time to take profit. To hold your bitcoins and don't be liquidated, margin called, self shake your hands, you must invest with your own money, not borrow money from someone to do that.If you start with trading, you will take big risk and very possibly you will end with failure, debt and your life will not be easy.Only trading if you have profit from investment and after have a few years in this market especially after you experience two years of Bitcoin bear market in its market cycle which is 4 years.",

I'll just remind you that even if you can spend 24/7 in front of a trading terminal, what you get daily is absolutely not guaranteed. I'd not rely on such a volatile income regardless of how good I am at doing that, I doubt any big traders do the same thing. You can probably start acting that way if you can spend a thousand dollars easily and never going to get into trouble even if you lose everything. Heck, some professional traders/brokers get paid to trade. If your job is quite decent, save some money and use that money to buy BTC every month or just do a weekly trade or something similar. The profit might be smaller but it will save you from stressing over a miss in 1% pump every day.",

If you're fortunate, you'll encourage others to follow your example, but if you're not, you'll be the one telling them not to try it because it is unreliable.",
