  "content": "Hello, I am not a US citizen and am willing to buy a privacy.com account.I already bought a US phone number but privacy.com also asks about bank login and password; however, I think once the account is verified, one can use other funding methods as well like a credit card to use. So anyone here who can sell a privacy.com account or can verify bank for me?",
