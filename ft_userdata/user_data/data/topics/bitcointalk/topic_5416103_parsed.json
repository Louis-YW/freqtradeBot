In order to sell something someone have to buy it. But what happens if there are no buy order at $2000.On most exchanges, the order type is limit order by default. If bitcoin is at $20000 and you place a sell order at $2000. As you want to sell at lower price, the market would be filled at $20000 immediately, which is the market price of bitcoin.Edit:Let me explain it betterBitcoin at $20000 for instanceIf you want to buy anything at higher price, people will want to sellIf you want to sell at lower price, people will want to buyBuying bitcoin, the order would be filled at exact or higher bitcoin price (the price you set)Selling bitcoin, the order would be filled at exact or lower bitcoin price (the price you set)Assuming bitcoin is at $20000, you want to buy and place to order at $19999 or lower, no one would want to sell. Order will not be filled. Assuming bitcoin is at $20000, you want to buy at $20000 or higher. The order would be filled immediatelyAssuming bitcoin is at $20000, you want to sell, and place order at $20001 or higher, no one will want to buy. Order will not be filled.

Strange question since we're talking about bitcoin but I cannot say the same for other cryptos.

Check my explanation above.My answer is based on the hypothetical situation which is the zero-buy order mentioned in the OP. It won't happen because it's bitcoin and volume or the buy orders for this coin in all real exchanges is already high.

      "body": "It would work only in spot trading but in P2P like on Binance if you sell 1btc there many buyers will buy it.It is not the same in the spot market when you accidentally set a sell order lower than the current selling price then it will be filled only with the current price, not the price you set lower than the current selling price.This only works on limit/market order but if you set it to stop limit or other types of order it won't be filled immediately instead it will wait until the selling price you set is reached.If you are trading on Binance they already have a better explanation about these types of order don't be afraid all you want to learn is already on Binance beginners guide here https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/binance-beginner-s-guide",

These buys happen so fast that one it goes live on the platform it's almost always certain that it gets sold too. Ever wonder why there are some flash crashes on one exchange but it is not found elsewhere? This is what usually happens, though it's not common due to a lot of traders relying mostly on bots nowadays but it still happens sometimes.",

So it will fill at the best bid as long as it’s higher than $2000. So most likely it’ll fill at like $19999.90 since Bitcoin has great liquidity. It’s not a bad question.

This is a fundamental mistake in trading so always trade in a sober mind without getting drunk or panicking, just one small mistake will make you regret not in time.Because you sell only one bitcoin but if you sell in large amount of bitcoins and below market price it is called market dumping. Once the market panics, many will accept to sell bitcoin at or below the market price to cut losses. This is how the market falls.",

In order to sell something someone have to buy it. But what happens if there are no buy order at $2000.Forgive me if i say something wrong. I didn't try it on exchanger because of the fear of losing money.I am assuming it's an order book exchange and it's a limit order.So this is the advantage of the limit order. When any person places a limit buy order it means he is ready to buy upto that price of that asset in this case let's say 20k which means he won't even pay a penny more than that but is ready to agree for anything less as well, similarly when you place a sell order you are ready to sell at a minimum of 20k not a penny less than that but obviously ready to sell more than that if someone agrees. Now suppose you put sell at 2000, the order book will try to find the person who is ready to pay the highest for your asset but anything not less than 2000. So eventually it will take the person ready to pay the highest in order book which will be around the current market price only. So you won't end up losing anything it will act more like a market order. People saying anything other than this have never traded on Order Book exchanges",

So even if you make such hilarious mistake it won't get confirmed and an error message will pop upWhat are those exchanges that you've tried it on spot and said an error?If you're on spot, it's just the same as with binance that you'll have to set a price and if someone peeks out and saw your price set at the lowest then they'll quickly snatch that.Check it again maybe that's not really the exact thing that will happen if you put an order at a mistaken price and the lowest.

Already many have explained in above about it , that  because of your lower sell order . Don't make this type of mistake otherwise you have to face loss and you  will never get your fund back.This might not be the case. If you sold at a lower price, all the buy offer from $20k below will be filled and losing $18k might not be the correct amount. You will surely lose a lot of money but not to the extent of losing $18k. Remember there's a support level which limit the seller from dumping their Bitcoin easily, technically $2k price might not happen not unless you sold a lot of your Bitcoin but with this case, it will not affect that much.",

There are all aspects you need to consider when you go for exchange trading When the market is within 20000 dollars, if you forget to order a thousand dollar order for $2000, your order will be automatically sold.Although you would think people order that low, you notice that people order even lower than that.Correct your misconceptions so that no one makes such a mistake.",
