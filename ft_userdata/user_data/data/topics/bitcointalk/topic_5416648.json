  "content": "Today the Study Budget for 2023 was delivered for Portugal.And with the novelty of cryptoassets (coins, NFTs and the like) they are now taxed at 28%.  But, there is a \"good\" but!  This fee will only be on the capital gains of crypto-assets “held for a period of less than one year”. Profits made by crypto assets obtained for more than 365 days are exempt from taxation.The main points are:QuoteThe main novelty concerns the gains obtained with crypto-assets held for less than a year, as is the case with the profits generated by the sale of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The regime, which is similar to that of shares, implies that taxpayers have to declare these operations and pay a 28% IRS tax, or opt for aggregation.If the assets are held for more than one year, these earnings are exempt. On this point, the proposal's articles clarifies that, for this count, the holding period of crypto assets acquired before the date of entry into force of the new regime is also accounted for.Still in terms of the IRS, the Government proposes “the taxation of income from operations with crypto-assets such as business and professional income”. Here, other activities are included, such as cryptocurrency mining and cryptocurrency issuance.The budget will now be debated in parliament and then it will have to be approved.Since the government has an absolute majority, it will certainly pass. Of course, there may still be some adjustment regarding these measures.Source (in PT): https://eco.sapo.pt/2022/10/10/ganhos-com-criptomoedas-detidas-por-menos-de-um-ano-vao-pagar-28-em-irs/",

I find this to be a fair tax, as many countries have close to 20% income tax that you pay regardless of whether you're a holder or a trader. What would you rather have? 28% if you sell in less than a year, or 20% flat tax without exceptions?",

That is currently 822 euros ($798), so the minimum monthly income for digital nomads would be around 3,288 euros.https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/portugal-e2-80-99s-new-digital-nomad-visa-just-made-working-remotely-from-a-european-beach-easier/ar-AA12NjO9Spain also recently implemented a similar digital nomad VISA program.I would guess countries like puerto rico are having success as popular financial safe havens for americans migrating abroad. Enough so that european nations are implementing measures to emulate their success.",

This means they fully accept crypto and consider this as legal tender right?  This could be a good start of a mass adoption and having that tax can be good at some point, though holding longer can always be a good benefit for the investors. Some countries really have a huge tax with cryptocurrency, we’re still lucky that our country is still a tax free for a crypto profit, regulations might begin to strict though as many banks started to show their interest with crypto.",

So they would hardly create a tax below 28% for cryptocurrencies. The fact that this tax is only valid for capital gains realized in the year of purchase of the cryptocurrency, allows the person to hold without selling the currency, until that year passes.I think that was an adequate measure, for a country that until now was tax-free on crypto.Quote from: famososMuertos on October 10, 2022, 09:38:26 PMThat said Portugal has always been on the threshold of friendly zones, so to speak, I have been looking for what The Bitcoin Family (Taihuttu) think about this but I have not seen anything official.The matter is very recent, these measures were announced today, so it's normal that they haven't said anything yet.Another interesting point is that they must have Bitcoin with much more than a year in their wallet.

India has got this tax way higher than Portugal @ 30% tax. This is applicable for the long term holders and you just have to let it sit for a year and one just to pass on that incentive.So, basically if someone has sold bitcoin or other crypto and holds it for more than a year in a stable coin and later on converts into fiat.

I wasn't thinking of politicians and their servants, but of ordinary people who certainly wouldn't have anything against paying 0% tax, even if they had to wait for it for several years. When you look only at the differences within the EU when it comes to taxation and regulation of cryptocurrencies, then you see how many differences there are according to something that should be harmonized across the entire union.Slovenia is also a very friendly country towards cryptocurrencies, I think there is a topic about it in the Legal board, and from this year all crypto profits (for individuals) up to EUR 15 000 should be tax-free.",
