So if I purchase 2 times one unit of coins AAA  P1: AAA 1.0 for 2$P2: AAA 1.0 for 3$My avg price is 2.5$ || my total spend is 5$ || and say now one AAA value = 4$ then my total value on that position is 8$.Nice thing would be additional column with gain / loss per transaction comparing to current price. Nothing fancy, simple stats per transaction just nicely prepared. I've tried cointracker.io but it doesn't provide such details, at least free version. Any advice much appreciated.Thanks.",

I'm not sure because I haven't used their service for a while.I'd like to mention that on this forum we have a user called joker_josue who offers to make custom Excel files. He made me a portfolio tracker at my request and I'm very happy with it, he did it in a professional way and is very responsive. You can tell him exactly what you want, and you'll have a file that you can control yourself, without having to depend on an online service that might later become paying or simply offline.",

Blockfolio apps gives you this option list down all your purchase on specific date, price and total units of token. The app will give summary on you total loss or gain for that specific order based on the current price but ofc its data is very limited based on the token you are holding since it only supports cex and some dex. I’m not using it anymore but that what I’m using when I’m still tracking my tokens value before I switch to tradingview.Poocoin is the best tracker for me since it shows data of my buy price and current status of my previous order without doing an input manually the only downside is its just support BSC. Pros and cons I guess.",

I think I'm able to create excel file myself since I was using VBA (long time ago).  I might have been wrong but in the times when basically all the apps around us are trying to do everything (including thinking) for us functionality I mention, is close to be base expectation from a wallet. I guess I'm wrong  and here more then anywhere else thinking by yourself is still more like survivor skill  ... which is good !Thanks againM",

Not 100% sure if it's the best but it works really well for me. Best of luck.https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricinghttps://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation",
