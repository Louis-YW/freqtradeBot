I don't think it was that kind of attack, because I also faced this problem some days ago, although I was able to enter the forum in 20-30 seconds, here I see it takes 15 minutes.  I would say changing the browser might solve the Issue. Because when I was using chrome browser, I used to face this issue often. Now I use Brave browser, So far such problems have not occurred yet.",

Maybe you can change browser from TOR to other browser like Chrome, Mozilla or Brave.Usually TOR detected with browser have VPN access, you login access to Bitcointalk forum trough using abnormal IP or detected without using local IP, depend with you but I think little risk when accessing not only Bitcointalk forum but also exchange market account will give trouble later for account get freeze as abnormal activities IP login.",

      "body": "One problem with anti-bot checks, such as those provided by Cloudflare, is that they can be intrusive and disrupt the browsing experience for users. This can be especially problematic for users that are on older devices or on a slow connection. It is understandable that websites want to protect themselves from bot attacks, but it is also important to consider the user experience for legitimate visitors. So I think it may be helpful for administrators to review and optimize their anti-bot measures to minimize the impact on users.",
