Next time just drop a link or a picture to at least proof that what you are saying is the truth, are you currently using Nbminer? If yes send us a screenshot with your LHR graphic cards mining ETH with full hashrate unlocked.Not joking.¬† Go see for yourself or dont.¬† Doesnt matter to me‚Ä¶all my LHR are enjoying the boost. And you can read it for yourslf in the NBMiner thread on this which is literaly the post below this one currently.Yes its working, tested and confirmed, I am sure that Nicehash isn't behind this unlocking, I am suspecting Nvidia itself, this morning Nicehash release the news and its not even 24hours yet now Nbminer released LHR unlock, something they don't even bother about right from when LHR became a thing.probably nvidia last milking of GPUs before the bear market hits hard. Bitcoin ASICs were sold before bear market in the past, nvidia have adopted the strategy.",

For Nvidia, the most correct decision was to initiate a hack of the LHR algorithm before the end of Ethereum mining, but they probably did not expect that the price of Ethereum would decrease significantly",

I always bought nVidia GPU's but what if AMD is also hiding something like this from us? In the end nothing will change. People will buy the best GPU for their buck whether it is AMD or nVidia.And don't look at intel. They have been placing spyware in your CPU's for the NSA for a long time.",
