The exchange will list both ether and the forked token, currently termed ETHW. A futures product for the new token will be launched in August, allowing investors to bet on prices.Take a look at the source: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/05/justin-sun-backs-ethereum-hard-fork-as-merge-approaches/In a fork, you should have the same amount of coin you have before the fork, but the value of the coin probably will be less, like BTC and Bitcoincash for example",

Then the Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin sv fork. Then with Ethereum it was, ETH with ETC and so on.Since so many miners want to continue making money mining they will try and support the POW fork of ETH.

ETH fees are cheap now but in the past you had to pay like $50 to do a single usdt transfer. So many used Tron for that. There is the Omni on Bitcoin which is also cheap but long wait times. Hence why Tron is very useful.",
