  "content": "We usually prioritize how keeping our keys safe and personal is crucial for the safety of our coins, but how can the visually impaired keep safe something that they cannot see. The entire thought of it is very disheartening that it may even be discouraging for any of such a person if after managing to agree to be a part of crypto, they now hear that they may never be able to secure their crypto. What can we suggest to these individuals (the visually impaired) who have an interest in bitcoins and crypto so that they don't loose interest?  Have you met any visually impaired individual in crypto, how do they manage to go about with it?",

I will not advice noncustodial wallet because the person still trust someone to help him keep the coins, noncustododial should be trustless and not suitable for visually impaired person. I will not suggest exchanges, regardless of anything, exchanges should be avoided.",

They can use the abundance of screen readers and other accessibility software that is available on all major operating systems. Generally, if these see any text, or input controls anywhere, the screen readers pronounce it out loud (with the exception of passwords, but I'd assume that people already invented a method to deal with that - at least for Windows passwords at first. Perhaps a braille keyboard for english letters). I don't see the problem here?",

They have their organization of massage therapists. I noticed someone when my mother once took me with her when she availed of their service, that one of them, despite his disability, is a fan of technology, and is the geek type. I saw that he was using a smartphone even though he was completely blind, I just didn't know what to call the software he was using, maybe a screen reader or text-to-speech tool and I admired him. But I just don't know if he also knows about cryptocurrency, it's been a long time, a few years ago.So today, I searched the internet to see how there are people like this who are interested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I read this story of Michael Staffen, he also had a visual impairment and he was one of the supporters of Bitcoin in 2014, Bitcoin-QT was the wallet he used then and he said he couldn't do anything because he only used a screenreader, he couldn't even access like send/receive a coin, fortunately, he has a sister who is also a Bitcoin enthusiast who helps him. It was also mentioned that he was hired by Coindesk to be a beta tester who will make the wallet usable for those like him, the wallet referred to here is MultiBit, but as far as I know, it was deprecated in 2017. I also found nothing news about him.Bitcoin 'Needs to be More Accessible for the Visually Impaired'Quote\"Most people want to make it accessible, probably including the developers – they just haven't considered it. That's one of the problems around accessibility: It's not that people intentionally exclude others. It's also up to [people with disabilities] to make noise.\"",

If they lose their card, their online banking account, forget their logins, etc., there are ways to help them. If they make the same mistake when sending Bitcoin or storing their private information, there is no one to turn to due to the nature of the system.",

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be that much work done in general for visually impaired people. There are small and abandoned works such as the bitcoin paper in Braille, some small work done by Multibit wallet which was forgotten after the wallet itself died. There also appears to have been a hardware wallet called IcyWallet that was supposed to use voice commands and Braille to help the visually impaired after the developer saw a reddit post but its website doesn't open anymore: https://icywallet.com/Others are generally using screen readers which sometimes don't work on bitcoin wallets like Electrum and cause some problems.",

Well in my experience when open source software lacks a certain functionality it is either because the developers are very busy with other things that means they don't have enough time for said features or in most cases there is little to no demand for that feature. For example we have to see issues being opened in each of these project's repositories and then receive some support for the dev to implement it. So far there has been a handful of requests that mostly went unnoticed which shows very low demand hence low priority.",

Actually you are right but if they have some offered to develop or in an agreement to create and improve something for that particular feature then they will have time for that no matter what regardless of the demand or little to none since probably those guys are the one who will make some marketing or introduce that for attracting users and those who are need the platform.",
