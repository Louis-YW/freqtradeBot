So the minimum 300$ sounds fishy (and greedy).Of course, there can be done tricks like issuing the cards on others' names, but that is also risky, possibly illegal, and clearly overly expensive.",

But they seem to be region limited, and the rates are worse then the other cards that do need some form of KYC.I guess a lot comes back to location. I can get $100 Visa cards from Egifter for $105.99 but it's US only. I vaguely remember some provider in Canada having the same things with CAD value.Kind of funny since I can go to just about any convenience store / drug store / food store here in the US and get up to a $500 VISA / MC / AMEX gift card for cash and nobody gives a shit.....Order it online and get a free anal probe......-Dave",
