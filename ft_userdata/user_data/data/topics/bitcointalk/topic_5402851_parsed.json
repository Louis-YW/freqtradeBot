  "content": "Hi all, I would like to share how I store my ledger nano 24 words seed phrase. Please let me know if there is any flaw in my method. Also please share your ways of keeping your 24 words safe so everyone can gain some knowledge on keeping crypto safe.I wrote them on a microsoft word on my laptop and put the microsoft word in three encrypted USB sticks. Then I keep three USB sticks in three separate locations. In a safe, car, and somewhere in my house. Even if someone has the encrypted USB stick they still won't be able to open it as it's password protected. The only thing that worried me a bit is when writing on the microsoft word on my laptop. Will the laptop memorizes the microsoft word and keep it somewhere in my laptop that I don't know of? Thanks, guys.",

You might've been better off using notepad for this since it won't have anything that remembers the words you typed for its dictionary. It is unlikely anything detectable has been saved and if you use word a lot it might have already relearnt some of those words enough times and removed their original meaning.",

Even if someone has the encrypted USB stick they still won't be able to open it as it's password protected. Why using bug filled hackable microsoft word file format, when you can simply use simple text file?!I would personally never use any digital files for storing seed words, even if they are encrypted, because I don't want to leave any traces behind.On top of that, if password is not strong it can easily be hacked or you can forget it, if you didn't write it on some paper or in password managers.Human brain and memory is a very fragile thing and I would not trust it as a long term storage space.",

Not even if you have an accident, severe head trauma, or suffer from memory loss?  Or even aging, depending on how long you plan on keeping your coins in cold storage.  Believe me, memory doesn't get better with age--and you do make a good point about things that can go horribly wrong.  I'd never rely on a human brain in lieu of something like a metal plate with a seed phrase stamped or engraved onto it.Has anyone read Bitcoin Billionaires by Ben Mezrich?  It's a great read, and it describes in detail how the Winklevoss twins stored the private keys to their first big bitcoin purchase.  It involved laptops with wifi adapters removed, the subsequent smashing of the laptops with a sledgehammer, and the twins traveling to several banks spread across the US to put separate pieces of the keys into safety deposit boxes.  They were kind of maniacal about the security of their bitcoin, and I'd say they were smart about it too.  That doesn't help the rest of us who don't have the resources to do all of the things the twins did, though.  I'd stick with my suggestion above and use something metal to stamp/etch/engrave whatever you have for a private key on.  At the very least write it down on paper and keep that paper secure.",

Use the exchanges for what they were intended - the exchange of cryptocurrencies. After that, withdraw your funds to a wallet whose keys only you control. You don't control what happens to a centralized exchange. You don't even have a wallet there, you have an account. The account is yours, but the wallets are theirs. An exchange can go bankrupt, be hacked, or exit scam. They can freeze your coins for any reasons such as the suspicion of illegal activities, change in regulatory framework, loss of trading licenses for your country, etc. The end result is a temporary or permanent loss of coins depending on what exactly happened. Cold storage, hardware wallets, even software wallets... everything is better than storing crypto on an exchange.",

They're honeypots for hackers, they're are businesses that may go bankrupt, or because some changes in the legislation or whatever they can deny your access to your money.But as long as you have your funds split, as long as the exchanges don't keep for you lifechanging amounts, they can also be a convenient option.Probably the bigger the funds, the more copies and splits may be needed.

If someone is investing a good amount, why wouldn’t they spend less than $100 to secure the seed? I think this one is one of best methods to secure the seed.",

      "body": "There seems to be a lot of seriousness around right now. Most of us recommend the Ledger Nano S as a long-term storage device. You don't need to worry about going with another option, and the extra bucks are actually worth it. You should get a better one if you don't have one of these. In light of the amount of storage you have, it's a small investment.  How should I store or where should I store it? Definitely avoid to use microsoft word or any Internet-connected systems. With just a tap on the side button, you can double-check and confirm every transaction by connecting to any computer (USB). But, How long can we avoid such internet connections?",
