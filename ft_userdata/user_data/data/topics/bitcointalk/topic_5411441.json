      "body": "Great mate nice work. But let me add this.Here is still Bitcoin talk forum and in as much as a good general advice is great but channeling you post more to the forum with explanations is best.Like for me personally coming up the ranks here in the forum time management has been key.# makes you meet up with post in time (the most interesting time to be part of a post conversation is early, you get to learn more then many times after that is filled up with spams)And if you are the busy type outside the forum you can still channel you time management in the forum according to your schedule, I like to be in the forum at the end of the day and having an alarm set for this has made me try to be online as often as I can, also the telegram notification can be of help to.",
