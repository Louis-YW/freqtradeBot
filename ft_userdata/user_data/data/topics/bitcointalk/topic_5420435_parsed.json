They have 16k+ and 10k+ followers while zero or six followers and 30-40 re-tweets per account.obviously, all previous tweets have been deleted, as well as a massive unfollow. It seems to me that the accounts are hacked, if they are not, then they are completely fake with bot followers and are certainly worthless.I would like to see any tweets made by these accounts and their activity, likes, retweets, or comment. edit: almost forget, your trust page just confirms my suspicions about the reliability of your offer.",
