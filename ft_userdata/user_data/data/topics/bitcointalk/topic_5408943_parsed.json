For example, if you know 10 words, you can test all combinations and find the 2 missing words. It's not that you can brute-force any seed phrase. A 12 word seed phrase generated by electrum provides 132 bits of entropy and it's secure enough.",

If only few words are missing (like 3 or 4 words) and you know their exact position, then recovering the seed using a good tool is possible. The more you remember the faster the tool will find your seed. Once it finds it, you can use it to recover your wallet and you will have full access to your coins.I've seen many reputable members recommending BTCRecover, so I believe it's safe.",

Python is notoriously slow for loops and there are faster implementations out there. Depending on your type of loops or iterations, the actual rate will probably be far less than a couple of million per seconds.There are actually tons of bottlenecks to be considered when you are bruteforcing seed phrases. First of all, you have to consider that various key stretching functions are used in the various steps of the process which slows it down significantly, because they are far more intensive than just generating random 12 word phrases. You are unlikely to really achieve speeds anywhere near feasible.The other notable bottleneck is trying to find the addresses with any transaction history or funds. You have to get a set of all of the used addresses on the blockchain and search through it which involve both storage and computational complexity when you are searching thousands or billions of seeds per second.",

However, you have correctly demonstrated why we have a 12 word seed instead of a 3 word seed.A simple demonstration would be using the word list to randomly generate a 12 word seed and iterate through the permutations and determine the number of iterations it takes to find that exact set of 12 words. The problem is there are 2048^12 (5.4445179e+39) possible permutations of it. You need to iterate at a rate of (10^30) to be able to find a seed in 5 centuries. That would be a factor of 21 over a billion, which is impractical, especially given that we established that the overheads makes this a very inefficient process.",
