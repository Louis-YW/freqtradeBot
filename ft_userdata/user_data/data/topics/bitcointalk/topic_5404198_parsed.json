      "body": "This is one of the good reasons to use a noncustodial (private key) wallet, if the coin receiver uses a private key wallet he would be able to recover the coin as nc50lc commented about it already. But it can be difficult if the receiver uses an exchange address because he (the receiver) has no private key and will not be able to recover the coin unless the exchange recover it for him. In this later case, the receiver can contact the customers care of the exchange if an exchange is used.",
