  "content": "BTC price battles 200-week moving average after $930M Tesla Bitcoin saleThe market has been on the rise since sone days ago, now on the news that Tesla bitcoin sale is affecting bitcoin market price to be decreasing. I remember the time when the market was very buslish and any whales that buy bitcoin resulted to a great price rise. Also a time of the Chinese crypto crack down FUD and when Elon Musk announcement of Tesla not accepting bitcoin payment anymore, the price downturn was greate. I do not know why this time should be linked to Tesla that sold 75% of their bitcoin holding. The amount sold is large but no significant effect.Elon Musk is anti bitcoiner and supporting just doge coin, people were thinking that this will happen, that Tesla will sell their bitcoin holding, it could be because of business reasons or a way to manipulate the market in the future, but it was good that Elon Musk sold this coin and not having significant effect on the market.I do not know why the news are bringing this up, no significant effect at all.",

When we read most of the headlines today, it turns out that Bitcoin suffered a massive blow below the belt because one man no longer believes in it - and the truth is that he stopped believing in Bitcoin even when he declared it a danger to the environment without even understanding what he was talking about.On the other hand, this is another good day for those who for some reason do not like Bitcoin or want it to fail, but Bitcoin has long outgrown being dependent on one person, so their joy will be very short.",

Of course, some needs more time to understand that's old news.Also.. we're still in bear market; I've said it not long ago that the recent rise can very well be just a bull trap.And somebody has also said something interesting: literally anything can trigger the next sell off (not as news, but as pretext). Is it  the case? I don't know. We'll see.We need more patience until we're sure the bear market is over.PS. It was a big surprise for me that Tesla did buy high and sell low. I've been expecting them be smarter.",

He's lost alot and the fear to loss gives way to more losses..maybe,when the WHALES gets to sink in alot and bitcoin bids for the top chart, he's just gonna realise that wasn't smart Sandra",
