And during that time most of the developed coins and exchanges have been fallen. Only few survived so there's no telling what happens in next 10 years or if cryptos are a thing in 50 years. They could be replaced with totally different and more elegant solution we haven't thought about. 100 years is a marketing gimmick. Most likely it will be rugged in a week.",
