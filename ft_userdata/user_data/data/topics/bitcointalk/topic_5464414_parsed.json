The screenshot I am going to share is from a Twitter user who shared his story of how a betting shop operator stopped him from betting after he noticed that he was placing bets on games every day for one week. The bet operator suspected that he was addicted to gambling. This is very commendable. from the bet operator who is educated on the symptoms of gambling addiction. If you were in the narrator's shoes, would you take a break from gambling despite knowing that you are not addicted, or would you patronize another betting shop?",

      "body": "There might be a few bookies who would do that, but it isn't ideal for many. The issue at hand is that bookies or sports betting agents are aiming for higher profitability. This implies that the more bets they attract, the more money they stand to gain. In my opinion, the phrase \"gamble responsibly\" should be sufficient to caution bettors, and if they choose to disregard it, the consequences are theirs to bear.I don't oppose shops advising individuals to quit gambling if they identify someone displaying signs of addiction. However, what if they encounter a multitude of gamblers who are already ensnared by addiction? Will their sole responsibility then be to tell these people to cease their activities?",

According to what I know, bookmaker are directly interacting with gamblers online and this can not be helpful for gamblers than to be using little amount of money and to gamble responsibly.",

Most people that come to bet with him are likely from the same street where is gambling shop is. He will likely know some of the people that comes and bet with him and he will know if someone among them is getting addicted. But in the country that I am, there is nothing like that even if you use all your life to bet, that is your own cup of tea.",

I wouldn't be surprised if one of their regulation is that they require gambling shops to spot gamblers that shows signs of gambling addiction and perform preventive measure, just like what the manager of the sport betting shop did.",

For me, it's like the Twitter user is promoting the shop with a made-up story just like every social media influencer does to make money for their living. I don't get how a casino employee can stop you from gambling there because he feels you are addicted.If it actually happened the casino or the shop would be sued for denying an individual right and its legally possible really if a shop thinks they should not come there every day then they should have a rule stating that.",

And if someone from the betting shop operators noticed, it was probably meant to warn gamblers that gamblers need to exercise self-control when losing streaks continue. And it would be even better if there were betting shops giving good advice or advice to excessive gamblers before resting them.And I think it's for the good of the gamblers, or maybe the betting shop doesn't want to be blamed when many gamblers are addicted because they often bet at the shop.and if it was me i would also quit and if i didn't feel addicted i would find another betting shop.",

If you look at it it’s a business and the main aim of them opening their shop is to make profit and for them to be able to do that they need people to patronize them and that will make them feel that if they tell any of their customers that their behaviors is becoming unusual that will discourage them from coming to their shop.But in the case the op presented, I feel they did the right but only if they delivered the message to the man in a very nice manager and not rudely and according to what the man wrote I don’t think he’ll be leaving that shop anytime soon since they have his health at heart and are not just interested in their profits alone.

They are after profit, except if they don't profit from him, however.He may have to expect the operator to make him stop especially if he wins every time and they can request this personally after all it's an offline operator. $10 is just not worth it for them which they often lose while him winning consistently.",

And if I had a gambling addiction, as the operator said, I would really seek help from the people around me and ask them to help me. But if I only play gambling, for example, once a day and play gambling every day for a week, it seems that this could be a sign that I have started to get addicted to gambling, and I must stop before it's too late.And I'm very grateful for the warning from the operator reminding me to stop gambling for a while. And we should have followed his advice instead of looking for another betting shop that would not have warned us. It was an unwise decision because we should have been able to rest for a while after playing gambling for a week. We can gamble again after the rest period and adjust the gambling schedule so we don't get a warning from the operator.",

I think an easy approach would have been more appropriate for the guy, I mean maybe the guy can handle himself already and he take responsibility in it.

This is the way it should be, no matter the advancement in technology not everyone are comfortable with online betting thats why some people prefer to visit bet shops so bet shop attendants can help reduce gambling addiction rate. If 10 shops can do the same that will be a total of 10 gambling addiction prevented. It should be their responsibility to look after their customers wellbeing and prevent addiction instead of being selfish and be concerned about their own personal gains.Quote from: Oshosondy on August 24, 2023, 11:50:03 AMIt was betting agent that stopped the gambler, not a bookmaker directly. According to what I know, bookmaker are directly interacting with gamblers online and this can not be helpful for gamblers than to be using little amount of money and to gamble responsibly. Never underestimate the power of an a conversation; it may not be as useful as you think but it has the capacity to completely alter a circumstance. We should always attempt to help others, no matter how small the help may appear, since you never know how much of an influence it may have on them. Some advise has the power to change a person's life.",
