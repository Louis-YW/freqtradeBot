  "content": "After being hesitant for years, I finally got out of my comfort zone and started testing the waters in futures trading. I had to admit though. I don't have any TA skills yet to make my own decisions. My good friend from Poland who is now based in Cebu, has his own trading signal. So he told me to give a try for now even with small amounts only. I'm fully aware of the risks though because it's much more riskier than the traditional spot trading. As of now, I got a bunch of wins and losses in my trades where most of the declarations are long due to the mini bull run that we are experiencing as of today. I am not expecting much results whether wins or losses, because I am still testing the waters. But still it's better for me to have a better understanding of the chart so that I could make my own decisions on the target amounts of a specific pairing to take profit and stop loss.Whether I take profit or got liquidated, it's worth the experience. But for now, I am not yet ready to go big on my trading capital because I need to be emotionally ready especially when things are going southward.",

Trading signals are scam. But be very careful and I can recommend you averaging, or just use low amount of money to trade because trading is very risky.",

I told him he could get into the bitcoin market right now with less than $1 while studying bitcoin movements and he finally gave it a go with $22 and less than $1 to buy.I advised him to enter during yesterday's correction and got his buy price at $22.7xx and when it dropped further down, he decided to buy again, which made his entry buy price lower than his previous entry buy price.And if you want to be able to trade well, you have to learn about market analysis to enter the market when the market is being corrected.",

Is that really working and helped you a lot or it's just the same as guessing a trade because it's inaccurate?Well, first, congratulations for trying it out. I've got no balls in doing it again because I don't want to experience the same burn that I've taken when I did it before.Just as what they say, you've get to learn more about analysis like TA, fundamental and the other strategy.",

It will save you a lot in a long run. Especially if you trade with high leverage.Remember that even if you are successful for weeks, does not mean you are good at trading and can go crazy with big bets. Some strategies works until market change its dynamic which can happened after weeks/months. I know people that double/tripled portfolio in few months just to go bust right after.",

On the other hand I tried the real thing as well for a while, with very small amounts like 100 bucks of course, but the results weren't as bad as the test, and yet it ended with bad result because of my bad management. I could have profited from it if I was more careful but I seen that investment as just a test and that is mostly the reason.

There's a good demand for futures trading recently even if its more risky compare to spot trading, some trader are very aggressive nowadays, I hope you won't be liquidated in futures.",

Well, it's petty simple then.Add your current revenues in case you would liquidate all your assets, I'm pretty sure a portfolio manager app could do that in a second and then compare with the results of purely holding Bitcoin. If your gains in $ are far larger than what you could have gained by simply holding BTC, or if with the alts you hold you could buy more coins then it means you did better than just holding. The problem in this that you have to look for is that the majority of your gains shouldn't be sourced from one single coin because that means you've simply gambled and one of the dark horses you picked won.That being said, trading signals, meh! It's more like those old pump and dumps groups, really hard next to impossible to trust one with more than peanuts.Quote from: Hamphser on February 08, 2023, 08:29:49 PMYou should test out waters self first on spot trading and it would be ideal on that way on which you are really that able to make enhance of your TA skills and i would really say that this would really be much betterEnhance the skills of seeing lines and dots where there are none to be seen?
