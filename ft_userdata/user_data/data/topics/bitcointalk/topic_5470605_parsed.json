This is a continuation of my previous post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5468812.0 in which I asked whether achieving an average annual return of 20% was considered good. There were several interesting comments, with some people saying it's a good return for spot trading, while others felt it's a very low return due to the high risk and volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Some mentioned that for a small capital, it might not be worth the effort for such a small gain. I'd like to address some of the points that came up in the post.**Risk Management:**The strategy divided my capital, and the  involves making multiple purchases as the price drops, averaging the cost, and selling when a certain profit-taking level is reached. In the Google Sheet I'll share, there's a sheet defining the risk and why I consider it a medium-to-low risk strategy.**Trading Operation:**My strategy is designed for Bitcoin, but it can work with other cryptocurrencies. I primarily use a 3-hour timeframe.**Time and Management:**You don't need to be in front of your computer all the time. Once I get a signal on TradingView, it sends a notification to the app and email with the quantity of BTC to buy and the price. Placing the buy limit and sell limit orders takes just one minute, which I find manageable for a 20% return.**Performance in 31 Days:**I've completed six trades, including both buying and selling. Over these 31 days, I've achieved a return of 1.91%, which translates to a daily return of 0.06%. Projected over a year, that would be 22.52%, but this can vary based on market behavior. It's important to note that this is in the spot market. Can it be done in futures? Yes, and with leverage (2x or 3x), you can easily reach 60% to 70% returns due to compound interest. However, I prefer the spot market as I see it more as a long-term investment.Here's the link to the spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TCRy0wyyBBvGvz8p2wEyB2RcslsJvZ9eN0gGrHWJOjo/edit?usp=sharing where you can see all the trades I've made, a screenshot of how the strategy operates on TradingView, and a sheet of risk.

Feel free to ask anything...In the first place, you don't really need to stay in front of the computer all day, because that depends on the timeframe you set up. Now, if your set-up is every 3 hours, that means every 3 hours that pass, there will be a new candle formation on the chart, either buy or sell. And the one left by the line on the candlestick is called the wick.With this strategy of trading, it is really necessary to understand that you really have to. It's really not possible for you to make unfounded predictions; that's the truth. So, if you earn even 0.5%, it will still be a profit. You will only see that there is no profit in your way if the profit you see is zero percent or below.",

I'd like to address some of the points that came up in the post.It is natural that not everyone will comment the same. Some people will support your 20% annual return considering its aspect and some people will not consider 20% return as the right return because of the additional risk of money. Two different ideas, but both are correct.  We should be satisfied with twenty percent out of 100%. If you have enough confidence in your trading skills then I think twenty percent is a lot of return. On the other hand, if $20,000 is invested, the return at the end of the year is only $2,000, so here I have risked $20,000, since I have risked money, this money could have been lost, so considering this, 20% is a bit less. 20% returns will be fine when you have full confidence in your trading strategy.",

It would be nice to get 22.52% over the entire year.I do not advise you to try this strategy on the future because the risks are high. It is true that profits can reach 60-70%, but the risks will also increase by a large percentage, so it is better to continue with spot trading in the long term with less risk.",

It's your way to trade - this means you choose the time management that fits to your life.and last but not least, you are on winning side. All you have to do is observing your returns and improve where necessary. For all people saying 20% is not much: Returns may grow exponential. If you keep your 0.06% daily you will have a multiplier of about 8.9 after 10 years (calculated without further investments). It's up to you to decide it's a good return or not.

It is good to go slow in trading than thinking big that can result to losses.I believe not. Making 20% annually, by doing a more active style of investing, and taking more risks is actually worse compared to a low-time-preference investment in Bitcoin. Measure it by taking the annual return, positive or negative, of merely HODLing Bitcoin for the last five years, then get the average. HODLing is lower risk than active trading, and I'm confident it will give the HODLer a higher return for his/her Dollar vs. the 20% annual profit from a more active strategy. If a person can't outperform the HODL, then just HODL.",

But the people who just look at others and don't have any intention to learn from themselves and get forward that person always stuck in their position which was ever. The best way in trading to move forward is to learn from yourself whether you have less knowledge it doesn't matter,  a time will come when everyone will learn from you.Strategies in trading play an important role, if someone is using a single strategy again and again, and he is continuously failing in his trading and getting losses, he must have to change it otherwise there will be more losses if he doesn't think about it and change his way of trading.

It's free, so feel free to join if you'd like. https://t.me/CryptoBeeStrategyWhy not you would really be needing to post up your free trade tips on here or with this thread rather than on requiring people to join up or would go into that TG group? Not all would really be that too confident on doing such thing or would really be hesitating on doing that step on using TG just to get some trading tips. Actually it isnt bad if you are really that making your own strategy and making some backtesting for a month and see your expected results. Please do bare in mind that not all that the results you are seeing on backtesting would really be precisely be happening once you do touch up the real deal. Volatility could easily fucked you up and could really be messing up on the strategy that you had made. You cant really just that make yourself that too confident that it would really be definitely 100% gonna work in case you would really be applying it.I do somewhat agree that 22% in a year is really that small when you are dealing with crypto space and just trying to look around then it would really be just that peanuts.We do have our own approaches when it comes to trading and if you do see that it do satisfies you then do it, dont get hesitated on whatever other people would be saying as long you do see that it works for youthen it should be just fine. We are really doing our own things just to survive this unpredictable market. There's no way that there's such thing about precise prediction or methods becauseit cant really just that so easy.",

This is a continuation of my previous post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5468812.0 in which I asked whether achieving an average annual return of 20% was considered good. There were several interesting comments, with some people saying it's a good return for spot trading, while others felt it's a very low return due to the high risk and volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Some mentioned that for a small capital, it might not be worth the effort for such a small gain. I'd like to address some of the points that came up in the post.EditI've created a Telegram group where I'll be sharing my daily trades. It's free, so feel free to join if you'd like. https://t.me/CryptoBeeStrategyThanks for sharing, updating, and taking us on your trading journey using your own trading strategies. I am an occasional trader even though I have the theoretical knowledge of trading so I am happy to see someone actually put in practice trading.  I was wondering, how how have you been trading for and what has been the most valuable lessons from trading that you have learned?I'll definitely check your telegram channel.",

What are the backtest results if you have any, would be interesting to see how strategy performed over the years when Bitcoin was trending Quote from: Wind_FURY on October 21, 2023, 09:15:06 AMAlthough, intra-day back-tests are not available for free. But TradingView does have a 30-day free trial. Plus for plebs, it's probably better to use lower time preference strategies.Hello, I have downloaded the backtest data so that you can better visualize the strategy I am implementing. The backtest covers the period from 2020 to 2023 with a capital of $1,000. In the following link, you will find the spreadsheet where everything is more detailed. Thank you very much for your feedback.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TCRy0wyyBBvGvz8p2wEyB2RcslsJvZ9eN0gGrHWJOjo/edit?usp=sharingPLEASE CHECK THE BACKTESTQuote from: Strongkored on October 21, 2023, 02:29:47 AMSo what is your telegram group for? I want to share the tool I've developed with the community, and the Telegram group is for that purpose, to address questions about my strategy. I need more than 20 people to be able to publish the strategy on TradingView and not waste money in vain. If you want to try it, please join the Telegram group, and when we reach 20 people, I will upload the strategy along with a manual for its use. Thank you.",
