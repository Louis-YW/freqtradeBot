Even the previous one occurred because not enough people were aware of Bitcoin or its potential to be valued what it is today.

Well, I guess majority of the people who put their money in bitcoin has one common goal, to become financially free and become rich. Having a lambo or any other luxuries is of course part of being rich. The word boring is not as hilarious as the word frustrating when we're talking about hitting that goal.",

We never know, there are people who got scammed for huge amounts of money without receiving anything.  There are also people who are insane and spend huge amounts of money without any reason.  We even see some managers betting a million dollars for a mere prediction knowing he will lose the bet.  Anyone can do a stunt just for publicity.  But still, I think this is a bad joke",
