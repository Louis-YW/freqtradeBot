Or comebacks from 2:10 all the time.Would not advise anybody to bet on this, its basically like plinko / roulette, you bet and hope for the best.Yeah, these table tennis always looked suspicious for me. As you noticed, they play 24/7 and they never stopped during Covid and they didn't even stopped to play during war in Ukraine.They're not professional players, they are just some random men and women. And I don't see any other purppose of these tournaments than match fixing. I doubt that amateurs would go to play 3 AM night just for fun. And it's perfect place for fixing, they're not professionals, so, they're not risking to get banned. And I doubt that someone would bother to try to prove it.Betting on such tournaments is pure lottery. It's cool if OP you really got $600 profit, but I wouldn't suggest for others to bet on it, well maybe only with small money.",

There can be mistake many times on determining the odds and you can take advantage of it.People who experience the last game loss can have lower confidence this also needs to be checked.If you go extreme mode you can check facial and body language. Some people have anxious stare on their face some people look like alpha males who come to win. Especially on table tennis they many of them are nerds. Not real athletes who work out.",

Turns out it isn't the case. But what about if both of the players doesn't look like winners, and one guy's odds are better than the other? Would you still consider that a good game to bet on or will you just skip it? Honestly if this works for you, then it's good, but I don't think this is a sound advice for gamblers at all. Yeah table tennis is a fast and easy sport to win at but only if you have prior knowledge of the sport IMO.P.S., that bet history with lots of losses isn't really attractive especially if you use this to pitch your strategy.",

What you're really looking at is if the player has the confidence he could win.I guess every person has their respective techniques that makes them comfortable betting but this is definitely the first time I heard someone relying on \"face appearances\" on betting. I hope that by using this technique, you are not being racist OP.As someone who has played table tennis during the entirety of my High School years, I would say that watching this sport is one of those things that makes your jaw drop in awe. Lots of Chinese and European players are gods in this sport especially that the top player right now can be changed by another person within the next few weeks/months. That is why I somehow consider this sport to be relatively difficult in terms of betting.",

Even though you're confident at times it's still risky since it could drain your bankroll much faster.",

And if you smell something fishy between those two teams, then you can bet on the underdog and see how it goes. If they win they good for you. And that is why is it also not advisable to bet on such league because of it's very unpredictable.",
