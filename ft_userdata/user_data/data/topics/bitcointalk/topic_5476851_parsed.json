I get about $100 a month as an allowance from my father. $100 is only for personal use, not for living expenses. I've been using these $100s to buy bitcoin for a few months now.

Just explore more, there's plenty of opportunities online where you can earn bitcoin without investing, by using your computer effectively, of course with internet, you'll be able to make that as a tool to accumulate/invest in bitcoin.",

You don’t need to invest large amounts,  Nothing wrong with starting small. Also make sure you use a hardware wallet or some type of cold storage setup.

If you're using it for your school and such and you are also doing some side hustles with that work then wouldn't it be counterproductive for you to sell that? I mean you could probably do more work with a computer and get more value out of it than just selling it and buying bitcoin right now and waiting for bitcoin to go up in prices, that 100 monthly investment is already a good number to put in bitcoin so don't be too hasty, you might want to leave some money for yourself in cases that you need a quick cash, it's going to be a problem for you if you were to have an emergency and you don't have a quick cash to pick up and you end up having to take some in your bitcoin stash.",

Is selling a computer the right decision?I think those are some very bold decision-making steps you are about to take. First, you are using from the allowances you get from your dad to save a part of it into your Bitcoin and now, you want to take the step forward, to sell your PC and invest more on Bitcoin. I must admit that you're a bold young person and I admire you for that.However, you also need to look at how useful the computer you are selling is to your financial life. Can you regard the computer system as an 'asset' or you see it as a 'liability'. If it is an asset, then I will advise you not to sell it yet and have a deeper thoughts about how it serves you and whether it will affect your income or earnings or not. If it doesn't, you can go ahead especially at this period that we are likely to enter soon which is the bull run period. But please, don't be greedy and always investigate the market trends heavily before taking those bold steps.",

Is selling a computer the right decision?Without having more data, it doesn't seem like a good idea to me that at 19 years old you are obsessing so much about it. That $100 that your father gives you should be spent on hanging out with friends and your girlfriend, which it looks like you don't have, and if you don't have a girlfriend, at least try to pick one up. If you don't spend anything, and the little you have you want to sell it to invest in Bitcoin, it looks like you spend the day at home, and that doesn't seem to me a good plan at all with 19 years old. It's not bad if you dedicate a small part of what they give you to invest in the future but at that age the biggest ROI will be in studying something usable in the marketplace. When you have a good job you will be able to invest regularly.",

Is selling a computer the right decision?I assume that the desire to sell your computer to invest in Bitcoin is propelled by FOMO. Computers have become an essential need especially if you are active in the crypto space or deal with online platforms. If you have an alternative computer and don't need the one you want to sell, then it's not a bad idea. But selling the only computer you have to buy Bitcoin might not be a good decision because you could use the computer to make money from online job platforms and the returns could be invested in Bitcoin. You don't have to be in haste to invest because Bitcoin will always create opportunities for people to invest.Don't also assume that buying $100 worth of Bitcoin every month is small money because millions of people earn less than that amount per month. I suggest you keep on buying using your DCA pattern and focus on keeping it for a long time. You will be surprised how much you have invested and gained in a few years.",

It's ridiculously small money, but I believe it could be quite a lot of money if I keep saving it steadily.You are 19 years old, and your dad gave you $100 for spending. You now divert it to a bitcoin investment. Did you stay at home without hanging out with friends and others? This seems to be a fishing story. But let me just say what brought me into your thread and move on. However, with the $100 you are investing, can you afford to lose it? Because by your age now, I think you should be using that money to do other things, like buying clothes, flexing, and other things to have fun, even if you will invest not all the money, I guess, so if you know you can’t afford to lose your complete allowance, invest the amount you can afford to lose because bitcoin investment has risk.Quote Is selling a computer the right decision?This is up to you, man. You will be the one to look at how useful the computer is for you because it seems to me that you want to rush and invest in the market when you see the price is increasing. Don’t do that, man. That is not how it works. You need to be prepared for a long-term investment. $100 you said you were investing can be enough; you don’t need to sell your assets. Or did you think $100 is still too small for your investment? People invest less than $100 and gradually accumulate some amount of bitcoin, so I think you should invest with a plan and don’t rush.",

You don't need to rush; it's okay to do it little by little. But if, for example, you are not really using the computer, then that's okay.

Is selling a computer the right decision?Despite the fact that Bitcoin has proven to be a good investment over a long period of time, if someone does not understand much about how it works, they will hardly succeed in their Bitcoin investment because of the challenges they may face in the market before making the profits. I don't really know much about your knowledge of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but from your writeup, I think you are new to the cryptocurrency industry. Selling property that is useful to you to invest in Bitcoin is not something that makes sense because there is no assurance that the Bitcoin you want to invest will surely bring you profits and plans with time. As a 19-year-old person, I believe you are still a student, and as a student, I believe you need a computer to do certain things. Just imagine you sell your computer now and invest the money in bitcoin. When you need a computer, Bitcoin is down in price. You will surely regret investing in bitcoin, and you may decide to even sell at a loss to get money to purchase a new computer. So it is better to invest what you can afford to lose; don't invest more than you can't afford to lose because the profits you are thinking you will make may never happen when you plan it because it is hard to predict the Bitcoin market. So far, you are getting $100 from your father every month. It would be better if you started using the DCA method to invest in Bitcoin with what you could afford every month. It will really be a great help, and in a few years, you could have invested a reasonable amount in Bitcoin. Do it gradually. The cryptocurrency industry is not about rushing to invest; investing according to knowledge.",
