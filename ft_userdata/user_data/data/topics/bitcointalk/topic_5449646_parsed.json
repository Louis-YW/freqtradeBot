  "content": "Hi, I'm Jay and my team and I have been working on ASIC.guidehttps://asic.guide/.  We launched a few months ago and for the past few months, we have been working hard to add as many companies in the space as possible (semi-curated).  I think the website is now a lot more well-round and you can now do research on:- Manufacturers- Distributors (For Wholesale Purchase)- Resellers (For Retail Purchase)- Hosting providers- Repair (Repair centers, Repair Training, Repair Tools)- Services (Mining pool, Custom Firmware, Miner Monitoring, and other services)You can also filter the list by 'Company Type' and 'Country'For now our plan, is to add more companies and work on the verification process so that we can do the verification part for users and provide a space for legit companies to operate.Would love to get some more feedback from the community!",
