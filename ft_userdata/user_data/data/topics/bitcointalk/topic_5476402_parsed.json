  "content": "A bunch of Kafirs were killed and score more injured in Philippines. They were allegedly punished by the Islamic state organization that aims to create a worldwide Islamic khilafah. Such incidents are on a rise in south east Asia as the religious difference rises. People should embrace it if they can't avoid it.https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-deadly-philippine-bombing-2023-12-03/?taid=656cb42b46b6e8000137fdd6",

      "body": "Sorry for the loss. Saw that yesterday or so and I took some time to research about Philippines and discovered they are mostly Catholics. And I wondered why the attacker would dare to attack in a mostly Christian country. I think it could be persecution or they were attacked for doing wrong.Anyways, True Religion or the Word of the CREATOR of the Universe needs to be diligently followed by Christains to be shielded from such attack. It's hard to successfully attack people who are properly following a good law or good constitution. Such attacks happen via loopholes which are created when the law isn't diligently followed. But there are certain attacks on True Christians that are possible especially when they are in the domain of the enemy spreading the Goodnews. It's like soldiers getting attacked on foreign lands while trying to turn the inhabitants away from evil culture. This occasionally happens to Christain spreading the Word of the CREATOR in the World and we call it persecution. Â Better to be attacked for doing right than for doing wrong.",

Maybe it would be a good time for the government of the Philippines to ask for help of the United States to neutralize the leftover terrorist cells in the Pacific...during the isis battle in Marawi seven years ago, USA actually helped the Philippines it might not be that far off to see them once again assisting",

I have Muslim friends and all of them do not support the activities of these terrorists, who commit these barbaric crimes in the name of Islam. The fight against terrorism is a global concern, so every nation needs to show concern and offer assistance to nations that these wicked humans are terrorising. I believe that the sponsors of these terrorisms have hidden agendas, they're just using religion to cover up their real intentions. Let the whole world rise up to these responsibility to crush these terror enemies.",

The government has to do something about this.Not sure what the government of any country could do about it, without being called out for violation of the religious freedoms of the people of such country. I don't believe violence is something completely dependant on the religious one belongs to, but rather what the priests and the religious authorities say to their followers an how that affects them, dealing to a process of radicalization. It is more common in Islam, because the teaching of Muhammed are more inclined to hostility than the teachings of Jesus Christ, still one can see Christian Sects which encourage their followers do commit atrocities, one only needs to take a look at the history of the Wacco seize in Texas/USA. Govenments could then try to look over and lay attention to sects and churches which use violent rethoric during their gatherings.",

In fact, he condemns such religions.",
