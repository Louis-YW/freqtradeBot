I'm not sure why you put him in this group and for what reason you think the registry should shut down this domain.also, domain deletion by the registry does not work exactly as you imagined. so if 50-100 people would report bitcointalk.org as a scam development, and there is certainly a sufficient number of frauds that have taken place here, this domain could easily be shut down. you deleted the first post, but it should serve as a warning for some new potential victims. although he would have to present all the facts related to that fraud and some evidence about it.I don't know where you're from, but maybe it's better to try to look for the owner of those domains through the official authorities. the registries most likely have his personal data.what do you suggest to do with these 800+ fraud sites? and that is only a small part of how many there are. in the end, that scammer invested about $50 for the registration of those domains, even if they are banned, with the new $50 he will start all over again and maybe you will believe in his services again.",

It takes longer to expect people to care about reporting those sites, but I think spreading the word about them is also a form of fighting them.",

Also there's no prove if those sites have been scammed anyone, he just accuse the site which using Russian domain is scam. Nothing more.",
