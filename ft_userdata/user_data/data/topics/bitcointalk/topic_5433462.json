Another is people who choose close source wallets, to me itâ€™s practically the same as leaving your crypto in exchanges. Trust wallet was open source until Binance purchased it, now itâ€™s completely closed source. Anything can go wrong and users wouldnâ€™t know about it until itâ€™s too late.

How about Paxful CEO as an example for promoting self custody and delisted ether, saying ether is more centralized as its blockchain is now using PoS. An organization do not have to lie, it is better to make use of the right word and to be truthful which their users will still respect about them. Or they should not say anything instead of lying.Quote from: CryptoPanda on January 08, 2023, 12:13:29 PMEven with FTX scam, there are still people that are willing to keep their bitcoins in exchanges. It seems self-custody is a burden to some people, they prefer a third party controls their money for them.What I think is that most people that store their coins on exchanges are not able to differentiate between custodial and noncustodial wallets and also unable to know the use of noncustodial wallet if compared to exchanges. Quote from: CryptoPanda on January 08, 2023, 12:13:29 PMAnother is people who choose close source wallets, to me itâ€™s practically the same as leaving your crypto in exchanges. Both are not recommendable but they are no the same thing. With noncustodial wallet, dangerous because you do not see the code used for the wallet makeup but you still have your keys and have full control, but having a bug can make me wrong. WithÂ  exchange you do not have the full control because it is not your coins on blockchain.

However, as much as I think it is wrong to store cryptocurrencies on CEX, for some investors it is still the simplest thing, considering that all they need is to create an ordinary account, which is no different from, say, creating an e-mail or something similar.It would be ideal if people understood what they are investing in, and if they don't, then they are easy targets for fake crypto wallets, seed stealers or clipboard malware. We've all seen how big the risk of storing coins on CEX is recently, but it's still the method that many use because of its simplicity.However, people need to be educated to understand the risks that threaten them, and how they can safely be their own bank, which is actually one of the ideas that came with Bitcoin.",

Unfortunately this is most people. How do we educate them on self custody is the million dollar question.This reminds me of a time where after going to bitcoin.com you would get a buy bitcoin button and it would redirect you to buying bitcoin cash. I remember that they changed it after the community got vocal about it. There's so many ways to store cryptocurrency and choosing to hold it on a platform that doesn't show you private keys is the worst. There's so much that can go wrong.If their login server goes down you won't be able to take your coins out even when the company is ok and they haven't been hacked or anything. We are all human. If you're wondering whether your coins are safer in your hands or in the hands of these \"professionals\" know that they also make mistakes, they get greedy, they get into trouble with law, they get sick. They can have an IQ of 180 and make a dumb mistake one day because they were tired or distracted.People who trusted brokers working in the World Trade Center with their money didn't take into account that one day a plane will crash into it.",
