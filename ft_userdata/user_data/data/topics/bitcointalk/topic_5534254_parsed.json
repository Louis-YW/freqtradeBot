So, it doesnâ€™t really make sense to borrow fiat or other crypto and use Bitcoin as collateral.getting a fiat loan is tax free cashhowever selling crypto yourself for fiat is a taxable event.. so think of the implications of you selling.. compared to giving them crypto as collateral and you getting tax free cashbut be warned.from reading blockstreams offering they wont just give you a lump sum upfront. they give you monthly income.. \"Blockstream Income Fund: Stable, Predictable Income\"also i doubt they will use the collateral to give a loan as of the exact date market rate you do the deal, so if you expect to do a tax free loan at the exact peak of a ATH and get 100% as a lump at ATH or as a monthly amount locked at ATH rate split over many months, forget it. ((they say high single digit to low teen 'conservative' loan to value risk). so expect 13% to be their probably max)they will give you a reduced rate.. which varies, to match a reduced rate+corrected market rate.. Â and as i said because its not a lump sum you cant just hoard a loan lump to then buy a large amount of coin back at the post-ATH correction to accumulate more coin than you loanedmy opinionEG if market ATH peaks to say $350k and you miraculously time it to do a loan of that date. they will probably take your BTC into their custody. but only offer you $304k rate (13% below) (they say high single digit to low teen 'conservative' loan to value risk). so expect 13% to be their probably max)which they will suggest a 20 month payout so first month is $15.2kthen if the following month the real market rate corrected to $290k($252k deal rate at 13% reduced), the second monthly payment wont be $15.2k but lower($12.6k)",

It doesn't make sense to me. It should've been the opposite, wanting Bitcoin for alt collateral. Blockstream's possibility of getting themselves bankrupt is high because there would be a lot of demand by bigger players, but it can only work well if the terms and conditions favours the institution where eligible users are selected based on activities on the platform and the total amount traded so far.",

So, it doesnâ€™t really make sense to borrow fiat or other crypto and use Bitcoin as collateral.With Trumpolini in power for the next 4 years this does not surprise me - you'll shortly understand why.Fun Facts:Â 1. In the US, income from a loan is not a taxable event whereas selling crypto for fiat IS a taxable event.Â 2. As long as you pay back the loan everybody is happy - you got tax-free fiat from your collateral to play around with while hopefully paying less in interest than you would have in taxes if you just had cashed out plus you got your collateral back and the loan company makes their money from interest on the loan.Â 3. If you do NOT pay back the loan the loan company sues you, forecloses on your loan and you lose your collateral - boo hoo - you still got all of that tax-free fiat and the loan company (hopefully) makes more from selling/using your collateral than they would from you repaying the loan. If you do not care about losing your collateral - like say it is an over-valued business or property you own and even better, if said collateral is heavily financed by investors - you stand to make a lot of tax-free money.Number-2 is one of the favorite ways 'The Rich' can avoid taxes on their money and is how it usually works.But, then there is #3... It is certainly Trumpolini's favorite scheme - he and his companies have been sued & foreclosed a myriad of times over the years for doing this. A large part of the kerfuffle in his New York cases is based on him constantly & drastically over-valuating his properties leading to banks losing money on his loans when they try to sell or reinvest the collateral...At least when using crypto for collateral one cannot cook the books to make it appear to be worth more than it really is worth.",

Why bother lending when you can sell your bitcoin and still be in profits. Much bigger than what you are capable to lend.That's right, start and go back to the reason why we're accumulating Bitcoin. If you are up for a loan then put Bitcoin out of the choice otherwise, just sell a portion of it to solve that problem of money. It's harder to accumulate once you have sold or loan it and defaulted on the loan. Or if there is no need to sell or lend Bitcoin, find a way to get that loan from other means. But hey, who will never know our situations but this is a good suggestion for those that are thinking about this option.",

Why bother lending when you can sell your bitcoin and still be in profits. Much bigger than what you are capable to lend.One of the benefits of using Bitcoin as collateral and not selling it is that Bitcoin price appreciates. Someone might have a pressing need but doesn't want to sell his holdings. It will be better to take a loan if the interest is law. You might be able to pay off the loan and still make a profit if the price of Bitcoin appreciates. However, I will not be willing to keep my funds in a centralized platform since they are not trustworthy. It will be safer to sell some part of my investment than to take a Bitcoin collateralized loan.",
