  "content": "* originally posted in wrong section*Hello,First and foremost, I would like to say that this is why I am leaving stake forever and taking my business to another book.I have been a loyal customer for over two years now, I have had many issues with their odds provider and support is usually useless but today they were somewhat helpful but still refused to fix the bet entirely.I bet this multi (soccer was already a winner) so I only had tennis left. sport:48659865Wager amount approx 4.4k usd Total payout around 7.6k usdI attempted to cash out my bet at 30-40 and about a millisecond after I requested my cashout, the odds changed as it went 40-40, therefore, due to odds changing, my cashout should have been rejected. Since the cashout feature is an absolute scam, my cashout was not rejected and it was accepted for about $200 when it should have been well over 1k.I contacted support immediately to notify them that the cashout should have been rejected and that the bet should stand with the new cashout amount available. After contacting support, my player went from 9.00 to 1.20 in a matter of minutes. My cashout would now be about 5.5k based on the math.Support argues with me back and forth until I ask for the logs, originally, they offer me a $100 goodwill gesture which I kindly decline. I continuously tell them to put the bet back to normal as the final set was starting and I wanted my cashout available. Of course, they ignore me until the match ends and she loses and they continue to argue with me and say there were no issues.After a few hours of arguing with them, they come back and offer me $600.00 (I refuse and tell them that the selection should be voided and paid on a single, they tell me $600 more is what I’m getting and that’s it) I take it and tell them I’m also posting this online.I am a diamond 3 player with a net loss of over 2.2 CAD and the fact that they think it’s fair to scam me over a few grand is laughable, especially when they admit it was a technical error. In addition, as you can see by the photos I posted, when you request a cashout on stake, there always has to be a 10 second cool down period, you can see my cashout was accepted only after 7 seconds.Stake can keep the money, but boys and girls, let me tell you, their odds providers are scammers and stake support doesn’t give a shit about helping their customers.First excuse - blaming it on my browser lolhttps://ibb.co/hYph1pJThan odds changed at the same time-https://ibb.co/fMDnvgLThan I can give you $100 on a 4.4k bet a goodwill gesture lolhttps://ibb.co/qxym4MkCashout log- as you can see, the 10 second cool down period never finished and that’s why it wasn’t rejectedhttps://ibb.co/H7GB95qFunny how odds changed exactly when I requested the cashout but it wasn’t rejected https://ibb.co/8zVHNt4He admits here “the cashout was not rejected correctly, so here take $600”https://ibb.co/5Gn30N8Its funny how the changed their tune multiple times until I called them out on the scam by their odds provider.I don’t expect any help from any stake mods here so just put it spite for these guys, I’m going to be reporting this to their licensing body.Thanks for reading!",
