  "content": "No doubt bitcoin has been a huge success to mankind, there are traceable evidence and impacts in the lives of its communities. Historically bitcoin remains the only fastest growing digital economy that has reduced unemployment rates across the globe. Speaking of which am a testimony to its forthcoming beneficiaries, sometimes I wonder how I would have fulfilled the little achievements, the problems I have face and solve without coming across this reputatable bitcoin project. Is quite understanding that we may have experience one or two occasions unexpected losses but that does not retrogressed its blessings to mankind.I wrote this few facts to boost our motivations, that knowingly or unknowingly we are all a shared partakers of this digital financial institutions. Bitcoin has lay fundamental hipps of digital assets, exchange, markets, and products. But not withstanding the condemning failures folks is quite alarming in as much as promotion and praises of bitcoin is overwhelming.This facts about BTC can be likely described in the following pinnacles:* Bitcoin is a gift- because we did not campaign for it to be established* bitcoin is assets- because its has intangible economic resources* bitcoin is new income technology* bitcoin is reliable, verifiable, durable, resourceful and monetized* bitcoin is work, employment and market/trades products* bitcoin is a welcome development* bitcoin is digital currency * bitcoin is paying bills* bitcoin is community of people.Now people with bitcoin lifestyles/mindset are mostly friendly, motivated, independent and self employed, trained/training/mentors to newbies. Bitcoiners solve problems, they're givers, hospitable, charity founders and lovers of bitcoin and its communities.Bitcoin is indeed a gift and blessings to mankind.......what do you think?",

You can also treat bitcoin as asset but it has nothing to do with your lifestyle. Bitcoin is a blessing for those who adopt it and know its value of bitcoin it is time for investing in bitcoin rather than spending it and acting cool about having bitcoin. Please don't get overwhelmed by bitcoin, people who have bitcoin is like any normal people you see on the street. It has nothing to do with anyone's behavior.",

      "body": "I appreciate your effort in spreading awareness about Bitcoin but it seems you talk a lot about the positive sides, how about the pros of Bitcoin? They must also understand how crucial using Bitcoin is and risky it is, as the security and safeguard of the assets when holding this. I like the way how you motivate people, in fact, that many people with a Bitcoin lifestyle or mindset are independent and self-employed is a testament to the freedom and flexibility that this technology can provide.  By embracing the principles of decentralization and individual sovereignty, Bitcoiners are able to take control of their own financial futures and pursue their passions and goals with a renewed sense of purpose and motivation.  I hope this is what I've heard for the future outcome.",

They do many different initiatives to bring Bitcoin to more people and it is very helpful for Bitcoin adoption globally.Announce your first Bitcoin purchase, Bitcoin acceptance for your business here. In that topic, you can see many activities were executed as parts of Bitcoin adoption.In my opinion, Bitcoin is not the only coin that has many use cases but it is the best because of its specifications:- Total supply is 21M cap.- Decentralized network- Very strong and healthy network with highest total hashrate- Highest trading volume in cryptocurrency marketHow is the 21 Million Bitcoin Cap Defined and Enforced?",

Has unemployment decreased globally?If Bitcoin does not help reduce unemployment, then there is no problem because it is not its main role.Bitcoin can help individuals who have knowledge of the basics of trading or want to invest in the long term, not people or countries in general, unless those countries decide to keep a percentage of their reserves in the form of Bitcoin, which did not happen in 99% of the countries in the world.",
