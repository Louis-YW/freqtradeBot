  "content": "Hello. I would be interested to know if there is a list anywhere that ranks countries according to their \"Bitcoin friendliness\".For example, I know from my own experience that Germany is friendlier than Britain. What do I mean by this? I mean it is just easier to transfer money from exchanges to banks and the other way around, the German tax people are generally \"cool\" with people owning Bitcoin, plus you do not pay capital gains tax on any crypto held longer than a year. Meanwhile, British banks are all angsty and I have heard of people getting their accounts shut down because they transfer fiat to/from an exchange.Has anyone ever compiled such a list? It would be interesting to do our own rankings, I think, from personal experience!I know lots of online magazines like Forbes sometimes do lists of \"ten Bitcoin-friendly countries\". But these sort of articles are usually just fluff (like \"ten countries it is easy to retire to\" and from experience I know their \"lists\" are rubbish).So which are the best from the point of view of the individual like us? I know Germany is pretty good and I would tend to imagine the smaller and more \"dynamic\" countries like Estonia ought to be better, but what about Asia, Central America, etc? Which country is best of all???",

But these sort of articles are usually just fluff (like \"ten countries it is easy to retire to\" and from experience I know their \"lists\" are rubbish). I think the most coolest & Bitcoin-friendly countries should be \"El-Salvador\" & \"Central African Republic\" simply because in those areas Bitcoin is fully legalized as legal tender and as such could be easily accessible by citizens without stress. And secondly, since you have regarded the list given by forbes not to be authentic, I think the only way we can have an authentic data about the most Bitcoin friendly countries in the world is if each and everyone of us can come here & mention how the use of Bitcoin looks like in that particular region, so that at the end, O.P could compare the names of the most friendly regains.So starting from me, I'm from Nigeria, and Bitcoin is not completed banned, but it was restricted by the Central Bank of Nigeria in 2021 under the last administration of president Mohammedu Buhari, due to the fact that they never wanted people to have their funds in Bitcoin rather than banks where they could have total control over it, but with the help of p2p platforms such as \"Binance\" and \"Remitano\", Nigerian citizens can now buy and sell Bitcoin in few seconds without stress, which I'm a living witness to that. Note: But just that you can't buy Bitcoin using bank cards such as Visa or Mastercard.So that's that for Nigeria.. How about yours?",

I think I've seen various rankings, but it was about Bitcoin adoption. Some account for legislation when they measure adoption, so it can be partially relevant. I think it would be useful to have a balanced Bitcoin friendliness index that would combine public perception, legislation, de facto stance based on available news, etc. The thread already has links to Bitcoin legal status by country and adoption by country. I can also see that some lists of crypto-friendly countries are directly based on the legislation they have regarding Bitcoin (here, for example).",

That could mean that such transactions triggered internal investigations, and since the cost of employees' time is not cheap, keeping those customers would mean making losses, so it was easier to just kick them out.Such a policy may be quite extreme and more unfriendly to customers. Despite engaging in crypto transactions, do they have the right to interfere in private transactions made as long as it is not a crime. Unless the transactions made exceed a reasonable amount of transactions, seen with very large transactions. That could possibly be a necessary review. But if it is just a small trading transaction, let alone a transaction made on a local Exchange that is already registered. Strict service to their customers is also influenced by regulatory issues.Quote from: pawel7777 on July 08, 2023, 07:21:15 AM-snip-And I think, as crypto becomes more mainstream, \"unfriendly\" banks will be changing their stance as well, if they haven't already.-snip-They have to change their attitude, \"Unfriendly\" banks will only be the ones that are left behind and cannot evolve with the latest payment technology today. More rules means more understanding of what their customers are using, more flexibility and not making rules that favor their own company.",

After years of fud and years of publishing false news that clearly implies that bitcoin mining is destroying the environment, Forbes has become instantly more supportive. Head scratching update from Forbes hehe. Bitcoin, often criticized for its energy consumption, actually uses less energy than many traditional industries. With an annual consumption of 129.45 TWh, it accounts for only 0.078% of global energy use. In comparison, the gold industry consumes around 240.61 TWh annually, factoring in emissions from various stages of production and refining. The traditional banking system, encompassing data centers, branches, ATMs, and card network data centers, uses even more energy, estimated at around 638.88 TWh annually.When we delve into the emission intensity (g/kWh) of bitcoin and compare it with other industries, it becomes clear that bitcoin, with an emission intensity of 296 g/kWh and a sustainable energy mix of 52.6%, is more environmentally efficient than many other sectors.The gold industry, which relies on a combination of non-electrical and electrical power sources, has an even higher emission intensity of 679g/kWh and a sustainable energy mix of a mere 12.8%, according to Goldmoney.com. These figures underscore the critical role of the energy mix in determining the environmental impact, and they position bitcoin in a more favorable light when considering emission intensity.Source https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-bitcoin-and-the-environment/",

Bulgaria and Estonia also benefit from pretty low taxes. France should be avoided, as should Italy and Austria, for example.Outside Europe, Singapore is a good country when it comes to crypto tax, Malaysia too, the Cayman Islands, (Puerto Rico has a special status too which is very interesting), and Georgia is top of the top.As for crypto-friendly usage and culture, because I think OP is not just talking about taxes, it's still harder to come up with a list of countries, things change quickly, and most countries are on an equal footing in this respect.",
