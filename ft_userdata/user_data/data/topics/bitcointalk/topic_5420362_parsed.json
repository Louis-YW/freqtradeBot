Not just in your eyes but that is what it is. Everything related to cryptocurrency investment is a risk at the moment and I believe until it comes to a time when the space has some sort of regulation, we will continue to see this type of thing happening. To me, it is like some years ago in my country when there was an explosion of Banks everywhere and most of them failed too until mergers and acquisitions (consolidation) which eventually led to higher capitalization for stability.This might be the case for crypto exchanges and the weaker ones will die off normally let's not forget it is a competitive space and manipulations by some to take over can't be ruled out. However, I agree with you too that the smaller investors and hodlers would be the most hit with this FTX happening and I don't know if what is written at the bottom of that Tom Brady and  Giselle Bündchen picture can still be considered as \"using their money well\" after what just happened to FTX.Quote from: Dave1 on November 10, 2022, 10:31:00 AMhttps://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1590188202044030978",

Not sure, but I'm under the impression that they might not able to get out their money before it collapses. But if they did, then lucky them, that is a huge amount of money to begin with and not everyone can have that kind of money and then invest in on something that is too risky.Again, this celebrities have tons of money, why not just throw everything in bitcoin and not to this altcoin or crypto exchange that could collapse anytime soon?Hehehe, the caption though, Brady needs to play till 50 years old?",

All they have to put in are ideas and some work and they're golden. Also, they're not the ones who lost a lot on that FTX deal turned sour. I'm sure they can take a beating for what its worth.",

Understanding the unwritten norms of the crypto community that aren't codified elsewhere is crucial. It may prove invaluable in helping you control costs and boost revenue. Diversify your holdings and only invest what you can afford to lose, as Tom Brady and Giselle have shown us. It breaks my heart to hear news like this, but I have faith that they will find a way to fix the problem. It's not a trivial amount of money, and I pray for their well-being and the opportunity to recover from this setback.",
