  "content": "Hi guys I know that's silly question that and I think that it's almost important cause new people use simple passwords that are easily guessed by these Hackers. And more the long and unique password, more it cannot be hacked the hacker. That's reason I always use long passwords ranging from 12 to 20 numeric long passwords with combinations. Here are some of the following password combinations you can try. You can Also comment your unique password capabilities too. 1) asdfghjkl7733@#2) asdfghjllAZQ???/3) asdfghjklMâˆšâˆšâˆš4) asdfghjklÂ£Â¢â‚¬Â¥%ASDthese are the unique combinations that I think ðŸ¤” that you might get more ideas and these are just examples how to use these passwords who are new and they are having problems how to write their password, and tis unique and also no one can guess.",

You should really use a password manager.Password managers will generate random ones for you, much safer and much more random than yours.You can use NordPass, BitWarden, even Firefox now has an integrated password manager.",

Or Keepass, as it allows you to host passwords database yourself. Having many clients you have access to your passwords on each device - android, iphone, windows, mac. Using browser add-on you may easily fill web forms.Quote from: fennic on December 05, 2022, 05:52:27 PMYou can Also comment your unique password capabilities too. 1) asdfghjkl7733@#2) asdfghjllAZQ???/3) asdfghjklMâˆšâˆšâˆš4) asdfghjklÂ£Â¢â‚¬Â¥%ASDThese passwords are much weaker then you expect, as using different character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits etc.) is not random but sequential. It is almost the famous case when people forced to use digit and special character just add at the end of word \"1!\".",

      "body": "It is really, really, important to have a strong password because the last thing I want in my life is to get hacked. Chances are if you have a simple password, you are taking a chance your life will be in someoneâ€™s elseâ€™ hands. You can also, have malware that can be put in your computer and your identity can be stolen. Recovering from fraud is so hard to recover from. The logistics of getting your life back after getting hacked is a lot of hard work and can be taxing. Our information is our responsibility to make it safe and the key is to keep your password strong and making it sure to change it periodically.",
