I also somehow found out that the real people who are making money or making such big amounts would never ever advertize it or try to teach it to other people in return to a couple of thousand dollars. I am not saying a couple of thousand dollars is not a big money, it is, in fact, it is a huge money where I am, but imagine you are the person that is making so much in one hour, would you go teaching people how to do that and bring more competition ?Reading the forum from 2021, you could start participating in subscription companies. Can you get those few hundred here to start with? To get something, you need to know what you can.As you might expect, now a river of advice will flow that you don't really need.Of these, I advise you to heed your own advice.Quote from: Eternalman on December 16, 2022, 09:10:36 AMSo, now is the perfect time to invest, no matter the sum.

Obviously, there are many things that I might not be seeing.Sorry, mate. But I'm very confused about your sentence above, is it about working 5 days for 9 hours as said by @lovesmayfamilis ? I thought I'd leave that until I get confirmation from you. Ok, let's move on to a more important point IMO.The safest way to earn money is by working or offering services, it will not give you even 0.0001% risk of losing money. But to work in the crypto space, you can't without having a bit of skill (unless you're an airdrop/bounty hunter, like the people on this board do).The foundation is very important to participate in the crypto space, what's the most basic foundation? The answer is...KnowledgeThis means that you have to learn a lot more things in the crypto space so that in the future you can participate, be it as a worker (Moderator, Part of Marketing , Part of Design or Core Team) in a blockchain project. Trust me, even if you already have skills in marketing and design, but without enough knowledge in the crypto space, you won't be able to participate.Whatever it is, but if you want to make money in the crypto space, you won't be able to without knowledge in the industry.",

If you get an idea for a company in the cryptospace (or anywhere) you'll make a decent amount of money but it might take some time. A lot of firms like blockchain.com and coinbase.com seemed to go from making no money to large amounts of money pretty quickly (although they both still have years that perform at losses iirc).Writing for another person's blog and other services can pay very well too or coding for a contact (if you're fast or good at delegating).",

Someone please give this guy a merit or two!!! I only asked for a sort of roadmap where learning a, then b, then c, and seeing at what point, can I really start to be confident to make the first buck. I am be honest with you, this forum is a bit overwhelming because of people like you. whose sole purpose seems to be waiting to bust people, and it is only to just get merit. I get it, merit means a lot on this forum. But I would rather choose to be authentic and original than perhaps to chase merit at any cost. which is why, even though I have been a member for a while, I  only read just as much as necessary to keep my sanity and dignity intact. Plus, you did not answer or bring any value to my query, I don't know why you decided to even jump into the conversation if your sole purpose was to bust someone or pinpoint what he did. I will heed my advice, but again, the point of this post was not to ask for all the ways to make money, but more like a roadmap of some sort so that I could know abc first before perhaps trying to really provide valuable comments (unlike you) and advice along with making money.

It's just going to take time — not something that you can achieve overnight.thank you for your responseYes, that is what I meant, the basics, you know, with programming, it goes liek this:  you learn , variables, loops, functions, objects, etc, then perhaps, make your calculator, and other smaller projects along the way, you know you are getting good, and you have the exact roadmap of where to go after what section or set of skills you have acquired. That  is what or sort of thing I had askedQuote from: Wapfika on January 04, 2023, 02:30:35 PMThe only secure way to earn money in the crypto space is to work using your skills on crypto company or simply the forum signature campaign. But all this work doesn’t guarantee you a lifetime sustainability since crypto projects usually come and go depending on how big the project you involve in. But one thing is for sure that finding a secure way of earning that sufficient to cover your salary to your job needs the same amount of time or more to your job. I really suggest to just find side hustle in crypto like support, moderator or campaign participants here in the forum.Seems to be a valuable answer, I didn't necessarily mean here on the forum but in general. then again, thank you.

Yes,  I think, I will be getting more into airdrops and, bounty compaigns, for started, they seemed to scam you the least, although, they have risk of failure, in terms of airdorps of altcoins. bounties though require you to having followers, fanbase etc. So, learning but feel like im on the right trackQuote from: coupable on January 04, 2023, 11:24:19 PMAccording to your posts, it seems that you are looking to earn crypto in any way possible and without specifying a specific field.At the top of this section there is a fixed topic that I think would be useful to you if you looked at it, and you might not have needed to publish this topic if you had paid attention to it : How to earn BitcoinsIn that topic, there is an identification of activities that can help you earn bitcoin (crypto) in different ways that suit your abilities, whether you are a beginner or an expert :Quote from: Lauda on September 27, 2016, 08:30:06 PMUseful links/postsThere are a few ways to earn Bitcoins, which differ in both skill and effort. A few things you can try:Offer your services in the Service-subboardJoin a signature campaign (be sure to read the official forum rules before joining one)Sells goods (Physical or Digital)Trading altcoins (be sure to read A warning about Alt-Coins)Mining (see also How Bitcoin mining works)Invest (but don't be stupid)How to Buy Bitcoin?The topic also has links to useful topics that it would be better for you to look at before deciding to choose this or that method :Quote from: Lauda on September 27, 2016, 08:30:06 PMWe have also compiled a list of URL's that are useful to read or related to the items posted above:Overview of Bitcointalk Signature-Ad Campaigns[EDU] Faucet risksAre faucets a waste of time?

And I believe this is the kind of post that deserves merit. not the kind that busts you, you know. I keep facing those kinds more often than the kind you just did. And as far as I know from the forum rules, the merit's initial purpose was to award value, and useful comments and to distinguish between a quality user and a trash user.  but busting is not a quality activity at all, nor an action a quality user does. but  hey just stating my personal openion! With that being said, I am not saynig you are busting, don't get me wrong, I just said that there are many occurances that happen on the forum not only specific to my situation and they get awarded.

But I guess it would have been better had I familiarized with Bitcoin more prior to me wanting to make money out of it. But it's all right. I'm only saying this because you're asking about building up a foundation. The most solid foundation of all is knowing Bitcoin. That would make you want more and HODL firm and strong, that is, if you still stick to making money. Others would probably say Bitcoin is to be spent because it's a currency, that 1BTC is 1BTC, blah blah blah, but, you know, we cannot just brush off the fact that 1BTC=$100,000 is much better than 1BTC=$15,000.There are other things like altcoins, NFTs, DeFi, staking, trading, and so on. Quite frankly, it is also possible to make money from them, but pretty risky. So, for a start, it would all be about getting to know Bitcoin, probably followed by accumulating and keeping Bitcoin in the safest way possible. The rest you could learn later.",
