I am second the motion for this, Op must add a little bit good information because as we all know that once a beginners try to enter the Crypto world then they must have enough knowledge becausee sometimes they will see or learn not accurate knowledge then that's the reason why some investors will failed.

The time wasted while trying to learn is not bad but it is bad when you fail to apply some principles of the knowledge you have from others who have been there before you to enable you scale through the process. In this case, when ever a situation arises that seems difficult, one can easily apply a method he or she has already heard about to that situation which would make them come through.With the above as explained, I think learning from experience is not bad but a good one to expand your knowledge and horizon.",

In as much as I would advise someone to wait till he acquires enough knowledge aside the security knowledge before going to trading, I would also suggest he takes some funds he can lose and hodl for long. This will give him more experience and coupled with the knowledge he is acquiring the road to been a successful trader will be easier.",
