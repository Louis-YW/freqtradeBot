      "body": "I took a glance at their website... For me, it looks problematic... Flashy buttons, keywords that get repeated, links to big company's to gain trust.... Whilst keeping vague on how this wallet would work. Also, there seems to be a token with the same name, which is also something that always makes me frown...Personally, i'm not a big fan of any wallet that would keep your keys anywhere but on your own device, and this one seems to do right that: keep your keys on a network?Now, for me that's a red flag, but i guess there might be relatively ok ways to do this (for example, by using a strong encryption scheme and keeping the encryption key on your device only whilst backupping the encrypted private key(s) in a network... i would never trust this, and i wouldn't recommand anybody else to trust this setup either, but for some it might be ok.... DYOR), the thing is: they're not clear about how any of this works straight away. Maybe if you dig into their whitepapers???Anyhow, i think there are plenty of trustworthy wallets out there... Why roll the dice with an unknown company that's going to save your keys in the cloud? We're talking about money here... Why would you use a company like this if there are plenty of trusted, good alternatives around... it wouldn't make sense to me...",

      "body": "Self-custody refers to the practice of personally holding and managing your private keys, which are used to access and control your funds. By entrusting your private keys to someone else, such as a custodial service or third-party provider, you are effectively giving up control and relying on them to safeguard your assets. It's safe to say that it's no longer a self-custody wallet. Plain and simple.",

Then I found this[2],Quote*Note that the Algorand, Cardano, and Solana networks require any type of wallets with one of these assets to have a minimum balance and a minimum withdrawal amount of the asset in question. For example, you’ll have to leave 0.1 ALGO in each Algorand wallet on Qredo when withdrawing outside of Qredo. Additionally, the minimum withdrawal amount for Algorand is 0.1 ALGO, excluding GAS and other fees. This doesn't apply to Transfers and Atomic Swaps within the Qredo Wallet.Decentralization works 1. https://www.qredo.com/web3-wallets2. https://support.qredo.com/introduction/supported-assets",

      "body": "I am surprised at the difficulty of taking responsibility for writing 12 words and keeping them, as many platforms invest in such services.As I stated previously, Ledger Wallet has not moved towards *encryption* cloud services. There is a demand from users for such services. They fear for their money, and these companies embellish some technical terms to suggest to the user that his money is safe and that he can access it at all times.@She shining These services have found a market and are trying to exploit it. All of these services are fraud and at some point a hacker can access your money. If you are not willing to manage your private keys, it is better to use banking services. At least your money is guaranteed and here no one guarantees you. .",

It is not like you'll eventually lose your Bitcoin as time goes. I believe there are tons of people who share guides here and there about private key/seeds backup, there are even products dedicated to helping you print your seed offline and so on. I tried checking their website and it seems like you need to register an account to access their \"Vault\" feature. Unless I'm missing something, I doubt that can be called self-custody. Heck, I won't be surprised if they can simply block accounts if they want to. It seems like they mislead people by using marketing terms. What they refer to as \"self-custody\" is basically customization. CMIIW.",

I was also feeling skeptical about their claims so had to post it here to hear from the experience of the board. About the question on why won't I want to control 100% of my private key. I lost my private key of a wallet in 2021 last year due to renovations on my parents home . This made me cautious and felt keeping the current one in my e-mail was safe from loss (prior to entering the forum I never knew that keeping ones private key in emails was not safe) have moved it to a safer place(s)but there's this element of doubt if it is really safe.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on June 01, 2023, 01:17:10 PM@She shining These services have found a market and are trying to exploit it.

It's definitely not safe at all. Don't ever store anything valuable in the cloud, like your emails, cloud storage, or online databases. You never know who else might have access to that stuff besides you.Quote from: She shining on June 02, 2023, 01:24:04 PMhave moved it to a safer place(s)but there's this element of doubt if it is really safe.It's actually a good thing to have a bit of doubt about the safety of your valuable information.
