Last time round I bet on BCH to 10x having dropped 10x.... IT DID SWEET FA. What say you?  Does bull starts from 2025?Well, altcoin are not to be trusted though you might predicts for the market to be much higher or above your prediction but sometimes may go sideways whereby you wouldn't expect the results you may see. So if you asked me I can say no one knows when a coin can go 10x or 20x, the only coin I know can go 10x and above is only bitcoin it has the tendency to rise above its previous ATH whenever we go into another bull run. There were lots of altcoin that made much x but after bull run we never smells about them anymore, this shows how we shouldn't rely on altcoin.",

Last time round I bet on BCH to 10x having dropped 10x.... IT DID SWEET FA. What say you?  According to your title, altcoins that have fallen by 10x in bear market can easily recover during a bull run. From my personal analysis I can say that current market is very risky and solona coin can pump 10×. However, if the bull market starts, roughly speaking, all altcoins will pump a lot. If you want to see a 10x pump, wait until the bitcoin halving. This time will easily cross 10x and expect 30-40x easily in bull market.",

Last time round I bet on BCH to 10x having dropped 10x.... IT DID SWEET FA. What say you?  It is much easier for altcoins to fall in price than to rise. If something has fallen in price 10 times, it does not mean that the price will soon return to its previous values. There are plenty of altcoins that once cheapened, never managed to repeat their former success. So I'm not sure that Solana will be worth as much in the future as it was worth in 2021. It could be the same story with XRP, where the price of the coin will never reach ATH for many years.",

Well basically all projects have reallt trimmed down to its ATL or close. So the bear market really kick in on a lot of projects. Solana is one of those that cracks maybe also due to Sam allegiance witht the project. Anyway we just need to find new projects that could do another leg or new season ATH once bull run arrived.",

There's no assurance to that and altcoins could stay at their price and not be pulled by Bitcoin anymore. When Bitcoin Spot ETF is approved that will open up opportunity for live trade but it doesn't say live trade for altcoins too so you might want to hold your horses because the bull run that you are expecting might become a different ending. I am not really monitoring coins that went down that far and I am not targetting them too. I'd like sticking with the old coins and see if they can somehow create demand when Bitcoin goes up in the future. XRP as one my added choices today after their recent news about being injected into a popular game.",

Even in that case, I would say not a lot of things can drop 90% or more and then go back to what it was.Yet, if you check the top ranked ones, they will improve a lot eventually and should be good enough, I get that it may not be all that much right now, but that doesn't mean that we are not going to end up with anything that would be different on the long run.
