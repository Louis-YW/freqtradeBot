  "content": "Hello -- two questions about using the 2-of-3 multisig in Electrum.Given three (3) people in three (3) separate locations, each with a Ledger Nano S hardware device -- I will call them Person Orange (with an orange-colored Ledger), Person Green (with a green-colored Ledger), and Person Black (with a black-colored Ledger) who are all in contact with one and other but are not physically in the same place.Question 1: Is there a way to create a 2-of-3 multisig wallet in Electrum in this situation?I have created a 2-of-3 multisig wallet in Electrum when holding all the hardware devices myself, but not when they are all in different locations.Question 2: Is there a way to sign a transaction in a 2-of-3 multisig wallet in Electrum when all hardware devices are in separate locations?Along the lines of question 1, suppose Person Orange and Person Green want to send bitcoin out of the wallet but they are not in the same location. Is this possible?Thank you so much for your help! -Dan",

      "body": "You're right @Pmalek -- the answer from @o_e_l_e_o was incredibly helpful, and after communicating Electrum contributors on Github the \"sequence of hardware devices\" challenge I was having got addressed nicely in version 4.2.2:https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/commit/238619f1ed7cb8e7bc60f9de0bfddc0116914b79Incredible turnaround speed and general responsiveness  and you can even see my dumb face if you hover over the linked comment on the commit haha. You definitely hit the nail on the head with these Ledger devices too!I am working through the suggestion from @nc50lc and the potential workaround from @NotATether this afternoon and will hopefully have all this all tied up with a bow before the end of the day.Thanks so much to everyone for your help in this thread, as a newcomer these helpful responses have no doubt saved me days of trial and error! -Dan",
