How are you going to make the listings trend?Some project doesnt meet the listing requirements and we ignore them and list faster with our insider help Fast tracking means in 24-48 hours. If they go with normal listing it can take up to 5 days and %80 rejected we are helping low quality projects.And aslo trending services are not able to do with bot or any software no one can get you trend on CoinMarketCap without a CMC Manager help and you just need to have right contacts to reach them or him we call him insider and its hard to find one and thats why we are here for trending/listing. We can discuss and i can give more information if you get in touch with me on telegram",
