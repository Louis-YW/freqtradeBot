Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.\"-1 Timothy 6:10The money being a root of evil, could be a 2,000 year old view derived from the christian bible. Its illustrated by King David being moral and just as a shepherd. Later after having become king he attains wealth, power and fame. This changes his behavior completely. He murders men and steals their wives. The story of King David is meant to illustrate how money and wealth can change people for the worse. How power and money can have a corruptive influence.On a broader scale, how might the behavior and tendencies of ruling elites be defined across all of human history. Is the behavior of the wealthy and powerful today, different from their peers in previous eras?  If people have money and power they naturally trend towards abusing it. This precedent might define the behavior of ruling elites in all eras of human history. Whether its Top G flaunting pics of women and bugattis on social media. Or more sinister things. Having wealth and power would appear to change the way people behave and how they see the world.In recent times, we adopted the urban myth of the \"benevolent billionaire\" who uses his wealth primarily for charitable and humanitarian causes. We have a paradigm shift in our views of the wealthy and powerful which could contrast with past eras.",

When men want to satisfy their uncontrollable desire for luxury and other material things, they become evil. Money didn't teach people how to steal, kill, defraud or become corrupt, people intentionally chose to act negatively to get money. The case of corruption in the government of Ukraine is a clear example of what people have become because of the quest to get rich quick. How will a sane person be benefiting from blood money without remorse? Ukrainians are suffering and dying, while some corrupt government officials are stealing from their predicament. Even in the face of war, some are going on luxurious vacations with stolen funds. It is not money that is caused these evil but selfish humans.",

They actually have a lot of money. Are they thirsty for power, so they dare to take rights from others? People who commit corruption are people who have power, whether it's in a narrow environment or even in their country. So in conclusion, it is possible that money is a factor that causes crime, but not all crimes are mentored by money, sometimes it is their morals that encourage them to commit these crimes.",
