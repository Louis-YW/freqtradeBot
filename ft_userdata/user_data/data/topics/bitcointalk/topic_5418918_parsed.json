If you have funds to spare for doing so then just go and also if you have trust btc all the way. But saying that you are holding for 10yrs or more then go for it. Just dont expect a lot of what figure it could be cause no one could really know if btc will be a great investment but one thing is for sure. 10 yrs from now the people who dont uses btc are probably stepping up on using it.",

I would suggest accumulating more till you reach a selling level at which point sell to recover some of your investment and add that to make more BTC.Realistically I expect bitcoin to at least cross it's last all time high if not 50k USD should be a high selling point. But true bitcoin believers will make targets close to 1mil and never sell.Altcoins are only a diversion to your money. Don't go too much into them even if you feel that they might do good because they wont. Altcoins are never going to be as big as Bitcoin. Check the charts of Bitcoin and your selected altcoins and you will know the truth. Also to get that good returns, you need the the long term profit from bitcoin not short term altcoin gains.",

It's good to diversify investment but choosing altcoins as alternative over bitcoin isn't good enough, you'd better prefer other investment assets than alts as alternatives but if you think the risk involved is not beyond what you can bear enough, then you can be ok with such.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on October 31, 2022, 09:41:35 AMI am wondering what everyone thinks this the price of Bitcoin can realistically get to? $100k? $250k? $500k? $1m?If you need the accurate answer to this then it's something you can derive on all by yourself, just got deep into the history of bitcoin since 2009 and check the major events that has happened, compare the all time high to the all time low and hiw this has been a continuous process within every four years interval and see how bitcoin has been volatile and ever increasing in value, such could help you predict by yourself what the future may tells andbhiwbfar it could go higher.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on October 31, 2022, 09:41:35 AMI am happy holding Bitcoin for the next 10 years or more if it reaches these prices above.If you really meant business then in this you have to really practice the holding indeed and if will definitely pays than you've expected from it.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on October 31, 2022, 09:41:35 AMI am just debating if I should continue to DCA into Bitcoin or sell all and put into stronger altcoins which will see better ROI over the next few years. Why are you compromising things here, you've made ut right already by investing with bitcoin, adopt the right technique with DCA, now you're introducing a spoil into it, bitcoin is the only digital currency recognized as an asset and recommended for for an investment while others were at your risk.",

      "body": "It is certain that Bitcoin price would definitely get higher than our expectations and calculations but I strongly believe it would gradually do so. While I said so is because as time goes on the world would definitely get to know about Bitcoin whereby  more than %50 of world population holds a little fraction of it added to the demand and pressure on Bitcoin. When that happens, there would be much higher demand for Bitcoin but as it stands now, what Bitcoin needs more is creating awareness about it globally because the world is yet to get familiar with it. This little awareness done will go along way in getting more people onboard the system. This will also create more liquidity and also improve the market there by making higher trading volume. Also, as we may know, Bitcoin has strong value that is why it was tagged digital gold as a result of it's emergence as the first digital currency in the world. So your speculated price is not a barrier in any ways. It is achievable as we collectively do our job as pro Bitcoin enthusiast.",

When you are looking for long term ROI you do not invest in Altcoins, i would tell you not to invest in them at all, but it is your call and your funds to spend, but if you'll listen to me then don't invest in Altcoins, over the next few years more than 50% of the \"attractive\" Altcoins in the market now would be no more, some would have made a classic rug pull scam on investors, dumped totally or are no longer tradable; but many more will keep coming out with the same hype and promises, if you don't like to gamble you can see there's no need going for Altcoins.If you have started to use DCA into BTC, there is no need to change, there is also no need to diversify, if you wanna do that go buy something else that isn't connected to the crypto network in anyway, you don't buy BTC and Solana and think you've diversified, no you have not.",

Bitcoin going over $100k is probably going to happen.within the next 10 years, $50k seems almost certain but we're near the point of when things are hard to predict because of how big the market cap of bitcoin.actually is (assuming most coins are movable still and aren't lost).",

Don't mind the percentage, the important thing is you'll be a consistent holder and adds more to it doing DCA.Many of us are aiming for the high price of bitcoin in the next few years and that's why we're just holding it until those day comes. But at first, we're thinking of seeing the $100k mark first.And then next are those high prices more than the $100k price that we've aimed at the start.",

There is nothing better than to continue to DCA into Bitcoin as long as you can do it. Yeah, some Alts might be also profitable but Bitcoin is a better guarantee of your investment if you are planning to hodling for a long time. And considering whether the price of Bitcoin might get to $100k or more, I believe it is just a matter of time before we would see that price per BTCitcoin reached, history has thought us that much.",

Now, i am wondering if there is really any altcoin out there that is stronger than bitcoin, i might want to know about them and the reason why you think they are stronger than bitcoin...Anyways, the price of bitcoin, just like any other cryptocurrency out there is not predictable, i mean they are highly unpredictable coupled with some factors that may likely affect the price positively or negatively in the future, like 1. Regulations2. Acceptance of bitcoin by different governments of the world This and many more factors i believe will play important roles in determining how far bitcoin can go in price, and right now, some of this factors are unclear to us all.",

Once I also made such a mistake, I chose altcoins from which I expected that they would grow in price and then I will sell them and buy bitcoins. But this was a huge mistake, because my altcoins only fell in price, and did not want to sell them because I was waiting for them to rise again so that I could at least return the money invested. As a result, this led to the fact that I lost almost everything I had and was left without bitcoin. Altcoins are some kind of illusion that only leads us astray, if you want, allocate a few thousand dollars for altcoins, and just look what this investment will lead to.
