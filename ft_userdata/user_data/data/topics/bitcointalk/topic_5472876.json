  "content": "Greetings to everybody.Please share with me if the introduction of the \"Crypto online demo trading app\" would have had the tendencies of risk impact on my friend.At July 2023 I met an old school friend who has been unfortunate to success after the years at schools. So he was interested to know what my lean to financial explore is and I told him I deals on Building Materials. Sometimes he comes spending time with me at the shop and at most times, there is just no patronage then he was worried to ask... \"How do you make it this way that you don't regularly have customers\"? And how is it possible you can still achieve a whole lot of things in life such as cars and house including the possibilities of meeting with your responsibilities?I told him that I diversifies my investments in Bitcoin and it is my most profitable source of income.Then he said if he was financially buoyant he would love to into the Bitcoin because he has to me as a testimony of the industry.Then I told him he can equally startup with any affordable amount which I intended to help raise a specific amount for him but because I wanted him to feel the struggle and raise the capital by himself so that he would pay a recommendable interest on the process of educating him in the industry because he has no knowledge about Bitcoin and also he will learn to value his profits with proper management.So, I hinted him briefly about the potentials of Bitcoin with some primary technicalities and also the interests in long-term and short-term investment so he has going into a short-term investment then i asked him to go watch Bitcoin trading on YouTube and also download \"Exness crypto online trading demo app\" where he can practically learn about crypto trading but specially of Bitcoin.In just 1 day spent in the demo app he felt to had learnt enough and was desperate to get into the Bitcoin market but I keep calming his desperacy because I wouldn't want to be blamed for any lost.then I asked him to keep exercising himself on the Bitcoin demo platform.But since there was a high inflation in my country which has depreciated our local currency over USD ($) and he could raise the highest amount of capital he could but seems to be underated in USD($) exchange to purchase Bitcoin but so far so good our local currency could gained some appreciative values over USD($) again then I opted him to key in and Invest now as a means to take advantage considering the current values of the fiats while he is yet to learn about the technicalities but though some basic educations on how to secure his private keys has been imputed to him.Now he has already invested while we undergoes the overall educational skills and techniques required to a proefficient Bitcoin investor. It was interesting that he could discuss about how he can take Bitcoin for his favorite crypto trading and funding his BTC wallet including  analysing the coins values and how BTC is being at top, talks about an overview, speculation and also as the market chart.I was so overwhelmed he that has aided to save me longer time in educating himBitcoin was around $26K when he came into the industry and Bitcoin market values today is impressively varying in-between $34K and $35K plus.So he had engaged on diversifying his portfolio having his first investment for a long-term investment on ageing plans ahead the future while he has also invested a short-term for his up closed bills.",

I am advising that you continue on holding on and even adding more so you are all in a good position once 2024 will come. So many people were enticed to \"invest\" with Bitcoin but they're afraid to start their journey and so when things are getting brighter they were left behind...good to see those who summoned the energy and the resources to join the BTC Club.",

      "body": "Diversifying his investment portfolio is the safest course of action. If you are in a country that has a variable exchange rate for the local currency and a variable rate for the price of Bitcoin compared to the dollar, calculating net profits and losses will be complicated and may lead you to a loss. Therefore, the best advice is to diversify your investments and focus on Bitcoin as a long-term investment versus buying dollars for investments. Short term or gold if he wants to build a house or buy a car. I know that saving will be more difficult, but some sacrifices are necessary in order to achieve financial well-being, which requires more hard work, and after 4 to 8 years, his Bitcoin investments will be sufficient to achieve what he dreams of.",

But if you've introduced your friend in a way that's informative but at the same time makes them do the decision of investing then I don't think that your relationship with that friend will be going anywhere bad.",

To me it sounds more like a willful decision borne out of good conviction, rather than an initiation to join some kind of Mafia organization. More power to your elbows OP.",

I have wasted my time in the past on people that later told me that they are not interested, it's part of the reason why I don't host any Bitcoin seminars anymore, as majority of them are not even ready to take risks, and it's part of the reason why the world if full of more poor people than the average people that can still provide for themselves. Today I choose to not introduce Bitcoin to anybody, not until I noticed that they have a passion to pursue the goal, some pretend to be ready for the risk and when the I expect things start happening they will lose control and probably sell for loss or start giving you some headache like calling you because the market dumped or something related to this.",

There could be risks of him acquiring wrong knowledges along the lines.* Lastly, if it was right keeping one on pending at where he feels tasty to get onboard because this guy was being too desperately eager without undermining the potentials risks involved as I hinted him about but yet he insisted of investing because I asked him to calm down.Quote from: Plaguedeath on November 05, 2023, 04:19:03 AMNothing different, just like you caught him in his old thread.First story Bitcoin help him become rich, second story he help his friend to invest in Bitcoin, I guess the next one Bitcoin help his country (Nigeria).Well @ plaguedeath you got this twisted. On that of my previous thread, I talked about how leaving my introversial life for extrovert has positioned me to a greater height where I found love and a life partner who is at a virtue willingness to paste me in a better financial status quo by gifting me a pare of shoe, pams including a laptop that I requested for to help handle my Bitcoin tasks flexibly with eases and she also promised to support me with a valuable amount of money to boosten my investments.I saw that happening in the nearest even though it didn't come a reality at last because we broke up 😏.Life is just unpredictable as not all that we plans for life comes as expected.

If you are teaching someone into this industry you would really need not to be biased as you introduced Bitcoin with its pros and cons so they would be aware. That way they would know to themselves that its their responsibility that they choose to to take the path you are taking, which is involved risk, this way it could really prevent of bad relationship. You could teach the basics, we have demo account right? But never told and spoonfed them as they will rely all the things to you.
