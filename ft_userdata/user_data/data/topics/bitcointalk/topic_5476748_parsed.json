  "content": "Starting out on the Bitcointalk forum as a newbie is like stepping into a maze of conversations, filled with lots of topics about technical stuff and market talk. Even though the forum is a great place for Bitcoin fans, it can be tricky for beginners. This topic is about the problems newbies face after their sign-up process and why we need simpler screens when you first join. There is contemplation of where to start and how to interact with the forum.  I believe there have not been any technical updates on the forum for a long time now. When I say technical update here, I am emphasizing specifically redesigning the Bitcointalk UI and adding a few onboarding screens to help newbies. In the meantime, I feel like these screens would help newbies find the right topics more easily to learn or start their Bitcointalk journey.",

I agree with you on this upgrade but as you said there is almost no technical update on this forum regarding to the UI but small improvements are made or maybe I came to know about them recently. This will help newbies but I wonder how difficult it will be for a newbie to understand this forum.I faced difficulty too because I was not used to such layout, I thought it would be more handy like social media are, I can say one thing for sure is, this platform's view will be difficult for those who used to spend more time on many social media applications and when they will get to use this forum they might find things old and out of date and at the first place they will hate the forum's layout too.But with time they will come to like it and hate other's like I am hating other forums but loving this layout. Are you an developer, I asked due to your username.",

I guess most Newbies failed to visit that page though it is clearly seen on the homepage",

I was about to say the same thing as these things you've mentioned are about as enough guide as a newbie can ask for except he's asking we have a virtual tour guide that will help newbies settle better on the forum.  That's by the way, though. The forum is a place where you have to acclimate yourself with by taking time to browse and even make research beforw making a post but it's like what most newbies are most concerned with after registering is to make their first post. And sometimes, when these helpful guidelines are being given, they seldom read it and feel they need to be spoonfed every step of the way, hence you find them making blunders.",

Ever since I joined the forum as a newbie, the design of the forum has been like this and I don’t remember any day that I feel the UI design doesn’t suit the taste of a newbie that I was then. This forum UI design is explicitly defined and simple to navigate around as a newbie. If you’re ready to go through the forum and learn new things, it won’t be hard for you to get use to the UI design. If you check other forums, they are not simply user friendly as this one, so requesting for a new face to the forum is not something realistic.",

      "body": "I don't think the forum is as complicated as some threads suggest here because the forum is an all encompassing platform with a pool of resources drawn from different varieties of topics and boards to choose from and learn gradually. Aside that, you can use the search bar located at the top right corner of the webpage and type whatever comes to your mind as a newbie there and you will see some results drawn from different related threads on this forum.As a newbie, my first advise is to take your first few days to tour around the forum, starting from the 'Help' button and skim through the help support provided By the forum to understand the information contained herein.Secondly, I will advise the newbie to come to the Beginners and Help board to learn some basic knowledge about Bitcoin and FAQs asked about this forum by other beginners in the forum. I learnt a lot about the forum then using the Beginners and Help board and can remember opening the pages one by one till over 10 pages were viewed and each of the board's page have 20 threads on it and l made sure I skimmed through them.Now, I don't want everyone to go that far from the beginning because that much information alone, scared me away from the forum a bit before I summoned more courage and continue but of course I got knowledge on different things.Lastly, is the search bar. Always use the search bar to search for a topic you have in mind before creating a new one. You can also use keywords to search for related topics of interest, until you don't find any, then you can create a new thread so you don't have to create what has already been created by someone else.",
