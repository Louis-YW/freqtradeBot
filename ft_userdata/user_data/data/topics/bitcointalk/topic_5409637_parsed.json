After 1st March you'll be able to close your investments and withdraw funds from YOLOdice.What did you do in last more than one year since March 2021?",

I think Stake team know about the service closing of Yolodice so if OP has more deposits from non Yolodice sources, Stake should not play the hard card by only asking about evidence of deposits from Yolodice.",

So I don't know how your chances are but if you keep asking the site to provide you information that help you to login into your wallet, they may not provide that for you but keep asking for what they ask from you to provide because that will show you are the real owner. Try harder to search for it and maybe you can stumble on it. We need to be careful about the KFC and other information we have, they should be written down in a safe and secured place.",
