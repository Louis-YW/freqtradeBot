  "content": "I'm tired to read all the comments in the vein of \"the SEC is threatening the crypto world\" or \"the SEC wants Bitcoin to stay small\".  The SEC's action against Coinbase and Binance has quite clear accusations: these exchanges allowed trading of securities without being authorized to do so. And they offered services like \"staking\" which are quite similar to bank products and thus also need authorization.Is any of these accusations related to Bitcoin? No. The SEC has already clarified that Bitcoin is not a security. So the accusations have nothing to do with Bitcoin.Instead, the accusations are deeply related to the mess the altcoin world has become in the last years, mostly since the \"ICO craze\" of 2017/18. More than 95% of all altcoins, I would estimate 98-99%, are managed in a completely centralized way, with a team in charge of everything collecting large profits. The most notorious example are the premines. These businesses create coins out of thin air - just a \"bug\" of the fiat world many Bitcoiners want to \"fix\" - to pay for marketing, bounties and shills with tokens. These tokens and coins are ... securities.You don't have to be even a Bitcoin maximalist - I tolerate altcoins with decentralized components and ICOs which are clearly focused on a non-crypto product - to see that these developments have nothing to do with Satoshi's ideal of a decentralized peer to peer cash.So let's calm down. This is not against Bitcoin. It's against shady business models where companies pretend they are decentralized but aren't, and want a cheaper and less consumer-protecting way to finance their businesses (or directly run away with your money). And it's also about crypto exchanges pretending they aren't banks - but they are, as long as they offer products like so-called \"staking\" (which nothing has to do with real proof-of-stake).It brings me hope that Bitcoin seems to be the least affected by the last price drop after the SEC accusations. People seem to begin to understand",

Some time I wonder how those exchange operates or think,  because being centralized means 100% regulatory compliance, why to operate a subsidiary of those exchange without properly getting the license from the authorities of the region you operate, The highest effect this crisis between the exchange vs SEC will have on decentralized coin (Bitcoin ) is the short-term impact it will have on the price of Bitcoin but in the long run,  Bitcoin is going to recover in price and move ahead.",

However: These businesses are not monopolies. I for example do not use neither Binance nor Coinbase and it's absolutely no issue (I'm however not in the US). Consumers themselves have to be a bit wary about the services they use, and which services they offer.The problem is that some services, like the centralized \"staking\" I mentioned, have become so common, and even \"diehard\" Bitcoiners have partly fell in love with them, because they can give them some easy profits. But even a superficial glimpse on them shows that centralized staking is 100% a product which would need an authorization as a bank in most countries (not only the US).And until now nothing is lost - those wanting to exit these exchanges can still do it. Yes, that can lead to a problematic \"bank run\" with frozen withdrawals and bankrupt exchanges. But MtGox has shown us in 2014 that it's never a good idea to leave lots of funds on exchanges (Yep, and I know of the problem that professional traders need funds on exchanges. That's their inherent business risk, that's why they can make profit). The best thing would actually be people withdrawing slowly to other platforms, diversificating the market.Quote from: Flexystar on June 16, 2023, 07:01:26 PMNow, its big world and there are many people so we can't ask everyone to bend their minds to use decentralized platforms and that's different story so they are going to use these handy tools which ultimately fails bitcoin.I don't think all centralized exchanges will come under attack from SEC. There are still some that do not offer products like staking, and they can limit altcoin tradings to non-security coins. Or close the door definitively for US customers. We sometimes forget that the US has only 3 or 4% of the world's inhabitants Quote from: Flexystar on June 16, 2023, 07:01:26 PMAlso, with the time SEC gonna put hard burden in Bitcoin's operation so it's still not entirely true what you mentioned about them.

      "body": "Maybe it's a good thing or a bad thing for Bitcoin. Still yet to see it through. With this price drop, in which Bitcoin is less affected, I guess now people will realize the potential about Bitcoin. Those centralized shits are just here for their own benefits. Offering what they can't provide, and they have nothing similar or even close to Bitcoin. I am also against staking that offers you this and that. But in reality, it's just another way to use its users and take advantage of them. Then again, the market runs on sentiments. The effect is low, but it does hurt the Bitcoin a little NGL. So if people can understand the facts and move towards Bitcoin, then it's a good thing. SEC could also target Bitcoin in secret and in that process, if they become successful, then it's gonna hurt bad. As of now, it is still unclear to decide what is going on and what will come next",

Does it mean the SEC is letting bitcoin be? out of the blues, SEC that wanted bitcoin regulated is indirectly saying; bitcoin is above our capabilities. Nobody solely stands for bitcoin, who will they go for if they're after bitcoin. Unlike the CEX operating like banks in mediums that seem to help bitcoin rise, but are turns in bitcoin's flesh, the SEC can easily get the CEO of any CEX and fine them over illicit actions and activities happening on the exchange. If the SEC eliminates those shitcoins bitcoin will have a breathing space and investors can invest without fear of losing money. Many investors fall for shitcoins because they want to become early adoptors of the coin, they invest so much money, hoping to hit huge profits when the price of the shitcoin turns 1 or 3 dollars. If the money thrown into shitcoins is channeled to bitcoin, they would have been a better and price of bitcoin today. Out of greed investors get ripped of their money and end up with nothing.",

If US government or SEC can regulate crypto exchanges, it means they also regulate crypto as a whole.The first sentence is correct. But the second is not. As I wrote above, Bitcoin (and a very limited set of altcoins) have no character of securities, because they lack a centralized \"issuer\".

Are they going to be regulated?The SEC cannot \"regulate altcoins\" if they weren't issued in the US and aren't targeted to US customers. They can only regulate companies offering services with them and create their revenue/income from these services, e.g. offering trading, \"staking\" etc.. That's a big difference.They can also not regulate altcoins which are not securities. But ~98% of them have the character of a security because they've a centralized issuer. One of the few coins which aren't a security is Monero, there are also smaller coins like Groestlcoin and Namecoin which are decentralized enough. Litecoin is already an edge case (due to its instamine accusation) but I think probability is high that the SEC wouldn't consider it a security, in Europe I'd be confident it would not be regulated by the upcoming MiCa crypto regulation.QuotePlus even if they did only intend to attack shitcoins and not bitcoins, their attempts had left bitcoin in a pretty precarious state price-wise.That's because many traders panicked and sold, and whales made money shorting the coins because traders are dumbly dumping their precious BTC If hodlers would understand what this SEC thingy is really about, then they wouldn't have reacted this way, and the price perhaps would be still at 27K (by the way, we're over 26K again).(BTW: for better understanding of the OP I added a sentence which hopefully helps to clarify what I meant, in bold.)",

I couldn't have said it better myself. The ICO craze has stained any possible innovation that could have alternatively used a bitcoin-like beginning, being a decentralized form of distribution and a decentralized, consensus-based network with a core team of developers. Instead, projects tried to jump-start their idea with the innovation of smart-contracts, and whether they had good or bad intentions had resulted in a permanent stain on the ability to cultivate innovation via a token/altcoin. In short - Everything going on with the SEC is good for Bitcoin. Less centralized exchange activity and their listing of new & highly speculative coins, more highlight on decentralized exchanges, and increased validation that Bitcoin is not a security.",
