If you just post garbage, you will never get even 1 merit point, and you will therefore never be able to put links in your signature, etc.Quote from: _act_ on October 13, 2023, 12:37:22 PMPeople are trying to rank higher and get into campaign is what people nowadays see has its benefit. To rank higher, join a signature campaign and earn bitcoin.I think if everyone is being realistic, the campaign is what is driving traffic into the forum daily, a lot of people probably got interested to joining Bitcointalk when they heard they can earn Bitcoins from signature campaigns But then, the merit system has discouraged a lot of them, an probably they gave up before they even started.",

In other words, here would have been filled with garbageposts. The merit system have eradicated all that as shitty post will not even get any attention. If you observe the forum, you will notice that high ranking members post in a manner that you can actually see that they are experienced and deserve their ranks. They don't go about opening threads that lacks substance. Instead, they opening great threads and contribute to discussions meaningfully. Finally, I think earning merits regularly is a sign that you are making meaning contribution to discussions in the forum.",

And based on your rank, you may get different benefits. You have to understand what this merit system is and why it was implemented. The merit system helps reduce spam and shitty posts. It's not a 100% fool proof system, but it's still doing its work like a charm. If you compare before and after the merit system was introduced, you'll see a massive difference in post quality. Those who understand it's significant are trying so hard to earn merit and rank up. Ranking up has its own benefits. You can join different bitcoin and altcoin signature campaigns that are happening in the forum. The payroll depends on your rank. Higher ranked members get massive payments weekly. If you were a legendary member, you may get 200-250 dollars worth of BTC on average per week. Sometimes it may vary, but I think you got what I tried to tell you.",

One of the advantages I know is that we can increase our rank by earning merit and activities.Other than getting your rank up, there are no meaning or purpose of the merit system, but many people here on btt judges you on the basis of merits (ranks) if you will have lower merit means lesser rank then they will might consider you newbie, but sometimes, you are not some newbie even though your rank is senior or full member but if you have 2k merits then you will be given the same respect as we gave to legendaries. Just to point out, only few people keep track of to whom, five how much respect, not every member. Because if you are newbie and made mistake then you will be based by others but if you are legendary and made some mistake while writing the post, then you will be not bashed instead you will be corrected.You might not like this, but it is what it is. And another feature of merit system is, if you have more merits w.r.t your activity then you will be preferred by many sig Compaign managers, as they will give you more priority but let me tell you, not every manager follow this rule. So, try not to go after ranks only, try to be genuine here and share your opinions and on the way, you will gain respect, with your shared opinions, and you will also gain ranks and merits too.",

If that is the case, we have various thread where you can report your posts for review and get merit if they are worthy. Some members when they see probably a merit source or a another member gives out merit more often to another user they think they are close or have some familiarity. Yes the familiarity might come from how the user getting the merits post and the other member gets attracted to his post and nothing of a friendship. There are many users that haven’t got interaction with one another and they have received the most merit from them. The best way to get merit to me is by staying constant pushing to contribute to the forum. You can as well learn how to make them by reading posts of prominent members that get them frequently. Quote from: bitnote on October 13, 2023, 02:50:51 PMNow I know one more reason: for getting paid more in signature campaigns.This also is not a reason why it is here. The only two genuine reason is to use it to separate ranks, aside the activity issue. With merit it means you achieved that rank with your contribution to the forum. The other one is to discourage spammers and low quality posters, once people do not get merit for there posts they get frustrated and that reduces the number of spammers.",
