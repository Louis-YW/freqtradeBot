I also found the bitmain https://shop.bitmain.com/support/download firmware page, but chrome says \"virus detected\" so not sure wth...also, there were a ton of options, so wasn't sure which one to download.My idea is to lower the freq to run it at around 1000W with 120v.thanks in advance",

If it won't fry some wires and hash board your lucky.The latest s9 firmware has multi-option under working mode you can underclock the unit to run it at low power mode.Or if you want to manually set the power as I said above you need to flash it with modded firmware like Braiins OS.",
