  "content": "I was looking for some coins to buy in the market,and I discovered that Solana price is too low for me to use huge amount of money to buy and hold like the way I have used my salary to purchased Bitcoin last month. Solana price has decreased to $19 few days ago that made me to ask if the price will increase to $40 this year, do you believe Solana investors will experience $40 or more than $40 this year? I have seen many massive moved of other coins price that made me to feel the same with Solana price because am very ready to invest in Solana, if I can get positive answers from this topic.",

Sometimes I wonder if they are only waiting for bitcoin price surg since most of the altcoin are being driven by bitcoin price.I would suggest keep increasing your bag with more fractions of bitcoin instead of altcoin.",

Quote from: Sebas.tian on March 15, 2023, 04:00:55 PMdo you believe Solana investors will experience $40 or more than $40 this year? That price is far from the ATH and just talking about possibilities, yeah that's possible for this year and it's just a 2x move for it from the current price that it has got. But as adaseb said, if you're investing based on what lies about that project, I'd also do the same. Although I'm not a thorough type of investor for altcoins, it's known to me about its outage issue and that's what I don't like to take on for a project that I'll invest every penny that I've got.",

For a long time they made us think that this coin was going to be the \"ethereum killer\".  This was done by doing very good marketing on social media and with influencers talking bout it.When the 'bear market' started Solana like rest of Crypto market I think the hype behind it started to die down.  I remember when solana was priced at a all time high of $259 per coin last November and to see it now at $20 per coin so many people lost alot.",

Maybe this is still not my priority in this space, looking back after a cycle where it came and fell after the FTX crash. I'm not too impressed with the pump project with big funds, an environment where I see a shark tank and we fall into it will just be all for those who are waiting.

Regarding price speculation, the $40 mark is possible during the bull market season but associated risks are more than alternative cryptos. The competition may lead to decreased market value for SOL but we never know what is next in this volatile industry.It all depends on the market. Right now the market have turned bullish, following the bitcoin move the price might reach $40 based on the price of bitcoin. However from the price range of $20 to $40 it takes time. On the other side more accusations against solana is the reason why the market isn't that good. If not this could've been at its best competence against the leading altcoins. Even now it is at good position, but more investors left solana and began to invest on other altcoins.",

However, the expectation of Sol reaching $40 in 2023 is not too difficult, I think that price will approach when BTC appreciates to $30,000 -$40000.The excitement is slowly returning, and congrats to everyone who will receive ARB, hope you guys don't waste those funds on dev teams",

Indeed what is behind this project, and knowing how FTX fails then it will take down Solana as well , so why need to risk in this one when there are many altcoins or even Bitcoin that we can put our money in more safer manner .now unless this will be pricing cheapest like a dollar then why not buy to keep holding.",

I think, this year will not be like last year to Solana investors because Solana team will do what will make the price of Solana to increase in a way both long term and short term investors will believe that the price will hit $40 before the end of December 2023.Based on the feedback I got from people in this topic, make me to change my mind not to invest all my capital in Solana in case the price change negatively in the market I will not feel bad about it.",

(...)After what happened to FTX Exchange, that's the time I left the Solana network and moved to other networks, it's just sad because Solana is the best especially if you are into DeFi and the small person who does small transactions because the fees are extremely cheap compared to these new layer 2 networks that are EVM based.Now the TVL of the Solana network is being overtaken by these layer 2 networks. I believe Solana for sure will fix these issues, especially the outages and I believe in the future Solana will be back just like before.",
