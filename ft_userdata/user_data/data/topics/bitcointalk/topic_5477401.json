The only real disadvantage I feel is the exorbitant transaction fees which we see during network congestion or bull run it's something which creates hurdle when we want to make some transaction on urgent basis and you realise transaction fees are more or equal to the value you wanna transfer.",

Volatility is like a regulator for Bitcoin, it stables everything, and that's why brings in more adopters and that's what also create winners.It's normal that not everyone will accept Bitcoin generally, it's a decentralized digital asset, and that use case isn't for everyone anyways, I am into Bitcoin not only because I can make money by holding it for the long term, I also need the decentralization badly because of what and what my government have been doing with it's people, monitoring your income stream and your bank account is normal to them.If money is lost in your bank account you have the bank to blame and they can get it back for you, but Bitcoin gives you total custody of your asset, you are in control and if you misplace your recovery seed or private key its your own fault, if you can't take responsibility you should not buy Bitcoin.",

The volatility of Bitcoin gives us the reason to hold it for so long because of how it fluctuates, without such, I don't think people will hold it.Quote from: Barikui1 on December 11, 2023, 07:53:49 AM* It's not generally accepted by all.Not yet.Quote from: Barikui1 on December 11, 2023, 07:53:49 AM* It can be stolen if your system is hacked.We all should be accountable for anything bad happens to our computers and wallets. A penetration won't actually happen if you don't do anything with your PC or wallet. Unless you download something malicious, there's no way a hacker will find and penetrate to your system.Quote from: Barikui1 on December 11, 2023, 07:53:49 AM* It's almost near impossible to retrieve if sent to the wrong address.It's actually impossible to retrieve it unless the receiver sends it back. But here me out, how are you going to send it to the wrong address if there are too many characters consists per wallet address. The only way to make this happen is when you copy a wrong address and become a victim of a copy paste malware.",

That's why no matter how risky bitcoin is due to its high volatility, people chose to take its risk rather than avoid it.However, those disadvantages you've mentioned will only be possible if you rush investing in bitcoin without educating yourself first. As an investor, you should know your investment well, otherwise instead of seeing it as a means to make you rich in the future, it might be the reason to see you struggling in your finances or worst made you homeless in the end.All types of investment has its own risk and rewards.

I am aware of the risk and rewards in holding Bitcoin for long, but I just have a great feeling about it as a long term thinker.Now currently around $42.3k, I’m actually at a nice profit where I bought BTC somewhere between $19k to $23k range. But I didn’t sell my BTCs as I am in no rush and I just live within my means by strict budgeting even for Holiday season. Even if there are more sell-offs earlier and even almost touching $40k, I don’t mind as I understand there were many who wanted to TP to spend for the Holidays and we cannot control them.I really appreciate the potential risks and rewards of holding BTC as it’s dominance is way higher and it may continue until next year.",

And being a BTC enthusiasts I will say it is also better than fiat, because our funds in fiat can also be stolen if the system got hacked, and we can send funds mistakenly from one place to another even in fiat. But we don't have to face the first two disadvantages in fiat.

I still consider ourselves as early adopters but in compared to the 2010 to 2015 we are not. Well, the point is, it can't make us filthy rich until the next 10 ro 20 years. I do agree with other factor by the way. Well, the point is, we should not judge any currency on the basis of money it can make for us, because many people consider BTC as currency while other assume it as asset.

Therefore, it's not peculiar to Bitcoin but all assets and services online.About the high volatility, I see this as a blessing, not a disadvantage as you claimed. The volatility means more money for experienced traders and investors like me. And for acceptance, it comes gradually, Bitcoin is still very new, it can't be accepted by all at once and it's not all services you see online that is accepted by all. Lastly, about the retrieval of the coin if sent to a wrong address, while that's the fault of the person, also note that it is the sacrifice we must all pay for the privacy and decentralization of Bitcoin.",
