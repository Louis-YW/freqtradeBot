      "body": "That’s insane, nature is damn impressive, look at the size of that thing. Their digestive systems are so interesting to study, literally swallowing their prey whole & slowly digesting them. The fact that they won’t need to eat for a long time after a meal that size is fascinating.Obviously it’s a real tragedy & may she rest in peace. This is Mother Nature right there though, Grandma ended up lower down in the food chain than that hungry snake sadly.",

      "body": "I was completely shocked to hear that a 22 ft python would be capable or even able to swallow a whole human. I would not be able to imagine being a family member of the missing grandmother and finding out that a monster python killed her, it must be very devastating.The environment where police found the monstrous python was a forest in Indonesia and in those parts of the world, I believe the villagers some be more cautious of their surroundings. I probably would want to move to a city and get away as far as possible from any snakes if this ever happened to someone that I knew.",
