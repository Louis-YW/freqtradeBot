  "content": "Wikipedia defines screen time as the amount of time spent using a device with a screen such as a smartphone, computer, television or a video game console. After years of willfully keeping away from the steering wheel, I finally decided to go in and get a license to drive a vehicle. Time for a vision test and I’m like, this would be real easy. I was so wrong. I had always thought I’ve got perfect eye sight as I could see quite clearly from a distance. I couldn’t pick out the small figures and alphabets that was displayed as they became blurry as I tried to focus on it. After lots of awkward smiles and pleading with my eyes, I passed the vision test with the minimum score. I recently went in to get my eyes checked and it’s likely I would need a prescription glasses. I read quite a lot and have slowly been deviating from paperback to reading on the kindle over the years. Been advised to cut back on my screen time but I had thought as I’m not old, my eyesight would remain hawk eyed. I was wrong. I would like to advise y’all to cut back on your screen time if you can. Put down your devices and take a walk or something. Our eyes grow weak with age but they also get weaker at a much faster pace when continuously strained. There are loads of eye defects that you may just be able to prevent With a healthy diet. These eye defects creep in slowly and would go unnoticed until it blossoms and becomes difficult to cure or manage. We could try and include fishes like salmon, sardines; nuts and legumes  like walnuts, cashews( fruits like oranges and grapefruits; eggs and a whole lot of water in our diet. I’ve learnt water does a lot of things in the body apart from regulation of our body temperature. We all need to take better care of our eyes as well as cutting back on some screen time.",

      "body": "Yeah. Prolonged exposure to screens is nothing new and there's still a lot of debate as to what extent it affects our health. But even if the dangers aren't as serious as they once were believed to be, great eye strain is still no fun, so we definitely shouldn't take it lightly. So if you notice that your eyes are acting up, let them relax for a little while. Your eyes will thank you later. When in doubt, take a break from your screen and rest your fatigued peepers. Cut back on eye strain. Add some Omega 3s to your diet, get some exercise and sunlight, and you'll be good as new!",

      "body": "Life has been made simplified for us to enjoy the best out of it but due to our human low esteem to information and education and we have failed to make utilization of the things around us in providing a solution to some of our problems faced in daily live, vision normally works with taking a good and balanced diet without a need of correcting it, but the environment we live in has been polluted by many human activities that has now rendered ot unsafe, same way lack of proper and adequate nutrition causes poor vision, this same people also spend much time on the screen to fulfill some daily obligated tasks on the screen, yet they never learn to optimize the effect by using lenses or reducing the brightness or sometimes switching to dark mode.",

Not the best display on a device for sure as it comes with some dirty brown colouration but it's does it's bit. Sadly, phones are hardly the only devices there is that we are exposed to daily. Our TV sets for instance, working systems, etc. A yet go notice them on these devices or perhaps developers weren't putting much in consideration but in all, phones is where most of us gets exposed a lot due to how attached the device is always with us.Quote from: Dunamisx on November 16, 2022, 08:55:14 PMLike OP rightly stated, it's never a problem until it blossoms. Its the same with the climate change we've got today. It was largely of no concern at a time and even now, so many would continue to ignore but, for the few that do believe, we could only try and hope for the best.It's just the way of the world.",

      "body": "My screen time is a little embarrassing to be honest. I sometimes clock up 7-8 hours per day of phone screen time. I should find something more constructive to do with my time. It’s tough when you’re so engrossed in online life & charts. Sometimes it’s good to just leave your phone & all devices at home. Fresh air is good, going for walks & things like that are good for you.",
