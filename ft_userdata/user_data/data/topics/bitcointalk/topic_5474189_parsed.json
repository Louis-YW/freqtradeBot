The statement was published on Nov. 10. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published the CARF in 2022. Developed from an April 2021 mandate from the G20, the CARF framework requires reporting on the type of cryptocurrency and digital asset transaction — whether through an intermediary or a service provider.\"China and Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, and Turkey and most African countries are not on this list.",

China will be forced to accept certain points of this agreement because this country has many trade relations. The United Arab Emirates has also done a lot over the past 10 years for financial control.",

The target here is to have the biggest economist of the world into this information sharing agreement. If some small economics are not in this list, it doesn't impact anything. China and Hong Kong are out of the list because of some of some obvious reasons. But as long as you have the big economics sharing information with each other, the goal is fulfilled.",

CMIIW.I read a lot of legislation and one important conclusion I came to is that if you use centralized services, then expect that all your transactions will be transferred to your government and your tax service. Then you will be ready to formalize everything correctly legally and pay taxes.The statute of limitations for tax crimes varies widely across countries.",

At the very least in my country, you'll get taxed automatically if you use any centralized services. As far as I know, there won't be a penalty if you forget to report it on your yearly tax report, and there is no tax on your crypto savings until you sell them, AFAIK. I feel like this might change if they need more money from the crypto community. Hopefully, they will make it easier to calculate and pay them instead of indirectly trying to make people get sanctioned for supposedly hiding their wealth.",

Of course, all of these exchanges have an agreement that they can require KYC at any time. I use them for small exchanges of a few hundred dollars if I need to sell something.From exampleshttps://www.mexc.com/",

But most of them don't provide what I need (such as my country's fiat withdrawal, etc), which means I stick with local exchanges or P2P. So far they don't require any crazy KYC requirements so it is still fine for me. I think this will stay for a while. Probably be a year or so until the government introduces a new law, if any, since elections and stuff might bring new personnel to the government that have different beliefs from their predecessors.",

This may be used as a pressure card on these countries to obtain certain concessions at a later time.As for why most African countries were excluded, I could not determine the real reasons, since these countries participating in the CARF agreement are trying to control Crypto by including the largest number of countries.",

Flee to UAE and drop all G20 clients?     Common be serious!You really need to understand the differences between an office, headquarters and countries where you're licensed to operate.Ferrari for example has an office in Hong Kong, do you think it's relevant?",

Although I think I know the differences between them well. but it's okay.In any case, I do not want to expand the debate further so that we do not become sidetracked. In any case, I believe that even if these companies do not have headquarters in the Emirates or Hong Kong, they will do so later due to the United States’ hostile policy towards Crypto, and The open policy of these countries towards crypto.Thank you.",
