      "body": "Unironically friendly basketball matches can end up in a tie, no matter how counter-intuitive it may sound.By rule, a basketball match can never end in a tie...but in friendly matches, both teams/coaches can mutually agree not to play overtime if the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter...reasons being injured players/fatigue/schedule, etc. I've seen it happen many times before. Here are a few examples from just this week:https://www.flashscore.com/match/2ewliWt3/#/match-summaryhttps://www.flashscore.com/match/2iPVojND/#/match-summaryhttps://www.flashscore.com/match/GOvx1tRe/#/match-summary  (this one had an overtime played, but still ended up in a tie)Some of those friendly matches can't be even called friendlies, rather sparring matches...they remind me of those joint practices NFL teams have in preseason.",

Some bookmakers have it written like Sb in brackets some don't, but it does almost always include overtime (should there be one played). Quote from: Jorjorjo1234 on September 14, 2023, 06:52:34 AM1. I can find more examples from the friendly matchesi with overtime. Even if it is true that a friendly match can be a draw, then why can't you write about it? Or is it a random situation and players need to guess whether they will play overtime or not, is that really fair in your opinion?I'd be surprised if there is a single bookmaker in the world where in their rules/terms and conditions is mentioned that a friendly basketball match can end in a tie. It is the responsibility of the bettors to know that even if it is an uncommon occurrence, it can happen.Quote from: Jorjorjo1234 on September 14, 2023, 06:52:34 AM2.https://sportsbet.io/help-centre/help-place-a-bet/help-placing-a-bet-general-betting-rules/basketballHere is the basketball beting rules from sportsbet.io and: In the event that a match does not finish in a tie, but overtime is played for qualification purposes, the markets will be settled according to the result at the end of regular time. You even considered the situation where there is no draw but overtime is played, but not where they played a draw game and overtime is not played. It is just your fault not to descripe that situation in the rules.\"but overtime is played for qualification purposes\"I'm pretty positive it refers to two-legged ties based on aggregate score. For example, team A wins game1 90-75 but loses game2 80-65, then overtime is played to determine which team should advance to the next round.Quote from: Jorjorjo1234 on September 14, 2023, 06:52:34 AM3. Support said in the conversation that a nba summer league game could ended with a tie, please give me a example about that. Or is the support using this reason to dismiss me?If the support refers to the main Las Vegas summer league, then the information is incorrect. There is overtime played.",

It indicates includes overtime to all matches with or without overtime. It doesn’t mean that the match needs to be on overtime when it’s tie. It’s your choice of match and it end up in tie with the game specific rules not sportsbet rules. I will understand your concern if your bet is a match winner without tie as an option but you bet on a game with handicap so you technically lose when the game end in tie. The including overtime note is intended to all the games that will have overtime. It’s not necessary that all the games should be in overtime once tied because you knew it by yourself that it’s a friendly match so this scenario is possible.",

      "body": "Back in the day bookies used to offer only spread, moneyline, and over/under on most games. There was no with OT or without OT. If you bet a team -3 and the team won by exactly 3 the bet ended up being a wash. Nowdays they have added the draw option in there and if you bet team A -3 and they win by exactly 3, you are a loser. You should have bet on Draw to win. It's a little shady IMO but it's clear. It gives the casino a little more house advantage  is all i'm saying. I don't think it's fair to title your thread \"DO NOT BET ANYMORE ON SPORTSBET.IO, wrong bet decision on unusual match\" when it's clear that you do not understand what happened even when people are trying to explain it to you. Yes, it sucks, but you should be aware of the rules of a match if you're going to make a bet. The bookie themselves did nothing wrong here, if you want to be angry or disappointed, you should direct your frustration to yourself for not knowing the rules.",

The bookie themselves did nothing wrong here, if you want to be angry or disappointed, you should direct your frustration to yourself for not knowing the rules. It is not roulette and the casino doesnt need house advantage since they already has it in their quotes.It is just like a football game that could ended in 80 minutes or 70 minutes where you have no idea how they will play.Im not playing casino, it is sportsbet where all the rules should be clear. Sure I should know that the game could ended with a tie, but how should I know that if I already bet on a game before that also played OT as friendly game? And I am disappointed to the wrong information from the support, where they try to lying to me.The site itsself has nothing to do with your bet man. You're not getting it. The site did not call the team representative and say, \"don't play overtime so we can fuck this bettor over\". That decision was made by the teams playing. The game was recorded as a tie, and sportsbet is paying bets that picked correctly. You picked incorrectly and it is your responsibility to know that the teams could decide against playing overtime, not the sites responsibility to inform you of the rules of the league. Here's an example I hope you understand. Let's say I live in a place where marijuana is legal. I can smoke all day long or visit a shop and buy it. Then I decide to move to a place where it is not legal, but I didn't know that. I smoke a joint like I used to and a cop sees me and arrests me. Well, I didn't know the law here is not going to get me out of trouble. If I am moving, it is my responsibility to know the laws where I am moving to. Same as the bet you made, it is your responsibility to be informed. Google is your friend. The site has nothing to do with anything.You are mad, I get it. I don't think stomping your feet like a kid is going to help you here though.",

I used to bet a lot on basketball and this bet looks just like the same. (Theres a incl overtime so I thought there must be an overtime in basketball match)Then I start to asking the support in this case and I got only as response that the score is official and they will not void my bet.After that I checked the another club friendly basketball matches and theres always an overtime.Matches:https://i.postimg.cc/761Bd63g/match1.jpghttps://i.postimg.cc/qqMGFGMT/match2.jpghttps://i.postimg.cc/66YcvFY5/match3.jpghttps://i.postimg.cc/P58Q0JhP/match4.jpgand my match looks like:https://i.postimg.cc/8CQmGGPw/match.jpgChat conversation with support: https://i.postimg.cc/FsYyJzYD/support1.jpghttps://i.postimg.cc/QMJ1rWzx/support2.jpgSportsbet.io support keeps saying that the score is official and final. But everyone knows that the game was unusual because every basketball match has overtime. Support also said that the nba summer league ended without overtime, but doesnt give me any answer to explain this.If there is a match without overtime, you should not write it next to the bet-market that it is incl overtime to confusion the players. If you say for a club friendly match it is normal without overtime, why does another club friend game has overtime? Should we as player guess if there is a overtime or not??Even the score is official, but it is not the basketball match we know anymore. So image a football-game that only has 70 minutes... the score is official but the playtime is not meet the conditions.So as a player who has been playing on sportsbet.io for a long time, I do not recommend that you play on sportsbet.io anymore because there is  lots of suspicious things.I see no problems to settle this bet as loss. Why whine at trustpilot? Do you think you will get money back?Get a life ffs.",
