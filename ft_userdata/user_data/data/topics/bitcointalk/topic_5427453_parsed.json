Iâ€™m asking this because I need to prove that Chips is looking on there customer data from other casino. I want to see whatâ€™s the discussion before they accused you of cheating on Rollbit. Much better to post complete screenshot by parts. I really want to help you to establish your case.I only have these images because my account was banned. First of all, they asked me to confirm this KYC, I confirmed.I had $6000 in my account at the time. Then, when the money in my account doubled and $ 15,500, they said that I was abusing Rollbit and your account would be closed. This is exactly the case.Did they tell you that or you yourself told them that you are abusing Rollbit?I'm just trying to understand everything since as as far as I know Chips.gg has build a reputation already here. And I'm not sure if casinos are sharing information amongst themselves because I don't that they are doing it although it is possible.Anyhow as others said, move it to Scam Accusations board.Chips told me, When I asked Rollbit about this, she said they don't share data.",

I want to understand furthermore how Rollbit brought up to his issue just to ban his account. I want to be fair here before jumping into conclusion but Iâ€™m sensing that Chips.gg point out an irregularities to the OP while OP stated that he is doing this same method on Rollbit. This is just my assumption because itâ€™s odd for a CS to brought up other casino name out of nowhere. Using other casino as an excuse doesn't prove anything. Â This simply show that the casino has no valid proof to Â throw against the player. Â And it is funny how to casino exchange information of their players. Â That is very unethical. I know that itâ€™s unethical if the Chips reps is the who one who brought up. Iâ€™m asking for a more clarification on how they come up to that statement because the evidence is crop. If you read my statement, I want to determine whether the OP brought up his status with Rollbit or not. Thereâ€™s no need to lecture about how unethical casino because I encounter a lot in the past. You are just repeating other user statement above.Iâ€™m asking a clarification and complete evidence that will make this case strong against the casino. Thereâ€™s a lot of issue like this that turns out that accuser is the one abusing and using the forum user to support him by providing manipulated evidence.Quote from: BarmyBasket on December 09, 2022, 08:49:09 AMChips : They say my fault is just Rollbit abusing. If I have another crime, they can come here and explain it with their evidence. If they are right, I will delete this thread and apologize to them.Can you post the conversation before that accusation statement.
