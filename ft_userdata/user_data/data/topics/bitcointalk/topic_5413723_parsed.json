There are lots in places like Birmingham that are fairly reasonable.https://www.guardiansofthearches.org.uk/tenant-support/https://www.thearchco.com/I know several people who have successfully mined in arches. Fairly cheap and well equipped for it.",

Quick google search result[1-2] shows electricity price ranging from 0.2 to 0.26 GBP ($0.22 to $0.29) per kWH.Quote from: BitMaxz on September 16, 2022, 03:53:51 PMOr I think looking for colocation with cheap electricity rate might be your best solution than trying to mine in the UK with very expensive Electricity rate. It's likely OP will find one located outside UK though. If OP already own the ASIC, it means additional cost on international shipping.[1] https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/electricity-price[2] https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/quarterly-energy-prices-september-2022Actually, UK electricity rates for new business contracts are currently coming in around £0.85 - £0.90 per kWh, which is around $1.00 per kWh.An S19 Pro 100T generates around £5.86 worth of Bitcoin per day, and will cost £60.18 to generate that £5.86 of Bitcoin (at assumed rate of £0.85), for a total loss of £54.32 per day, per S19 100T!So unless you have free electricity, or have a current contract with very low rates, UK is not the place to be thinking about mining.",
