      "body": "Quote from: alexviana on February 02, 2023, 07:18:56 PMHello friends! I have some doubts and maybe someone here can clarify some of them. Before that, I’ll tell you a little about my relationship with betting. (It will be a long text, sorry! hahaha And I thank those who can read until the end)My SKYPE login and contact email is: alexvianapoker@gmail.comIn case this type of subject is not allowed here in the forum and you can help me by chatting thereSince my beginnings in sports betting, I realized that the best and least risky way to profit (in my case) involved betting with bonuses.Obviously, whenever I found an attractive bonus, usually 100%, without very absurd and impossible rollovers, I would do itHowever, over time, sites with good bonuses became scarcer, harder to findWhen a good one appears, either the rollover is too high or it only exists for certain types of deposit methodsHere in South America, unlike the European and North American markets, users generally used virtual wallets. Basically it was Moneybookers (later and now Skrill) and Neteller. Shortly after EcopayzThese virtual wallets easily allow the same customer to create several of them, obviously with different names and data.So, as the good bonuses became more and more rare, I thought: why not just turn my attention to the best bonuses? For example, the 2 best or the 3 best or even the 5 best, and make several accounts in these best ones without having to go through dozens, hundreds of different sites?In addition, as everyone should know, those who “hunt bonuses” end up experiencing difficulties (sites that become dishonest and do not want to pay withdrawals) or even payment delays (some sites pay in minutes, others hours, other days, some even weeks)So: why not focus my attention on just a few sites, even 1 or 2, the best ones that I know are honest and pay fast, with rollovers and easy conditions to fulfill? And, on these sites, do I create dozens or hundreds of accounts?Obviously, the answer to that would be negative because each person can only have 1 account on each site, correct?But, nothing prevents us from making an account with data from family members or friends (obviously, if they allow this, because we need photos of their documents for KYC processes, right?). And, certainly, taking all the precautions with controlling the ips of each account, cookies and other things that anyone who is a “bonus hunter” knows about…Here, for this, the virtual wallets that I mentioned before (Skrill, Neteller, Ecopayz) facilitated this, allowing several people around the world to play and operate with multiple accounts within the same siteWell, so far everything was fine, right? However, these wallets, in the last year and months, have increased the bureaucracy for users, from creating to validating accounts. In addition, betting sites, casino, poker, less and less have accepted these methods to participate in promotionsDue to this, I spent a lot of time not hunting for new bonuses, just playing on my personal account.However, a while ago, I noticed that more and more sites are accepting cryptocurrencies as deposit and withdrawal methods, including offering promotions for new players who deposit with these methods. Good and big welcome bonuses too!I confess that I’ve always wanted to learn about this cryptocurrency market, to find out if it’s really what I’m imagining it to be: the best alternative for those hunting for bonuses and wanting to have multiple accounts on the same siteThe problem is: I already tried to read articles, watch videos on youtube and I really couldn’t understand how all this works! On betting sites, casino, poker… For example: I can’t understand how to get cryptocurrencies, how to buy, how to sell, how to exchange them with other people, how to turn them into money (in my bank account, for example), how to deposit on betting sites, how to withdraw cryptocurrency balance from betting sites. These brokerage sites, wallets, addresses for sending and receiving cryptocurrencies…All these things are still confusing to me (I even believe that it is simple for those who already understand, but I really haven’t found a place that removes the doubts that really matter to me, where the main one is: how the betting sites, which so much value for avoid multiple accounts and bonus abuses, decide to accept cryptocurrencies for deposits and withdrawals, being them “anonymous transactions”? Or do the sites detect multiple accounts with the cryptocurrency addresses used in the deposit or withdrawal? Are these addresses not always different? In other words : yes, I still don’t understand anything about this and luckily I found this forum to try to find some answersReturning to the subject of the old virtual wallets (Skrill, Neteller, Ecopayz) used for multiple accounts: some people, without knowing it, ended up creating more than one account in them, in the same name and, obviously, they were blocked automatically, losing money. Others created more than one account on a site, like bet365, to earn more than one bonus there, and deposited using the same payment method (the same Skrill or Neteller or Ecopayz account). bet365 easily detected the attempt to abuse bonuses: each Skrill or Neteller or Ecopayz has a unique and fixed ID to identify the account, so when the customer deposits with this method in more than one betting account (in his name or in the name other people), the bet site’s protection system blocked accounts because it detected the same deposit method (electronic wallet ID) depositing in different accounts, even if the person used different ips, cleared cookies and other things. .. There are people, even today, who believe that just changing the email or home address inside the electronic wallet will manage to “fool” the betting site, and obviously not, because the ID of the account used to deposit never changesSo, about this above: if we are now talking about cryptocurrencies, is there a way for the betting site to detect something similar to what I exemplified above? Or would each transaction be using a different address to send and receive money between the customer and the betting site? What difficulties and risks would I have when making multiple accounts on the same website, but now using cryptocurrencies? I repeat: I still don’t understand anything about crypto, I’m trying to understand first only the basics, comparing this with my old uses of e-wallets (Skrill, Neteller, Ecopayz)Another question I have: looking at the member area on sites where I play, I tried to simulate a cryptocurrency deposit, Bitcoin. When I click on it, the site asks for the amount to deposit, I type it in and a destination address code is automatically shown (example a4sgh8SHN87sdyh8JDasf83), showing that I must send that amount in cryptocurrency to this destination address, correct? (Yes, I still have no idea how and where to get this to send to their address). I believe, then, that I must have a balance in cryptocurrencies at one of my addresses, correct? Something also in ahx7A8HS7a8h78AH format. This would be how the site would identify me in transactions, right? So each customer can only have one address and with that would be similar to Skrill/Neteller/Ecopayz ID? Preventing the same person from being able to use that cryptocurrency value from that address in more than one account within the same betting site? Or can a person have several addresses and, with this, easily be able to deposit in several accounts within the same site?Already simulating a withdrawal, I also did a simulation: I choose to withdraw via Bitcoin cryptocurrency and the site asks me to choose the amount to withdraw, and inform a destination address (my address, also in that format like gasAGS6gs6GHjS8hi3AJa8j), which is where the site will send my money in cryptocurrencies, correct? (Yes, I also still have no idea how and where I create an address like this for myself). In this case, obviously, if I use the same address for two different withdrawals (from two different accounts within the same betting site, from different people), the site will detect that it is the same destination address. The question: can the same person have multiple addresses as well?Thinking about it, the ideal scenario, similar to what I did with Skrill/Neteller/Ecopayz, would be for us customers to be able to have multiple cryptocurrency addresses, using an address to deposit into a betting site account and a different address to withdraw money from the betting site . Thus, no transaction between the customer and the betting site would be using any code or address 6gas56GAS7hgs7H7H8j the same as any other customer or transaction. Is this possible? Can a person have multiple addresses for this, similar to having multiple Skrill/Neteller/Ecopayz accounts?I’ve always been interested in hunting for bonuses again, but only the best ones: to do this, make several on the same site, as I explained at the beginning of the text. But, first, I really need to understand how the sites control the issues of cryptocurrency transactions, how the transaction of a customer sending money in cryptocurrency to a betting site works and how the transaction of a betting site sending cryptocurrency in a pick up for the customer. Obviously, I also need to understand the basics of how to buy/sell/exchange cryptocurrency values, between people, the question of brokerages, wallets, addresses, that all of this remains confusing to me.My feeling, until the present moment, is as if I knew and were able to get a lot of money in cryptocurrency balance on betting sites, with bonuses and having multiple accounts (yes, I still have family and friends who allow me to use their data, because they don’t play, hundreds of KYC data that I used only on sites with Skrill/Neteller/Ecopayz wallets and on no site with cryptocurrency bonuses), as if I could do that, BUT I DON’T KNOW HOW TO DO IT, HOW TO BUY/SELL /DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW from websites using cryptocurrencies. With the Skrill/Neteller/Ecopayz virtual wallets it was easy: I created the account on the electronic wallet website, deposited money in it, then deposited this money on the betting website, won the bonus, fulfilled the rollover, withdraw the final balance to the electronic wallet and that’s it: it was already on to the next account and a new bonus with data from another relative or friendThe doubts, as everyone can see, are several, from the basics. And, believe me, I really tried to find materials about it, but few in my native language, which made it difficult. But luckily I found this forum and maybe someone will take the time to clear some of them up for me.My SKYPE login and contact email is: alexvianapoker@gmail.comIn case this type of subject is not allowed here in the forum and you can help me by chatting thereThank you to everyone who has been able to read this far, this long text, and also for any response you can give below! I will be attentive to any feedbackYou call yourself bonus hunter/arber and you have this kind of problems ?C mon man, bonus hunters/arbers were always persons who were one step ahead of books and with ability to think out of box.",

I'm sorry my friend, but cheating is not only unethical, it's also illegal. Not to mention the fact that casinos take cheating very seriously and have advanced measures in place to detect and prevent it. Sorry, buddy, but you're in the wrong place if you're looking for tips on how to bend the rules at the casino. You see, folks like you make it tough for honest players who just want to enjoy a little gambling fun. And let's be real, if you get caught cheating, you'll probably come back here and play the victim, complaining about how the casino \"unfairly\" banned you and took all your money. So save us all the drama, and play fair.",

      "body": "The post is pretty long and not everybody is going to have time to read it, so I'll get to the point.Your family members don't care about privacy and/or don't know what you're doing with their private information. They aren't aware that it can be used against them, for instance someone could make a fake ID and use it to buy something on credit. You're abusing their trust by putting their private data anywhere you can just to earn a few dollars. If you and your family are very poor and can't find other ways to make money, I can live with that, but it's more probable you're doing it for your own benefit, because it seems easy and you're not risking anything. How come a smart abuser of bonuses, a hunter as you call yourself, can't understand how crypto payments work? I thought you were smarter than those dumb casino operators who allow you to claim bonuses as all your family members without getting caught? You're a menace. People like you are the reason why casinos have to put up those crazy wagering requirements and ask all the legit players for KYC. You're the reason why bonuses are getting smaller and smaller because people aren't claiming them to play in the casino but farming them with multiple accounts. That's what you should call yourself, a farmer.",

You’re one of the reason why bonuses today required a lot of wager to get it and you can’t withdraw that easily. You’ll face more problem if you continue doing this, Abusing the system is not safe for you, just be ready for more consequences because you violated the rules and you can’t get out of that problem.",

Why not stick to one account in a gambling casino, there is nothing to happen if you want to hunt bonuses because usually, you cannot withdraw them if you won't wager them. So it is basically a risky part when you get busted by the casino.Sorry to tell but we are not the same as you, an account farmer, abuser, or doing bad acts just to earn money.
