The international community? UNESCO? european training organization parents? the teachers? professors? the doctors? Elon Musk?We are in a cryptocurrency forum and we all agree on that, but all we can do is invite local members of our community to vote to adopt laws that add articles related to inflation to classrooms and marketing workshops, with community awareness and try to open opportunities for dialogue about this and invite specialists to conduct seminars.",

How to brand the new projects and selling it for millions?I feel we should teach about the real finance to everyone in this world, I mean from the beginning stages of a kid like school itself which is more important for now people to understand about the reality behind Money.",

Maybe one would use bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain and some other words to gain attention from the audience but this can be taught from general widespread information.Basics of cryptocurrencies, finances and economics should be taught at schools but the problem is: 1. No one is gonna do that2. Teachers should be unbiased and open-minded.I plan to get a master's degree in Finance but then I sit and think:1. Do I like math that much?2. Does it worth it to get into a university that only teaches you old-school finance and doesn't go deep into cryptocurrencies?",

Marketing is more like advertising. I think that it's an inappropriate section. I think that most need to understand money, not how to sell crypto.So most of the people may need actual financial courses, not marketing. People would need to know how to handle better their money, no matter it's fiat or crypto. And this kind of courses are missing in most schools.However, I think that even if this kind of courses would exist, they may be highly biased towards fiat and against crypto, since those teaching them would have a certain age (i.e. most not open to new) and a certain background/education (and I keep telling that people into finances/accountancy don't understand bitcoin).Hence unless there's a teacher with a lot of willingness and open minded, this cannot bring anything good.And such teachers do exist, but too few; @titular is one such example. He taught his students how to use Electrum and more: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5378518",

Blockchain is a new technology but since its related to database system, it could just be under this curriculum. The schools in Argentina which were committed to educate students about Bitcoin was concentrated to Bitcoin alone. But they should also include blockchain as its the backbone of crypto. This isn't marketing but perhaps the project in Web3 could be related to marketing.",

It wouldn't be stuck in a single position. But I have to admit that a digital marketing course would help to understand Crypto marketing.

Also on YouTube you can see huge channels about crypto marketing.It would be outstanding if crypto marketing would grant as a different subject in school. But it is only possible if the government grants crypto education. But at the same time, crypto is illegal in most of the country. So now we can only expect to legalize cryptocurrency around the world, then it would not be too surprising to see crypto school & universities.",

Because categorizing it as marketing benefits only a limited use case of cryptocurrencies where you are figuring out how to get paid with them.",
