  "content": "Greetings! I'm on a quest to find some bitcoin mining sites/apps that have a considerably lower threshold for minimum withdrawal My plan is to reach whatever the would-be minimum payout thresholds, add it all up and then sell the BTC. I'm looking to setup as many as I can to get ideally 0.33 BTC as quick as possible; then sell the BTC. The money I received then will go towards groceries and anything else beyond. Such as investing in the best paid online traffic methods in efforts to make money online via online content creation. I've recently been spending some time devising strategies and formulating plans to make money working smart rather than hard.Or perhaps another cryptocurrency can help me with this, one way or another. Thanks for the replies, greatly appreciated üôè",

Such websites usually display a fake number as your balance and once you reach their minimum withdrawal amount, they ask you to deposit some bitcoin to be able to make withdrawal.Don't waste your time and your money. That's not how bitcoin is mined.",

I still think buying Bitcoin is more effective and profitable for a low budget person if one buys at the right time of the market.Mining Bitcoin requires a lot of effort and also takes time for you to breakeven, even if the electricity is free.",

Better for you to buy real miners and find someone that can host them for you that to contract web mining services. This is my opinion, but you¬† re free to check Hasnest and see what they have to offer.",
