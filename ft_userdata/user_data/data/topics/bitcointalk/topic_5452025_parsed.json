Also, it's probably bad timing for its US users knowing there are only several exchanges can legally operate there and the BTC price keep hanging the 30k barrier.",

It's probably better to close them completely.",

It's probably better to close them completely.Because legally it's a 100% separate company from the rest. They formed a corporation in the US that operated independently from the other Bittrex entities.It's actually quite common in a lot of businesses. You see it a lot in property. The building at 1 Dave Street is a different company then 2 Dave Street and 3 Dave Street. This way if something happens at or to 3 Dave Street that may cause it financial stress or something else #s 1 & 2 are not bothered by it. Also, if you want to sell 3 Dave Street, there is nothing to split up. It's 100% on it's own. Look at it this way, if instead of filing Chapter 11 they decided to sell off the US arm to 1 Dave Street properties, all they would have had to do is sell that one thing. Not split it off form some huge monolithic Bittrex World Wide entity. It was already split off.-Dave",

I have forgotten they exist.The rate at which sec are on to us base exchange branches, it will get to a point there is no exchange for the us crypto users. even though they seem to be on the right part, it has negative impact since not many exchange will be willing to operate there.",
