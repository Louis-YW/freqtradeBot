But on a regular wallet even if the address is blacklisted say by the government I doubt they can be able to stop it from transferring those funds. This tainted funds can only be confiscated by the government legalized exchanges and it would stop it from been exchanged to either fiat currency but for non legalized or private address it can actually be transferred.",

Can't you do anything with satoshis on that address? When the address gets blacklisted or banned, all the coins associated with it get the status of being \"tainted\" or \"dirty\": these are terms chain analysis companies came up with to harm Bitcoin's fungibility and try to prevent people from freely transacting on the censorship-resistant network. Chain analysis firms keep track of such addresses and may deem anyone connected to these addresses a potential criminal or a person helping to facilitate illegal activity. As one of the Samourai wallet developers once said, these companies themselves created a problem of \"tainted\" coins and now are making a good buck offering and selling \"solutions\" for this nonsense. On the protocol level, nothing changes really: if you are not dealing with so-called \"OFAC-compliant\" miners, your transaction gets broadcast, shared between, and verified by full nodes, validated, and included into a block by economically-rational miners. In a decentralized network such as Bitcoin, it is absolutely legal to move coins to which you have a corresponding private key.",

Thank youIf the BTC-network is decentralized, then how do you imagine that some bitcoin address would be banned? Who will do it? Nobody. No one can ban any address in the BTC-network. This is the peculiarity of bitcoin, which is called decentralization, expressed in the fact that there is no supervisory authority that regulates and is able to ban.No one has the right to prohibit sending or receiving btc, even if this address is blacklisted. The essence of the black list is that on third-party resources, a hypothetical address will have a label (for example, about offenses, like stolen btc), which will limit the ability to exchange or sell these btc on some resources, like exchangers. But this does not mean that the money on this address will be 100% blocked and can't be transferred. On BTC-network itself, there is no way to leave unfavorable tags, which allows you to still use that hypothetical address, even if it is blacklisted.",

Thank youAFAIK, no one can ban addresses but with exchanges, they can blacklist a bitcoin address or any address from other cryptos. They're doing that to control those stolen funds that's reported to them. That's part of their cooperation to whoever is reporting incidents like hacking to them. That's gonna give the hacker a hard time if the address used for hacking is alerted to the exchanges. And if the hacker has already deposited using that blacklisted address, the fund will be on the custody of the exchange and the hacker won't be able to withdraw it.",

Thank youActually, if you're using personal wallet you can transfer Btc to any other addresses even though you're using a blacklisted address. I didn't see feature from a personal wallet to be locked automatically if you deposit Btc you get from hacking or fraudulent activities. But if you're going to exchange it, especially in CEX, if there's something suspicious to your deposit address, your account will be freeze then they will check your account and your address very well before they will unfreeze your account. Even if the address you're using is tainted, there's a high chance your account will be freeze. That's why good people always use mixers just to make sure their address is clean.",

Thank youSimple answer is, they can make transactions using the block chain technology because AFAIK, they are only labeled as black listed or summers or involved in fraudulent activities by Authorities but they can not stop them to make transactions. I think if they will make transactions to another wallet that wallet will also be labeled as fraudulent one. This raised a question that what if they send small money to other normal legal users? I think we should ban incoming transactions from those users. There have been many announcements made by authorities about blacklisting many addresses and you can check the transaction details of those addresses to verify either those addresses are making any transactions or not.

Honestly, it never occurred to me that there would be any concept like banning the Bitcoin addresses. The only thing that came to my mind first is, what about decentralization then? Who is going to ban my address in an environment which is completely decentralized and runs on the public ledger? So the public? How? Thank God, there is no such thing as banning the address. As far as the above answer is concerned I am now putting my all trust in decentralization one more time. (kidding, I never lost the trust)However, it's good to know that this can be done in the shitcoins. They anyway deserve it considering the fact that they are platforms where scammers bloom and make thousands of dollars with scamming. More happy to know Bitcoin address is perfectly integrative.",
