But with current news it wants us to rethink and ask – is doge coin dead?Twitter has no positive correlation with dogecoin's emergence. It was just Elon musk's influence which contributed with the previous uprise on its price.To answer whether it is dead or not, unfortunately it could be but it can also still recover. That's the problem with tokens having no utilities;they tend to rely solely with demand. So if there are no demand for it, you won't see its market value reaching ceilings. Unlike with utility tokens wherein , its usage could be a factor to catch the interest of investors towards it giving a stronger support for its market value.",

And thinking that every move he does and his companies like Twitter will have an impact to Dogecoin's price, there's no correlation on it.With the result poll Elon did if he should remain as CEO and will abide to the result of the poll, it seems that he's going to step down as CEO of Twitter if he really mean what he said. And for the price of Dogecoin, it's survived a lot of tough times even if there's no Elon and hype.",

The Dogecoin Army's aspiration that Dogecoin will be used as a means of payment on Twitter can be destroyed, the plan was traded before the purchase of Twitter so that the last two weeks in November many bought dogecoin.I think most investors will pay attention to this and withdraw their investment funds.",

It will probably go back to its original position and go unnoticed but it won't die.",

However, when Elon suddenly started to promote Doge, people thought that it was a good coin to buy and hold. But if you look at he richest wallet of Dogecoin, only a few of them owns it actually.And now that the hype of Doge is gone and Elon somewhat not promoting it and because we are in a bear market, the price simply goes down.We will see what's the movement next bull run though. If Elon will suddenly revived it again or not.",

We never really know really the status of the coin or token in the bear market we only know it when the market started its bull run my portfolio is down 60% but I cannot blame any token or coin in my portfolio because of the bear market, to say that Dogecoin is dead when the market is in a bear market and almost all coins are going down is like looking blindly in the market condition, and Dogecoin has nothing to do with Twitter for all we know Elon Musk is just taking us for a ride.",
