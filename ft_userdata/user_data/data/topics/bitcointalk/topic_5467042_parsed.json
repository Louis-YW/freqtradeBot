  "content": "What happened::  Two days ago, American billionaire, investor, and businessman Mark Cuban got hacked and lost about $870,000 in various cryptocurrencies. Cuban had not used his MetaMask wallet for months, and the sudden movements in his wallet from the thefts were monitored and discovered via the Etherscan explorer by blockchain sleuth WazzCrypto.How did the scammers gain access to his wallet?According to the DLNews website, Cuban downloaded a fake copy of the MetaMask wallet, and he was the victim of a phishing attack. Fortunately, Cuban succeeded, according to  Arkham's tweet, in transferring all of his remaining assets ($2.5M USDC on Polygon) to Coinbase and his NFTs on Opensea to a wallet labeled as “Mark Cuban 3” by EtherScan.Reference Link:  Code:https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x293Ed38530005620e4B28600f196a97E1125dAAcAdditional Notes: When searching in famous search engines, be careful because there are many fake applications and extensions for wallets and many phishing domains for platforms in Adsense ads.Please check out this article CZ wrote three years ago, which contains important tips for protecting crypto. He published it after this incident in this tweet on his official account in X.Source:[1] https://twitter.com/WazzCrypto/status/1702820716343624168[2] https://www.dlnews.com/articles/people-culture/mark-cuban-loses-870k-to-a-crypto-scam[3] https://cointelegraph.com/news/mark-cuban-hot-wallet-hacked[4] https://www.theblock.co/post/251343/mark-cuban-loses-860000-of-crypto-to-phishing-attack",

      "body": "$870,000 is a very huge amount of money, and I'm surprised that someone with over $3 million worth of digital assets could not buy a good hardware wallet like Trezor or Passport to store his assets. Information is power because money is clearly not the problem here, Mark Cuban is not well informed about wallet security if not he would have opted for a HW. He's very lucky that the hacker did not drain all the funds in his wallet and he still has about 2.5M USDC to fall back on and a lesson to learn.",

      "body": "I don’t know if I should call this carelessness or stupidity, how can someone with that kind of coin put it in a hot wallet, as an investor the first thing you should do is to make good provision for the safe keeping of your investments documents and for him to have neglected that important part shows that he was ready for the risk that he took and now it has cost him his money. I’m not sure how he downloaded a fake MetaMask app but the more I read the story the more the whole thing turns into an even that played out due to the carelessness of someone who has more than enough money. And even with what has happened his remaining money still remains in another hot wallet this should at least given him the idea to purchase a hardware wallet and move his coins there.",

He isn't likely ever going to lose sleep over losing less than a million or holding it in that type of wallet. Specifically, he has $5.2 billion in assets, so what he has lost is not even 0.1% of what he has. But on the other hand, I saw him once saying that he was taking advantage of Amazon offers to buy in bulk, consumer goods that he uses all the time and things like toothpaste. Although it may seem silly, people who have become that rich starting from the bottom tend to keep the habits that have made them rich once they are at the top. So he may not have laughed at the hack, but he could have saved his shitcoins better by now. Although he must also have bitcoin, as he said that if you invest in gold nowadays instead of bitcoin you are a fool, and I imagine he will have those in a HW (or not?).",

There are people who buy cars worth nearly that much as those coisn are worth and never drive them more than once forgetting even at which home that thing is, and here you have a guy with 5 billion worth of assets who bought on impulse some coins and tossed them in some wallet.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on September 17, 2023, 03:42:57 AMBut on the other hand, I saw him once saying that he was taking advantage of Amazon offers to buy in bulk, consumer goods that he uses all the time and things like toothpaste. Although it may seem silly, people who have become that rich starting from the bottom tend to keep the habits that have made them rich once they are at the top. For some it's a bit more complicated, it's not that they have to save every penny or that they have some sort of trauma but they don't like it if they feel cheated or misled on buying something, they will argue for one hour over $5 wrong in a bank statement but they wouldn't care throwing away 1million in a day. Not really being cheap, more like trying to play it smart or something!Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on September 17, 2023, 03:42:57 AMAlthough he must also have bitcoin, as he said that if you invest in gold nowadays instead of bitcoin you are a fool (https://fortune.com/2022/12/24/mark-cuban-defends-bitcoin-crypto-slams-gold-investing/), and I imagine he will have those in a HW (or not?)My bet is on some custodial service like Coinbase or Bitgo!",

Alot of times stories like these are meant to serve as an example to others. The part that gets me even more is that he still transferred the remaining crypto to another hot wallet. I dont know what his thinking though but I hope he knows what he's doing. For someone that rich i don't think he even felt his loss. To him it's just like removing a dollar from his total net worth and nothing more.lol",

However, I do not think it is appropriate for the Altcoins board, but perhaps the other topic covers a better and more appropriate discussion, and to avoid spam, I think it would be better to close my topic.
