So make haste while the sun shine, people don dey smart enough, any money you get for hand e go better to go bank start to withdraw because very soon even to see money withdraw go be problem even this Pos people go do worst with their big charges.So OP, no be wetin to fear or create panic about as no be wetin u think na him dey go on, this na just mere case.",

I just hope no be wetin I they think shaa.You no be the only person wey don experience this, as me too wey be frequent visitor to banks been don observe this since the beginning of this December. As both Access and FCMB don place limit on how much you can withdraw as we approach festive season, which is not a new thing, but due to the touch time last year, I'm sure with this recent change, everybody is worried not to get beaten the second time by lack of cash in circulation just as we experience last year. But just as the governor of CBN made it clear that the old Naira note which was supposed to stop been in circulation this December remains valid til further notice, I will still urge people to be on the safer side, as you never can tell, hence, stuck as much note as you can now to avoid regretting later tomorrow.",

If the price of transportation start to de increase, e go surprise you? na so the matter be because people de mostly withdraw money use buy stuff keep for house as price of goods never increase finish like that. Another reason why people no too de go make deposit for bank be say most business men when he really like to deposit huge amount of money for bank de use most of their money run pos business and as e be say market de move well well by this time of the year, e no suppose surprise you say money go de scarce.As a banking institute, this na wetin dem for don see since then make reasonable plan so that customers no go come bank come find money and him no see money withdraw.Scarcity of money no de come anywhere, me self no Lulu like to be use the cash as most persons for my area de accept transfer so if dem like make them make the money scarce, man no go still get shaking.",

However thank you very much for this wonderful update, although I been don dey expect am since because e don turn normal thing for every December. As December just reach money go scarce and na that same time you go see say all banks go come dey get network issue, I still dey expect to see another hike in the price of fuel because that one sef na normal occurrence for the month of December every year. So all this things no be new thing, but the part wey dey pain me pass na be say, no be say na by accident these things take dey happen, na just some person wey don conspire to bring this scarcity, because if you watch well for the time of petrol scarcity, you go see say na one by one the filling station dem take dey open, as this one lock, the second one go open.",

But since the cash scarcity that we face few months ago don make some people are not use to be holding cash again even those that are not collecting transfer before are use to it, that is why all this cash issue no dey move me again.You will see someone that will withdraw 1k will go to bank they want cash, when there's POS everywhere that make work easier for us, even as charges no cost again they no want to lose #100 to withdraw 1k, in as far cash dey POS and they suffer people like we face few months ago, i think it's still okay because i never hear any complain from the POS.",

I just hope no be wetin I they think shaa.This problem is everywhere around the nation. I can say that I haven't for once experience Naira scarcity during the festive period, the only time I experienced was during tbe pre election period and post election when the previous government anounces change of currency and directed old notes to be seize from circulation and the experience we had that time was beyond what I can discuss from my mouth because it was a terrible situation that led to th death of many.One of the reason why I think we have currency scarcity was because of the previous announcement that was made on the Naira notes. If you remember, when the new Government assume office, they made it clear that the old notes are allow to be used as Legal tender until December, so it was expected for everyone to make sure they deposited all the currency into their respective commercial banks but along the line, the CBN found out that there is still large of old note in circulation and has to postpone it indefinitely, so that people don't have to face the same hardship again.However, the people don't trust the government and I believe you know better, people have prepared and hide all the new notes incase the government make a u U turn from it's initial statement, they are holding it and including some business people, they don't want to be caught unaware again because many of them lost so many deals because of this money scarcity. Don't worry, after December you will see more money in circulation if they see that the government keep to their promise with the indifinite action of old notes.",
