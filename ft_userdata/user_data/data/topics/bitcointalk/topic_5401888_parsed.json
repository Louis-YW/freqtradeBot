In the past, the solution was to mix the gpu´s - AMD and Nvidia. Hope to see some improvements for more GPU´s than 13 under Linux. @david739you use a normal Linux Distro? This will not work with more than 7 GPU from the same brand, you must mix it with 6 nvidia and than it will work. This was the only way in the past for this old linux kernelsEDIT:here is an part of the asrock advice:Materials you need1. ASRock H110 Pro BTC+ motherboard2. Total power supply up to 2400W3.
