Blockstream released \"this\" for Jade but having said that, the more I'm reading about it [e.g. here's one], the more I think this might actually be true [can someone confirm if it really works]!",

Ironically, it would have had more of an impact on those who wish Satoshilabs to reveal their newest generation of HW. It was a lost chance, honestly. Do not be so serious, SL.",

Although these funny announcements can be used as a kind of way to promote their products. Why did they think of this before?Funny April 1st announcements were made by these HW device manufacturers and as you noticed, Ledger could not come up with anything original. Which is rather strange, since this company has a lot of resources and could use the holiday for advertising purposes. Well, or just to please their fans.The rest of the companies, of which there are quite a lot, also didn't have anything like this in social networks?",

They whole offer is like a one big April 1st, the other companies had to do an extra effort to be at the same level.But yes, honestly speaking I think HWs are overpriced and any reason (even April 1st) would be a good reason to make a discount promo.

Quote from: NotATether on April 11, 2023, 07:02:49 AMFor extra safety, also keep a pistol lying around the house in a secure location.  If you have a gun, it should go everywhere you go. More precisely, everywhere you sleep. It's not much of a use if you have to walk past the thief on your way from your bedroom to your living room to get to your gun. Or the stories you hear about people taking it apart and keeping different parts in separate rooms of the house. Wait a little Mr. robber. I just need to get my stuff and I will be right with you.",
