  "content": "It was not clear how he was hacked, however, he mentioned that the hackers got him for 5 ETH and he has not used the wallet for 160 days. But when he began to use it, his Metamask was drained to zero. Someone might have promised him a 5 ETH profit and what occurred was a $870,000 surprise hehehe.The hackers are unknown but I would not be shocked if they blame the Lazarus group again hehehehee.Mark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, confirmed to DL News that he has lost approximately $870,000 to a crypto scam late on Friday.The sudden movements in a wallet marked on blockchain explorer EtherScan as “Mark Cuban 2″ were first spotted by pseudonymous on-chain sleuth WazzCrypto.Cuban was unaware of the wallet movements when approached by DL News and later said, “Someone got me for 5 eth.”“I went on MetaMask for the first time in months. They must have been watching,” he told DL News.Cuban’s losses extended beyond 5 Ether, worth about $9,000 at current prices. Altogether, he was set back by around $870,000 across 10 cryptocurrencies.Read in full https://www.dlnews.com/articles/people-culture/mark-cuban-loses-870k-to-a-crypto-scam/",

Transferred all my Polygon in the account,“Since I was only working with the account that got hacked, none of my others gave up anything,”Indeed we can't know for sure what is the root cause of the hack with only those kinds of details. We might be able to speculate that it may be due to a malicious or unofficial MetaMask, but due to incomplete information, what's confusing is his last statement where only one account got hacked. Supposedly, if the extension or application itself is malicious, all the accounts on the same phrase should be vulnerable.",

Sounds like he has fell for some generic hack and likely the hacker didn't even know who owned the wallet, but drained the wallet via bot. The fact that hacker needed to move 0.1 eth back to move other tokens out speaks for some automatic wallet hack.Quote from: Nwada001 on September 16, 2023, 05:40:09 AMHow can someone who has over $870,000 worth of crypto across his metamask wallet be moved by a promise of eth, which will be around $8k +?

But compare to us average joe, who really works very hard to earn and save and accumulate crypto overtime.And I don't think that Lazarus Group is behind, this entity targets millions of crypto in one heist, so I doubt that they will target some peanuts amount even if it is identified to Mark Cuban.",

I am beginnig to be skeptical. Also, Mark Cuban is not someone stupid and he did not become rich by being tricked easily. I reckon when those funds are mixed and traded into Ethereum, who would know if it was Mark Cuban who bought a bored ape and other NFTs?He has reduced his taxes and he has bought NFTs without being detected hehehe.
