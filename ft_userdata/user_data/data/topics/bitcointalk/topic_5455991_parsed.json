      "body": "Makes you wonder if this is the cause of some of the hacks and loss of funds that some people have had in certain wallets. No that they're actually been hacked but the fact that the programmers did their job so poorly that it left certain things vulnerable. Would be interesting to actually have them name the wallet, but I understand why they can't. You really do not want to cause that stampede and / or people loosing funds because somebody happened to mention that they were using wallet X and now people know it has certain issues.However, as we have seen, you can light up in 50 foot blinking neon sign saying \"don't use this wallet it has issues\" and people will still use it because either they like it, or it does something they want, or they've been using it for a while and it's just pure inertia.-Dave",

These affected transactions are a user implementing their own script to steal these funds, and inside their own script is this peculiar way of calculating a nonce for their transactions.Interesting that they have linked all this to the forum user amaclin.Quote from: ymgve2 on June 10, 2023, 10:40:36 PMI guess they wanted something that was faster than RFC 6979 so they could frontrun other transactions, but if speed is your point, why not just pre-generate a ton of cryptographically secure nonces in advance?How long does it take on average to calculate a nonce following RFC 6979?

I forgot that it loops if the value is not between 1 and q-1, which could result in more operations being required (although this is fairly unlikely). But then having said that, his half and half system would also be vulnerable to the exact same drawback, and could still calculate a nonce outside the required range.So this then loops (heh) back round to your original question - why use any computational function at all? If speed is the most important factor here, then why not just have a nonce pre-calculated?",

It's the same with private keys, if you don't select it randomly it is just as weak and can be \"leaked\". You can't say \"private key is a major weakness in ECDSA just because eg. an incompetent developer choose number 1 as the key\".In all cases of weak nonce leading to loss of funds, the reason has been developer incompetence. For example blockchain.info using random.org to generate nonce and being incompetent enough to never even check the success state of the respond received from the site (they used the returned error as the nonce!).Quote from: ymgve2 on June 10, 2023, 10:40:36 PMI guess they wanted something that was faster than RFC 6979 so they could frontrun other transactions, but if speed is your point, why not just pre-generate a ton of cryptographically secure nonces in advance?They could just use an RNG to generate it if they wanted to skip RFC6979 which would be faster.

These are not normal transactions, and use a custom construction that makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks since in practice it's basically an equation with a single unknown variable. This is merely a curiosity and has no impact on anything that uses proper nonce generation procedures.",
