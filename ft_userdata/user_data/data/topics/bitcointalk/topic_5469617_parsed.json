You are comparing unrealistically as if for those who bought bitcoin in 2010 there were many people doing it but in reality there were not.If you want to be rich buy bitcoin now in other words 5000 BTC  and wait 13 years you will be rich.If you have a more effective way to invest then use that strategy, I think DCA is a common conversation here, I also do it because this is one of the simpler investments there is no pressure anyway, if about wanting profit then of course there is a target that must be achieved at what price it is sold.Focus on accumulation and wait for the bullish after halving of course the rally will come.",

If theres chance I could go back to that date then Im possibly buying a lot and hold of them until few years back. But right now, with that such price how can we believe that it could go more than that now? Like ita 27k could be like $27million a piece? We need to consider that and right now there are other choices too aside from it maybe we could bet on that instead?",

However, relying solely on history as a reference is not a completely foolproof strategy, as the future is not entirely dictated by the past. Despite Bitcoin's predicted annual price growth, there will undoubtedly be bearish moments that serve as a reminder of how volatile the market can be.I acknowledge that Bitcoin has an impressive price history thus far, but ensuring Bitcoin's price next year is by no means an easy feat as long as price fluctuations remain relatively high.",

It requires to focus and acquire skill, and in my experience, it requires you to embrace responsibilities. Bitcoin can help a person richer but can not bring wealth and prosperity to the person sustainably. Because to have sustainable wealth and prosperity, there are many things to do with your assets, capital management and risk management as well as how you spend your money after getting richer with Bitcoin.Like star athletics who can earn massive money when they were young but after their career retirement, many of them have very bad finance. It is because they overspent in the past, maintained that bad spending habit and when they have less income after retirement, their finance will be at verge of nightmare.QuoteBitcoin is good as long as you're working on what you love and doing it with passion. Passion to learn basic, securing your wallet and bitcoin (don't use custodial wallet, online accounts for storing bitcoin), and using bitcoin for money transfer on Bitcoin blockchain are very good basic practice to love bitcoin more with time.In the mean time, if we can hold our bitcoin, we can enjoy its value growth.The bullish case for Bitcoin",

To look at the past and simply think that because the price of something has gone up a lot you would have become rich is very short-sighted. As we have discussed many times on the forum, when the price was worth a few cents and went to $1 most people sold. Others bought at $1, the price went down and sold scared of losing everything because at that time the risk of Bitcoin going to 0 was much higher than now.

To many people doesn't know yet if bitcoin could go that far but since we have see a lot of events that bitcoin price could go up then it could possibly open the eyes of newbies that they should try it and try to decide on what they should do about what they learn about bitcoin. But they also make sure that they will not expect anything not possible since on bitcoin investment we need to know the realistic events and don't overlook on risky or uncontrolled situations, always learn when to take your profit since as of now this is the best way to earn on our bitcoin investment if that's what you mean here.Quote from: Kara3 on October 08, 2023, 08:04:51 AM The most simple but effective way I use to navigate my way in the market is the DCA method I use, accormulate as much Bitcoin as possible because the bull run will definitely change the history of your finances if you position your self right and wait patiently for the bull run to come .DCA is one of the best method so to know more about it better for newbie to test every situation so that they could test it for long term and see a best result on the investment decisions they do.",
