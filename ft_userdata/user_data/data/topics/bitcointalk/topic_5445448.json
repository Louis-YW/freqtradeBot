Your wallet appears to have enabled the avoid_reuse flag, so the values in UTXOs for scripts that have already been used before will be counted in the \"used\" balance separately from \"trusted\".Is there any real potential benefits for settings avoid_reuse as False. And thanks for the explanation. I did some calculations and yeah, it matches.",
