Don't worry, BSC and ETH wallets are the same though there are two different chains. It's made for your convenience. Open your MetaMask, choose settings, then networks, then add the chain manually:Chain name: Smart ChainNew RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/Chain ID: 56Ticker: BNBBlock Explorer URL: https://bscscan.comChoose BNB chain after adding this one, and you will see your BSC tokens. Since it's BSC, you will have to pay the gas fees in BNB.",

      "body": "Here you go, https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/connect-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain-bscAfter adding the BNB network add a small BNB to make transactions. Then you have to add the BUSD contract address. You will find it on your transaction, which means have to add a new token. Then you can transfer your BUSD to another wallet. Don't worry, your fund is safe as long as you are holding the seed phrase. Just imports existing seed phrase during open Metamask. Just watch the tutorial how to do it.",
