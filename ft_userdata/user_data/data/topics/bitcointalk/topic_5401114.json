  "content": "I launched an open-source Bitcoin database https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/web3/bitcoin. Anyone should be able to clone and run mysql queries on top of it. It's built on a database tool called https://github.com/dolthub/dolt. Let me know if this interesting, this current database is a little behind the head block but I have a more optimized database of Bitcoin coming soon.",

And the fact that it needs to be connected to a node to be updated makes me feel like a resource wasting. But for some projects this is great.Thanks for the apport and thanks for making it open source.",

Any idea how much in terms of resources (especially storage I assume a new M1 macbook pro with 16gb ram is fine for everything else) for data storage plus running the server? If you check 1st link shared by OP, it's stated the size of this dataset is 581GB. Few MacBook Pro which use M1 chip only has 512GB storage, so you need to make upgrade if you have 512GB model or free space of your macbook is less than 581GB + few GB for application to run SQL server. Other than that, M1 chip and 16GB is more than enough to run SQL server.",
