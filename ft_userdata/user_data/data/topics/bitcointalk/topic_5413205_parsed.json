Since it's perfectly applicable to the overall market (not just related to Altcoins), moving it to \"Altcoins\" would mean, the useful, general advice could be lost in the Altcoin section. It's not a discussion about Altcoins...Like Upgrade00 suggested, I agree that it's suited for \"Beginners and Help\".",

The topic generally describes an example with suspicious investments using bitcoin.I think using the keyword \"crypto\" sounds abit off the boundary for bitcoin since it is believed that cryptocurrency is the general name where every form of shitty coins fall under, that's why anytime we are dealing with crypto coins then it will give more light by been specific on which, here if the talk is strictly about bitcoin then no need using the word crypto because that alone can render it all being the same as any other altcoin, also if we consider the forum at large, it was designed for bitcoin while any other discussion that does not specific with the use of bitcoin but crypto  will all fall under altcoins discussion, just my view.",

I understand it is only possible to \"yield farm\" using various altcoins, such as ETH (I presume there are others). I also understand that any yield farming involving \"bitcoin\" is actually a \"wrapped\" bitcoin that is very similar to an IOU. As a result of the above, discussions related to \"yield farming\" are not talking about anything that you can do with bitcoin and should be in the altcoin section.Although, there is an argument that certain altcoin subjects belong in the newbie section, although opening up this can of worms similar to what I discussed here.",

If it is to be moved anywhere, i think it should be moved to the Bitcoin discussion section.",

I think posts like that which seek to warn the community of possible deception and scam, especially newbies should either be placed in the Beginners & Help or Services sections; not altcoins.

Oh, I guess I wasn't invited to the Welcome Back party and I hadn't noticed. Looking at his most recent posts, he has been somewhat involved in discussing altcoins and posting in the Wall Observer thread, so I am not surprised I haven't ran into him. At least that's what I thought. Seems there was some confusion again with one of his NFTs threads being moved to the Altcoins board. Funny thing is I merited that OP of his but still failed to realize who started it.",
