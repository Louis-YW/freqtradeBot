Georgina no just girlfriend to Ronaldo but na also mother to some of him children and for Arab once the parents don gree give you the girl to marry and both families witness this thing then una don bind together as husband wife no be till una gather masses chop rice. If you look some of our Yoruba’s dem Dey do this kind thing, na like when children don reach 2 na him people Dey gather. As long imam don bless the two toh dem don turn husband and wife. Even if you divorce woman and u still carry her in make she Dey take care of your children, Arabs no frown on top.

Like the GOAT you used as your example, he is a public figure; his name is on the lips of millions of fans, and that is just how he has built it and how Grace exploited him. It's good to be super relevant, but some people don't have the zeal. So what?  Man just gat to keep pushing.I discovered that some individuals in high positions tend to bend the rules a little in some situations.",
