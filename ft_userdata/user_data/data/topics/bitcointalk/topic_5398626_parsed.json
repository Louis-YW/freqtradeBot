Some people prefer BTT rather than other platforms to read the updates. That's why we are here. If we take another decision to leave the forum, we will let you know. As for the traffic, we have been here since 2017. We are a team of blockchain developers. And we do know that the traffic trends has changed dramatically. But it doesn't mean we don't want to use BTT as a source of traffic. We do really want.",

      "body": "Dear BlaBlaGamers,Today we prepared an amazing article for you about different strategies you can use playing Rock-Paper-Scissors game.üî• Have you ever heard about Martingale tactic?It‚Äôs a betting strategy which is based on the principle of raising the bets every time after a loss. Every time you lose, you must increase the bet, taking into account previous losses.An example:1. The game starts, the bets are placed.2. After each loss, the player must increase the bet so that if he wins, he will pay off all past losses in this series, with a small income (for example, 1‚Äì2‚Äì4‚Äì8‚Äì16‚Äì32‚Äì64, etc.). If the sequence is followed, the player‚Äôs profit when winning will be equal to the initial bet.3.In case of a win, the player must return back to the initial bet.Many people play using the Martingale technique with a large number of bets. For example, they make five bets of 10 cents, then in case of loss ‚Äî 5 of 20, etc.This strategy is win-win, since the player cannot lose indefinitely.There are also two more tactics based on human psychology:‚òùÔ∏è The first strategy is countertactic-strategy. Let‚Äôs imagine that you played Rock and your opponent played Paper in the first round. The chance that your opponent will play paper again is very high. So now what you should do is to play scissors. In short the rule is: play the bid object that wasn‚Äôt played in previous round.‚úåÔ∏è The second strategy is a mirror-strategy. If you won in the first round, in the next round choose the bid object that your opponent played before, because he or she will think that you are going to play the same combination.üå±These strategies should work unless your opponent knows about them.‚ö°Actually, the best Rock-Paper-Scissors strategy is to play randomly ‚Äî play each bid object one-third of the time to make your opponent not to guess what‚Äôs next. This tactic is called Nash Equilibrium: both players act randomly, they do not switch strategies because it‚Äôs not possible to increase your chances to win in more than one-third cases.Here are some more interesting observations:üí° Man without experience in this game statistically most often will go with Rock in his first move. Experienced man will not use Rock in his first round.üí° Woman statistically most often will go with Scissors in the first round.üí° If the opponent plays with the same option two times in a raw, he or she will unlikely use the same option for the third time.üí° If you are in a total loss, throw Paper. Scissors is statistically the most rare throw, Rock is the most often, so Paper will give you the best chance to win.Now you are fully armed and ready!
