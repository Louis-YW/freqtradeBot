  "content": "When try to introduce some cow milk powder to woman, she would shamelessly cherry picking whether it is safe for pregnanted lady, it is fascinating to me so I quickly answer yup it is safe, she would also quickly, like reflective or programmed to response accordingly, it had to be registered and approved by a reputable medical associates to be considered food safety and mocking me for not understanding woman! May be cow milk is not gentle enough to be safe to very fragile person...Btw adding cost on top by the third party approval seem like seeking validation to me, may be adding more costs make the product unnecessarily ultra-inflated could make an already near 99.9% purity cow milk to unlock a new achievement or waygu grade 99.999% pure cow milk and that very marginal gain would result in safe enough cow milk to pregnanted lady.  btw it is not about hypergamous behavior or hyper paranoid, it is nature intended just like what animal do.",

If I understand your analysis, it is more of lactating mother and not a pregnant woman. Breast milk and or cow milk are all about feeding the new body. So I didn't see where the pregnancy comes in into advantage against the man at least.Maybe I didn't understand the intent of your post anyway.",

      "body": "Quote from: Gozie51 on October 02, 2023, 11:46:59 AMI think they didn't really tie up together. No doubt it sound illogical and pointless, that is exactly what I'd like to recall, also it look very complicated and quickly developed into affairs, involved more people that is otherwise not necessary, also does create more busy-ness. Quoteit is more of lactating mother and not a pregnant woman. yup, it is fascinating, but I think she purposely mention pregnant lady, to capture a general belief that contaminated substances may harm the pregnancy process, lead to miscarriage etc, for shifting responsibility I guess? Does it sound like taking advantage?Quoteare all about feeding the new body. So I didn't see where the pregnancy comes in into advantage againstIt highly depend on the legislation by the given time when it were amended. However legal system seem to put more emphasize on pregnant than lactating woman when it come to seeking damage through legal system.QuoteMaybe I didn't understand the intent of your post anyway.The intention is not to belittle anyone, but to point out something that is too obvious to ignore. Something like a loophole in the system that can be extorted.Finally I also like to add, from the story above it conclude, the cow milk powder is safe to be feeded to infant just like it is advertised, yet it is still not safe to the pregnant mum, the reason is up to anyone else to make guess, it is very much sound like just another form of mental gymnastics to me.",

      "body": "It is something that has been in existence for long. When a woman loves you, the man should be careful because a woman can go to any extent just to be with a man she really loves. Using pregnancy to take full advantage of a man is very little compare to things they are capable ofFurthermore, pregnant woman tends to stress their man purposely. As they said it is the only time you should tender all you have in mind and it shall be granted. Some might even turn their man to messenger intentionally.My perspective is I wunt care even if am a messenger to my woman during pregnancy because to be at stage requires all the possible support needed. Do good to your woman whether she's pregnant or not, it brings unity.",

      "body": "Smart people who enter into marriage these days, will make a contract. In the contract, the details will include 'no harm' clauses. This means that they will not take each other to court, or testify against each other if court happens.How does one enforce such a contract? Include million dollar bonds as part of the contract. Or, don't get married if the other partner won't get bonded.If this is too hard, maybe marriage isn't worth it. Or get married without a contract, and subject the couple to the same kinds of troubles they have now without a contract.Women might be dangerous, but in other ways, so are men.",

      "body": "Pregnancy is truly a group commitment! While women bear the physical and emotional responsibility of raising a little human, fathers-to-be can help by offering emotional as well as practical assistance. It is important for fathers to realize that they play an important role in their partner's journey, even if their contributions are not always as obvious as the mother's.But don't forget that even with all the help in the world, pregnancy can be a difficult experience. Women frequently experience physical and mental changes that might make them feel vulnerable, which is why they need every support they can get from anyone, especially the man who impregnates them, because they are not the ones who impregnate themselves, therefore helping them in in the way they can doesn't really mean that the woman is taking advantage of them rather they should see it as their responsibility.",
