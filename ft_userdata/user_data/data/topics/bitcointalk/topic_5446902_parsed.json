  "content": "Slot tournament involves slot players who are playing between themselves to see who can win the most coins1. Winner of the competition is determined by the person who wins the most number of coins. In the past it used to be held in a brick and mortar casinos but with the advent of online casinos. More flexible time limits is the only rule that exist in the online version of the competition that does not apply to the regular rules when played in the land-based casino.Slot tournaments are of two types2 - freeroll and buy-in. In the former, participants aren't required to pay any fee to participate. In fact, it may even be part of the casino's promotional offers while in the latter, participants pay to take part in the competition. Other types include - scheduled, comped, signup freeroll, survivor, one-shot, PCH, reloader, and extender tournaments. So basically, the way the tournaments run is this - you register to participate in the competition, you will be given the same amount of credits with the other participants, after which, you play at the slot for a specified time. The goal is simply to stack up as much coins as you can more than the others to be declared the winner of the tournament. Have you participated in any slot tournament whether online or offline before? Did you like it? Generally, let me know your thoughts on this. 1. https://www.casinolifemagazine.com/blog/complete-guide-online-slot-tournaments2. https://www.slotsmate.com/slots-tournaments",

Somehow kind of the game but nothing like free unless we have nothing to be won, unlike casinos providing the free offer as a promotional offer. This would be possible on land based casino, but are you sure online casinos can offer this too? Where gamblers will meet and just gamble like a competition among themselves and not a competition between them and the gambling site. Online gambling sites always prefer the later.",

      "body": "Never heard of this; I believed slot machine games are individual games, it would always be house vs the player. So if there is a comparative approach with slot tournaments, I guess that would be just an added reward such that winning the jackpot in the game itself qhile having a bonus reqard from winning more, versus or in comparison with the other player. But as I've read what OP is trying to point out, it seems like such kind of slots will make it more of not being dependent with the jackpot alone but will give more emphais with the frequency or combos a player could achieve while playing. It sounds interesting but for sure would be confusing to many players who aren't aware of such concept.",

Luckily I had landed some good hits to win one of the three prizes I remember my prize was around BTC.01 or BTC.02  and there weren't a lot of participants joining so that helped as well. It was one of the best tournaments i've joined as you rarely get the chance to play equally with everyone and most casinos usually have weekly wagering tournaments that would just let the high rollers stomp the competition.",

Winner of the competition is determined by the person who wins the most number of coins.I have seen slots \"Tournamentes\" where the users need to chase X multiplier, but I have never seen a tournament to see who wins more coins. and is a weird competition for me because it's a game of 100% luck and zero skills. If the users want to martingale then they will lose, because the right way to win this is with max bets and with all the luck.I will chase one of these Slot tournaments, would be nice to join the free roll one. Sounds like a fun event and maybe more casinos start doing them from now.",

Well, it seems the rules are fair to every players if that is really how the competition works. Everyone having the same chances, that is, the same \"tools\" to work on the tournament makes it possible for every gamblers to win the final prize, doesn't matter how rich each of them is. I have never joined a slots' tournament, but it would be very interesting to do it someday, considering the rules are as stated above, otherwise I have no way to compete against wealthy players having access to lots of bonusses and extra spins.That the luckiest participant wins!",

I haven't heard this, but has this been done, like, is there like a recent tournament like this? Whether promotional or for another purpose, But still, it is about luck, and the one who wins the tournament is the luckiest of them all. Also it is fun that all of the participants will play at the specific time so all of the probability will be distributed among them all",

Generally, let me know your thoughts on this. For this game, I am more familiar with Progressive Slots, even though there are many other types of games offered, but I rarely see them and even if I play only once out of curiosity. The habit that makes us addicted to slots is out of curiosity, the habit of making small bets often results in wins that make us addicted to increasing bets and finally losing in the next round, generally slot players feel this.This means that we only try to bet on luck in the game round, the Jackpot bonus is usually what we often hope for and unfortunately sometimes we also don't have luck, but for slot tournaments I have never tried it.",
