  "content": "This thread is for any investors who purchased BKB during the ICO in 2017 that may not be in the Telegram group or receive emails.Quick history:We launched an ICO in 2017 that raised $6 million.When we closed the last time, investors still held over $2 million worth of tokens that we were trying to refund but couldn't due to the site not able to turn a profit.The other investors had sold their tokens in the old buy back program (some made a profit) or were refunded in other ways since then.We are now in a better place to start refunding the remaining token holders.The https://betking.io website went live about 6 weeks ago with the purpose of being a convenient place for old token holders to receive refunds.You can read about the refund process here https://betking.io/token At this time there is no way for any players to deposit and play.We don't have time to run BetKing as a casino at this time. We may open to deposits and add extra games in future if we can find someone to run and market the site.All BKB holders who had an account and tokens on site after 2019 (after the last software update) are automatically receiving refunds from the pool. If you have tokens in your own wallet (not on an exchange) or have lost access to your account please email support@betking.io for help.Any posts that are clearly signature spam or that are just attacking without reading the OP will be deleted.",

I store most of my BKB token on trezor that I purchased on the built-in exchange after the ICO. Am I still eligible for the refund even though I move my tokens out of the casino?Nevermind, will contact via email. ThanksI will update here once I get in touch with the support via email. I hope that I can still refund my 7K BKB tokens. Finger crossed here!",

You would need to make a new one and then prove ownership of tokens.The rate is $0.09128 yes, that was the price of the token after the ICO ended. Most investors bought the tokens cheaper in the earlier stages of the ICO.",

I was only looking at gaining a wider audience (those who are in one way or the other affected) by the site to come back claim their lost, but if you says this board is okay then no issues.",

I'm not looking to make that back.$5 million came from other investors. Most of it was profit they had made from BetKing pre ICO, when we had a crowdfunded bankroll.The amount we are trying to refund is over $2 million. That shows the initial investors actually received almost $3 million back before we closed..Almost all of those investors made a profit due to buying with 25% discount in the ICO. The tokens were bought back by BetKing at a higher price.The refunds are for the unfortunate investors who never sold any tokens in buybacks or received any other form of refunds.$2 million is a huge amount to be refunding out of my own pocket but it's certainly more probable than refunding $6 million, that people commonly mistake the number to be.Last thing. There is no desire for me to open BetKing at all. It is currently closed for deposits.The only way I would re-open it is if, and only if, there was a chance that a good portion of old players would return and it had a high chance of being able to make profit that could speed up investor refunds. This is obviously unlikely.If we did open and the site made enough to refund investors, I would close it the next day. I have no interest in making money from BetKing personally.",

I just checked the google search engine to confirm the one I know. The domain names are not the same but they are similar. The one I know is betking.com https://mlite.betking.com/en/sports. Well Op I can see that you have a heavy negative tags in your profile and I believe for your to clear that negative trust is not hard if really you have truly repented and clear all refunds. Because it was users that reported you to be tagged and the same users will still report you to be a good casino that has repaid all the token. So the genuineness of what you are saying is best. We are all human, we have feelings what you did to them hurt them and now that you are back to refund the token to them, it is a good move you have taken, let it be legit. When you have re-funded all the money back to the owners and do the right thing then the forum will still give you trust back. The real trust is from the mind. So go and sin no more.",
