I think I been don still see one way wiwo dey do, but e come be like say that one na for only hero and legendary members. However I go like advice say the weekly amount wey you put for each user too big, even if na from senior members upwards. U no say some persons for this place na $65 dem dey collect as pay and dem gat settle other things like DCA and feeding. Because I know say no be everybody wey dey this forum dey like to use their normal monthly salary take invest, So why not bring the amount down a little to like $40, so that even if dem comot 10% for investing dem go still gats small change for hand then use the other one take do the akawo?",

      "body": "It's a nice and welcome development just like the other weekly akawo that others do in this our local board. This would have been better foe many of us, but base on the level we found our selves, we can't paticipate even as it's been reduced to $50. I hope someday when we rank up we will be able to meet up or probably create another one. But you guys need to be careful dealing with people you don't really know. I think it should be more of furum members who you are familiar with or you should have a meeting outside this forum, sit properly and discuss this matter. Because money issue is a serious business and not to be joked about. Like also discussing about penalty of default payment. And everything need to be documented. Another problem is when campegn wallet is empty and need refilling just like ours is right now, how will the contribution continue?",

Wetin I noticed be say you no too exercised patient or even to consult at least almost all the members of the original akawo group so that them for reason together to give birth to 50$ people but I see am say you too wan carry am out so that people wey no fit meet up 100$ go join $50 yes nothing bad and body is against it. Like the way Fiverstar don already talk e go really weigh you down if time no taken so if I be you I go still fall back to them to create out that spot from their original group so that with their strength them fit control the both sides together",

If the contribution will be done in btc, don't you think some people will see it as if the wallets are used to send money to each other since everything about the forum is private? What if people are accused of having multiple accounts. I urge the op to look into the risk involved before making further steps.To add to wetin you d reason give the OP, what if the reputable signature wey the member of the akawo d stop expectedly or the remove the peso from the signature campaign as we don see am happen for this forum severally. How will the peso go take cope up with em $50 weekly akawo payment? Since na the criteria of how the peso go take join the akawo contribution. I no wan try discourage peso or talk sae the idea of the akawo no d good, em d good, but there are things to consider before peso go get em self for akawo. The questions wey I raised supposed to be part of them cos em d very necessary for peso to think of, if such thing go fit happen. Remember sae no signature campaign wey promise us sae em go last for long. Na anything wey we see for the signature campaign wey we join, we take am like that without questioning the campaign manager, managing the signature campaign",
