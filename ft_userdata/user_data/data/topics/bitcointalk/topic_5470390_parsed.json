  "content": "I think legal challenges often serve as a litmus test for any organization, and Binance is currently under the magnifying glass. The SEC has come down hard on Binance, bringing forth 13 charges related to securities violations. These charges revolve around allegations of wash trading and the illegal sale of BNB and BUSD tokens as unregistered securities.Even before the SEC lawsuit, two key figures at Binance, CZ  and former Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lin, were charged by the CFTC for their questionable actions. The CFTC has not only issued charges but seeks to impose a payment trading and registration ban on the exchange, which would effectively mean Binance could no longer do business in the U.S. These legal battles are no trifles, and the implications are profound.The situation at Binance reminds us of a familiar tale: FTX. Is Binance headed down the same path? One thing that can't be ignored is the timing of key personnel departures from Binance. What's even more intriguing is the timing of key personnel departures from Binance. Several high-profile executives, including  its Chief Strategy Officer, President of Compliance, and General Counsel left Binance in what appeared to be a coordinated move. While the official statement cites personal reasons for their departures, rumors suggest that these executives were not satisfied with CZ's handling of the DOJ  investigation. The timing is indeed peculiar and bears a striking resemblance to the situation that unfolded before FTX's collapse when Sam Trabucco left Almeda Research.In the crypto world, things move fast. I think Binance is facing its biggest threat and I for one am terrified of what's to come, but they can never go down like ftx. Can Binance regain trust?",

Its part of their job to go hunt on every crypto exchanges to make sure they follow their rules from A to Z and as for binance, they are the biggest crypto exchange as of now so they are the main target for SEC to chew on therefore there will be tons of allegation in the future as wellQuote from: Aisha_jay on October 15, 2023, 06:26:09 AMIn the crypto world, things move fast.

FTX is a thief, they planned to appropriate investors' assets and SBF is facing a criminal lawsuit that has entered its 8th day and it is difficult to escape the crime. While binance is facing a series of meaningless troubles from the SEC and European legislature.  Simply because Binance is growing too fast and needs to be restrained before letting them expand further. Binance's market share is dropping significantly but saying it will collapse like FTX is nonsense.",

I wouldn't say this reminds me of FTX though, which collapsed because of fund management/accounting issues and eventually turned insolvent. In addition, this is only their US arm.However as a precaution, you should always consider the possibility that your go-to CEX could crumble at some point hence tread your actions carefully. Most common advice is to not use exchanges as a means of storage.",

SEC is pretty much throwing whatever they can to undermine the cryptocurrency scene in the US in favor of their CBDC, which is arguably inferior and less enticing than the superior cryptocurrency system that we have built for over a decade. Binance is going to weather the storm and gain traction once again the US. and if it couldn't, it's not going to be much of a problem, especially now that the US economy is on the shitbox so they can't really provide as much financial upturn for Binance. China is the name of the game now, as well as other neighboring countries, should we see changes in the outlook of China towards crypto, we can pretty much disregard this whole SEC conundrum altogether.",

My prediction is that they will not exist 10 years in the future, either being shut down or because they steal people's money.

I think Binance is still profitable, this gives more resources to fight the legal battles and weather the storm.As a Binance user, it's reasonable to be concerned about these developments.

I believe it was due to regulators request. If Binance stop operation in US, they will still be doing fine.

Why am I talking about Coinbase? Well that's a company that is mainly USA based and has around %20 of what Binance does in volume, they are even second and yet still barely at %20, not even that, more like %15 volume. So if we are talking about peaks, if 100 billion was the peak of Coinbase, then Binance must be around 300-400 billion range easily at the top, and even right now it should be somewhere over 100 billion easily, could be near 200 billion to be fair. Why does that matter in this situation? Well simply because no legal trouble could make them go away, no company that worths 100-200 billion, with a potential to double that even triple that easily could ever have legal troubles. They would hire not just the best lawyers but you can bet that they can hire the best judges as well, bribery is nothing for a company like that.",

If it is the former, then that should be expected regardless if Binance fails or not. Even simple misinformation can cause crypto prices to go down. Besides, saying a company is too big to fail is not a good mindset since it sounds like you have a reliance on them. Just be prepared and do your own risk management as usual. Not the first time a big company is crashing down as mentioned above. If it is the latter then just prepare a cut-loss accordingly, don't store your wealth on a token like BNB if you want security.I also don't think this is a trust issue since customers are still using them regardless of what the SEC does. You can't really affect how their legal process works afaik. It would be better to stop worrying about their future and start practicing better security and trading practices if I were you.",
