It is privateWrong,Bitcoin is decentralized, but if you have deposited your coins to centralized services e.g. casino, it's no longer decentralized and they have a control over your coins.Bitcoin is secure, but if you have deposited your coins to a casino, it's no longer secure since any website are vulnerable to get hacked e.g. exchanges had been hacked multiple times.Bitcoin is private, but if you have deposited your coins to a casino, it's no longer private since they have recorded your IP, device and moreover you have submitted your personal information to them, they can easily know your name, face, location etc.Quote4. It is untraceable. Bitcoin’s anonymityWrong,Bitcoin is not anonymous, but pseudonymous. Anyone can trace Bitcoin if they didn't use a mixer or having good privacy concern.Quote- Is it convenient to play in the Bitcoin Gambling?- How does Bitcoin gambling work?It's more convenient due to easier than using fiat to gamble and there's no much difference between Fiat based casino and Bitcoin based casino. It works same, the main difference is the payment method.",

So it's a traceable transaction.The reason why I hate reading an article is that the author does not have a true experience on gambling using crypto, as long as they have an article to publish.",
