It was a special edition celebrating 100 years of CONMEBOL and Copa America.It was the first edition held outside of South America, and the first with 16 teams.That year Chile was champion. with Argentina 2nd place.Uruguay, despite being a team that always plays all the championships with great will, and they play well, I don't think they are the favorite this time. Argentina and Brazil are more likely to be champions, since Argentina is the current champion of both the Copa America and the World Cup. And Brazil is always the favorite.The last time Uruguay was champion was in 2011 and after that they never managed to get into the top 4 again.And one more thing I forgot to comment on in my previous post, this competition is ideal for the United States, Canada and Mexico to play important championship matches, since the 3 host countries of the World Cup will not be playing in the qualifiers.",

We will have to wait and see how good Argentina and Brazil perform this time.On USA, I think they still have a long path ahead before they can call themselves to be a competitive team in the same way South American teams are.If you know a bit about popular culture, you must be aware that for people in the United States, the super bowl is the most important sport event, even beyond the Copa America, even being the host in this occasion.",

It's going to be hard to beat the Cavani-Suarez attacking duo, they had a great partnership.In the world cup the coach used Arrascaeta little, who in my opinion was their best player and made all the difference in Uruguay's result.There are players like Valverde and Darwin Nu√±ez who are new and can help the team a lot, together with Arrascaeta I believe that Uruguay will be able to play good games and continue as the third force in South American soccer. But to be Copa America champions I think Uruguay is on the same level as Mexico, USA and Ecuador at the moment.Quote from: Sirait on March 24, 2023, 06:09:09 PMin the 2022 world cup, US performance has actually increased, because they have started not only focusing on basketball or futball.I have an opinion that it's not only the results that matter, and a world cup is something incredibly difficult, you can't judge only with those parameters.I also agree that the US team has improved, they are playing very well, and if you compare with previous teams you can see that they are playing well and competing equally with other teams.One important thing that is missing in the US team at the moment are at least two very high level players. There is Pulisic that can be one of those players, or Reyna, but it would be ideal to have a higher level striker.The United States will have a good opportunity to develop its soccer by having the Copa America and the World Cup.",

One instant, we're basking in sunlight, the next, it's a downpour, and just like that ‚Äì you're an icicle. But seriously, folks, is weather the ultimate arbiter of soccer infrastructure supremacy? We're discussing football, not a sun-soaked beach getaway!The genuine rationale for Europe's enviable football foundation is elementary: money, money, money. Europe's simply rolling in it compared to other parts of the world, and that's the reason they can invest more in their cherished sport. It is not a rocket science, people!But wait, let's give props to South America's wealth of talent. Granted, their leagues may not be top-notch, but they've got some of the planet's best players. Want to see more young upstarts go pro? Time to funnel some serious cash and support to that neck of the woods.",

But, sometimes I'm bored too, I don't know why not as interesting as Euro 2024. Maybe you are thinking like me, I often to pass to watch the qualification group and 2nd round group in Copa America Cup, I always often to watch them in Semifinal, there usually is Brazil and Argentina listed, that more interesting because both will fight as World cup.And, what makes me bored too, the champions are not far away from Argentina, Brazil or Uruguay.I always watch Copa America, usually the matches are exciting, of course you mentioned the 3 best teams, but surprises happenDid you know that in 2001 Colombia was the champion, with Mexico in second place?And Chile was champion in 2015 and 2016, beating Argentina, and Messi played that game.In 2019 Peru made it all the way to the final against Brazil.In other words, it's not that predictable.I can also cite some reasons to watch the 2024 Copa America:They will have 16 teams, unlike the 10 that usually participate, there are 2 confederations participating.We will be able to see a little of how the 2026 world cup will be, since it will be in the United States, possibly using the same stadiums, and FIFA may do some tests or changes in refereeing etc.The United States, Canada, and Mexico will have a great opportunity to play a high level competition to prepare for the World Cup, since they will not be competing in the qualifiers.Messi will probably play, as will Neymar, with chances to play an important match like semi-final or final.",

But nobody really doubts that South American soccer players can be the best of the best obviously, but the leagues aren't really. The big stuff happens in Europe and that is why every single South American superstar ends up playing for a team in Europe. Though I fully agree that putting more emphasis on that part of the world and also to funnel more money to that part (hopefully) due to drawing more attention to it does help a lot with providing young talents with better chances to make it as a professional soccer player. The only way to find out which part of the world is better (Europe vs. CONCACAF) would be to have a league with the six best European countries against the six best CONCACAF teams. Not that I am hoping for that to happen, but it would be interesting to see how it ends. In tournaments it is often difficult to judge as the luck factor can play quite the role although Europe has been dominating for the last two decades. Oh, weather, you capricious beast! One instant, we're basking in sunlight, the next, it's a downpour, and just like that ‚Äì you're an icicle. But seriously, folks, is weather the ultimate arbiter of soccer infrastructure supremacy? We're discussing football, not a sun-soaked beach getaway!The genuine rationale for Europe's enviable football foundation is elementary: money, money, money. Europe's simply rolling in it compared to other parts of the world, and that's the reason they can invest more in their cherished sport. It is not a rocket science, people!But wait, let's give props to South America's wealth of talent. Granted, their leagues may not be top-notch, but they've got some of the planet's best players. Want to see more young upstarts go pro? Time to funnel some serious cash and support to that neck of the woods. Yes, or would you like to get a sunburn playing soccer in Brazil? @slapper I am sure we are actually of the same opinion that the weather isn't the ultimate factor whether a place is suitable for a sport to develop or not, but if it's constantly too hot it might play a role. I assume that is why they cooled down all those stadiums during the World Cup? Or perhaps only for the audience, I don't know. But I remember that many professionals complained in advance as well about temperatures. This is what I posted in the World Cup 2026 thread because someone argued that some teams have an advantage playing in Canada over those who have to play in Mexico, but a little search on the Internet gave me this:Quote from: shogun47 on April 04, 2023, 09:12:17 PMI have no idea whether climate change has changed anything, but this graphic says that Mexico is far from being the worst place to play soccer at during the World Cup. I guess it is something that also can't really be predicted. It is not impossible that Canada has a hot summer and regarding the hotels, that is something all those teams take care of in advance. None of the teams will spend time in an average hotel. That's all taken care of and the FIFA will have their first look well in advance. It is obviously not the case that Mexico is the worst place to play soccer during summer. Sure the graphic is subject to variability as there aren't many data points, but I think it does give one an idea whether Mexico really is such a horrible place compared to Canada in terms of weather and playing soccer.",
