  "content": "Abstract & ImportanceBlockchain technologies have become the most well-known and self-developing sector of today. The number of blocks used in blockchains is structurally increasing day by day. Increasing blocks are downloaded to the devices from 0 to the current block number in the currently used device. The size factor, which slows down the processing power and reduces the hardware life of the devices, can cause many slowdowns and problems around the world. Mildchain technology is able to offer device users (miners) faster transaction speed by turning the bulky structure of the currently used blockchain into a modern and lite workable structure.Even now, the world's leading mining companies and individual device owners may have problems with the block scanning time of many blockchains. The number of incompletely scanned blocks is repetitive and the processing times are too long.Importance for BlockchainAll kinds of community and contribution projects aiming to benefit the blockchain technology, which has succeeded in expanding its technological structure and the scope of benefits it indirectly creates, and which has established itself as a new era, will be in a very important position in the future. The Mildchain project will be able to offer a smooth working performance by adapting not only to the bitcoin blockchain, but also to other future blockchains that work by handling RPC connections.Initiation of Mildchain NetworkThe Mildchain project is in a structure that continues its development and can deliver the mobility structure to the collaborative parties to initiate if cooperation is requested. The public offering and the use of individual miners will be completed in Q2-Q3 2023. Of course, all innovations and information from within the network will be shared with the community on a regular basis.Stable PerformanceWhen we remove the blocks that recover the distributed ledger technology and are closed, there will be a 37% reduction and error FIX advantage in blockchains.Mobility and SpeedThe fact that it takes up +50GB of space and the transaction speed potential is below -170% shows that blockchains are cumbersome and old-fashioned. A lightweight blockchain structure will eliminate these 2 problems.ReliabilityThanks to the RPC structures, you can only benefit from the technology in its lightened form, without having to manually download the block structures of the entire blockchain.Token InformationMildchain Network has a BEP20 Token created using the Binance Smart Chain network and can be used in wallets that support the entire BSC network with the information below and can be purchased from decentralized exchanges that also use the entire BSC network.Token Name: Mildchain NetworkToken Symbol: MILDChain: BSC (56)Token Decimals: 9Token Contract Address: 0xba14e57b89a8d9023ed8e549d5fda7b488f56d25Why Should I Buy?The Mildchain project is a utility & community project with the BEP20 token launched in November 2022 and created using the Binance smart chain network. The entire supply created was only presented to the community, and the liquidity obtained was completely locked and a trust structure was created. Certificates proving that there is no honeypot and rugpull were obtained for the Mildchain project. The developer team only took 10% development share and released the remaining 90% Mildchain token through Pancakeswap with a fair launch.2% Marketing and 1% Charity fees are deducted from the purchase and sale transactions you will make in order to cover the marketing expenses and contribute to the growth of the project. Mildchain Token is a tradable and tradable Token. There are no conditions for you to be able to sell! It maintains its financial freedom structure. The Mildchain project, which was established in Poland, does not need to be DOXXED because it aims only for the benefit of the community. It is not possible to take any action to the detriment of the project anyway!Advantage for InvestorsProjects that have just started and progressed with the aim of shedding light on the future and that have adopted the aim of benefit and serving the community become the focus and point of interest of all investors. At the beginning, like every company and formation, we need new people in our community and new small and big investors who want to grow with us.Expanding blockchain technology and proving that blockchain is a necessity structure that can shed light on the future, as banking and credit card digital structure services did decades ago, has become one of the most important question marks today.Transforming blockchain structures from bulky and heavy structures into more mobile structures is in the direction of starting a second revolution.Website: https://mildchain.networkDocs: https://docs.mildchain.networkTwitter: https://twitter.com/mildchainTelegram: https://t.me/mildchainFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mildchainnetworkYoutube: https://medium.com/@mildchainnetworkReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/mildchainGithub: https://github.com/Mildchain",
