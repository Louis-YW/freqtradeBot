Because I only read the general purpose of Bitcoin itself where Bitcoin was created in 2009 in the middle of an economic recession. Bitcoin was created to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, but it has also attracted investors who are attracted to cryptocurrencies as a store of value currency, comparable to gold.

Those attempts had flaws and didn't get much traction, many even remained purely theoretical. But Satoshi built on their experience and used his innovation to create the first working decentralized electronic currency. The people who wanted such currency dreamed about transferring money without restrictions, without interference.

If you can see the whitepaper suggests that Bitcoin was created to address some of the flaws in traditional financial systems, such as the high costs and long transaction times associated with traditional banking systems.  Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized, meaning that it operates without a central authority, like a government or a bank, controlling it and this decentralization makes it resistant to censorship and interference from third parties.  I hope you better understand this.Anyone with an internet connection can participate in the Bitcoin network, buy and sell Bitcoin, and use it as a means of payment which is the mean core upon the creation.",

Let's read his stance on this matter years ago before he left the forum.Quote from: satoshi on February 14, 2010, 03:52:23 PMRight.  Otherwise we couldn't have a finite limit of 21 million coins, because there would always need to be some minimum reward for generating.  In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes.  I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.Nobody knows at in 2009, 2010 but now 14 years since 2009, I have stronger belief that Bitcoin won't die.If you want to be more knowledgeable then more bullish about Bitcoin, let's read The bullish case for Bitcoin",

But for newbie I don't quite recommend to read the whitepaper because there's a lot of alien words where it would make you confused.The first question is really simple, Satoshi only want to avoid third parties, while the second question, you just need to use your logic. If anyone can access Bitcoin through non custodial wallet and decentralized exchange, do you think there's no one can use Bitcoin?",

Without globally accepted and properly working digital currency, they are cut off from the rest of the world and have to only transact locally like in primitive times when money didn't exist. Bitcoin solves this problem by giving these people the ability to join the party and transact with whomever they wish without having to ask permission. It exists to help people make trades with each other in a decentralized way regardless of imposed sanctions or other constraints; it unites people that otherwise would have been disparate.",

Such as the reason to be detached from government regulations so that they cannot be arbitrary in managing everyone's assets because they have power. Bitcoin was created to be decentralized which means it cannot be regulated by anyone including the government, and because the number is limited makes bitcoin very valuable.Bitcoin is also designed as an alternative to the traditional financial system which tends to be centralized and vulnerable to the influence of the government or large financial institutions. Bitcoin is also considered a lucrative investment tool by some due to its increasing value over the long term.Bitcoin's goal is to provide an alternative to existing financial systems and give its users full control over money and transactions.",

But what's cool about it, and what sets it apart and makes it unique from previous forms of digital currency, is that it's not controlled by any central authority. Instead, it's run by a bunch of computers all over the world that work together to keep track of everyone's transactions.The guy who created Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, didn't really say why he made it, but he wrote this thing called a whitepaper that explained how it works. And in that paper, he talked about how regular money can be a pain because you have to rely on banks and stuff to keep track of it. But with Bitcoin, you don't need a bank, so it's more like a peer-to-peer system where people can send money directly to each other without any middlemen getting in the way.",
