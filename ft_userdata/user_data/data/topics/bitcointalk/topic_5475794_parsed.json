Feel free. We are all the same here; we are from the same country. Showing each other love is the only thing we can give to each other. However, feel free to ask questions on anything you don’t understand. People will help out.

Threads like this are coming up every single day, and nobody complains about them. The only thing is to welcome them and give them some guides that will guide them while operating on the forum. However, it is not about struggling by yourself. Do you have someone who will teach you what you want to know? And that’s the reason for creating this thread, in my opinion. Even though I know we have specific threads on this local board, for introduction, I think that thread is not related to what the OP is looking for; he wants us to guide him through the forum.",

And if you want to push up you have to work hard and post qualitatively and not quantitatively then merit will definitely come for you to go up without stressing yourself. But whereby you are posting low quality posts then nobody can push you to the next level. And what u go so be say you go read more than posting.

Newbies must come for the expansion of Bitcoin and the forum at last. And all the other advise you gave to the op na correct ones. Op go do everything by himself to grow up. And not to beg for people to push up. Op just enter forum with 7 activities and e don dey beg for push up and dis shows that the orientation was very bad.",
