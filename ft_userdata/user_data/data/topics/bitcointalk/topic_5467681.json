We will look into it and get back to you as soon as we learn more.Best regards,Damjan S.Please someone had the same problem? I am afraid they are not going to let me withdraw my funds ever, after two months and a half I can not believe this is a technical issue, I am thinking they could be insolvent or had a hack. Any advice? Thanks",

If so, what's the error message displayed? Or do you mean you don't see your balance at all when you want to make a withdrawal?",

And have you tried submitting other tickets since that message?This is sadly a common issue with exchanges sometimes. There isn't much you can do, the support team is the only one who can help you and I doubt it's a technical issue, it's probably something to do with your account (suspicious activity, more KYC to do, etc.)",

So you think they have been insolvent and they are blocking withdrawals for almost 3 months yet you're the first one in months one around here with the problem in the last month? I did one exchange just before leaving for a trip so that would be something around the middle of August (can't check it right now for sure) and it funds were in under 24 hours.Most likely it's about your documents and your KYC, from my experience Bitstamp is probably the worst when doing this, I was just lucky to be an already old customer with them when they started but for newer clients going through this might be a nightmare, check your previous mail they might have asked you already for a ton of documents, most like proof of funds as that is their specialty.",

You cannot withdraw it until the order is executed or cancelled.Try this possibility and make sure you have no open orders.A terrible feature. At least in a couple of exchanges I have used. The overview of the balance can be seen on the withdrawal page, along with the balance that is still locked up in open orders. Sometimes I just wonder why some very old exchanges are so slow with implementing new changes and features. I am glad I have never used them.",

In order to be assisted by other members, it's best to be a little more descriptive and, if possible, provide screenshots, transcripts, or anything else you have to prove your point. From what I'm understanding, you have sufficient balance in your account, but you're unable to withdraw due to a technical error showing you don't have any balance. Am I right? I'm a little skeptical because it sounds way too odd and something that I've never heard before.I've used Bitstamp in the past, for quite a few years too, and have even left a decent sum of money deposited and abandoned for over two years. I never faced any issues, and I'd still use it if it weren't for the excessive trading fees.",

This is why even with established exchanges, it can still be risky. Also, if they haven't finished looking into you case, there's a good chance it's an open ended answer.I would suggest following up your case on their social media as well. For instance: https://twitter.com/Bitstamp/ -- check bio. Be aware that there are loads of scammers pretending to be bitstamp so always triple check.",

      "body": "Two months is too long already for them to have you wait hanging. This is totally unfair! What are they into, a fishing expedition? To freeze withdrawals is to have found something suspicious. They should have at least told you what that is.We can only speculate here. If they aren't asking for additional KYC information of proof of source of funds, then they aren't probing the user behind the account nor your financial capacity. If you don't have any open orders either, then it must be something else. Are you using a new withdrawal address? If you are, have you tried withdrawing funds to an address that you have been using for years? Or have you made a deposit from suspicious sites like an unlicensed gambling platform?In any case, you should be submitting another ticket. You may also inquire about your pending concern in all their official channels.",
