And provably youtube will be another alternative but in future maybe we can see a streaming platform where it will focus on cryptocurrency industry or web3 rather where many people like streamers can take advantage with.",

If Stake, as a separate entity, goes live on Twitch that is okay? Stake is a gambling entity, and it's not safe from Twitch's ban since they are a gambling platform.Quote from: Despairo on September 26, 2022, 09:47:30 AMYoutube is worst than Twitch, so I don't think there's another good platform for Drake except Twitch since the other platforms doesn't popular.For now there aren't any alternatives. Twitch is the best out of there as of now and there's no changing that any time soon. Dlive is a good platform but very few viewers at a time, although I think Drake can pull a lot of viewers since a lot of huge Twitch names in the past managed to pull viewers from Twitch to other live streaming platform (Mixer) in the past with enough hype and advertisement of the switch.",

Basically, people follow the streamers and not the sites like Twitch or YouTube. Without the content being loaded on this platform, these platforms are zero. People will follow the popular streamers no matter on which platform they will stream. If youtube and twitch start a campaign against crypto gambling videos and streamers, these people will move to other platforms and the audience will also move with them.",

Then they won't be streaming there. Due to which some other sites including Stake.com, Rollbit.com and Duelbits.com have will be banned.But the agency says it won't ban fantasy sports like sports betting, fantasy football or poker. My question is why Stake.com, Rollbit.com and Duelbits.com will be shut down. Is it just because of the license or is there something else?.",
