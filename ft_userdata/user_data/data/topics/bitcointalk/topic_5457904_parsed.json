  "content": "Don't find this amusing in anyway possible, that's because, So much have been said about Manchester United Captain-England defender Harry Maguire who was signed from Leicester City for Â£80million 2019.He must have been delighted to make Manchester United his number one choice, Â but judging for the past three years, Harry Maguire hasn't been much of a useful player to the club as he should be. Â Some say he is the worst value for money signing in Manchester United's history. He has let so much pressure on him and has responded sluggishly, Such a player for that value should be worthy of high performance for the club but all we see is horrible shows and lack of self belief.Yes the idea would be said to be biased, Â but, I honestly think Manchester United should have invested into Bitcoin than buying Harry Maguire, Â The Bears and Bulls off course wouldn't have caused more horrific scenes, also increased blood pressure on Manchester United fans. Â In financial circumstances I mean crises, Man United would have falled back to the Pumps Bitcoin had. So back to 2019, Harry Maguire or Â£80million for Bitcoin? Genuine Opinions!PS: Don't shoot the messenger. ðŸ™ƒ",

They never did, they never will.Just think of Maguire as a bad investment. It happens everything, even to the best of us. Personally, I feel Maguire was a better investment for Man United than Hazard for Madrid.",

Personally, I feel Maguire was a better investment for Man United than Hazard for Madrid.You are right that Maguire isn't as wasteful as Hazard. Bitcoin is an asset that keeps increasing in value as time passes by and it has a volatile nature,which makes it superb. Properties and human depreciates in values as time goes on,that is why investing in bitcoin in 2019 with that amount will be more profitable than investing in Maguire. I believe that this club managers sometimes don't know that such player will decline in performance in a very short period. That is why it is good to buy the players very young,we are only humans and wouldn't be able to look into the future.",
