      "body": "Speaking of cash(papernotes), it's adoption has gradually been reducing over recent years now and with the development of new technologies soon the government would see no need to print paper currency when every transaction could be carried out virtually online.   In my country we recently experienced a cash scarcity which lasted for more than 2 months due to the governments inability to manage or plan ahead before imposing the change of our old currency interface. During this period all over the country, people began to adopt the online payment system even for payment as small as a pinch of salt. We all had no choice but to adopt. Now, what I'm trying to say here is that negative events can bring forth both positive and negative change to the world. Up till now, even after our money issues has been resolved people still use online banking to carry out transaction and prefer it to cash(paper notes) soon the world will adopt online digital currency (cryptocurrency) but I don't think that paper notes would ceize to exist or disappear totally",

      "body": "No, I don't think so, a lot of transactions are still settled in cash< see and after 2020 more than a quarter of transactions are still settled in cash and it's a preferred option for many when you want to trade from the local store or pay for daily requirements. I expect this percentage to continue to decline, from 71% in 2019 to 25%, which is a significant change, but if we reach zero, this may take more than 50 years.Source61% transactions were settled with debt, which shows that sometimes cash makes us feel guilty when we spend a lot of it. While I can pay 10,000 dollars with a single click, the pain it causes when I pay it with cash is greater.",

If we read about the recent reports that the fiat devaluation is actually caused by the excessive number of paper money printed not to talk of the expensive amount spend on the printing process this cash, this has actually prompted the government to promote the method of cashless policy which has brought about the creation of fintechs. This factors have had an impact of cash been used less. But I don’t think that total cash less policy can be achieved sooner or later because there are rural areas that still the basic network service to run this cashless policy. Also the transaction fees and sometimes the slow payment process during transaction is a thing that would still make it hard to get away from using cash. Yes bitcoin is already an alternative because many people run both inter or intra border transactions using the bitcoin. Because aside the slow transaction process and the high transactions fees it so much more secure than the even the fiat transfers.",

      "body": "This is actually a good thread, but as of now I think it would be impossible for Bitcoin to take over to current currencies right now since most countries are depended on it. But I already found some countries that their fiat money doesn't even have value or worthless that they make it use as a toilet paper. You could be called as millionaire and poor at the same time. With this maybe Bitcoin could be a good alternative as the country aren't dependent to fiat money. Only thing they need to think of is how they could implement it when Bitcoin is a decentralized system to the country.",

What does the future hold for cash, and can btc become an alternative?Thank youAt 99.9%, I expect that cash in the future (or the near future) will be withdrawn from circulation. This is primarily due to the fact that this money can't be tracked, and it is cash that is 100% anonymous, and not bitcoin. Because it is impossible to track the chain of users, transactions, and so on.Bitcoin by 99.9% will not be an alternative to cash. This role is destined for CBDC.",

Though, the adoption won't be as massive as what the government's solution, say digital cash or CBDC. Without a doubt, the vision of a cashless society is nothing new. bitcoins wont to replace FIAT. There is a technical limitation and surely governments do not like a currency that is beyond their own control.One might argue, the lightning network might be able to solve the scalability problem. Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that Bitcoin can be fully replaces FIAT currencies. So, it is not a scalability problem. In fact, since its inception bitcoin is not meant or visioned as a replacement.",

Bitcoin can be used as a medium to transfer value from one point to any point around the world without going through a third party, for this reason Bitcoin has the potential to become an alternative medium for transactions or the role of cash will soon be replaced. Even though there are still many countries that have not made Bitcoin a means of payment, technological developments are inevitable. Currently cash still plays an important role as a transaction tool, but we must be more active in educating our families and relatives to use non-cash transactions before cash disappears from the surface of the earth.Robert Reich once said thisQuoteThere will be a time (I don’t know when), I can’t give you a date when physical money is just going to cease to exist.My assumption is that sooner or later cash will disappear from circulation because nothing can fight technological developments.",

When you say ATMs are losing popularity, it means people are turning from paper money to digital money, but still using the national currency version of this, not decentralized cryptocurrencies. The alternative people go for is always the most stable one. That is why we have the world using Dollar as exchange reserve and every country trying to control their centralized currencies in a desperate attempt to keep them most stable as possible.And when they fail doing so, there is a lot of financial troubles, riots, investors running from the country, governments using force to intimidate citizens. I imagine if Bitcoin was adopted as currency by one country or another we would see these things happening as well, because human beings aren't prepared to live in environments characterized by volatility, uncertainity and doubt 24 hours.",

While we are increasingly conducting cashless transactions through fiat currencies, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will replace the traditional fiat system. Although people have become familiar with Mobile Financial Services (MFS) systems, a significant portion of the population remains unaware of Bitcoin. This lack of awareness can be attributed to the fact that fiat systems are endorsed and regulated by governments, whereas Bitcoin operates independently.",

The value can deteriorate continually, but it will never be stopped. Even if Bitcoin becomes a global legal tender, physical money will never be displaced. But, normally, I don't think Bitcoin can be legally accepted in every part of the world; it's likely to only be in some countries. I know that change is constant, but even if anything happens and we stop using physical cash, maybe every payment is carried out electronically, via transfers or pay cards, and it will still be the local currency we are using.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",
