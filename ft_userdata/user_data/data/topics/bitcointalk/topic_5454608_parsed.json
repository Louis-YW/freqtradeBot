Any suggestions? Why did you think of making Stablecoins a development project? apart from this, do you have a deep idea of what you are entering into the Crypto space or bockchain technology? Are you a developer or looking for a developer?      Or maybe the reason is that many banking systems today are outdated and inefficient due to the inflation that is happening now?am I right? Also, making a stablecoin is not that simple to do in my understanding. Then if you make a Stablecoin you need to make a prototype for it, and to have it you must have a Whitepaper to make for the stablecoins you will make, Now, if you are really determined, the good blockchain to use is TRON or TRC20 because its network is well established, because the security and infrastructure of this blockchain can support its high volume transaction.Guidelines of how to create Stablecoins?",

      "body": "To create a stablecoin, there must be a reserve to link its value, and the method of linking differs. Either it is centralized, which is what happens in USDT&USDC, or decentralized like Dai, where the smart contract generates currencies against USD. Those new pair coins are the ones that balance the value of the stable currency.Creating a centralized stablecoin is relatively easier, but you need a lot of money, as every dollar of stablecoin must equal a dollar in your bank account, and with regulatory legislation, I do not think that individuals can create a centralized stablecoin.For decentralized stablecoin, you need to hire a developer, not a partner.",
