  "content": "From the article : Economist Peter Schiff Explains Why He Expects Bitcoin to Crash as Recession Deepens — Warns 'Don't Buy This Dip'Economist Peter Schiff predicts that the crypto market especially Bitcoin and Ether will continue to crash due to the need to cash out.QuoteEconomist and gold bug Peter Schiff has made some dire predictions about cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin and ether. He explained that “The need to sell bitcoin to pay the bills will only get worse as the recession deepens,” adding that bitcoin is poised to crash to $20K while ether will sink to $1K.He also say in his tweet that Bitcoin will continue to crash down to 20k while ETH to 1k.QuoteBitcoin looks poised to crash to $20K and Ethereum to $1K … Don’t buy this dip. You’ll lose a lot more money.He stated the reason why this thing will happen and said that holders need to sell because of the ever-increasing price of commodities.QuoteThe need to sell bitcoin to pay the bills will only get worse as the recession deepens and many Hodlers lose their jobs, especially those working for soon to be bankrupt blockchain companies.When I read this article I was like.. is he on drugs?.  Why wouldn't I buy this dip?  This is like a Bitcoin on sales.  Even if the Bitcoin market stays in bear trend in years, it will become bullish after this trend.  We have seen it several times.  I think he is forgetting the trading law of buy low sell high and if we can buy lower that will be better.  Now I fully understand why many crypto enthusiasts ignore most of Peter Schiff advice.QuoteMost bitcoin proponents continue to ignore all bitcoin and crypto predictions made by Schiff, with many seeing his gloomy expectations as a buy signal for BTC.“Possibly the most consistently bad investment advice on public record,” one Twitter user wrote. Another asked Schiff: “Check bitcoin or Ethereum 5-year charts, then check gold’s. Which would you rather have held? Which would you rather hold for another 5 years?”How about you?  Would you let this another window opportunity to buy BTC at a lower price pass by?  Do you also think Bitcoin price will crash further?",

His opinion about BTC was also negative when the whole market was moving upward. I do not care or follow this person at all.One thing I am certain about with BTC is that it will break ATH every 4-year cycle. This is inevitable because of its limited supply and as long as its community grows. And the bear market is the best time to grab more BTC, so I am buying the dip.",

Today it is 10 times higher and even though he has stopped his extreme FUD but he is still spreading FUD.",

This is more like wishful thinking disguised as a pseudo-analysis. There's no recession so far. We are witnessing high inflation, but the unemployment rate isn't growing and the GDP isn't decreasing. Many \"experts\" are predicting stagflation, which might happen, but there's no 100% certainty.He could be right about the BTC price dropping down to 20K USD, but for all the wrong reasons. The Bitcoin bears are willing to sell at 30K and buy the dip at 20K USD. His doom and gloom prophecy about crypto traders and companies going bankrupt might not happen.",

But I don't buy all at once or all-in, just to anticipate if the price continues to fall to lower prices. And if the bitcoin price is going to hit $20k, I'll set a buy target at that price and wait. I don't know if the bitcoin price will fall further or will bounce to a higher price than now because, in my opinion, the current market conditions are moving fast because many people are panicking about the market situation. Hopefully, $23k is the lowest point for bitcoin and after that, the price can bounce back.",
