It cannot be solely attributed to Jerome Powell's decision to raise interest rates. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions are based on a wide range of economic indicators, including employment levels, inflation, and economic growth, and the primary goal is to promote maximum employment and stable prices.",

If you are using the unemployment status of the US for the reason why the FED is hiking the rate and using job cuts as a solution to high demands, then you are contracting yourself as this is still leading to more unemployment aside from the fact that it's not the solution.The reason why FED has been hiking Federal Funds Rate since late 2021 and become so aggressive since 2022 is nothing but a rise in inflation. Inflation should naturally cut demands because you now have lesser value for your money as against your narration. However, what causes inflation might be deeper than anyone could imagine, but of course, this present one is global, so it's a chain reaction that is not peculiar to the US.The solution to this, and of course what will stop the rate hike and perhaps start forcing FED to cut rates is when the Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index and Core PCE Price take the downturn. This is when the retail sales and Core Retail sales start to increase, then FED can begin cutting the rate or holding it.",

High interest rates will result in lower economic growth, and lower economic growth will result in high unemployment which then will affect inflation rates. Recession being the proximal factor to high unemployment, of course.Inflation becomes a positive feedback loop -- with employees demanding more pay, more demand gets created and inflation goes up even higher. Companies just combat it by laying off the employees. Powell gets a bad rep, to be honest. He's trying to play a balancing game with the interest rates based on the dumpster fire he's been handed that is the U.S. economy.",
