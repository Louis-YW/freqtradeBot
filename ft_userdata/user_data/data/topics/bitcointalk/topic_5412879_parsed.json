      "body": "I like to cook certain foods on my bbq grill because it is a completely different taste from in-house cooking. Especially when you grill beef and chicken I feel like you can enjoy the taste and don't have to use cooking oil which is not really good for your body. The great thing about my bbq grill is that it is small that I am able to take it to the park or the lake and be able to grill just as long as my propane tank is functional. Now when it comes to grilling between propane or charcoal, I recommend propane as it is fast to get your grill started and ready. As opposed to charcoal, you have to get the coal hot and if the fire dies out then you have to get it back going with lighter fluid and a lighter. This just be describing the processes it can time consuming, inconvenient, and dangerous if the fire gets out of control.The foods that I really enjoy cooking are bbq chicken with rice because every time I cook the meal it makes my family happy and compliments how well the chicken was made and try to get my family's secret recipe. I also enjoy doing chicken soup on rainy days because it reminds me of when I was a small child and my mother would say, \"If it rains, then there is enough water for soup day\". Growing up my mother tried to teach me and had me help her around the kitchen, not realizing that she was passing down food recipes that help me today. Another food that I like to cook is beef steak with onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, and cilantro, and make tacos or just eat beef steak with a mix of vegetables.",

The magnets reduce the propane flavor that hits your food and also saves you on fuel because you can now run the grill at a lower setting. Propane cooking without the magnets produces city chicken and city beef, low food grade quality. Restaurants should use the magnets as they would save them a ton of money and their food would taste less city. Going to build a rocket stove and maybe oven, for outdoor cooking. Uses less wood and reduces the black smoke of the fire.",
