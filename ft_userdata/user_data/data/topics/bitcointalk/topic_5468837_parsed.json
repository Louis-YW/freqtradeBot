A note app can function better in some areas, but it has to be one which does not collate user data from what they type and keep logs of the information.",

The only error you get most times is the timed out error which usually comes when you take longer time in posting your message.Quote from: Upgrade00 on October 02, 2023, 04:10:05 AMA note app can function better in some areas, but it has to be one which does not collate user data from what they type and keep logs of the information.From the list he has posted here, I don't see anyone that would be trust wordy. They are just some Ai and third party sites which is not any different from the notepad installed on your mobile. I prefer not to download third-party software, especially when it comes to writing or typing. Some of these apps might be designed to anonymously store your passwords or monitoring your activity. Instead, I typically use my phone's built-in Notepad when I need to write longer responses that I don't want to lose. I also suggest using trusted, pre-installed software for writing tasks to stay on the safer side.",

It is very annoying though. I have had this experience several times whereby I will be writing and all of a sudden I begin to see my page is loading backwards and all what I have typed wiped off which is very much annoying. I had to resolve to o sourcing for an easy note taking App and I was introduced to sticky notes which have been very much helpful to me. Very easy to use. You can save your work and width it when ever you feel like doing such. So far I started using it, it has been of good help and importance to my writing both here and other activities. I no longer move about with note book rather I use my app for typing and here too I do most of my typing on my sticky note app before posting here.",

Accident happens, a wrong move or a wrong press & everything gets lost. So whenever I'm on my mobile phone, I always use \"Keep Notes\" from Google to ensure that I don't lose my work. And after writing the content, I tend to post it here.You are right, OP. And as we all know, BitcoinTalk isn't mobile-friendly. You have to zoom in to see every section or board to post, edit, or reply. It's such a pain. Even at this moment, I'm writing in my Keep Notes app. I prefer using apps rather than websites. What if you accidentally closed the browser or tabs? Some of these websites save data in the cache, so even if the page is closed, you are back where you started from. But many don't. That's what I'm concerned about.",

I saw some users complaining that some Python commands may not appear when you try to publish it, and because a single line of code may cause problems in the program, it is better to use these code uploader site when you want to post a new code.It is for a small group and not for everyone. They are the ones who post codes and the number of active developers who making such codes on the forum is small due to the limited number of words that do not appear compared to the number of developers.",
