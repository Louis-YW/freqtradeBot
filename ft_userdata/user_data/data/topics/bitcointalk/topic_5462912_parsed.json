So welcome then, good to be in that space that year because that is a bull run that no one forgets.Quote from: valfather.btc on August 11, 2023, 11:56:23 AMI wonder what you think of Bitcoin name services for example https://btc.us/ and also the L2-network Stacks that it runs on. I myself is invested in them a bit, not as much as in btc ofc. I believe they could take off hard if bitcoin makes new all time highs.Well if you wanted to buy a domain name with the .btc then I will say it could be a good investment. As it bitcoin will continue to grow, and so there could be a demand for users or even developers to have a .btc as a domain name and probably this is what the goal of the services that you posted here. And if that happens, then it's going to be expensive in the future to buy a .btc domain and there could be some individuals who loves to flip a .btc domain name and buy it right now.",

I searched for generic names and they are all reserved.",

Well, he already have an investment which is good especially if what he invested in is legit where he will surely earn profit but if it isn't legit then not just lose profit but also the capital that is used in investing. Holding BTC would be much safer compared to investing in what you didn't know or not sure that it is not a scam.",

I believe they could take off hard if bitcoin makes new all time highs.Well i don't get name services on eth, or in other altcoins either. I don't get how linking your pseudonymous account with some vanity string of letters is taking bitcoin anywhere. Or other altcoins. One strenght about the eth or any other account is that it's harder for just everyone to connect them to my online handles or real identity. Imho adding this kind of attention to oneself in a public network is basically asking for doxxing.Maybe i don't just get the future implementations, but i can't see anything cool coming from this. Other than maybe some airdrops, but that's not really a tech developement.",

      "body": "Bitcoin layers 2 besides the lightning network is not garnered much attention. Even with the recent hype of NFT, it is directly built on top of the native chain, although it is surely inefficient.With that in mind, there is no pressure or even lack of market potential to build on top of Bitcoin layers 2. Besides stacks, the one that is still being developed that makes smart contract capability more flexible is using Taro or RGB protocols. There is also sidechain like Liquid and Rootstock. All of those are not pretty much having a market as big as other cryptocurrencies which are more focused of smart-contract capabilities. So since there is no pressure and motive, I think the development would lag behind, so does with the investment opportunity within that sector.",

Im excited about the btc altcoins that will emerge instead of the eth-mania we have had.Only if it is Bitcoin or .btc, this does not give it value just as is the case with Ethereum. I find in these sites a new way to withdraw Bitcoin from you, and the possibility of its continuation is much less than the known domains. If you specialize in finding domains that may have value, you will realize that they are worthless, or at least the chances of making a profit from them are much more difficult.Hodling your bitcoins",

I myself is invested in them a bit, not as much as in btc ofc. I believe they could take off hard if bitcoin makes new all time highs.The bitcoin name service can only be applied on the L2 bitcoin blockchain. That means some blockhain like stack or RIF which have ability to implement such feature. You shall not hope for bitcoin blockchain to implement it caused by it will not happen. Basically, it was only changing the name from address to the specific name that demanded by the owner of address but think about it will grow during the next bullrun is still remain speculative question. The answer will be maybe yes or maybe no. It's caused by the bitcoin pump didn't significantly affect the whole of market. Are you expecting bitcoin name service token?",
