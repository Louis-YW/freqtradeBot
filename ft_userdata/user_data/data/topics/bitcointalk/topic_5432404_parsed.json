  "content": "Hello,I have read a post about \"Cheap Node Self Hosting\", but I wanted to ask a very simple question to which I haven't been able to find an answer online.I have only one laptop at home, which I use everyday for all my tasks. Can I use an external HDD to store the blockchain and set Bitcoin Core to use this disk ? Would that be enough to make a custom bitcoin node? I know that this means that I will leave my laptop turned on all day. My laptop specs are: 16GB RAM and i7 11th gen processor.I could buy an external SSD, but since I already own an external HDD, I wanted to know whether there are major differences.Forgive my ignorance.thanks",

If you can spare 8-10GB for dbcache then you'll find the sync goes by a lot faster than it would.I tried syncing a laptop with 8GB ram and a hard disk drive (internal) and I expect it'd complete the sync in about 4 days to a week if I left it running with a high dbcache (memory usage).It'll be something that you'll be able to work out what works once you've done it. I don't think an external SSD would be much faster than an external hard drive unless it uses a faster connection (such as usbc or ethernet to connect to your computer). Replacing a ram stick with an SSD might boost the sync though (and then you can move your synced files onto a hard drive) - assuming you have two 8gb ram drives and they connect fairly normally (they fit in different sizes though iirc so you'd have to find something compatible).",

Just make sure that the external HDD has at least 500-600 GB of memory. I'm running a full node in a raspberry pi4 8gb ram with an HDD with 500 GB more or less and it works perfect.If your laptop uses Linux you can use this post to follow the steps in order to set up the node: https://ishaana-misra.medium.com/using-raspberry-pi-to-run-a-full-bitcoin-node-a30c6339b06eIt's for a Raspberry but it's the same, Linux is Linux, if you have a debian distro based this should work.If you're using Windows I think there's a GUI and you can configure where you want to save the blockchain in a simple way. (Not sure about this, never tried on Windows).Hope this helps!",

You shouldn't really use your everyday laptop for running Bitcoin node, and you don't need latest generation processor or crazy amount of RAM at all.If you still plan to continue using this laptop both for Bitcoin node and for everyday tasks, internet, etc than I would say NO, don't do it.Better buy cheap used laptop or raspberry pi with 1TB hard drive and use it only for running bitcoin node, bitcoin software and nothing else.SSD would be much faster but regular HDD can do the job and it's much cheaper.",
