Take note that mining bitcoin requires a big computing power and it's not as easy as you may think.

You don’t create new bitcoin when you mine it. There is a definite number of bitcoin, so when someone mines bitcoin, new bitcoins is added to the ones already in circulation.Asides that, I don’t think you’re actually looking for answers to your questions",

Bitcoin can be bought from exchange using you traditional bank account to connect to the exchange, buying Bitcoin is much more easier than mining Bitcoin.",

Currently, 6.25 BTC is generated in each block and it will decrease to 3.25 BTC after the next halving. bitcoins rules decide on the amount of coins created.. not users.this is an unbroken rule that users cant change/decide/create themselvesyes when a mining pools efforts(via its miners) result in a block that solves a puzzle, new coins are awarded to that pool. and that pool decides how to share it out with all its miners. but its the following of the rules that helped create the coin. not a particular miners designits more of a miner gets paid for its work, with new coins, based on the rules .. rather than a miner created the new coina miner is not a \"creator\" they cant just decide \"maybe today i will create 7btc this block instead of 6.25\".. a miner is just a \"worker\".. workers getting paid with fresh coin",

      "body": "It's not creating new bitcoins. When you mine for gold, you don't create gold amongst the rocks and rubble that you tear down. You discover them and release said gold ores from the dirt and rocks that it is stuck with. The same can be said for bitcoin. When you mine bitcoin, you mine amongst the codes where bitcoins could be found and calculations are made by your system to fulfill this. Which is why the more powerful your rig is, the more potent it could become with mining bitcoins.",

All the Bitcoins that can ever exist are mathematically defined from the moment the Bitcoin software is launched. When miners solve the complex mathematical problems, known as cryptographic hash functions, to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain, they are rewarded with a certain amount of fresh bitcoins that have not been previously used in any transactions.QuoteBuying Bitcoin is paying for a certain amount of Bitcoin in physical cash Buying Bitcoin generally refers to the process of exchanging fiat currency (physical cash, or government-issued currency) for a certain amount of Bitcoin. This can be done through various platforms, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, peer-to-peer marketplaces, or Bitcoin ATMs. Or you can even do it in person, by meeting with a seller directly to exchange cash for Bitcoin.QuoteEarning Bitcoin is getting paid through the digital currency for a particular job doneYes, earning Bitcoin can refer to getting paid in the form of digital currency for completing a particular job or task. This can take many forms, such as getting paid in Bitcoin for providing goods or services, receiving Bitcoin as a form of compensation or bonus, or receiving a portion of your salary in Bitcoin.",
