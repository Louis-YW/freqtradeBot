      "body": "Thanks for the new thread, was going to post this update on the other  This otherwise doesn't look good at all, even though it's only the first (unconfirmed) day of a new capitulation phase. Hoping it'll simply be another correction due to stagnation of growth would be naive at this point.The last time we had a secondary capitulation after hash rate recovery prior to a buy signal (hash & price recovery) in the past few years was in May 2021 (as highlighted below). The recovery arrived at $43K prior to price dropping to $29K, however the secondary capitulation occurred at $35K, so I find it bit vague as to whether there will be much more significant downside at present.If we are to consider the original analysis of the potential for a 50% drop from this hash rate capitulation, that originally occurred at $30K, then there could still be a target of $15K. Either way, I think it's too early to tell. The hash rate could still recover by the end of the week signalling a recovery, or otherwise another phase of capitulation. The fact that the recovery was only signalled on the Daily chart is a concern though.Notably while today there was a drop in hash rate to the lowest level in the past 2 weeks, the average mining cost as of yesterday was $23.4K, a considerable increase from two days before at $18.3K. It seems likely that both of these spikes (both up and down) will be short lived. Already today's decline in hash rate could well price the mining cost back below $20K for example, for further hash rate recovery.",

      "body": "This seems like the age old argument of whether Bitcoin price follows hashrate, or whether hashrate follows the Bitcoin price.  I am a believer that people add new hashrate when it's profitable to do so, meaning they are reactive to the market price.  I doubt big businesses are doing their cost calculations and deciding to expand when it isn't profitable to do so (although historically this has been the move when spending USD on miners).  So I believe that you've got your post backwards and the hashrate is reacting to things slower than you think.  It takes time for operations to react.  Judging from the size of this drop in hashrate (a drop for ants), I would say that we also have very different opinions when it comes to capitulation.",

Already today's decline in hash rate could well price the mining cost back below $20K for example, for further hash rate recovery.Somewhat as anticipated hash rate is bouncing back, with the average mining cost has dropped to a new low of $16,780. While today price moves back up to $22K. This hasn't had any immediate affect on hash rate's 30MA or 60MA, but with price maintaining higher levels and such a low average mining cost, the likelihood of hash rate recovering significantly increases at present, despite the bearish looking indicator:Mining difficulty otherwise dropped -1.4% yesterday, providing a helping hand to miners, with the next estimated difficulty in 12 days currently at +5.1% average. 1 month ago hash rate hit an ATH, so factoring in the slight decline from this date, if hash rate can maintain it's current highs, then the 30MA can recover relatively quickly. Likewise the 60MA would otherwise stop declining based on 60 days of data.Hash rate: https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rateMining cost: https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-costDifficulty: https://www.bitrawr.com/difficulty-estimator",

This is now very much having the effect of a \"miner capitulation\" that the indicator signaled:Unlike last months capitulation that was short-lived while hash rate consolidated sideways, this second wave is highlighting the weakness in Bitcoin's hash rate as both the 30MA and 60MA decline:While Bitcoin's price currently hovers around $20K, the average cost of mining has been approximately between $17K and $20K in recent days. While generally the mining difficulty has been slowly declining, it hasn't been enough to provide any relief to Bitcoin's slowing hash rate. As referenced previously, a drop below the local low of $17.6K would likely see a considerable drop in both hash rate and difficulty.",

      "body": "As a quick update, based on news that Bitcoin's cost of production could be nearer $13K*, as opposed to most recent estimate of $23.7K:While miners continue to capitulate at current prices and mining costs, so far we've seen a -5% correction from the capitulation level based on MA crossover. For reference sake and in comparison to other capitulations, in 2020 there were 3 capitulations; twice of -10% and one approximately -6%. Whereas in 2018 it was nearer -25% and in 2021 (China's mining ban) it was -40%. Mining difficulty average is currently estimated at -3.8% in 6 days, continuing the decline since the end of May. While difficult to tell how far hash rate will correct, as will be largely determined be Bitcoin's future price movements (currently at $20.8K), the capitulation could be half complete already based on 2020 corrections, or otherwise only only just beginning if based on 2018 or 2021.*As for JP Morgan's estimate of $13K for mining costs, there appears to be a complete lack of reference or evidence to substantiate such a claim. If this is indeed the case, then the capitulation could be over a lot quicker than expected if Bitcoin's price remains above this level. Overall, it seems very unlikely this is a correct estimate of Bitcoin's mining cost, as otherwise there wouldn't be such a capitulation if it were.",

The buy signal then arrived at $3.5K quite conveniently a few months later.In March 2020 it signalled at $5.8K (after the big drop) with a buy signal at $7.7K. Throughout 2020 the capitulation prices were lower than the buy signal prices.Despite the misleading phrase, the indicator was never intended to be used to predict any price movements to the downside, only to the upside (based on network recovery followed by growth).Quote from: Wind_FURY on August 01, 2022, 08:25:26 AMBut what it miner capitulation?

It simply means hash rate in the mid-term (30 to 60 days) is correcting, or reducing. It ironically doesn't imply an outright capitulation of miners, like hash rate dropping in half such as in 2021. While some miners switching off will mean others will switch on, especially when difficulty is reducing, and some miners are paying much higher for electricity, this doesn't always occur immediately afterwards.For example at the moment difficulty and hash rate have been reducing for around 8-10 weeks now, so there are more miners switching off than on and not enough \"thank you very much\". At least not yet.",
