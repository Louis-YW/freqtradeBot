  "content": "Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are the methods in which the government and financial institutions use to continue their control over it's citizens when the Fiat currency seems to be failing. These digital tokens help for monopoly as these bodies become the center of the system since every transaction that is being conducted is monitored, hence leaving the individual open to being a victim of EO6102 attack. Bitcoin, according to financial operators, is regarded as a potential, existential threat which has come to upset the \"equilibrium\" on which the government lies. BTC receives much whiplash not just because of its volatility and unstability in price, which is made worse by the bear season by the way, but simply because there would be no means to control it since it operates on an open source peer-2-peer network which has no central authority. While CBDCs tend to take away your privacy, Bitcoin protects privacy and finance and helps for accessibility to financial resources. Its aim is not just to make one rich or get more money, rather they present a new approach to freedom in many places where traditional banking holds full court.  https://bitcoinist.com/the-case-against-cbdcs-in-a-capitalist-society/https://www.matter.ngo/bitcoin-freedom/",

      "body": "I don't disagree with OP here! There's no fundamental difference between fiat and CBDC. Both are issued by a central authority but just the operating environment is different. Also with CBDC, citizens will loose their remaining financial anonymity. Cash is still somewhat anonymous but with CBDC that last bit of freedom will be gone forever. So there's no need for cheering about CBDC. My country has just launched CBDC as a pilot. But this is something I really want their failure.",

      "body": "CBDC's were just meant to \"officially\" digitalized currency that hasn't had any new innovations since conception. I use innovation loosely, of course, because CBDC's are to the detriment of the consumer. Most banking is done online anyways so it's not as if the government needs to digitalize the currency in the first place. They already have the central and private banks within grip.I speculate the reason is merely to allow even greater control over money supply than they already have -- essentially being able to generate tokens or deduct them from a person's holdings without having to jump through any hoops.",

Yeah,  these CBDCs have a lot of advantages, one of them being it's ability to help manage the disappearance of public funds and ensuring financial stability and all that. But just like there's no smoke without a fire not too far around, same can be said of these CBDCs since they experience geographical restrictions as they are only accepted in the countries that issued them. Another risk a CBDC poses is the tendency for inflation. Since they can be created at the press of a button, there's the possibility of it been created with no aim for  production, it thereby inflates the money supply without a corresponding increase in production.",

CBDC's are just meant to delay the inevitable which is the mass adoption of bitcoins and cryptocurrency. No matter how polished and upgraded the government may make it look they still are not an alternative to bitcoins. In my country where we currently have the eNaira (CBDC), this is a quote from the Head of our Central bank QuoteThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, says the eNaira has recorded 700,000 transactions valued at N8 billion since its inauguration on Oct. 25, 2021. source I find it hard to believe however knowing that these figures can be falsified, and that they may just hyping it to make it sound enticing to attract people to it and hide the fact that their project did not record as much success as they could have expected. The reason behind my unbelieve is because aside bitcoin investment, I'm also involved in a business offline where I happen to receive a lot of transactions from people regularly, I have not met a customer or anyone that has suggested making payment via the eNaira, but some customers, even the one's you least expect have suggested paying via crypto many times. So who are these invisible people using CBDC's in my country??",
