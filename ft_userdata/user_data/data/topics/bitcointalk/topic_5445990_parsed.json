Their minimum purchase 0.1 Eth and Maximum Purchase 10 Eth Whatever the scam method may be easy for someone to discover, you will find that there are beginners who have already connected their wallets and lost their assets due to their lack of experience in the field and because of their haste and not taking enough time to conduct research, when the scammers learn that there is a project that has already launched an airdrop for the participants on its network, or it may be launched in the future, they create phishing websites for the respective project to mislead the participants so that they connect their wallets to the wrong site and fall into the traps, and of course, you will not find one phishing site only, but thousands of scam and phishing sites, and even the scammers promote their phishing sites with their money until their scam sites appear for the largest category of people, so we should all warn people to keep the crypto community safe.",
