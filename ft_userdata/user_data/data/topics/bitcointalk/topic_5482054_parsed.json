Bitcoin was in decline in 2022, and from early January 2023 the price of Bitcoin was bullish and until December the price of Bitcoin was only bullish. If the investment could have been made according to the price of Bitcoin in January 2023, it would have increased by several times now. So I consider 2023 to be a fundamental investment. I think 2023 is the best time to invest.",

Now, it can be considered as a good addition to a pension, but only in the long term. For Bitcoin to make 5-10x from its current level will take 5-10 years.",
