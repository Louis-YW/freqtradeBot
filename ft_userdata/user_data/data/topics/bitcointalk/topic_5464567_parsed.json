  "content": "The water system in my house got some blocking issues and I needed to call a plumber, the plumber guy I was used to was not available, I called and he said he is far away, so I looked for someone else. After he went through the problem and fixed the pipes for me, out of joke I gave him payment options that are available, if he will like any.I asked him if he will want cash, bank transfer or Bitcoin, to my surprise he answered Bitcoin, I don't take this very seriously because, you know, most people don't care about Bitcoin here, but he brought out his smartphone and told me to scan the QR CODE. I asked if he really his serious and he said yes, I had to pay him in Bitcoin and he said something that caught my attention.He said people don't ask that's why he believed no one is using Bitcoin as payment.He also said collecting cash will make him spend the money faster but he chose Bitcoin because he planned to start buying the following week.While I was trying to question him about how he know about Bitcoin he revealed that he is a student, and that being a plumber is his side hustle, this answered my curiosity about how he knew about Bitcoin. Have you guys been promoting Bitcoin by asking workers if they will receive Bitcoin as payment? How was it? This is actually the first time I will do such, all my mind was focused on, if I didn't see Bitcoin Payment Receive here I wouldn't bother.",

This is actually the first time I will do such, all my mind was focused on, if I didn't see Bitcoin Payment Receive here I wouldn't bother. It is crucial that we start to ask these odd workers or skilled professional. Bitcoin awareness has spread more than we know it and some of these guys just want to experiment with it. Some would even choose to get paid for their services in bitcoin as one of the ways of accumulating bitcoin rather than buying from an exchange. A furniture maker once jokingly requested that I pay for the wooden furniture in bitcoin after he overheard me talk about bitcoin with a friend on the phone. Well, I didn't pay him though. Maybe next time. What we should observe is that bitcoin awareness has travelled far into all walks of life.",

Yes, many times, and I'm surprised that they are open to accepting Bitcoin, workers or providers that I thought were not aware of Bitcoin, Bitcoin is already popular here in our country but you have to ask people if they are willing to accept Bitcoin or keeping Bitcoin, it has something to do with our people being conservative or secretive on their wealth because of misconception.Some people think that you are rich if you have Bitcoin or accept Bitcoin as payment you really never know here in our country who's into investing or holding Bitcoin unless you ask or have a hint that they are.",

Another aspect of this is that the amount involved might not be large enough to request that it be paid in Bitcoin unless it's actually a big job that's more than a simple repair.It's actually nice that you asked and ended up completing a service using the payment option, and I hope you continue working with him in order to help him meet his accumulating target on time.",

The Op expressed his shock about what the plumber said simply because he didn't expect a menial worker to have access to such knowledge. This is a welcome development for BTC and this can help to fast track it's adoption. In my area, I find it difficult to preach or ask people I transact business with because it's not popular and I've assumed they are used to using the traditional fiat or credit cards to pay for services. Also, they might look at me like I've developed two heads  so I just keep it to myself.",

A mindset like this can only be changed if at all you promise them that there is a lot of money to be made from it. But if you tell them the outright truth that there is risk also involve in it they don’t get interested. I also don’t want to push to hard one based on your security reasons too and secondly I don’t want to be accountable for any lose when they lose there funds. I will stick to the aspect of teaching only if you requested. Like the OP did I don’t even ask workers for bitcoin payment option because to me I will only use that method for a cross border transaction because at this point my bitcoin is too valuable to be used to pay for little stuffs like this.",

Because the one who came into your house was a plumber and a student too, he must have had good problem-solving and learning skills, which must have encouraged him to adopt new technology. Not to mention the fact that learning such new technology can become a headache for some.And the plumbers here in my area or in my district are not students because plumbing is not some work that could generate decent income here, so everyone has to do a full-time job; they cannot do this work part-time. And the ones who are full-time plumbers do not want to learn new things; instead, they are just fed up with their lives so much that they do not even want to hear anything aside from their job and personal lives.",

In my country, bitcoin can only be owned as an asset and can only be used for crypto trading, so I can't do bitcoin promotions like you.From my experience introducing bitcoin to my friends, most of them weren't interested, some were interested but unfortunately they thought the price of bitcoin was too expensive so they didn't dare to buy it, even though I said buying bitcoin could be done in small quantities.",

So to answer your question, I tried to promote Bitcoin by just trying to do what my friend did to me back then to my other friends. Cause when pandemic hits, NFT games are hyped back in 2020 so they actually doing exchanges thru Binance where they have seen different coins. Of course since they are engaging in the crypto world I didn't hesitate to introduced Bitcoin to them and explained the benefits, the risk, the volatility and almost all the information that I could think of about Bitcoin. At first they are really interested knowing the fact that I've earned in Bitcoin. In the end, they just simply said \"they have no luck in Bitcoin\" and kept grinding on NFT games where it's coin doesn't reach 1 dollar value today. Any kind of promoting is good but it would really depends on the people if they will acknowledged Bitcoin.",

I'm a retired programmer and about a year ago I was invited by a long-year customer who invested over 2 million in more vacation-houses. We talked about finances in general and then got deeper into assets we are invested in. Really trusting this man I asked him if he is acquainted with Bitcoin and he was very interested even though I talked more about the vision than the possibility to lambo. Soon after we met again and he asked for help as to where and how to buy. Being told of course not to buy for more than he could afford to lose overnight without any pain he bought. And he bought again in November 22, hitting it nice (while I was waiting for the prive to go down a little more...). What I'm trying to say is that we're in the same boat now what threats are concerned and we trust each other. Now I work for him again once in a while and he pays me with Bitcoin. We are both happy.Why not spread the idea of Bitcoin among people you trust without a doubt. I know he woudn't tear down my house trying to find my seed(s) (and he sure would have to).But I agree - never brag, never even talk about it with anyone you don't completely trust.",
