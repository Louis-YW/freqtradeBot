This one shock me no be small. I don't know how Binance take dey make our Naira weak abi na Binance dey manage our economy. This one show say the people wey dey handle some of these agencies no even know the things wey fit affect our currency. I truly dey feel bad for this kind news. We all know say our government no gree create job for the youth, now cryptocurrency na one way youth take dey see food chop, if them ban Binance, imagine how many youths using P2P to see food wey go dey affected. Binance P2P been help wella even when CBN been dey worry people wey use cryptocurrency. Naija people were still able to exchange, do business overseas and this help plenty people make a living. This will be very painful if government come ban Binance for Nigeria because plenty people wey create account for Binance used their BVN or NIN to do KYC verification.  So if government ban Binance, them no go get access to these portals and there are other ways them go mandate Binance not to allow Nigerians use their exchange as e suppose be. My people how una see this matter?For those wey wan read the news in detail, Peoples Gazette carry am.",

If you bend one side look this matter, you go see say na frustration dey worry these people...them no know wetin to do because \"if e didn't dey, e didn't dey\".

I just give a valid reason how exchanges can not put pressure on naira as long as it is CeXP2P. But I noticed that the man is just self-centered because he believed that people are using crypto exchanges like Binance and prefer to convert to bitcoin, and most especially the stable coins in this regard and exchanging them to naira. Quote from: https://gazettengr.com/abcon-bureaux-de-change-tell-fg-to-ban-binance-to-save-naira/Mr Gwadabe pointed out that when pessimism overrode the psychology of the market, it would lead to loss of confidence.“So we are seeing a scenario where optimism is giving way to pessimism. Investors are not coming. Nigerians don’t have confidence in the market and we have to look for external finances that are coming in as a quick fix,” He suggested.So they think if there are no crypto exchanges like Binance, they will have more trading volume and more profit. All I noticed about this is selfishness and looking for ways crypto businesses can be restricted to favour themselves.Quote from: Hyphen(-) on August 09, 2023, 09:49:44 AMThere are other cryptocurrency exchanges that are operating here in Nigeria, then why only Binance?Kucoin and some crypto exchanges are running p2p, maybe they are only focus on binance because as they mentioned in the content that they have high liquidity.I do not know if this is a rhetorical question but let me answer it. Because SEC sees Binance to be illegal in Nigeria and it is most known to Nigerians. Also because many of these people do not know these exchanges as we know them.Quote from: Hyphen(-) on August 09, 2023, 09:49:44 AMI don't think Binance has anything related to this issue of Naira to dollar price drop, they are just trying use them and scare Nigerians to stop or reduce using the exchange which I don't thin will work for them.No issue at all than someone speaking because he wants more gain in his business as I explained about it just now.",

What has binance got to do with Naira devaluation in the first place. Is it binance that controls the economy and government of Nigeria? Or is it binance that formulates policies for our government?You know when they are bereft of ideas and plans on how to move the economy forward, they start dancing around with kangaroo dance steps.  It is unfortunate where the nation finds herself coupled with the leadership pattern of the old cabals that still wants to power at all cost.The issue of banning binance is impossible because binance is not registered here and there is no law binding binance and the Nigerian government together. So their claims and accusations are null and void. Come to talk of it, it is a p2p platform so how can they know the exact transaction that has to do with crypto currency coming from binance when there are a million and one transactions going on every seconds.I think they should concentrate on being a producing nation exporting her local produce rather than being a consuming nation which drastically effects the value of our local currency.",

This exchange has helped many youths in the country to be free from poverty and have a food on their table by transacting with them. P2P have helped many youths in the country that we can imagine, and by putting an end to binance operation in Nigeria is like putting many people back to their days of suffering for a work to do.

M. B (President, Mohammadu Buhari) was on set we saw how our economy was crumbling we thought he is not doing well so, we all learned our lesson hoping for change to come, after which his regime came to pass and we couldn't factor our that if we elects another doom in same seat we could experienced something more strange and difficult in our country and yet some sets of foolish adults and when ahead to organized themselves to manipulate election results in order for their selfish party to be in authority without knowing we need to restructure our country and economy. Now we are facing serious rise in dollars and they planned to ban Binance as how ?Is Binance the cause of dollars increase or what?Okay, why not Ban the Aboki's who are selling in the black market or is it because if they ban Aboki their business has came to end or what if I may know.In fact there are some things we need to vote for before taking final decisions as I believe Binance exchange is not our problems rather the Government is our problems. When a man is so much desperate of power this is what it turns out to be because what I can factor out is incompetent of leadership. And people think he would spent billions of Naira to achieve the seat without him working to cover his expense?No this impossible because I know that is something very important in his life because nobody do like to involved himself or herself to a profit and loss business.",
