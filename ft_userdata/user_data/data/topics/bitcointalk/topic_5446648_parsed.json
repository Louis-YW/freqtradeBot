TyUnfortunately, you were not careful and did not check in detail the reputation of the Bibox exchange, so you became a victim of the umpteenth scam from the Bibox exchange.We are very anti to using the Bibox exchange, because Bibox has carried out its actions from 2019 until now.Experiences of users fooled by Bibox exchange.Quote from: ChiNgadOr on January 06, 2018, 01:13:49 AMi sent  2 hours ago some ETH. checking TX HASH it appears as confirmed! \"SUCCESS\" .. so shouldn't it appear automatically  balance in my ETH acocunt int BIBOX?i think i have been scammed. so be carefull guysAnd this is another series of accusations, caused by the Bibox exchange, against its users.* EXCHANGE SCAM ? TX HASH confirmed, but balance still as 0!* Bibox Technology Ltd. \"Bibox\" crypto-exchange is trying to scam my profit.Conclusion: the OP for the future did a rise first before using a crypto exchange that is outside or operating here, regarding their reputation, to prevent losses.",

We cannot mark an exchange as a scam exchange without knowing the details. I have never used this exchange so I am not aware of their reputation. So you can add the screenshots of what kind of conversation their support team had with you in this thread, so that everything will be easy to understand the current situation.",

Ty I have not heard of this exchange platform name. It is new to me. And not all the exchange platforms you see in the internet that are legit. There are some that are there to scam people funds, and some are paying out but their charges rate is very high that many people can't use them. That is why when you want to use any of them make sure you ask questions to know them more.",

I am sure that they've got a system that sees those withdrawals that are on queue and if yours have been there for nearly 2 weeks, they'll take notice of it.But since they're not taking action on it, you've probably haven't seen the reputation that they've got and doing some quick search on the web will show you that they've got 3 stars and even 1 stars for most of the ratings websites that they're part of.And if a website rates them on 5 stars that's most likely was too old review and likely it was just during their launching. It's always good to check ratings, good and bad to give you the thought on what type of exchange they are. I'm still wishing you that you'll be able to reach out to them and just grant your withdrawal request and if it happens, never deposit again there and leave them.",
