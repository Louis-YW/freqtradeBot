  "content": "The topic has said everything so I want to know the different opinions from forum users. I have done the physical interview with some people and I have seen the different mindsets of people for seen money on the floor or somewhere in their working places.There was a story in my locality this week. A woman who is working in a hotel, found $70,000 in hotel room she working and with her good heart, she returns the money to the customer. Now the question other people asked was if the didn't know the person what she would have done? If you were in the woman's shoe, what would you do? Or if you see such amount as bitcoin in your working place with the seed phrase in aseed plate, what will you do? And probably you know the person and there is no way to locate the person. But if I am the one, I will also do the same as the woman and if I don't know the person and I can't locate the person, I will take to the nearest Radio or Television Stations for Broadcasting, or if any of the above can not be found in the locality then I will handover them to the police. Good Name is Better Than Silver and Gold I love my Name to be good",

So even if you were tempted, you would not be able to access the funds. The only thing worth keeping would be the hardware wallet itself. The right thing to do would be to give it back to the owner, and who knows, they might even give you a little something as a reward!",

Look I get what you are trying to say here, but As I said before, it's illogical Practically, it is adviced to return something that isn't yours or rather just leave it maybe the owner might come looking for it. But let's be realistic and cut the crap. I don't think most people would see  money on the floor and just leave it there or even think about looking for it's owner. That would be their last taught.",

On what world will a hardware wallet owner keep his or her passcode inside a bag with his wallet? If they will be negligent like that then what's the essence of getting a hardware wallet in the first place?

As we always heard this (Be honest, even if others are not, even if others will not, and even if others cannot) that was probably the reason this story why the girl returned that big amount. Just considering the hypothetical situation of being in her shoes or finding a significant amount like BTC with the seed phrase, I would also aim to act with honesty and integrity. If I know the rightful owner and there's no way to locate them, I would make every effort to return the money or assets to them, even resorting to using media channels like Radio or TV if necessary. If all else fails, handing it over to the police would be the right thing to do, ensuring that the rightful owner has the best chance of reclaiming their property. Because for me, honesty and doing what is right should guide our actions in such situations.",

There are still plenty of good people in the world today. Not to brag but I was an active user of a crypto project (in DeFi) where a small set of users including me were able to withdraw more than we deposited. This was unintended and a week later, the team reached out and got it returned to them as soon as I could. I ended up getting a bounty from the  exploited amount and although it was no where near the full exploit amount but the satisfaction I got from it, was worth it and I enjoyed the experience.I have read about plenty of situations like this and some times (not all times), the lost item/amount is returned.",

Most people will of course say that they would return the wallet to the owner (if they know who it is) and no one will admit that they would keep the money for themselves. But we all know that's not true. If you have ever been in a situation or know someone who has lost a wallet with personal documents and money, you know that only in very rare situations does an honest finder contact the owner. True, there are still honest people in the world, but my experience is that people are mostly selfish and greedy.I honestly don't know what I would do because I simply cannot imagine myself in such a situation. That whole imaginary scenario sounds too unreal to me. No normal person would actually carry a hardware wallet along with its recovery seed, so it's pointless to even talk about this kind of situation.",

Such stories are not too rare in life and I believe you already read such stories some times in your life. So this Bitcoin story and your question is not necessary. The answer is obvious, if she is a good person, she will find ways to return Bitcoin to the victim but if she is morally bad, she will steal it and keep silent even if the victim asks her about that.",
