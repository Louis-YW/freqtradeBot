  "content": "Hi im new to the mining community and ive recently bought 2 Whatsminer M21S's. They were both tested before being shipped (Well known company) but when ive set them up they run for 10-15 minutes then restart. Theyll do a cooldown after restarting before mining again and then do the exact same thing again. They both have the exact same fault, ive swapped control boards about along with hashboards and at one point i had it running for 25 minutes all going well but now theyre stuck in the same look again without me changing anything. ive tried rumerous different things but cant figure it out. Can anyone help?This is the log at the point of restart 11-29 04:01:42.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot2 test fifo, ok cores:  91.6%, fifo percent:  93.8%,  93.4%11-29 04:01:42.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot0 test fifo, ok cores:  88.5%, fifo percent:  90.5%,  90.3%11-29 04:01:45.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot0 Change freq 812->811M, 801M, board temp:  62.5, hottest:   0.0, vol: 368, ok cores:  98.6%, failed: 011-29 04:01:46.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot2 Change freq 831->829M, 818M, board temp:  66.5, hottest:   0.0, vol: 368, ok cores:  98.5%, failed: 011-29 04:01:46.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot0 test fifo, ok cores:  88.8%, fifo percent:  91.2%,  90.6%11-29 04:01:47.00 N cgminer[2604]: Accepted 0105b2aa Diff 64.1K/35267 SM 1 (temp 62.5 69.0 66.5 fan 4320 3780)11-29 04:01:47.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot2 test fifo, ok cores:  92.3%, fifo percent:  93.5%,  94.1%11-29 04:01:49.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot0 Change freq 811->811M, 801M, board temp:  62.5, hottest:   0.0, vol: 368, ok cores:  98.6%, failed: 011-29 04:01:50.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot0 test fifo, ok cores:  88.8%, fifo percent:  91.2%,  90.6%11-29 04:01:51.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot2 Change freq 829->828M, 820M, board temp:  66.5, hottest:   0.0, vol: 368, ok cores:  98.9%, failed: 011-29 04:01:52.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot2 test fifo, ok cores:  91.8%, fifo percent:  92.9%,  93.7%11-29 04:01:52.00 N cgminer[2604]: Accepted 0159b0bf Diff 48.5K/35267 SM 2 (temp 62.5 69.0 66.5 fan 4320 3780)11-29 04:01:55.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot2 Change freq 828->827M, 819M, board temp:  66.5, hottest:   0.0, vol: 368, ok cores:  98.9%, failed: 011-29 04:01:56.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot2 test fifo, ok cores:  92.2%, fifo percent:  93.3%,  94.1%11-29 04:01:56.00 N cgminer[2604]: Upfreq freq: 839.5/841, power: 3362/(3350~3500), boards: 3/3, vol: 1272/(1272~1370), expect: 51.74T,64.98/(0.0~0.0W)11-29 04:01:56.00 N cgminer[2604]: bt1920_get_fifo_percent: Slot0, percent:  91.2%11-29 04:01:56.00 N cgminer[2604]: bt1920_get_fifo_percent: Slot1, percent:  99.8%11-29 04:01:56.00 N cgminer[2604]: bt1920_get_fifo_percent: Slot2, percent:  94.1%11-29 04:01:56.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot2: upfreq wait board stable 411-29 04:01:59.00 N cgminer[2604]: bt1920_get_fifo_percent: Slot0, percent:  91.2%11-29 04:01:59.00 N cgminer[2604]: bt1920_get_fifo_percent: Slot1, percent:  99.8%11-29 04:01:59.00 N cgminer[2604]: bt1920_get_fifo_percent: Slot2, percent:  94.1%11-29 04:01:59.00 E cgminer[2604]: Restart as hashrate error, fifo_percent: 95.0%, cur vol:1272(expect vol:1282, add:2.5%)->final vol:1272->128211-29 04:01:59.00 E cgminer[2604]: Attempting to restart cgminer git-078e62711-29 04:01:59.00 N cgminer[2604]: Set fan auto speed mode enabled11-29 04:01:59.00 E cgminer[2604]: system_power_off11-29 04:01:59.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot0: set reset pin 99 to 011-29 04:01:59.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot1: set reset pin 100 to 011-29 04:01:59.00 N cgminer[2604]: Slot2: set reset pin 101 to 011-29 04:01:59.00 N cgminer[2604]: Turn off power11-29 04:01:59.00 W cgminer[2604]: Summary of runtime statistics:11-29 04:01:59.00 W cgminer[2604]: Started at [1970-01-01 08:00:45.182]11-29 04:01:59.00 W cgminer[2604]: Pool: stratum+tcp://stratum.braiins.com:333311-29 04:01:59.00 W cgminer[2604]: Runtime: 0 hrs : 0 mins : 0 secs11-29 04:01:59.00 W cgminer[2604]: Average hashrate: 35607090.0 Mhash/s",

Running out of ideas tbhIf my suggestion does not work would you mind to try to replug all fan cables and power supply since it just recently arrived there's a possibility that there may be a loose connection between the power supply and the controller or there might be a loose screw on copper row, 6 screws should be tightened and copper bar should be aligned properly to avoid some issues.Check the manual beliw on how to dismantle this unit and replug the PSU.- https://www.zeusbtc.com/manuals/user-manuals/WhatsMiner-M21S-Manual.pdf",

Well if you did all the basic things and it still doesn't work they sent you a defective unit or possibly the delivery guy didn't handle it with care during delivery.Would you mind telling us what company you bought this unit?If it is still under warranty then better send it back to where you bought this unit for replacement or repair warranty.",

You were supposed to post the logs you got from Whatsminer tool, but you have not, anyway, here are two things to do1- Check the input voltage to your miner, lower voltage would cause the miner reboot loop2- Unmount two of the hashboards and leave only one, try a random order, keep the right board, and if it fails, keep the middle or left.report your results here and I will help you further.",

I heard someone before with the same issue but on Whatsminer m20s but he solved the issue by changing the pools. You are still using Braiins pool according to the logs and I don't know what pool you tested before would you mind to try again changing the pool but this time use https://solo.ckpool.org/Please use this while you are troubleshooting. Would you mind changing the performance mode to saving mode if it still does not? Use whatsminer tool to change it from normal mode into saving mode you can find it under the control button. Let's see if it would run normally let it run first for 30 minutes and then update here.",

      "body": "Not sure if you stated this piece of info but I couldn't find it, many people miss doing one of the basic tests which is running the miner with only 1 hashboard using two different hashbaords one at a time, in many cases the issue is just within a single board which causes the whole miner to act crazy, obviously, since you may be so unlucky and test the bad board only, you are required to test at least two out of the three hashboards you have, this basic troubleshooting process will reveal a lot of information.",

      "body": "Hi Mikey, yeah I’ve already tried that. No matter which boards I use the miner will only run with 2 boards in. Any 2 of the 7 boards I have it will run normally. But as soon as I add a 3rd board it does the reboot cycle. Ive spoke to Oliver at whatsminer and he’s told me the miner has been tampered with, the label on the case isn’t original. Not sure exactly what’s been tampered with but I’ve tried 3 different control boards, numerous variations of hashboards out of the 7 and I’ve just got a new PSU that I need to try. I’ve also contacted coinminingcentral again after finding out the label isn’t original, their reply was that it’s a USED unit and that it was all tested before shipping to me. I mean I understand there’s no guarantee with a used unit but one with unoriginal parts?? Would never buy a used unit off them again. Their support was ok trying to help me, trying different test to figure it out but they’ve since cut me off basically, they’re no longer replying to me.",
