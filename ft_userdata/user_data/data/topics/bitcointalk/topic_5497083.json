Bitcoin is on people's lips on the street, TV, internet especially now that the halving is over.Your friend is a trader that trades on goods not cryptocurrency or assets so he is supposed to be familiar with bitcoin but if due to ignorant, he should listen to you and invest some of his profit in bitcoin so that he can be sure that he has an investment that is an hedge to inflation instead or debating. Didn't you tell him that he can continue with his trading and only invest little profit from his trading in bitcoin. Maybe that would have made him understand better than bragging about what you guys are into.",

The reason for this is that we may have the conception that a lot of people know what bitcoin is- like bitcoin being the digital goal however, they may not really have the core understanding of the merits of Bitcoin. And I personally believe that if people can understand bitcoin more, they will get to appreciate it better than they do. Whenever I talk about Bitcoin with non-bitcoiner, one of the things I never fail to emphasize is that anyone with access to the internet can start investing in Bitcoin no matter how small their capital. This in itself is what gives Bitcoin a huge advantage over physical and other types of investment or trading.",

Some of them have been doing this and the master this craft for years to come and they made gain, however government interference will always come into play because they wouldn't want a situation whereby traders will not be checkmated on the activities.Bitcoin is a different environment from those kind of traders, bitcoin is decentralized, it doesn't have government control, unlike your conventional trader that sells goods on a day-to-day routine and get their gain almost immediately, bitcoin requires long-time plan and a whole lot of knowledge for you to start making profit. Between the two distinctive competitors, I think they have their own advantage and disadvantage, you just need to choose the one that best suits you.",
