He was simply have a relaxing drink during some pleasant conversation with some friendly buddies. A couple of small, timid girls, who he had never bothered, snuck up on him and shot him to death... because they were mean, and simply didn't like his looks or smell. The fleet-footed girls got away because his buddies were too drunk to stop them.There really isn't any peace in this world. Somebody always has a weapon to use against someone else who is napping regarding his own self-defense. Peace in society requires everybody - at least the majority - to be peaceful and respectful in his heart, towards everyone else... or it won't work very well. We see this in the violence done by the Soros-paid-off Antifa and BLM against unsuspecting people of the general public.We see it in the US-provoked, tiny, timid Ukraine sneaking up on Russia since at least 2014... until Russia couldn't take it any more, and had to fight back to protect herself and her people.",

If gun freedom in the US were gone, government would run right over us all, and convert the whole world into outright slavery.More gun freedom is what keeps us free. In addition, you can find all kinds of times when a good gunner shoots a bad shooter who is on a killing spree, because he illegally obtained a gun.Is this the answer?Make robots that can do everything for us that we need done.Then put all the people of the world into strait jackets.The robots can feed us, bathe us, wipe our butts, and do everything we need for us.But we can't hurt anybody or anything... total green earth without our interference.EDIT: Btw, does the guy who controls the robots have special guns to shoot rogue robots?",

Of course, they're only against such use of force if it's being used against their own. If it's the government using \"self defense\" against right wing protestors, they support it. If it's a private citizen defending himself from deranged rioters, they'll call for life imprisonment.There is no logic behind it so no one can rationalize it.",

Gun access should be free, but only when you've passed some tests, weren't jailed for a serious crime, underwent a course that taught you basic gun safety. When you take your gun out in public you should be aware that someone else may carry and you can get killed. Allowing people to carry changes things because there won't be situations like that in Norway where guns aren't allowed and Breivik kept shooting people for hours because he was the only one with a gun and nobody could fight him. People were hiding, waiting to be slaughtered. This is a good example that banning guns won't stop criminals from obtaining them. Quote I believe you will not need self-defence if guns are not allowed to carry by anyone except by the police and other military units. What's the response time of the police in your area? I live about 3km from the nearest town and it takes a minimum of 5 minutes before the police can arrive at my house. Usually it's 10 (checked). Imagine sitting there for 10 minutes, waiting for the police, while the robbers steal your shit. They could literally rape your wife and kill you both before the police arrives. I'd rather have a gun.",

I hear news from America where little children as little as six shoot their parents or classmates because they have access to guns. The US has the highest rate of mass shootings carried out by sometimes innocent teenagers just because they have access to firearms. In my country, we don't have such experiences because gun ownership is strictly regulated.But there is a need for arms in self-defense. The world is going mad and sometimes we need these guns to protect ourselves from criminals. In my area kidnapping would reduce if people are allowed to carry arms.But it might be good to increase the age of legal gun ownership and some sophisticated hand gone or riffles should be restricted.",

To this I think some people will consider the measure of defense against the strength of attack. Like if it is assault done on someone with mere plastic chair and the defender goes on to use lethal or gun to retaliate, this is not to be considered as self defense. Moreover if the attacker dies from the lethal weapon of the defender, it becomes a crime. I think this is the rationale behind the illegality of self defense. It should be measure for measure and not taking the opportunity to cause bodily harm while the attacker's effect wouldn't inflict such injury.",

Guns in the hands of the people. If ALL the people had carried guns, the IRA would have won, and the Taliban wouldn't have.Gun freedom in one major country of the world is something that sets the whole world in a certain mindset. Whatever country you are from, there will be a lot of people who understand the idea of gun self-protection. And it is this freedom ideal that government leaders realize exists among their people, and so they act with restraint. That is the second major reason why countries with no gun freedom have real freedom. The major reason, of course, is that government people can't get rich off their people if the people are always living in fear. Fearful people don't work with enthusiasm. So, government plays the game of making them think they are free, while enslaving them as much as they can for the wealth they will produce that can be taxed.Gun freedom in one major country produces the world mindset of freedom. It's why the US is the major country in the world, and Britain is second. Not that Britain has gun freedom now. But that when they did, they became powerful, even though their strength is wearing off.America's gun problem doesn't come from people having guns. It comes from cowardly Americans not exercising their gun rights. Think of it the other way. If everybody were required to carry at least a .38 in public (except the kids, of course), all the people would respect each other, because nobody wants a gun battle. Everybody would know that if he started a gun battle - or a shooting spree - he would be dead. Gun problems would evaporate because problem makers would be dead. People would be awake.",

If everybody had guns in the public, how long would a mass shooter last? Not long. And there wouldn't be many mass shooters, because to be a successful mass shooter, one needs to find a place where he will last long enough to do his mass shooting. Most will chicken out before attempting the job... if they know that they will be shot down almost immediately. Whatever principle in their life dictates to them that they have to go on a killing spree, would also show them that they wouldn't be successful. But they want success, in this thing if nothing else.So, what would they do? Some of them would still try, if they had a personal death wish along with it. Others would just commit suicide. And it's a shame that there are people who have mental problems like that. But they would be gone, and society would be better without them.Without guns, there wouldn't be freedom. Why? Because government still has guns. And government would figure out ways and reasons to take freedom away from the people. How do we know? Look what the Taliban has done to their country. And in the US, look at the many laws the politicians make, designed to take away gun freedom, even though foundational US law is that we can have guns (2nd Amendment). They want to enslave us.In the US, look at how far it has gone already with government. People think that their President is a dictator - almost a king. If he says they should get a Covid vaxx that will destroy their lives, they do it just to obey him... rather than checking the data to see if it is correct. It's a good thing that a bunch of people recognize the benefits of keeping guns.",

Most of gun-control is some form of infringement on the 2nd Amendment gun rights which demands no infringement in its wording - Quote from: https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendmentAmendment IIA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.Free state of Florida moves to ban tracking of firearms, ammo purchases because it’s no one’s businesshttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-01-13-florida-moves-to-ban-tracking-of-firearms-ammo.htmlOfficials in the “free state” of Florida are moving to bar the tracking of gun and ammunition purchases because they say such information isn’t relevant to anything except to provide it to the government at some point, which is unnecessary and none of Uncle Sam’s business.The move would block state financial institutions from implementing firearms and ammunition sales tracking codes, with officials arguing that doing so amounts to an unconstitutional infringement on the Second Amendment.The three state officials, all of who are, unsurprisingly, Republicans, touted the “Florida Arms and Ammo Act,” a first-in-the-country policy proposal to ban the tracking of sales of guns and ammo through merchant category codes.The proposal was introduced by Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson, along with state Sen. Danny Burgess and state Rep. John Snyder, who argued that the codes would create something of a gun and ammunition registry for Florida residents, The Epoch Times reported this week.“We are all blessed to live in the free state of Florida where our Second Amendment rights are valued and protected, but Democrats in Washington continue to try to chip away at these rights—and we must stay vigilant,”  Simpson, a former state Senate president who was sworn in recently as the state’s agriculture commissioner, noted in a statement.The outlet reported further:Gun-control advocates and Democrat lawmakers pushed for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to recently adopt new merchant category codes that can be used to identify retail sales of firearms and ammunition when made by credit card.A coalition of national gun-control groups, including Guns Down America, Giffords, Brady, and New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, issued a joint statement applauding the new tracking codes when the ISO approved their creation in September 2022....",
