  "content": "My holding company (USA incorporation 8+ years) has a division OEM that assembles & design HPC (High Performance Computing) I am interested in establishing a dialogue and get some deposit allocation of a small batch of 500-1000 HPM (High-Performance Mining) units a year. While the amount of miners might seem like little that will be roughly 75-250m+ in possible miner/crypto node inventory available to the community.    Our HPM (High Performance Miners) will require our cooling pods technology (extra cost average 15k-85k a unit), will require our gallium (80plus titanium) modular PSU (extra cost average 15-85k), and until the company's design patent is finalized miners will remain in company's data center in USA, Miami, FL. In terms of electricity cost it is irrelevant with our model due to increase density and efficiency but Florida has competitive rates to Texas.   Possible alternative solution will be to convert customer existing Air-Cooled ASIC models, into our company proprietary cooling infastructure (Send me a PM for this) having said that timeframe will still be around same 18-24 month delivery due to some backlogs with our HPC nodes.    Our HPM models are a little different from market incumbents, we do our models base on server racks sizing to increase density & ROI, increase efficiency (our HPC models with h20 have PUE of 1.08-1.25 and our engineered liquid has PUE of 1.01-1.07), reduce overhead cost (reduce BTU/cooling cost), average miner will be around ~150-250k+ per unit cost, the compute capacity should be roughly x5-10+ (500%-1000%) denser of market incumbents (Bitmain, Whatsminer, Cheetah, Goldshell), miners will be overclocked, the miner could be used as crypto nodes (validate chains, create API, host daps) as they have hard drive/ram/processor, delivery time-frame ~18-24+ months delivery window, the models assemble & manufacture in the USA, miners could be multi-crypto in a box (meaning OEM will create multiple VM/ virtualize and pass-through GPU/ASIC for the mining of different crypto), miners will be low dB, miners will be from low weight elements (acrylic, carbon composites), the ROI on the HPM units will vary depending on strategy (shitcoins could yield quicker ROI) but expect 13-22+ months to get ROI on the units, and company will provide 3-7 (36-84 months) year warranty terms.   Company can also assemble GPU focus miners as we do something similar in our HPC_AI models. Thank you for the time reading my PSA & if interested please contact me via PM to get a dialogue started. -J",
