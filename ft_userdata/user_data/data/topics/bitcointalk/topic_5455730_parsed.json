Apparently they have a mixture of super-old soviet era captured stuff and more or less recent light armour from US.This is what I've actually thought of upon seeing this news. I've watched the rush and hurry of people and the military leaving Afghanistan when the Taliban has taken over the country. While theories may come again and if they think that the US is the one funding the Taliban for the arms so what's the sense of making themselves leave the country because of the claimed terrorist group and then they'll support it eventually?It doesn't make sense but I am no good on this one and just basing on what I've seen and read.",

Apparently they have a mixture of super-old soviet era captured stuff and more or less recent light armour from US.Before the US-led force withdrew from Afghanistan it trained and equipped the Afghan armed forces. Most of their armories were US made. When the Taliban overthrew the US-backed government most of these weapons entered into the hands of the Taliban. According to Â aljazeera the Taliban forces took control of more than 300,000 light arms, 26,000 heavy weapons, and about 61,000 military vehicles during the takeover of the country. So it is possible that U.S. armored Humvees and Navistar 7000 transport trucks we saw in the video are part of the spoils of war from the withdrawal of the US-led forces and the fall of the Afghan government. I can't certainly state that the withdrawal of the US-led forces is a calculated attempt to hand over weapons to the Taliban to fight Iran because I don't have evidence to back up my claims.",

We are in gun-free world and most of the guns and weapons are unlicensed so there will on be speculation about their origin or owners this is the situation we found ourselves and we have to cope with that, the Taliban have not put up any formidable factory to manufacture their own weapons, although there may be some locally made weapons being used by the Taliban, most of the sophisticated weapons may be the leftover of US since there we're under US control for a long period until the Taliban took over the government.",

It is true that there were no confrontations between them for any reason, but this does not explain that it will never happen.Despite the direct hostility between the United States and Iran and America's desire to isolate Iran and clamp down on it, it is unlikely that it will support the Taliban in a possible military confrontation. The Taliban uses American weapons in the confrontation with Iran after seizing power in Afghanistan, with which America supported the Afghan army, in addition to various other military aid.",

It's funny that there was no news about those 19 encounters that were bloody but when it comes to Iran the propaganda machines become super active",

You're right, there's a law against the illegal possession of arms but i don't think this is effective in most cases where applicable, when i looked into the scenario of the way how the Taliban took over the government in Afghanistan, you will discover that it was something even the US never plan or see coming because they engaged with a full force attack to take over, there could be many of the US machineries and war equipments that would be left within the territory before their departure at the embassy, moving heavy equipment like the amour tank is not an easy task and may take some extra effort and time, this could be one of the reasons why they were seen using the US war guns at the cause among other reasons unclear to us.",

The CIA has quite much experience on this kind of long distance operations to get rid of regimes which they do not like or do not comply with the interest of the United States. However, if this is indeed some sort of plan thought ahead by the Biden administration, it would imply they had knowledge of religious/political disagreements between Iran and the Taliban. Otherwise, they would be risking those weapons to be used against them and their allies in the region. I have also read the Taliban is against ISIS, so it could also have something to do with it.",
