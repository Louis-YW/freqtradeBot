  "content": "While countries are busy seeking solutions to the seemingly unending inflation in their region, as well as looking for ways to place some level of regulation on the use or acceptance of cryptocurrency,  it is glad to know that the Philippines have gone ahead to realize a dream of providing crypto and its trading services to customers with its Unionbank institution. While this is a sure step in the right direction with more adoption of the cryptocurrency in commerce, other countries will aim to learn from them and enact same as this is the future of doing business around the world. This is also aimed at solving the issues of inflation. Henry Aguda, the chief technology and operations officer and chief transformation officer at Unionbank, remarked. “We are proud to continue UnionBank’s series of industry firsts, this time being the first regulated bank in the country allowing digital currency exchange feature for clients.”What do you think of this new approach of the Phillipina government to providing cryptocurrency  services? https://news.bitcoin.com/philippines-financial-institution-unionbank-now-provides-crypto-custody-and-trading-services/?utm_source=OneSignalPush&utm_medium=notification&utm_campaign=PushNotifications",

      "body": "It seems inevitable that some banks will get involved in trading and providing storage for cryptocurrencies, but not because they have any sympathy for Bitcoin, but because they want to take their share of the pie. This particular bank has been dealing with such things for years, and I read in the article that they already have their own stablecoin.As for trading, I don't see anything wrong if they enable it in bank branches or online with some reasonable fees, but as for the custody service, they should warn their clients what it exactly means and explain what will happen in the event that crypto assets get hacked from their bank. I can't say what the rules are about the insurance of savings deposits in the Philippines, but regardless and if they exist, I would advise everyone not to store Bitcoin in banks or centralized crypto exchanges.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on November 03, 2022, 10:20:06 AMThis is also aimed at solving the issues of inflation. I don't see how anyone thinks that a crypto-friendly bank will help in the fight against inflation? Investing in Bitcoin or any altcoin (especially in the short term) does not provide any insurance against inflation, and as long as we have this kind of financial system, inflation will be a part of our everyday life.",

This is indeed a welcome development to the entire crypto currency community and great win for the crypto currency community in Philippine, it is the desire of every crypto currency lover to be able to exchanged their local fiat currency easily to fiat, and it is rather unfortunate for several countries that continue to see crypto as a threat to their national currency, which is absolutely wrong, to me, this is one of ways to generate more revenue for the development of the country since the bank will be taking a charge, but i really the fee is minimal enough so as not to put holes on peoples pocket thereby turn off citizens from using the service.kudos to Philippine's government for this wonderful move.QuoteThis is also aimed at solving the issues of inflation. I agree with Lucius, there is no way this is helping to fight inflation, but rather, if the government will generalized the acceptance of crypto to every bank in the country by allowing citizens to easily exchange their fiat to crypto and vise versa easily, i think its a good and added source of revenue for the country.",

That is a very good approach from the government for all Phillipina citizens, because with it every Phillipina who already knows and uses cryptocurrency will get more convenience with the presence of special services for cryptocurrencies through Unionbank which is there (Philippines). And I consider this to be very good news because it can trigger examples from other countries or banks in other countries in terms of cryptocurrency services if there are more conveniences that are obtained by Phillipina.",

Just a little correction mate, it should be the Philippines or the Philippine government. Because Phillipina(Filipina) refers to a Filipino woman. A little background of that bank, Unionbank. They're also offering courses that are for free and that include blockchain/crypto-related courses through (https://ubpxcellerator.apptitude.xyz/). They own that program. I also have an account with this bank but when I checked it on their app with my account and it seems I'm not part of those selected retail users to test it out.",

Definitely the government must have a share of the pie.  This is the reason why the government is regulating cryptocurrency.  Aside from taxes, the government and other financial companies can take advantage of the market, reason why banks and other financial institutions are adopting cryptocurrency and opening a marketplace for selling, this time as a trading platform.Union Bank is expected to be the first one to take advantage of cryptocurrency.  while other bank doesn't show interest in adopting cryptocurrency, Union Bank had been expressive of their support of Cryptocurrency specifically Bitcoin and now, ETH.  So it is not a surprise to read news about Unionbank engaging in Bitcoin and ETH trading Platform.  I believe they will add more cryptocurrency as the time pass by.",

Based on what Philippina government has done to their citizens by providing cryptocurrency services to their citizens, show that many business men and women will start allowing Bitcoin payment in their different businesses so that other countries that still doubt cryptocurrency will see how important cryptocurrency is to government. This step will surely bring a good results to the Philippine government because it will really contribute to their economy and other things in the country.",

Officially!Indeed Union bank had been the first bank in the Philippines to be crypto-friendly.  They wanted to be the first one and lead the financial institution in the Philippines when it comes to crypto adoption.  As a result, aside from their very own cryptocurrency, they have now a crypto exchange platform.Obviously, the bank doesn't care about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency but they are interested in Blockchain technology.  Aside from that, being the first mover among the banks they think they will attract more crypto enthusiast clients and take advantage of the growing market of cryptocurrency.  At the end of the day, it is still all about possible profit.",

I can say that my country are very open when it comes to cryptocurrency, kudos to those companies who are showing their interest to adopt as well. I see Binance doing their effort as well to introduce cryptocurrency legally in my country, we are indeed growing. One of the advantage of this heroic move by Unionbank of Philippine is that citizens can comfortably exchange Bitcoin to the Philippine peso without restrictions. This would no doubt attract more citizens to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Another plus to this service is that it would create more awareness about Bitcoin, which is a welcomed development in the Bitcoin space.But the use of Metaco’s platform Harmonize (a third party exchange) for this transaction means that customers funds would be controlled by individuals.

In the united states banks carry FDIC insurance which in theory provides protection up to more than $50,000 in losses. Protection against bank runs and withdrawal limits are also a plus in times of economic uncertainty. Not all banks are created equal in these areas. High risk investment banks can often carry smaller margins for error. While low risk banks can retain greater stability and reliability in times of recession and inflation.Foreign nations like the philippines can have banks which lack basic insurance protection on accounts.
