Why wouldn't the SEC want to give FTX, one of the then-largest Crypto exchanges available to the worldwide public, a second chance? It is a known fact they have FTX & Co. by the balls. This post could be absolute shit, and I am willing to admit that. However, if FTX does indeed receive its revival, what stipulations will this come by? FTX gets revived/rebranded, and newbies flock under the tight leash of the Govt? Govt now has a hand in a major exchange? Please feel free to provide your thoughts. I intend to educate and be educated and participate in a safe Crypto renaissance.",

This is actually going to be interesting to watch and many people can be waiting any good announcement from SEC on this matter.",

It may answer your question. Would you trust your money to exchange that once went bankrupt and lost a lot of money of traders like you? Gensler doesn't seem to be a stupid man, and I guess you could say he's cunning. But I don't understand what kind of reboot they're talking about? The reputation of the exchange is well known. I don't think anyone will trust FTX again.",

I intend to educate and be educated and participate in a safe Crypto renaissance. I feel like a trustee managed one could be decent, wouldn't sound all that bad. Why? Because well in the end this company owned a lot of companies and even though they failed and bankrupted, if they could be allowed to continue, by people who are actually trying to profit and not steal, then they would be able to grow this bigger. Think about it, all these big corporations getting together, hundreds of workers all together, building something that could benefit the investor should result with something good. Doesn't mean that it will, it just means that it should, and that's an important thing.I understand that life is not always all that simple, and sometimes it may result with something that is a little bit different, but we could potentially see this happening and we should be careful about it. I personally believe that there is a potential here, and even if they fail, then it is already failed anyway so what harm could this failure do to it that it hasn't faced already.",

      "body": "I just don't trust this exchange anymore as I have responded to a similar post on other section about FTT, it's a trap and why would we give second chance to an exchange which has already ruined life of many and on what basis? I see lot of people investing into it especially in last three days in moment of heat but what about long term when the coins once again becomes zero either drastically or gradually. Crypto market is all about reputation and we have hundreds of projects and exchanges to choose from so there is no point of sticking to this exchange as it wouldn't take long for them to chest on us again. Rather, we should boycott such exchanges and even if they revive back with full guarantee there is no way they could compensate those who have already lost because either the ones who have invested in their token has sold it for lesser price and even if they are hodling it still they would be recovering 20x less than what they would have purchased it. Even exchanges like Binance should delist this coin.",

And with the recent price increase, any news released can easily make many people have the feeling of returning to it, but honestly, forget it because this space has many other options to choose from. It's been a long time since their own collapse, I don't care about the price increases it created, the pump/dump game stimulates those who like to take risks. And of course, those who have their own views and positions will easily forget mistakes when making profits, but those who lose money will continue to make mistakes.",
