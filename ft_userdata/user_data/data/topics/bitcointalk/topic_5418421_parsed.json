I can reproduce it in testnet, Electrum v4.3.2.But IIRC, it's always been the case in the older versions (at least from what I can recall in my previous test)For others who want to try reproducing the issue:If the other cosigner(s) is open while a cosigner sent a transaction to the cosigner pool server, it wont get prompted for a new partially signed transaction until the wallet get closed and reopened.-edit-I've tried to open the second cosigner in v3.3.8 and it worked without reopening the wallet.But AFAIK, it's always been the case somewhere in v4.x.x, I'll try another older version.-edit2-Same behavior in v4.2.0 & v4.0.6, cosigners have to be reopened to retrieve the partially signed transaction.But works in v4.0.1.Unfortunately, I can't find a relevant commit in cosigner_pool plugin history (link) and there's no similar open issue in GitHub,perhaps you might want to open one, the Devs might be able to fix/find-out the issue: github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues?",

Quote(at least from what I can recall in my previous test)as far as i remember on my test mainnet 2019 at this time it wasnt the case, the pool popup had rised up immediately.further observations (mainnet): sometimes its not possible to send the tx to from the 1/2 wallet to the cosigner pool ( there is no button availiable for it), then i closed the 1/2 wallet the popup from the cosigner pool appears on the 2/2 wallet without any interaction.  it seems that sometimes the pool popup appears also when u close the wallet and not reopen it, weird.  Quoteperhaps you might want to open one, the Devs might be able to fix/find-out the issuei'll think about itbest regards",
