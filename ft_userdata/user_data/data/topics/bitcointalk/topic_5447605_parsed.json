  "content": "Hi everyone, I had recently heard of a coin called telos and decided to invest in it. It seems to be an awesome project, it’s considered the fastest EVM (ethereum virtual main net) coin and seems to have an incredible community and strong room for growth (currently has a marketcap under 60 million with solid trade volume). They also have great staking rewards. I highly recommend you do your research on it and comment your thoughts!",

      "body": "First of all, EVM stands for (Ethereum Virtual Machine ) - https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/and every chain will consider fastest than others  But still, telos is great although Im never uses only hearing it and scalping the 24H volume right now at ~ 2 Million and according to Coingecko the rank is around 500 so I would say this coin has the potential. Like other EVM it needs a push lot of DeFi .",

You are not a new case this space is driven by the hype of the very projects you introduce, I find it worthy of attention but not a great choice when it comes to concepts. that you prompt EVM.And I advise you, if you only see it from people you think are good at this field, be wary, judge for yourself to see what extent and potential that project can do in the market and the competition its with similar projects in that field.",

They also have great staking rewards. I highly recommend you do your research on it and comment your thoughts! Looks like paid shilling. First of all no self-respecting investor would write something like \"and decided to invest in it\" based on:1- incredible community (that cost 5$ per 1000 members on telegram)2- strong room for growth (with 60 million marketcap!). 60 million for a project that no one use? With literally 0 user-base? \"strong room for growth\" is based on what?3- great staking - \"great\" is a professional term straight from the nomenclature of a professional investor\"Benjamin Graham, along with David Dodd, attempted a precise definition of investing and speculation in their seminal work Security Analysis (1934). “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return.\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/02/27/what-is-the-difference-between-investing-and-speculation-2/\"promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return.\" not \"great staking\"",

The token has lost more than 80% of its value from ATH, which means there will be a lot of bagholder looking to dump on the market. Good luck, this is not for me",

I see there’s a good hype for this project, and its community is huge as well, DeFi projects are still catching up, with this its is advisable to do your research before staking or investing but personally if there’s no big updates I’m out, especially with this token even if its cheapest now.",
