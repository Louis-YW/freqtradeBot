Base stake rewards are exclusively dedicated to the node operators.The base stake may suffer penalties, if the node is off, or malfunctioning.

This includes the 1,976 ETNY base stake and the minimum extended stake of 3,024 ETNY.Extended StakeThe extended stake is the process of allocating your ETNY tokens to operator nodes via our Staking dApp. Token delegation may be performed either on the stakerâ€™s own nodes or to other node operators, within our ecosystem.The extended stake provider and the node operator will enter into an agreement and share staking rewards. The operator reward split will be set by the extended stake provider. Keep in mind that the reward split has to be attractive to the node operators, to ensure that your extended stake allocation is accepted.The maximum amount of ETNY that can be staked on each node is 75,000 ETNY, this includes both base and extended stake.Please note that staking rewards may be received only if the node is fully functional.

      "body": "Briefly about how things are going in Ethernity Cloud now. In the process of all actions in creating our cloud, the team adhered to the roadmap and at the end of this year came with a new token (under the ticker ECLD) to the exchange. The listing was not good or bad, I would say it was tolerable, many expected some unimaginable numbers right away, but the fundamentals donâ€™t work that way. In the process, weak hands lost the token below the public sale price, strong hands hold on and will be rewarded for this on this bull market.So, in principle, we are already growing 4150+ nodes, we are waiting for applied tasks on the nodes, bonus goodies from NFTs, listings on new exchanges at the beginning of next year.We are growing, we are growing, the team is not giving up, the community is growing stronger...By the way...There is an option to earn an ETNY token, the event is taking place in ZeaLY until January 1, 2024, 83k tokens are being drawn among the top 100 (quests are easier than a steamed turnip)https://zealy.io/c/ethernitycloud/invite/WpCXgUrKYvHNmPCXipI2lMore info:ethernity.cloudhttps://discord.gg/gzfubAvRjuhttps://twitter.com/Ethernity_cloud",
