If the person generated it with the right vanity address generator software, the address is very safe just like the normal bitcoin addresses.Is that it might not be a burn address, as vanity addresses can be generated and used just like any other bitcoin address. So, the answer to why \"people\" are sending to this BTC address, is for the same reason anyone sends/receives bitcoin on any other address (unless you want to do some blockchain analysis), who knows",

And is this the first type of wallet address creation methods? From your statement that is what I understood. Please do not be mad at me, I don't know much about wallets.",

A vanity address has a known private key and is different from addresses posted by OP. Whoever created those addresses doesn't know the private key assosiated with them and can't access the fund sent to them. For generating a vanity address, you start with a random number (private key) and derive an address from that. You repeat the same thing again and again until you generate an address with the desired pattern. Addresses posted by OP are known as burn addresses. For having such addresses, all you need to do is calculate and use the correct checksum so that the address is valid.",

      "body": "Quote from: foysalsiam on January 23, 2025, 10:16:03 PMWhy people sending btc to this address?Bitcoins sent to these addresses are gone forever. There are a few reasons whey people might send to a burn address. Primarily, sending to a burn address proves that you spent the bitcoins and got nothing in return. Some people send just like some people might burn a $100 for show in a video. Many of the bitcoins sent to 1111...4oLvT2 were sent accidentally due to software bugs.Quote from: foysalsiam on January 23, 2025, 10:16:03 PMWhy it called burn wallet?It is called a \"burn address\" because bitcoins sent to it can never be recovered. They have been \"burned\".Quote from: foysalsiam on January 23, 2025, 10:16:03 PMWhat is burn wallet?A burn address is an address with an unknown private key. It is not possible to prove that the private key for a burn address is not known, but we can be pretty certain that the private keys for these addresses are not known because addresses that have private keys look random and those addresses are far from random.Burn addresses are easy to construct. In short, you set all but the last 6 characters in the address to the text that you want and then compute the last 6 characters as the checksum.Quote from: _act_ on January 23, 2025, 10:19:26 PMThe person that owns the address used vanity address generator to generate the address with high computational power equipment. If the person generated it with the right vanity address generator software, the address is very safe just like the normal bitcoin addresses.Burn addresses such at those cannot be made with a vanity address generator because every character in the address (except the checksum) is chosen instead of generated from the private key.",
