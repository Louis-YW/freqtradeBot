Such offers only come from new users who create their new accounts to scam. They use very attractive offers to scam greedy trade partners and if you are greedy, you will fall to those scam offers.Some tips are below but basically you only need to be careful (don't release coin if you are not received payment from the trade partner), are not greedy, you will not be scammed.Common P2P Scams in developing countries and How to Avoid ThemDon't Fall Victim to Proof of Payment Scams – Keep Your P2P Trading SecureHow to Choose and Rank a Trustworthy Counterparty for P2P Trading",

      "body": "Thanks for informing us about this, but I think it already been shared before but the method of scamming was a little different, like in that method the scammer make a policy that in order to receive the funds while doing p2p you have to give us your number, and when the seller/buyer gives his/her number, then scammer use that number to send phishing messages like the one you shared.Well, asking for email on the Binance chat would be risky for seller because his account can be blocked immediately but even they are risking there accounts and asking for your email then they don't have to, because if they will insert a rule in there policy that in order to receive the funds you have to give your email on which you have made your Binance account they can save there accounts. Well, from the look this statement or policy will give vibes that something is off. And a smart guy will understand quickly that this person will attempt a phishing attack. And you can avoid making any transaction with them.And dear OP I will suggest to insert a disclaimer that you have copied the whole thing from somewhere, or maybe you can use the quote tags, because you just copied the whole thing and it is misleading us into thinking that you have wrote this text while you don't.",

Indeed, that is the biggest obstacle if we only choose one, sometimes if we are active in a local forum we can seek opinions from other people we trust so we can choose a responsible Binance p2p service.In essence, if the Binance p2p method is not executed correctly and there are unusual deviations, it is better to cancel the transaction and move to another p2p service opener.",

The only way out is to keep the chat on the platform for moderators to keep watch the trading conversation between both buyers and sellers. I've had a similar trading experience where the seller ask me to contact him in WhatsApp before he confirms and releases my trade with him, I immediately reported and filed him to the moderators about his fraudulent actions until he released my trade.
