Yes at my place it's probably only $2 for a single lunch and that's relatively expensive from where you say.the situation of the place is the main factor in the difference in the price of each food and there are also those who sell at a low price in order to attract customers to buy food at their place.",

It consists of a variety of side dishes (mostly vegetables and eggs) and can be said to have met some of the daily nutritional needs.And a few days ago, found an interesting tip in a city that for only 10,000 IDR/0.66USD you can get 3 meals a day.",

You can get away with cheaper cost if you cook at home for a family of 3-4. Also in India as well you can find decent portion of food which costs around the similar price at a lot of mediocre places and many people especially the wage labour do eat it.",

If you want to compare prices in general and how one can really save money and how much, which definitely implies cooking at home look at the amount one spends on food from his wage.https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/this-map-shows-how-much-each-country-spends-on-food/Anyhow, probably the cheapest serving here which would include a soup, some porc, and a side dish is around 6-8 Euros, that is is either foodcourts near shopping malls or in some not-so-good restaurants, so called asian street food.",

In your country that $0.57 might be worth the same amount in comparison to the average wage. It makes no sense to really give just the cheapest examples without giving a wider context about food costs. The food while cheap does not exactly constitute a well rounded diet and is lacking any sort of variety, unless they have multiple different dishes priced at the same level you wouldn't want to eat it twice a day for a month. Even prisoners seek a bit of variety in their food habits, although it's interesting to see prices from lots of different people here.",

It's impossible to even here, I could buy for 4 Euros a day one kilo of rice and half of pasta since you mentioned that, and to reach the previously mentioned sum throw in one kilo of pork meat with potatoes on top of it and still go below 300 euros a month, basic food is cheap almost everywhere compared to a median wage, good food that covers every need and diet, that's obviously different. Whenever I'm out in the evening and in a new restaurant I'm always worried about cheap stuff, the first question is why is this so cheap and how long ago has it expired before turning the page!But seriously, food is the one thing where you don't want to cut costs, but it's also the first thing people like to cut, I would do so with a lot of other things first, health is something you won't be able to recover if you neglect it no matter how much money you make from saving a penny a day. And sometimes it's even worse, people eat garbage food just because they don't have time or are lazy, not because of the price as some fast food junk is becoming far more expensive than normal cooking.",

Then again, a lot of us are probably not eating healthy anyway so if we are really trying to save some money wherever we can, we can probably do this for a month if the option is available. Here in our place, I can eat healthy foods with lots of variations for $4 a day. Basically, it's 2 cups of rice with a combination of meat, veggies, fish, or whatever dish you want. $120 a month for food doesn't seem to be too bad, considering that you will always have the option which foods to eat that'll satisfy your tastebuds without sacrificing the nutrients that you get.",

I suspect you haven't had the pleasure of eating rice with beans all day, but I can assure you it's going to lead to gases and constipation.I did research on growth and preparation of beans for human consumption purposes, as part of my attempts to HODL agriculture.According to bean cooking recommendations I have seen. The consensus appears to be, beans must be cooked for more than 10 minutes at boiling temperature, to breakdown the chemical components which cause gas and other negative side effects. Some sources claim beans should be cooked for more than 30 to 60 minutes before consumption to completely eliminate gas. (Although I have not gotten around to testing this, yet.)Electricity costs being on the rise, it could be ideal to use passive cookers for this role. Such as solar cookers which use mirrors to redirect the suns rays.",
