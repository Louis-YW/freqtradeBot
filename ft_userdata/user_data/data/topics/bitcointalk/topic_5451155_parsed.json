That doesn't necessarily mean they will ever give you any money related to those numbers.* Handling money, doing business... this kind of things have to be done while one is cool. Rushing it, FOMO-ing, can easily end badly (mistakes, lack of double-checking egerything, money loss).",

You might think that you don't belong to their group just because you don't have the kind of money they have. just have a little patience everything works out with time don't be in a hurry.Secondly the idea of borrowing money to make investments that you are not sure would bring out good outcomes should be remove from your head. Don't invest unless your are 50-70% sure it would bring out positive resultsLastly, if you feel like what you are getting into is wrong and it won't be good for your mental health, like you can't handle it just stop it why you still can. Don't let anyone advice you into starting something you can't finish. And making money shouldn't involve any illegal means this must be your no one rule. The moment you break that rule, you might end up Lossing everything.",

One cannot rely on a single job these days, you need to venture into another side jobs where your skills can still be useful and may bring additional income for you. The more income you gained, the bigger chances that you become financially stable, and the higher chances that you will be able to save. Saving could be a lot of help so you can prepare in any circumstances that may come in your life unexpectedly. If you have emergency funds, you will always be confident that you won’t struggle in your finances once unplanned expenses or financial emergencies arise.",

Always learn to face your hustle and make your own money.One should not invest all their money in one place (carrying all their eggs in one basket).One should always not only rely on one source of income but also think of possible ways to expand their financial lifestyle.Invest only in friends that can give you future value. I wish to talk about this because some people are fond of lavishing money on friends who are just in a parasitic relationship with them instead of investing in friends or relatives who can also be of help to them in the future.",

I also learned from my personal environment, but I am now deeper into what is called investment. lately I realized that we just keep saving continuously without investing our money, but the value of the money actually decreases because there is inflation and I also know that there is not a single rich person in this world who has enormous wealth without investing and I now I realize that investing is important for the future rather than just saving money because I used to only be taught what is called saving, not investing.are you guys the same?",

Also always have a budget and do financial planning, investing alone might not be good you still need to have a plan and this will serve as a guide to you on when and where you are heading.",

Don't keep your money in the bank for long : You know many people are still falling for the historical banking ideology of keeping money there to build some interest on it but know evidence have shown that banks rather deduct from customer account in the guise of service charge. The earlier view of fixing your money in the bank is now becoming a fallacy as the interest on it would be very small that you would be better circulating your money in a legit business.2. Human capital development : Some times we undermine the power of helping the needing. Such sacrifices and favour done to other people are returned multiple times to us even when we don't know how it operate to save us from harm or danger.",

Never make that mistake if not you will regret it.Secondly when joining a public vehicle do not display cash from your pocket or your wallet as you have no idea who the rest of the other passengers are.

Money plummets where you invest it.This goes for every currency there is, even cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, although bitcoin comes with some twist and that's thanks to volatility but, money invested births more money. People have the idea of saving money in the banks of which, these banks reinvet your money to get interest in them because they understand the idea behind investment and money. Bitcoin comes with fhe twist as it is in itself an investment which makes hodling profitable but not so much with fiat.2. Fiat currency in particular is a product of the government.These are government authorised and so its validity is dependent on what the government decides, its values yoo and they can manipulate it as they please, bringing about inflation or otherwise. Hence, you can create or avoid certain situations depending on how you choose to manage money.",

Having a side hustle or other things that give us money is something that many persons do not take very seriously that is why they will always go broke and to beg for money because there is no sure way. Even though we are doing a work that pays our well, we still need to invest or create a business that will be giving us money so we are not going to relent on just one source of income. We need to utilize opportunities so that we can earn from different atmospheres for a better condition.",

Just like on thinking up ahead with your day job salary on which you've been already spending or have those partitions already without even getting those in hand.You  wouldn't know if you would be suddenly been laid off or would really be having accident or simply you been get kicked or fired. This is why living according into your needs and not into your wants. You should really be wise on your spending so that you wouldnt really be ending up on getting some debt just because you have been overdropped just becauseyour spending is too much comparing on what you do earn. Financial learnings do always come on these actual situations and experiences on which you would be applying it out.We are the ones who do mold up our own destiny or future on which it would really be just that right that you should really be that sensible towards your actions.Important thing is that we shouldnt really let ourselves fall into the pit of loan or simply with debts just because of mishandling up your money.",

I do not completely agree with you in your point of view.  Because, by the same logic, there are many sectors that thrived in periods of crisis such as the Corona virus.  The job that stresses its necessity even in parallel with the investment could be a job in one of those investments for an investor who was able to benefit from the crisis.  Investing in the pharmaceutical sector, for example, or food chains, is considered one of the safest investments, since it meets basic human needs.",

In my limited experience with money management, I have accumulated a lot of knowledge from this forum and others. My biggest financial lessons thus far are as follows: 1. Always have a budget: In everything you do, always have a plan for what to spend on. You can always keep track of what you want to spend on and minimize it. I track what I spend money on by making a list of the things I need. This helps me manage the limited resources I have while also causing me to have extra savings. According to Lord Robbins' economics study, the desires of man for goods and services are vast and cannot be completely satisfied, therefore no matter how much money you spend, you will never stop spending or be satisfied. 2. Do not spend more than you earn: My favorite guideline and one that has kept me going for a while. One must not spend more than they make; your income influences your spending decisions. How much money do I have for this should be your first consideration. If the item you wish to purchase does not fit within your budget, you should give it up. When this rule is ignored or not followed, it results in debt, which is never a choice.",

To me money is a tool, not an end in itself and another important money lesson I've learned is the power of compound interest. By investing your money wisely and agreeing to grow over time we can harness the power of compounding to accelerate our financial development so prioritize your values and use money to support one's goals and desires in fulfilling my needs.",
