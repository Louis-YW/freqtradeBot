  "content": "In 22nd of May, Burak Keceli sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, describing an alternative second layer solution which is far more scalable, private, requires no interactivity and does not introduce liquidity constraints; essentially superior to lightning in every aspect. It consumes much less space on-chain, works like Chaumian eCash without being a central point of failure, and makes use of shared transaction outputs. To enable anonymous, scalable and off-chain transactions, it uses virtual transaction outputs (or vTXO). It is in very early stage, and the team behind desperately needs Bitcoin developers willing to work on it.

It removes pretty much all friction lightning currently faces:1.Backups2.Interactivity3.Offline receiving4.Receiver privacy5.On-chain footprintwell if that's the case then let's join forces   I am coincidentally also working on a Lightning wallet (as long as it is written in Python as development of the wallet core has already begun).Quote from: She shining on May 27, 2023, 09:22:52 PM QuoteThe only downside is that Ark require users to come online and \"refresh\" their coins every few weeks, otherwise the ASP can sweep the funds. is this the side effect of removing on-chain footprint?Not really a downside as a \"watchtower\" program can be made that inputs your wallet password and the refreshing date in the future, which is stored with AES encryption in memory.The key to this cipher is the time stored in ISO 8601 format as a byte string. It is promptly discarded from memory.Every second, the watchtower will attempt to decrypt the cipher using the current ISO 8601 time looking like \"YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS\" as the key.Naturally this will only succeed at the requisite time at which the wallet is to be unlocked - following which the coins inside the ASP can be refreshed.If at any point you come online, you can simply terminate the watchtower program, and the encrypted wallet password will be destroyed and nobody will be able to use it unless they also know the unlock time, even if they have hacked the watchtower on a later date after the timer has started. But the unlock time has already been discarded after it was used to encrypt the wallet password, meaning the deleted copy of the encrypted password is now unrecoverable.This particular part is my own design, not Burak's. I haven't told him about this yet.",

Your program will need to decrypt it for every second, so your decryption could not take more time than that. The simplest way of getting the current time, and trying to decrypt it, can cause it to never be decrypted, if you will be unlucky, and your process will have a lower priority for a few seconds, when it should be decrypted.Another thing is, any attacker could scan it faster than one decryption per second, it could do 1000 decryptions per second, and reach it sooner. Also, if there will be some default locking time, for example two weeks, and the attacker will know that some file on your server was created one week ago (by checking metadata), then it will use one week offset, and scan only a range of time, and then will get to the solution much faster than the official algorithm.",

I'm still trying to grasp the concept. Quote from: NotATether on June 13, 2024, 05:51:43 AMBut you know what would be really awesome?
