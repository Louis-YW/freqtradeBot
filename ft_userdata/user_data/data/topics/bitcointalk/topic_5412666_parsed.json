Good call - (then again, judging by your recent post history, you make such bogus claims in just about every post you make to make your post count for the signature campaign you are in) please share the link where you read this.QuoteBe very careful using or buying any of these.Any person purchasing any code has the option of paying an additional fee to have the actual coupon posted to them.All property codes/coupons will be posted to the buyer upon receipt of their mailing details they send to me via https://privnote.com/ to ensure privacy.",
