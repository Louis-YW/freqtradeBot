  "content": "I discovered that the majority of us newbies are unaware of the distinctions between the two types of cryptocurrency wallets, hot and cold wallets, and which one is the best to use, so I decided to share my thoughts with them. As we all know, wallets play critical roles in protecting our cryptocurrencies.A cryptocurrency wallet is a device or program that enables users to send, receive, and store fund. Let see the difference  hot and cold wallet and where is best to be use. HOT WALLETA hot wallet is one that is online, quick and easy to use for bitcoin trading or spending, but it is also vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can result in lost or stolen bitcoins, for example. Edge wallet, coinbase, and MetamaskCOLD WALLETA cold wallet is one that is not connected to the internet, such as paper, USB, and other computer storage facilities where the private key can be kept, such as CDs.Wallet selectionIt is entirely up to you to choose the best crypto wallet for yourself; however, if you intend to hold Bitcoin, it is best to use a cold wallet. However, if you are the type who spends all of your time on your phone, it may be best to keep some cryptocurrency in a mobile wallet.Also make sure the wallet is non-custodial wallets that you always retain the private key, and  you have total control over you fund.",

You should use a non-custodial and open-source wallet.If the wallet isn't open source, you don't know how the keys have been generated and whether you are the only one who has access to the keys or not. For example, trustwallet is a non-custodial wallet, but since it's close source, I wouldn't recommend it.",

      "body": "The best is the crypto wallet that you fully understand, because otherwise every wallet can be a big risk, regardless of whether it is hot, cold, or open source. A person who downloads a desktop/mobile wallet, installs it on his device without verifying the files and saves his seed in an inappropriate way (cloud, e-mail, plain text file on the computer), is certainly exposed to a much greater risk than a person who buys a hardware wallet and creates his own crypto wallet but repeats the mistake of saving backup. Both users are therefore exposed to similar risks, the latter perhaps less so because they take advantage of hardware wallets, but in the end both of them do not understand how to achieve security and protect themselves from hackers.A properly made cold wallet is the only correct way to store larger amounts, and any of the hot wallets that have a good reputation can be used for everyday transactions.",

Most of newbies who mostly use hot wallet to hold their coins are because there's lack of explanation how to create secured cold wallet or they don't have any idea how to create it.Paper wallet sound to be easy to create since there's a paper wallet generator out there, but it's very insecure and that's paper wallet might be compromised.That's why it's the best for newbies to bought a hardware wallet e.g. trezor or ledger since they don't need to follow complicated step to have a cold wallet.",

At a point I have done some business on Coinbase but I never for once felt safe in there. The chances of attack there are high.So my key advice on selecting a wallet is.#It has to be in your control. You own the private keys you own the wallet.#Transactions has to be fast and easy# low to moderate transaction fees",

So, it doesn't make sense to say that I select a wallet with low fee. You should use a wallet which allow you to set the fee and estimate the required fee rate well. Your suggestion (electrum) is surely a good option.",

It's meant to be shared publicly with others and when you send or receive any transaction, that transaction will be saved on the blockchain and your address will be visible for everyone.This is something you can't avoid but it's more of a privacy concern than a security risk. This is why it's recommended use a new address for each transaction.Quote from: Solosanz on September 25, 2022, 11:07:46 AM...
