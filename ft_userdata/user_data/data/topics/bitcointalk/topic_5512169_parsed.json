All IMF is concerned about is limiting bitcoin exposure to the public. They are trying to prevent bitcoin from being officially recognized as a currency. Obviously, threatened by it. They have to protect fiat now seeing how bitcoin is a serious matter and is here to stay. This can definitely be a discouragement for other countries to adopt bitcoin in their economies as they might be targeted by United Nations organizations. What a disappointment for El Salvador. I wonder how they will navigate through this.",

They can be a first nation with Bitcoin legal tender but it's more difficult to be a game-changer and force IMF to recognize their national treasury growth by investment in Bitcoin.We see it, IMF see it but it won't be easy for El Salvador to have a good jump in their national rank with pressure of many big countries on IMF.A portfolio tracker on El Salvador investment in Bitcoin since September 2021.https://nayibtracker.com/",

Adopting bitcoin is a very great initiative,  but can we say all these improvements in the country was solely because they adopted bitcoin as legal tender or because they put better policies in place and managed the country better under this present government? My point is, crediting bitcoin alone for this success might lead them to neglect other aspects of the country and that would be disastrous.That being said, it was obvious that El Salvador will face many obstacles from these kind of institutions and big countries because they adopted bitcoin as legal tender. Accepting what others are fighting against means your standing against them. The IMF wants El Salvador to tighten bitcoin laws and be more controlling, lol. I mean, that's exactly what most countries want, to restrict bitcoin in a way that they have control of everything. This alone goes against what bitcoin stands against.",

Every creditor will seek a means to collect its money from the debtor.  The country owns about 5,892.76 BTC and has a policy of buying one Bitcoin daily. IMF might not be comfortable with such exposure, maybe because of the volatility of Bitcoin. They want the country to cut their investment in Bitcoin and diversify funds to other areas.But the president of El Salvador is a strong believer in Bitcoin. He sees the future profitability of the coin and wants to keep holding and adding more to the state's treasury. He has already started making bold economic reforms that will reduce the risk of investing in Bitcoin. One of them is the proposed 2025 budget deficit financial plans. The budget will be funded by internally generated revenues without loans from any organization. Nayib Bukele can achieve it because he has reduced budget deficits since he assumed office. In 2019, when he became president, the budget deficit was $1.2 billion, but last year, it stood at $338 million.IMF is just surprised that El Salvador's economy has not nosedived as they predicted, so they are seeking other means to influence the country's Bitcoin policies. After all, how many developing countries have experienced dramatic economic growth with IMF loans?",

It is certain and will happen, but the President of El Salvador is smart and has also reviewed this before making his decision. It could be the ultimate dream of the leader of El Salvador if perhaps they will pay off all their debts with the IMF or others with the help of BTC investment instruments.I think the IMF is only talking about the economic inequality that is currently widening and trying to provide recommendations in addressing potential fiscal and financial stability issues that come from the Bitcoin initiative as I read in the news from the OP's post link. However, one thing that is most needed now is how all countries will be able to pay off their debts from various sources including the IMF whose interest continues to accumulate over time, including El Salvador.",

Hopefully we can also see that bitcoin soar up high and El Salvador will earn a lot of money since for sure this will shutdown those entities that discourage them to use bitcoin and make it as their alternative currency.",

      "body": "One of the IMF's main goals is to \"prevent financial crises,\" which is why they advise El Salvador to proceed cautiously with Bitcoin due to its high volatility. They are concerned that such an asset could affect the country’s financial stability if the market dumps or, in a worst-case scenario, collapses. However, pro-Bitcoin advocates argue that it's more likely for fiat to collapse than Bitcoin since fiat is controlled by a few, while Bitcoin operates as a global currency.It’s understandable why the IMF is concerned as El Salvador has a debt of $30 billion as of March 2024, which is 82.8% of their GDP. That percentage indicates the country is facing financial struggles. Still, the president's reasoning for investing in Bitcoin is to attract investors to the country, although there haven't been significant developments in that area yet.More info about Debt-to-GDP ratiohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio",
