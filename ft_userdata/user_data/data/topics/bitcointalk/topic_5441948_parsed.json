No one knows who Satoshi is. Bitcoin adoption has been from its very beginning of its creation, its price has gone up beyond and people later know that bitcoin is just more than p2p but an asset and they buy and holding it while some people are trading it.",

So it was an inspiration from several people.You taking about hope? we are not that desperate, we are still very much alive, bear and bull market, it's just part of the ecosystem.Not sure though if you have experience what you are preaching here, that is to HODL.",

Traversing South America teaching people about Bitcoin. Getting rebels and misfits in some unrecognised republic in Syria to use Bitcoin.

These are fun fact about bitcoin that could make your work beautiful Exactly, as OP mentioned Bitcoin was 14 years so by those years it would be impossible to have a lot of history about Bitcoin. This is actually a common knowledge for Bitcoin like basic background but if were going to post a thread maybe putting some sources would be good. In the time of pandemic, since people were not allowed to go outside due to covid-19 so almost everyone are using gadgets and crypto became famous especially into my country PH. People invested here despite the mindset of easy money but as we know FOMO is common back days so when the bull run ends. A lot of people also loss a huge amound of assets. Maybe in next decades Bitcoin would fly high up and will change a lot of people's life. From P2P game after it died, they transfer to investing and trading then boom huge loss. Not even doing their own research just to be part of the trend.",

Isn't it the best time to accumulate Bitcoin?  Because if it so happen that Blackrock's interest in Bitcoin will make them to buy all Bitcoin in the market then those who are holding will greatly profit from this action.  This is manipulation that can do good for the holders until they decided to take profit and crash the price then rinse and repeat.  But whatever their intention holding and accumulating Bitcoin is not a bad idea at all we just need to time when we will sell at a profit and restock with a huge discount.  After all, Bitcoin market is always been like this ever since which is why there is this so called 4 year cycles that shows how Bitcoin price has its movement pattern.Quote from: Mate2237 on July 08, 2023, 06:32:39 PMThat is your own part of the history.
