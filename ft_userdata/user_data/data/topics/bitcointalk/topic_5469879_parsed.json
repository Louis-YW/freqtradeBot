I think the hackers target Hong Kong Binance users and that can only be from data breach or insider work. This does not have to be the only cases. One of the loopholes that hackers use and that companies use to evade responsibility is sharing data with third parties is sharing data with third parties, whether those parties are legal or for commercial purposes, and therefore there are several copies of your data in several Parties. Some of these parties abide by the laws and maintain the confidentiality of the data and delete it after a while, but there is always a third party that is vulnerable to hackers or to leaking and selling the data. even the current laws that protect customer data will fail with such data sharing.You should use better email filters, check any link before clicking on it, and make sure it is not a phishing link.",

I could remember that this trick is not new here in my country because this is how scammers will send you a text message or call you, that they are from your bank and that you should send them your last four digit number of your ATM card for them to verify your bank account to avoid blockage of ATM card. So many people fell for this trick, especially the ones that were not educated , and they got all the funds in their account wiped out.This is the same method that these scammers has come with by deceiving people to verify their Binance account through the form so that they can have details which they can use to access your their Binance account.It is better to stay away from CEX and if you can't, don't believe in whatever message or link that you get from anyone when it comes to your finance.",

I think the hackers target Hong Kong Binance users and that can only be from data breach or insider work. Centralized exchanges we know are not safe and the bitter truth is that we can't completely avoid them. Although In this scenario Its not just enclosed in how unsafe having our data's on  centralized exchanges or any other kyc required entity, It also has a lot to do with knowledge.  Anyone using binance and is well informed about how binance operates in terms of notifying or reaching out to their customers will  not have problem identifying that binance don't notify their customers on any important issues as such through text messages and will move straightaway to login into their account to check for such notification if it's there or better still contact the customer service.There are many advance fashions of scammers that is why whatever crypto exchangers we are using we ought to study and research to learn about their operations as having prep knowledge of that can easily save us from falling to a scam coming through that angle.For the fact that we can't completely guarantee of not using centralized entities which means these are the kind of risks we'll likely be experiencing using them  we also have to equip ourselves in knowledge against these expected scams. For without knowledge it's easy for anyone to fall to their antics.",

The hackers sent random text messages to many people and just waited for someone to fall into their trap. We have to be careful and confirm the information we receive, and the important thing is that we don't panic if we get a message like that.If we panic, we won't be able to think clearly and will fall into their trap easily because they can also play with their target's psychology. They will very convincingly influence their targets to follow what they want. The hackers already had the target's data but sent the messages randomly.So the sale of customer data does exist, and hackers can get it easily. We may also have experienced getting an offer from someone we don't know, but he already knows our name and address. That's because the data we provide to banking or insurance agencies share the data with each other.",

Any KYC requirement that requires information like phone numbers, residential addresses, social media handles, and other personal data is highly dangerous. With these data, criminals can physically track their targets with less restrictions. These days many people live their lives on social media. They cheaply give out their locations on the internet which will give these criminals access to them. The recent murder of a well-known rapper in South Africa was facilitated because he gave out his location on social media. Having a special email, phone number or social media media account for registration in these centralized platforms will reduce some of the risk of using them.",

Their decentralized exchanges can stop operation anytime and if you lock your coins in their staking pools, you can lose your coins anytime.Privacy is not completely secured on decentralized exchanges and you have to use them with caution too.On centralized exchanges, KYC is not only to prevent and control criminal activities, money laundering.

Which is already there, but those who are new to the crypto field and fall prey to such phishing links might not think of it. Because last time I checked, such phishing attempts also occurred in the Electrum desktop wallet. Where user activates it after many months and on the app he is asked to update the wallet in a built-in app pop-up notification. Well, those who were active in the market did know that this pop-up notification was a phishing scam but that user was not active in the community and clicked on the link and updated the electrum wallet of those scammers and when entered the seed phrase lost all of his money. The best way to confirm the signature but if the same system of confirmation of messages, sent by the Binance or any centralized exchange would be provided then it will be easier for the newbies.
