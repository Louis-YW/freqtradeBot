If you are extremely lucky even the first share could find the block, the question is only if your device is able to submit shares. Also it need to submit the block that was found to the network quite fast. In general this is the Beaty of the bitcoin network. You can participate with every device.

I think I will be extremely lucky to find a block, but the chance is there, and the cost is negligible.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I will bet on the powerful machine. It's a really rare case that you might end up mining something if you get lucky. But who knows what could happen in this case.",

Okay stop thinking your own node with a usb stick.last Jan of 2022 sledge hit on cks pool with 9 usb sticks.I am not anti node mining.I would estimate a block every 10 minutes means a 10 % shot you lose the block in a race with a fast connected person.I am assuming you have a fairly good connection to the chain on a decent pc.you will not find out if some guy is solo mining on a node and hits with a usb stick for the simple reason he is like you a paranoid person wanting full security.your paranoia is unjustified btw.mining to ckpool solo is private as the address you created to mine it.I can look at every block made and see the coin payment to an address.so wether it is ck pool on a node has no difference on security.",
