Thanks!You are very late to the party, for many years the members of this forum have known that cloud mining is just a Ponzi scheme and nothing more, in the best case scenario you could find a company which actually has mining equipment and you buy some hash power out of them, but when we add all the costs it is almost impossible you make any money, in the worst case scenario, which is also the most common, nothing like that exist and whatever money you believe you are earning comes from the next people that decided to invest in the scam, however as it has been demonstrated over and over again this is not a stable model and eventually collapses.",

Yes, years ago fake cloud mining sites were very popular and offered high interest rates. They were in fact ponzi schemes. The greediest ones used to last few days or weeks, the humblest ones used to last a month or few months, depending the rates proposed by the scammers. The systems were elaborated and showed real time results, that is, the coins being hypothetically mined directly to your balance every second.This concept incentivized and tempted many enthusiasts to invest and watch the coins coming in to their wallets.Some people achieved ROI, but without any doubts, for most investors it was a complete loss.",

Thanks!Cloud mining is not a good method nowadays to earn crypto or bitcoin. Maybe in 2016-2017, I can still say that somehow it is possible to earn cryptocurrency, but now it is not effective because it usually ends up being a scam dude.Now, if you want to make money doing almost nothing but you will earn bitcoin, it is better to just buy your mining rigs as long as your electricity consumption is low in the area or country you are in because it is necessary that the mining rigs are in a cold place or else if it's hot it's sure that its electricity consumption is high.Or if you don't have enough to buy mining, you can also trade every day and just check 3x a day, it depends on you what time you check to see if it's sold or when you buy crypto, that's the only way you see it.",

And the reason for it is obvious: If cloud mining would be profitable, they wouldn't sell that service but just keep the mining profits for themselves. Otherwise they would be making lossEven every cloud mining icos that have been looking for investors to build server farms have been scams or failed, so that should tell you something.Only way for you to get profits by minining is either renting your own mining rig or find something that's profitable to mine.",

Until i they are turn as a scam i never get my money  @OP with your current money, you don't need to use cloud mining to get BTC, just trade it, with trading skill you can increase your BTC. if you don't have a skill to trade, just hold it and save your BTC to your own wallet (electrum or Bitcoin wallet). If you wants to buy an altcoin, and wants to increase your holding, try to find altcoin with staking feature. such as Cardano, Uniswap, Pancakeswap. But same as using cloud mining, if you wants higher rewards, you need to invest more.always DYOR and DWYOR before you make a decision.",
