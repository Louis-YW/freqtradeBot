CZ also later addressed this issue of mass withdrawal in one of his tweetshttps://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602676998094069760Do you think such type of incidents are pre planned to benefit the exchange ?",

      "body": "It was pre planned. CZ exudes self-assurance and boasts that he and his company are not touching the money of the depositors. Furthermore, he is sending signals to the public that they are liquid and solvent. I like what CZ is doing, but I have my doubts that Binance is not using the money of its depositors. It is possible that they had already begun securing the funds of all depositors. So he has the courage to challenge the other CEX for regular test withdrawals. It is not a bad idea at all. Although the majority of us dislike him, his proposal is beneficial to crypto.",

The exchange is currently experiencing a decline and trust from crypto investors & users, that's one way CZ wants to prove to Binance investors & users, that they really have funds without having to steal, they have millions of dollars in savings, they want to prove Binance is responsible.What CZ is doing, is the mission & vision to convince investors and crypto users in general, but we really don't know what will happen in the future and we can't see what we can't see yet, The news that you provide is one way that can be seen, you do not know for the continuation.What is certain is that anything can happen on a crypto exchange unexpectedly, it's a good idea to just stick to this advice: Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts.",

It's like the collapse of Luna doesn't mean ETH will collapse, both are centralized, but they are 2 completely different entities.Quote from: JamesByrom on December 31, 2022, 09:46:44 AMIt is possible that some exchanges may intentionally leak information in order to build their brand or generate buzz.

As long as they don't scam, don't use customers' money indiscriminately, they can do anything to improve their reputation.",

He knows they have been attacked several times so yep it's been planned by CZ. Even in the interviews, he reassures the public that they can withstand the fud.Hew is obliged to because people will panic more if they just beg for people not to withdraw.",

The real test happens when the CEO and his team are taken by surprise, what seems to not be the case here. I liked what CZ said about exchanges, though:It's really simple. Exchanges just need to respect users' funds. If you have 1 BTC deposited on the platform, they must keep that 1 BTC there, instead of exchanging it into altcoins to run their schemes. Moreover, when the community points alerts on possible exchanges which are potentially going bankrupt, the accused exchanges shouldn't victimize themselves, but to deal with the situation as something normal, since they have the necessary funds to fulfill with their obligations.",

With the proof of reserve, that's what making everyone to think that their funds are safe into exchanges, mainly in Binance. But, with that idea also, everyone must be aware right now that if you deposit an exact btc or any altcoin on them, they're using it somewhere else for their personal gain.Just as the banks, that's what they do and that's why they've got earning offers that will make people earn and deposit on their platform. But having that lot of users and they're not really parking the exact crypto that's deposited on them. It's making most of us aware that they're not really a safe place to keep it. Well, we've known that ever since though.",

There's big trouble when clients deposited a total of 100,000BTC and the exchange simply says it has $1,683,140,000 worth of assets that back it.

But these exchanges don't follow that, they're reinvesting it somewhere else or mostly buying their own tokens for that demand.And as for Binance, I think that's what they have to prove that the ratio should be accurate on how much deposits are there and how much are withdrawable any time just as what happened recently.",

Well, their users but do we have power for them to do that? I doubt it.That's why if the government steps in and forces them to do this, like the FED or FBI or the government where they're doing their main operations. Then they should be forced to prove them that it's 1:1. It will make them brave and proving that they're really for their customers and have enough reserve funds as what's deposited to them.",
