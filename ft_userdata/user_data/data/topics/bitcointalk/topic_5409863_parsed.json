In addition, you'll need to create a hard copy of them somewhere that you are sure not to lose. But, the most important thing is to avoid your private keys getting into the wrong hands in the first place. That's why you should keep your private keys safe from thieves, hackers, and/or accidental loss. These kinds of mishaps are one of the biggest threats to newbies and less experienced Bitcoin users. Don't ever take security lightly.",

      "body": "The first question to every beginner with regards to safety is in the words \"Private Key\". Simply asking what does this phrase actually means, a beginner is expected to grasps what it all entails without being told or even with the least given detail. The only confusion tha a few is expected to phase in this is the how to secure there private keys or seed phrases and that is entirely upto the beginner as to the best means of safety and reproducing it when it's needed.Now it's important that you know that,1. Your private key/seed phrase is like a master key2. It could reproduce its wallet anywhere and on any device where ever its used around the world3. It gives the user complete authority over the wallet4. It is supposed to stay unique to a single individualHence, the importance of private key and why its expected to be the most protected or secured code in the cryptospace cannot be over emphasised.It's expected of a beginner to learn the pros and cons of the cryptospace and should he or she come by any wallet compromised in the early stage of there crypto journey, they just create a new one, move all funds over and they are safe again. There is security in privacy hence, its of importance that you stay private.",

If you want to dig more research and gain further information I want you to read this thread, there's a lot of information that newbies must know before they jump in investing crypto.  It's an advantage for crypto holders if you've knowledgable enough technically and fundamentally when it comes to Bitcoin. As I'd say, stay vigilant at all times, keep your valuable things safe and be responsible for them.",

Its not that you dont trust them but if your keeping a lot of crypto dont leave or make him/her hold it while your away,  a split seconf is enough to capture your keys or any info he can used to steal your funds.  Too baf if that friend can do that to you.  Its not you dont trust them but who knows what motive they have regardless of friendship? Money can change people especially if thats a lot to take in.",

You will use your phones to connect to more public Internet connections and do more vulnerable activities in security aspect.On smart phones, usually people are less care about security and less Internet Security or Antivirus softwares are used by people for their phones.Together, they make phones are more vulnerable for your cryptocurrency (wallets, assets, ie.)If you store your cryptocurrency on phone, only store a small part you have. That small part is for convenient usages in life. For big part, store it on your PC, at home is the best. Don't store it in your PC at your company.",

I am also storing some on my phones as I need it more when I traveled and do some of my stuff like doing signature which I am conveniently doing on mobile rather than pc.  When I say convenient is like I could lie down on my bed while reading post and not slouching on a table and chair whole day.  But in terms of security,  no doubt its better to store on PC.  But like you said,  most people use their phones more than PC so a little caution is needed.",

Keeping private safe is when you write it out without saving it online. a seed phrase is the highest security a cryptocurrency minded person supposed to secure knowing that keeping it open it will affect your coins in the wallet. That's while i do advice people to documents a wallet seed phrase without showcasing it people. Because it's very obvious that any slight exposure of seed phrase that comes to the end of that particular wallet.",

Be careful with people who introduce you to crypto currency because some of them might steal your keys and you will not know that is why we have plenty of cases were people funds go missing without a traceThat's true and we can't be tired of stressing it. Wallet security lies predominantly with the owner. Hacks don't easily happen without a loophole somehow from the wallet owner, especially if it's an open source wallet. I can relate with your comment there and that was why I said it was true. I had an experience on that with a dude I was teaching wallet security among other things. I told the dude never to give out his passphrase to anyone no matter what because it's like his bank account pin/password, and I mentioned to him \"not even to me\". A few days after that while teaching was still going on, I told him to release his passphrase to me that I needed to check up something on his wallet. The dude did! I laughed him to scorn. He learnt his lesson after that. He said he was embarrassed by his compliance.",

It was for that sole reason of never trusting his seedphrase to anyone that I tempted him with myself (whom he felt wouldn't do any wrong)😂. I can be a prankster when I choose to be lively.
