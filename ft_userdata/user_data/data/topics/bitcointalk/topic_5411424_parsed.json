      "body": "I guess I'll be invited if the review is good. I know that there are a lot of gambling platforms that do paid reviews every now and then but it is one of the most reliable ways to know whether the platform is up to a certain standard or not. Even if the review is quite rigged to the benefit of the casino, you'll still encounter a lot of reviews that goes the other way, and is completely blunt, honest, and true in a lot of aspects. These reviews easily gives you a sneak peek of what to expect on the platform, and that is something important to me if I'm looking to change places for my weekend gambling habits.",

Since it tackles everything about the casino and how the casino interacts with its player.  It is also worth noting all the information on the review sites since it can give us a hint on the possible experience we may have about the reviewed casino.  There may be rigged reviews out there but we can also find sites that give honor to their works and signing under these honest review sites is a gesture of thanking them for the effort to bring us information about the casino.",

After I choose suitable casinos based on the reviews, I will register in order to either get a good welcome bonus right away or an accumulative bonus - rakeback. It's hard to say which path I would take (you need to look at specific numbers) but rakeback seems to be the most profitable thing.",

Signatures like this are mostly something like ads, they just inform us, the consumers of the existence of that specific service, company, or business, they don't really state anything about how it works, is it trusted, is it worth it stuff like that. Reviews on the other hand state the personal experience of users which is rather reliable, even if we do consider how there are paid reviews since you can cross-reference the casino reviews from multiple sources.",

Of course it's more advised to have a rakeback promoter as referrer, but you have to be focused on that purpose since the beginning, otherwise only after you create your account through another links you will notice there is that possibility, and then it's too late, because if you attempt to create a second account to get rakeback you may be flagged as multi account or cheater.",

If the rakeback does not interest me with its size, then I would rather join via a direct link.",
