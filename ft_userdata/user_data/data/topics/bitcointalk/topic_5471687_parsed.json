Some people were expecting the same contest again, but I am not sure if ChiBitCTy has any plans to organize the contest this year. Last time, he created the contest thread in the first week of October month. But this is the last week of this month. So, I guess there is no contest for this year. I don't know if ChiBitCTy has spoken out anything regarding this.",

Anything that has to do with free money will attract scumbags who won't respect the rules -- that's just how its always been, long before bitcoin.",

There would be fewer such participants if a maximum of 3–4 accounts could be registered from one IP address.Now we will observe how the transfer of merit will be carried out between failed pumpkin carvers.",
