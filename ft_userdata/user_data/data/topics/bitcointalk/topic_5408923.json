Which looks like the best way for a derivativesGoing of the word \"derivatives\" do you mean hierarchical determination (HD) wallets as a backup instead of using individual public-private key pairs? The difference here is an antire wallet can be store on a piece of paper/ahead of its use which can be used as a full backup without any risk of losing funds/keys because you've not backed up since your keypool got full/didn't print that private key.There's also an argument for error reduction in HD wallets as writing down a nmemonic makes mistakes easier to find (electrum is a good example of how this can be done as you can select words as you type them so you'll know a lot of the time if something's written down wrong).",

Definitely less than 1 in 16^2.You have 1:16^2 chances to get:Code:00xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAnd 1:16^2 chances to get:Code:x00xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAnd it goes on, and on. I'm not a mathematician, but let's say we want to find the chances of getting either of the first two cases. I presume that would be a 2:16^2, or 1 in (16^2)/2, which means 1 in 128.To make sure it's correct, I'll calculate thousands of hashes and see how frequent the appearance of 00x... and x00... is. I just wrote this small node.js code that does what I said:Code:const crypto = require('crypto'),hash = crypto.getHashes();var times = 0;for(var i=1; i<128001; i++){ hashPwd = crypto.createHash('sha256')  ¬† ¬†.update(i.toString())  ¬† ¬†.digest('hex'); var first_and_second = hashPwd.slice(0, 2); var second_and_third = hashPwd.slice(1, 3);  if(first_and_second == \"00\"){  times += 1; } if(second_and_third == \"00\"){  times += 1; } }console.log(\"times: \" + times);It returns me \"times: 991\" for 128,000 hashes, and I expected about 1,000. So, I assume I'm correct. If you increase the number of hashes to millions, it becomes even more accurate. Back to your question. \"00\" can appear in 63 positions. This means you have 63:16^2 chances, or 63 in 256, which is ~24.6%. This new code checks for \"00\" in any position. We should get it ~24.6% of our times. ¬†Code:const crypto = require('crypto'),hash = crypto.getHashes();var times = 0;for(var i=1; i<1000001; i++){ hashPwd = crypto.createHash('sha256')  ¬† ¬†.update(i.toString())  ¬† ¬†.digest('hex');  ¬† ¬†if(hashPwd.includes(\"00\")){  ¬† ¬† let count = (hashPwd.match(/00/g) || []).length;  ¬† ¬† times+=count;  ¬† ¬†}}console.log(\"times: \" + times);It returned me 231570.",
