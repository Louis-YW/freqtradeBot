Human beings have become so reliant on FIAT that it's difficult for them to trust other payment systems easily.Also, the many governments actively warn their citizens to avoid investing in them which instills fear and spreads negativity related to cryptocurrencies.However, this is changing with time since more and more people are investing in the crypto world since they are able to see past all this negativity which is a good thing.",

This also means bashing crypto, which they may see as competition.Then: crypto is difficult to understand for economists. It's not that straightforward (for them) why crypto (and especially bitcoin) holds value, and, even more, that value tends to increase over time.Also crypto is rather technical. Heads of governments and central banks are far from young and they don't understand the technical details and also fear them.Even more, commercial banks have noticed that crypto can do easily and cheap various things they were doing slow and expensive. That means less revenues for them. So they most probably have done some lobbying against crypto.Good enough for a quick list?",

That's where it's rooted and I don't think that they're still too many of them. Majority are not speaking but there are those that have already spoken and they're for the support of it. What I'm seeing with the constant defamation are coming from the economists and financial experts and you understand it why. Because crypto is against to their traditional business.",

Cryptocurrency is about financial Independence and freedom of use separate from third party. If government is to protect the public they need to know what the public is doing but in terms of financial Independence, blockchain doesn't allow for that third party interference which is the government. This is a major reason for the defamation of crypto and effort is now on trying to make a regulation on it. This is the centralized and decentralised issue running in the system.",

Bitcoin is an interruption against governments fiat currencies and many “powerful” people often have interests in banks and other similar institutions that bitcoin goes against.",

Those business do generate money and interest to the owners as even there alternative source of income or main income. They will defame bitcoin for their selfish purpose.",

Cryptocurrency has been associated with terror financing and tax evasion, even if we know that fiat currency has been used for the same too, but the point that bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous and often it is the only currency being accepted by Ransomware hackers, it started to have more of a negative impact in public. Not being able to see who is sending or receiving builds a sense of suspicion among the person being told about the same. To them it appears as is the parties involved in a transaction have something to hide. This is a side-effect of the system that bitcoin has, not something we can help much. Of course personal experience reduces this suspicion by a lot, but reaching that level requires time.I will no say that governments defame crypto, it is the choice of the listener to determine whether a statement is defamation or just a warning.",
