And also instilled the values of what you've learned here in the forum and in your wider community, in order to make Satoshi Nakamoto proud of his investment and the goal he wished to achieve. I'm sure you can write a whole book about bitcoin now, lol. I congratulate you once more for this achievement.",

BTW, I think there is not that many forums which shows how much time you spent on it. I never paid much attention how much time I spent (or sometimes wasted) here. Now it's almost 148 days.Quote from: Mahirap on December 15, 2022, 08:53:17 PMWhat a journey! This must be an incredible achievement, investing so many times of your life in something. Members like you make this forum what it is today, keep going. I think it's not needed to overstimate such achievement. It's nice thing, but not same like making x number of posts or getting like 1000 merit for example. Not about OP, but it's easy to achieve such thing without doing anything, you just need to keep your browser tab with Bitcointalk open. There is some accounts there with more than 20 000 days logged in and 0 posts. Offcourse, they're bots, it's not possible for real human to achieve such things - after all, 20k days is more than 50 years.",

I have known collectibles in bitcoin, I have found essential guides to juggle in this sector, I found new points of view that opened my mind and allowed me to talk to friends who are thousands of kilometers away but thanks to the forum and this passion, seems really close to me.Last but not least, it was also essential to get to know so many enthusiasts of this sector and in some cases to have been able to meet them even in live meetings here in Italy.Among my friends/family, no one is able to speak a minimum of the subject with \"knowledge of the facts\". It's frustrating  because if you want to talk about this argument, have some questions or doubts or requests for clarification, I can only use the forum (please note I don't use social network  ).There is no toll-free number to call for details on how to use open source software or anything else, we have the forum which remains as a point of reference. I tried to give back what I got. I have always found it essential to also offer support to other users by writing guides, giving advice, explaining scams and so on.I hope that other users are able to live this experience and have the same passion using the forum.",

I haven't even had my 20 days total active since 2017, but this total active time will only grow if I stay interested in this forum.For you, since you've been spending a lot of time on bitcointalk, I hope you do get a good return.

Plus, don't get me wrong popularity does still play a factor in that. I think certain users have a real conscious way of distributing merit, while others are much more casual about it. Both are fine, since that's what creates the diversity to allow users to rank up. I don't know what theymos' thought process was, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was a last ditch effort to shore up the forum, before the removal of signature campaigns all together, because they definitely do contribute a massive factor to the spam problem. I know theymos has previously stated he quite likes the idea of a sub economy on the forum, and I'd probably agree. However, there's a certain point where it becomes more detrimental, than positive. I do think that the merit system has, and still is correcting the large amount of problems we had before.",

Though, as said above, it have some downsides. Reaching x number of posts can be relatively easy, but still, it requires more or less eforts. While basically to reach 100, 200 or 500 days  while being logged in is enoughto keep tab with Bitcointalk open on your browser without doing anything.You have very good point about community awards shows who contributed most in different ways, but at the same time it's also popularity contest.",
