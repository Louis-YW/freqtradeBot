However, many argue for Altcoins, especially the newer projects, that they can experience rapid price growth, providing the potential opportunity for significant investment ROI and I'm also surprised it has always been able to attract so much interest from both investors and developers.",

What's your skills and opinion?  Most altcoins are best for short term and a few might be considered good for long term. But that's where the debate starts because everyone has their own taste of altcoins.Many are the ones that looks at it as their ticket to lottery and likely to give them the best profits that they can think of for a very short period of time. But little did they know, that's gonna butcher them when the altcoin they've chosen is mostly a pump and dump.",

How many people would be able to afford owning a single unit of Bitcoin. Altcoins came into play and the market was open for new projects and thousands of Altcoins was introduced. Lot of people have made more money from Altcoins than Bitcoin, it has given Bitcoin the run of its life. The best thing that happened to the crypto market space is the introduction of Altcoins every single day.",

But the question is, have altcoins done more good than harm to the crypto ecosystem? For every thousand investors and new crypto enthusiasts that altcoins have brought in, how many have they disgusted with scams, rug pulls and other shenanigans?They're important, because they represent a huge financial volume. But for me, their greatest quality is to demonstrate day after day how solid, useful and self-sufficient Bitcoin is. I can't even count the number of messages I've read on the internet saying: \"I got into cryptos for a get-rich-quick scheme with some altcoins, after failures and disappointments I'm now all-in BTC\". Many don't understand how altcoins work. Those who make money, make altcoins useful because they earn profit with them, those who lose money, make them useful because sometimes it directs them to BTC.It's nuanced, as always, ETH is not a stupid memecoin, and don't offer the same possibilities. So I think some alts can be important, while others are just losses for everyone (except for their dubious developers who get rich on the backs of investors, examples are numerous on the BSC chain).",

That may be some of the benefits of altcoin and competition in the network.With an alternative coin language, which is an option where you can benefit from other coin investments besides Bitcoin, or we can call diversification.For a lot of altcoin who died or scam, I think it is a fact that cannot be changed, but to avoid coins like that depending on how you analyze the project, with the meaning that you cannot punish altcoin as a scam, because we see in the market many altcoin which provides benefits to the investor, but if it is intended for the long term you must really think about it again",

What's your skills and opinion?  Altcoin is not a single coin, its a term used for every cryptocurrencies apart from bitcoin so even if 50% of market dominance under bitcoin still there is room for another 50% that is the factor drives the investors to make money apart from bitcoin. Investing on cheap coin can go as complete loss or can give 100x returns in very short term.",

Maybe there are some who wants to show their support towards the project thru holding their coin, but most are because of profit. Scam, and death are more likely to happen in new projects, but for the projects that are out there for years already, the chances of it to be either scam or dead project is way lesser than that of new projects.Quote from: Jocuserious on July 04, 2023, 09:08:03 AMMy opinion buy dip and sold faster on some profits like to be best revenge for all altcoins investors! What's your skills and opinion?  That's very easy to say, but the question is can you do it in real time?It's easy to say \"buy the dip\", or \"sell on top\" etc. but the reality is you don't know when it will happen, and by the time it happens, you might lost your patience already and bought at a wrong time. As for me, I don't have any skills at all. I just invest, and hold it for long term. I don't know TBH if I have skills that would've help me in investing. As for my opinion, there are some altcoins out there who are important still. Bitcoin isn't a one size fits all type of cryptocurrency where it all has the good features already, and that's where altcoins shine. There are some altcoins out there who are covering what Bitcoin can't do. For ex. transaction speed. Bitcoin's transaction speed is slow that's why we are seeing altcoins that has a faster transaction speed as an alternative coin to be used when transacting.",

What's your skills and opinion?  For profitability reason. And don't generalize all of it since there are good altcoins to hold, its just those newly created altcoins do that public sale,exchane listing then dump and turn scam. We need to avoid such scheme so its better sell fast than selling late then dump it up even if we already lose at 95% in value. If we don't want this to happen we can also try to hold bitcoins since this could give us much better pace than any other alts out there.",

We can think it's all useless, but let's keep in mind such altcoins allowed many professionals to acquire more experience and practice their programming skills.Meanwhile, other altcoins are important tokens inside determined platforms. They are what we call native tokens, which guarantee additional benefits for holders inside an exchange, casino or investment platform. Altcoins are also assets with rewarding potential. So, they shouldn't be neglected. We just have to be careful selecting the worthful ones and despising the worthless scammy ones.",

What's your skills and opinion?  I am a pretty small investor even for crypto standards i would guess therefore i have so far not invested a single dollar into Bitcoin because i just don't think that we will see another 10x or even more from here on out because Bitcoin already made a x20000 or even more since it was introduced and i just dislike the fact to invest into something where others made a fortune with. So i would say it all depends on the goals that you want to achieve with your investment.If you want to be as safe as possible with your investment into crypto, then i think Bitcoin is still the best project to invest in.If you want a chance for potentially higher profits then you should invest into alcoins in my opinions. Not in stupid meme-coins but in good altcoins.",

What's your skills and opinion?  ETH is an altcoin. I hope you know that? So, do you still have that generalization of how shitty altcoins are? Well, imagine all the tokens and even coins that were (and are still) birthed through the ETH contract which has deepened this cryptocurrency industry. Without ETH, this industry wouldn't have gone this competitive. Yes, I know many will argue that the preponderance of altcoins paved way for the many cases of scam in the industry. That's not entirely true. Left with only Bitcoin, I'm cocksure scam in the industry will still exist.Again, I can bet you that many of those who bad mouth altcoins still have them in their wallets. Altcoins aren't that bad to invest in. It's just that investors should be meticulous while picking ones to invest in. On the short run, altcoins give better ROI than Bitcoin and I guess that's why they keep attracting investments.",
