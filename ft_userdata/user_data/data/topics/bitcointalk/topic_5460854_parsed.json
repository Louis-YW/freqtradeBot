In no time if care isn't taken enough you might not know when you have moved from #100 limit in a week to $1000.This idea of deposit limit can only work for those gambler's with core discipline with their spending and not for a loss chaser gambler.",

Limiting the deposit amount will lessen the losses, especially for those who play every day and like spending more at each bet while aiming for the jackpot shots. I see gamblers who spend a lot of time in casino games that have a betting minimum of $0.01 so $100 will keep him busy for 10000 bets, that's if he loses in a long streak which I doubt happens. Right now, that is my strategy, waiting for the jackpot to hit while betting less, but it sure does take a lot of time before profits can be made. It's not a recommended type of strategy for those who don't have patience.",

      "body": "There are deposit limits, and that is what the casino has stated. However, they are not our mothers or drill instructors who would tell us what to do and what not to do. They simply inform us that as gamblers, we have the option to set limits on our deposits for either a 24-hour, 7-day, or 30-day period. Additionally, they provide another option to increase the limit, but you must wait for a 24-hour period, which should be enough time for any sensible and responsible gambler to reconsider. I want to believe that there is also an option to cancel the increased limit in case of a change of mind.No matter what, they have left us with a choice. They are not to be blamed for someone becoming an addict, and I do not see anything shady about them. Every gambler must take responsibility for their habit and not shift the blame to the casinos.",

Nah, and it's also adjustable, it's good though but been disciplined doesn't end with daily limit availability on online casinos, gambling rsponbile starts within the gamblers themselves.Casinos trying to help? Well thank you but it's still about the money, about the gambler's losses.Learn to be disciplined from within and not through anything else, gamble responsible using your very own strategy, it's not hard unless you made it seem so, get used to using what you can only afford to lose.",

If a person cannot control his finances to gamble, he should not gamble or approach gambling. Many people have lost a lot of money from gambling so they don't need to follow it and it's better to find other entertainment. Self-discipline is needed in gambling, including having the self-discipline to limit his money and time to gamble to how many times a week he can gamble. If he has good self-discipline, he will not get addicted to gambling because he can take good care of himself while gambling.",

      "body": "It would be very helpful if the casino set a deposit limit change not only to 24 hours but a week because it means that players will have to wait longer to be able to make a deposit again if they have reached the limit they have set, but I think the casino will not be willing to apply a longer time because they are worried that the players will go to another casino because they feel that this arrangement prevents them from continuing to channel their desire to gamble at any time with any amount of money.It seems that this kind of feature will never be used by small gamblers because they already have a limit on their funds even though there is an opportunity to use borrowed money, but gamblers who can still control themselves will stay at the limit and will not try to fulfill their desire to play in a way that can harm them such as borrowing or using money that is not supposed to be for gambling, so self-control will be very necessary if you want to keep playing and never put our finances at risk.",

I think it's a really good idea if a gambling platform wants to help gamblers limit deposits and do that, but still it all comes down to the gambler's own decision, because if the gambler still doesn't want to limit it, it's the same as the gambling platform can't hold them back. it is difficult to control addicts, especially if addicts do not have the desire to stop themselves, of course, it is rather difficult to stop themYes, even though this method can help reduce gambler addiction, it will not be possible to fully work easily, everything returns to oneself by limiting daily or weekly deposit limits, to be honest, I don't need this because I can already limit my weekly deposit for gambling, but maybe it will be useful for those who really want to reduce losses in gambling.",

If I am to go for such a feature I will likely will if stake.com should offer such,  I will limit my deposit for up to 30 days and that should be ok in the end and if I may likely change the limit amount for deposits,  I will likely decrease it on a monthly bases until I don't have to deposits any more,  what I will do is to leave a small amount on my balance in the casino after each winning,  doing so,  I won't have to make new deposits at each point. Nice to have you bring this here,  and as an addition to the ops please include the casino that already has the features in place because we have some members who will love to try this out.",

However,the gamblers that will always benefit from this are those gamblers that have self-control over their gambling activities, but an addict will increase till the amount gets to $1000 for his/her daily limits.

At least the casino tried doing initiative like this on possibly stoping gamblers from over spending on their casino which usually casino don't care on how much gamblers spend in their casino, as casino earns mainly from them. We all have our own lives and people that have a gambling addiction can only control themselves, atleast with this feature, they should be aware of the overspending they could do in the casino.",

I know someone, I will say that his local wallet has a limit (fiat wallet), for deposit and withdrawal. So if he reach that limit he can't used his wallet anymore and will have to wait for the 1st day of the month to reset everything. However, if he wanted to gamble and play, he will simply borrow someone's wallet and continue to play. My point is that still boils down to self control, whether we take advantage of deposit limit or not, still up to us. Because if we wanted to, we might think of ways to still continue to play per day even if we have reach our limits.",
