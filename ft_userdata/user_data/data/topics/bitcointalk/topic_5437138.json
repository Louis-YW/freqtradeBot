  "content": "UPDATE : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5437138.msg61692069#msg61692069Hello everyone,Recently, a newbie did a BTC giveaway. Unfortunately, the member in question never sent the funds to the winner.(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5435424.0)I found this frustrating and a shame, because little giveaways like this are fun, and help to keep a good atmosphere on the forum.So I suggest you to organize giveaways, fair, transparent and fun To avoid abuse, here are some basic rules:-I will ask a respected and active member for a long time here to do the draw, even if bitmover made a good tool, I prefer to organize the giveaway and leave the draw to a former member with a strong reputation (if there is a volunteer please leave me a PM)-Accounts with 5 or less merits can't participate-I will make regular giveaways with dusts converted to BTC For more transparency, here is the address where the funds for the winner will come from: 1Luck1xjq1WgHPG3Ew2LG7ohinza399yr6https://mempool.space/fr/address/1Luck1xjq1WgHPG3Ew2LG7ohinza399yr6I want to mention that I don't do this to farm merit. I just like the mood of this kind of games / gamblings. The amount doesn't need to be crazy high to have a fun game. ___ROUND #1As you can the on the wallet's balance, I will start with a ‎0.00061600 BTC giveaway.If you want to participate, you will need to reply with your username + BTC address.You can participate until the 1st of February 10:00 am UTCExample :Code:Username : genesis-blockBTC addy : 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNaGood luck",
