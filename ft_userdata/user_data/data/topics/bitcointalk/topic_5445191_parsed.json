  "content": "1- Who am I? Hello, I don't really want to introduce myself as an individual. In the crypto world, it doesn't matter who you are personally! It's your thoughts and contributions to society that matter. Yes, the most important thing that makes you who you are and turns you into a nameless hero is your contributions to society. Just like SATOSHI. But in summary, I can describe myself as follows: I am a construction worker, I don't have any higher education, not even education that is considered bad in countries like Europe or India due to the poor education conditions in my country, and I have no knowledge of software. However, I have a self-improving nature and constantly think about how I can contribute to people's lives and my own life. How do I do this? By doing the best I can in whatever job I do! Yes, you can make a positive contribution to people and your own life by doing the best you can in your job! Because what I do is important! Because when I finish my work, people are able to keep their most important things such as their lives, families, and possessions safe in the buildings I construct. So, I help them keep their most important things safe, with trust and peace! So, I love my job and working. But there is a problem! People are not aware of this truth and I have the worst living conditions! I am the other person in society! I am an unskilled and despised section of society! Unfortunately, my salary (we can't get paid from many places because we are being scammed) is not enough to live with human values! Yes, HUMAN VALUES! Did you know that I am 38 years old and still single? The reason? Because I am afraid of finances and the future! Because I cannot offer a humane life to the community that I call my family! In fact, because of the poor conditions in my country, I even have trouble providing for myself, no matter how hard I work. Yes, unfortunately, I am afraid of these things. But I have hope in Bitcoin...2- Bitcoin!If we were to define it in a classic way: decentralized peer-to-peer currency transfer! How simple and straightforward is that? Not scary at all (for governments) and seemingly powerless! Just a simple method! How much could such a simple system with a supply of 21 million change things?Yes, people who knew about it had this idea exactly ten years ago. They even labeled it as fraud and Ponzi scheme! They called it something used for money laundering and dirty business! Yes, people who didn't know what it was talked about Bitcoin as if it were something that existed! But in this decade, the \"thing\" label has been replaced by the title of \"future gold\"!So, how did this happen? What happened? How did Bitcoin gain so much value and strengthen itself to such an extent that it continues to grow and increase in power? How does it achieve this?Do you know that Bitcoin hasn't really done or accomplished anything? It has simply continued to work in a decentralized, stable, and trustworthy manner since its inception. And we admire and appreciate it for this standard function, and give it both material and spiritual value! (DESERVES IT!)Actually, when the terms TRUST and WORK, which should be in people, are found in a code line (Bitcoin), this result emerges. A code sequence whose creator is unknown... Our hero named Satoshi and his country, America! (You must be in darkness to reach the light.)3- America! In my country, and realistically speaking, America is seen as a den of evil in many countries around the world, specifically the U.S. government, not the American people! With its advanced technology, it is a state structure that poses the risk of destroying the world for its own interests. Just like the governments of Russia and China or European countries! This may sound a bit political to you, but we need to speak honestly and truthfully! Ultimately, everything can be solved through dialogue and discussion! Their desire to control and manage everything is consuming us as human beings. There is a saying in my country: when elephants fight, the grass is trampled! While they fight, the conditions of life for those of us who have fallen into our own life troubles become even more difficult! So, can they use this desired control power well? Absolutely not! When Bitcoin was first invented, the U.S. government went bankrupt, and its money turned into a piece of paper! That is why Bitcoin was invented. In short, a government that is driven by the desire to control everything could not even control its own economy and money! As a result, it failed! It eventually recovered after a while, but today, on March 16, 2023, it is facing the same scenario again, with three of its banks having gone bankrupt. China is a closed box, but occasionally leaked image-supported news reports suggest that they are in the same situation. So, their selfish attitudes will once again bring them to a point of self-destruction. The motto that applies to every wrongdoer is applicable to them too! Anger and resentment! Let's get back to our topic, which will now turn to politics! What about companies?4- States, Corporations, and Crypto!States create their own whips to govern societies, and one of these whips is corporations. They are given a specific amount to serve a certain segment of society! In my country, we call this minimum wage! ðŸ˜Š This amount only ensures their survival! Unfortunately, in many countries, the state mechanism is run in this way, except for economically and culturally developed countries. The goal is to survive with the money you earn!However, they keep a large portion of the money under their own control and put it in their safes. Despite our hard work and development, they grow their own treasures. Because they don't want money to get into the hands of the public! If more money than they want or the amount they determined passes into the hands of the public, then they cannot enforce their will. They also cannot protect a portion of the society that they cannot control.Just like in the Bitcoin community! What I want to say and do here is not to rebel and move towards anarchy! Of course, a country and government must exist because if there is no control mechanism, societies can destroy themselves! Just like in the Amazon rainforests or the Ilker tribes living in certain parts of Africa! However, the world is advancing, opportunities and life are expanding! When I see the beauty of a corner of the world on my phone today, I want to experience it there in person! And then I want to continue with my work and life! I still want to work, but also want to live like a human being! I want to secure myself and my family economically and live without worrying about the future! That's why we need to eliminate the whip of the state, that is, the centralized system-based corporation whip!...5- Problem with Money! Yes, we have a big weakness among us who are being whipped under the company lash - money! More precisely, more money... the belief that a large sum of money can instantly change everything! Governments, companies, and casinos, among others, are aware of and exploiting this weakness of ours. But I have some sad news for you! Our weakness has a new enemy - centralized exchanges and altcoins! Many of us work for months to earn money (if we can save any) and then seek ways to invest it (which is our natural right). However, in the process, we succumb to our greed and take huge risks in our desperation to get out of our current lives as soon as possible! And we place our hopes on these risks! Unfortunately, these risks lead to disappointment! The issue becomes a bit convoluted here, and I don't know how to explain it to you in a way that you will understand. At the same time, I don't want to break your hopes and dreams! However, we need to examine the facts and see the risks clearly and direct ourselves accordingly. But if you want to increase your money by a hundred or a thousand times instantly, please gamble! At least you know the outcome, either you win or lose. However, if you want to grow your money faster and more consciously than the current traditional interest systems, and want to have control and protection, buy BITCOIN. But remember, nothing grows instantly; time and patience are required! Be careful, it's not altcoins! It's BITCOIN! Because 98% of altcoins are nothing more than a tool for fraud!6- Altcoins!When Bitcoin first emerged, it told us one simple thing: a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system. It was straightforward and plain, and it has delivered on its promise flawlessly. This is why people trust Bitcoin and invest in it.Bitcoin did not promise to make us rich like the owners of shit coins do. It did not send rocket emojis or say we are going to the moon. It did not present itself like industrial coins that promise to send rockets into space, be used on sim-cardless phones, create the world's fastest computer, or become a payment method for well-known brands. Nor did it make any structural promises like saying it could scale to a certain level.The only thing it said was that it is a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system. And it has delivered on that promise brilliantly.In contrast, some people who define this sector as an industry have created centralized exchanges to list coins and tokens that make empty promises. These exchanges are facilitating people's scams.7- Centralized exchanges, fake Bitcoin, and altcoins!! When a coin owner says, \"I'm going to send a rocket to space,\" no exchange says, \"Okay, send your rocket first, then come back.\" Or when a coin owner says, \"We'll build the fastest computer in the world,\" no exchange says, \"Okay, build your computer first, then come back.\" Because they knew that these promises were just empty lies, and they knew it better than we did. But instead of standing up to them, they allowed people to invest in their empty promises!They listed any coin and token that made even the slightest promise! Becausethey were like shopkeepers, and the more diverse products they had, the more money they would make! And this wasn't enough for them. They sold these empty tokens and coins beyond their supply! And they did this for Bitcoin too! Unfortunately, they went even further and turned these empty coins and tokens into a gambling table by introducing a leverage system! And they ruthlessly stripped people of their money!However, there was a problem with making money with money that they couldn't calculate! Especially forgetting that they were dealing with a section of people who would definitely find the money to buy hope!Yes, they sold people empty coins that they didn't have, and the values of these coins and tokens increased more than they anticipated due to the volume that they did not account for! They used the Fed speculation and the collapse of fraudulent markets and Luna as an opportunity to try to lower the values of these coins and tokens with the last fall, but it didn't go as they planned for most of them! On the contrary, when people began to withdraw the coins and tokens they bought to their wallets, things started to get out of control!So, where does Bitcoin stand in all of this? The Bitcoin price is the leader of the whole market, and a 10% increase in its price reflects as 100% or more in many coins and tokens. And when you enter the leverage system, things get even more complicated! There is a liquidity crisis.They are trying to overcome this problem in the following ways: 1- Gradually raising and lowering the Bitcoin price to liquidate leveraged positions! 2- Trying to hold cash with outrageous interest rates. 3- As a last resort, delisting.Even the most trusted exchanges fell into the pit they dug, and unfortunately, they will take us, the working class who are investors, with them.I would like to conclude my words as follows. Frankly, I am not against the altcoin world because every new idea will pave the way for a new one. But as long as they prove what they say...So, do you have a solution to this problem? Yes, I do...",
