  "content": "Hello guys, the final countdown is near for the $CORE release but at the same time are a lot of things to be aware of or be really careful about.First, there are a lot of Core Dao Twitter accounts that are fake and promoting airdrops or/and a pancakeswap fake $CORE. Obviously, this is a scam, this and any other that can be released before the 08/02Second, some users are spreading misinformation (more for ignorance I guess) about a Core DAO token that is 1 USD. Well that toke is not a scam but also is not THE Core we are waiting for, that ticker is full $COREDAO, and is this one https://www.coingecko.com/es/monedas/coredao. Is not on MEXC but some people are funding the project with another one.Third, There are two more CORE tokens with the \"same\" Ticker. One is Coreum that on MEXC is already changed but in the dextools are not. The other one is $CORE from Cvaultfinance which is only available on Uniswap and, again, is not core.To end this post I put separately the tokens that can be confused for the $CORE dao coinCORE dao (the anticipated one with the satoshi plus consensus) https://www.coingecko.com/es/monedas/core-daoCOREDAO, a problematic token if we search the above one https://www.coingecko.com/es/monedas/coredaoCvaultfinance, a DEFI with a very low supply.https://www.coingecko.com/es/monedas/cvault-financeThe Future is crypto, and take care!",
