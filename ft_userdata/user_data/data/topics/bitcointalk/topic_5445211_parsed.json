      "body": "Hello, Thank you for your feedback!  QuoteI think you need to work with the marketing team to write a good ANN topic or at least add an infographic. Yes, our marketing team is going to refine our ANN topic in near future. QuoteThe site asks me to leave an evaluation, but isn't it better to leave the evaluation through a third party that you do not control?I must clarify that we don't ask our customers to leave an evaluation on our website. What we ask is leaving review of our service on platforms where we are represented, so our customer can get a bonus. QuoteYou have many positive reviews on trustpilot[1], but most of them were during the last three months.Recently we started to give bonuses, so we can get a proper reviews of our website. Sometimes we also offer giveaways. And one of conditions to participating in it can be leaving a review of our service.QuoteThe maximum amount of bitcoins that can be transferred is 120 bitcoins, which is a lot to ask without KYC, how did you manage it?Not many customers are ready to exchange this amount of btc without contacting our support team. In such cases, we advise splitting the amount and exchanging it in several parts. But if the customer sends such amount, we are able to complete this order. All incoming transactions should pass AML system, and if it's ok, we execute an exchange without hesitation.QuoteI guess you need to consider listing your site with Best_change. They list crypto exchanges like your ones.Yep, this is one of the best platforms for such services as ours, and we are definitely considering listing on Best_change. But we would like to go further. For example, we almost complete our integration with SwapSpace.",
