  "content": "QuoteDuring the bill’s review phase, the House of Lords agreed on certain amendments to clarify its intent of targeting monetary proceeds from fraud or other financial crimes.A bill that aims to expand the ability of authorities in the United Kindom to target illicit cryptocurrency usage has been pushed to the final stages for approval by the House of Lords. The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill was introduced in September 2022 and primarily aims to tackle crypto-related financial crimes. Over the past year, the bill went from the House of Commons to the House of Lords and is now in the final stages of approval.During the review, the House of Lords agreed on certain amendments to clarify its intent of targeting monetary proceeds from fraud or other financial crimes. In addition, the bill also aims to set provisions for corporate transparency and overseas business registrations.At the final stage, the House of Commons will either decide to accept the proposed amendments or recommend changes to the bill. Following the approval, the bill will be signed into law through royal assent, a method by which a monarch formally approves an act of the legislature.Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/house-of-lords-crypto-bill-uk                                    This is an image showing the progress of the draft economic crime and corporate transparency law.Source: bills.parliament.ukLet's discuss the potential negatives and positives of this law:On the positive side, the law targeting stolen cryptocurrencies will help track cryptocurrencies stolen from central exchanges and return them to their owners. As we hear now, the value of the amounts stolen from CoinEX has reached more than $70 million. Such a law will be very useful in such cases.As for the negative aspects, I fear that the law will be abused to impose more stringent measures and violate users’ privacy.what do you think?",

On the other hand, a clear law can also help people judge whether a law enforcement process is being abused or not, although I doubt this applies to the new law since there is no tool to monitor the process easily. At the end of the day, I don't see how it can improve user's ability to recover their stolen funds from criminal activity. I can see why though, probably because the government doesn't want people to scam them too. But yeah, the best thing to do is be careful and prevent yourself from using scammy services or falling for a scam easily.",

But yeah, the best thing to do is be careful and prevent yourself from using scammy services or falling for a scam easily.It would be more correct to say, “Prevent yourself from using central services.”Because the problem is not in the use of fraudulent services, the problem is in the use of central services in the first place. There are many central platforms that are legally licensed, but they were hacked and people’s money was stolen. Recently, the CoinEx platform was hacked and more than $70 million was stolen, and yesterday the HTX exchange was hacked and $8 million was stolen as well.How will the new law protect these people who have been robbed? The hacker will resort to Non-KYC DEXs or the deep web to dispose of the stolen coins, and even if the police are able to pursue him and confiscate the money, investigations will begin into the sources of the users’ funds and most likely they will be confiscated.Therefore, in my opinion, this law is impractical on the ground and will not benefit users, but of course it will be useful to the government.",

The mission is to force everyone to the centralized system (CEXs), where everyone would be able to complete KYC, be effectively monitored and tasked. There will be a law prohibiting the use and existence of DEXs in order to complement the stolen crypto bill.
