Can we expect at least 1$ value in this coin? As I can see there will be very big movements because this project is making hype in twitter because of their airdrop phases. As the coin will be newly listed, there will be high volume and price movements. It opens with high price first, then finds equilibrium. Airdrop recipients will naturally want to sell it. Volume remains high until these trades are finished. As for the project, I don't think it will survive in the long run. When the hype ends, this will be one of the forgotten tokens. It's similar to dot-com bubble, with a web3 sauce.",

It depends on Binance's level of support in pumping up the price of newly listed tokens on the exchange. But is it true that the token has support from Binance? The transaction doesn't appear to have taken place from their smart contract yet, so that makes absolutely no sense at $1. Is this also part of the promotion?",

Another hype token actually, but for sure it will rise because its a good project as well, just don't expect for its listing price to pump that much because for sure many will sell it and take profit. If they are able to survive such selling pressure then it can be good. If you get this from an airdrop its good to take profit as much as possible. Didn't know much about its technology, but if you are planning to invest with Space ID, its better to understand its technology so you can know if they are just hyping this one or Space ID really have a good utility.",

This should not be just a hype, and Space ID should deliver as promised. I can see this as a good one, Binance supported the listing can already tell you about how good it is, so if you are going to invest just analyze more. The price might start to dump though due to listing pressure, expect this during the first week.",

The problem that I find is that each project is tapping into different areas, and in terms of expectations, I think both will receive a strong response from everyone.I speculate that ID will be priced around $0.5, but not too sure that it will be pumped strongly right from the listing.",

I'm pretty confident with the ROI from the launchpad on binance, so looking at the TGE of the ID I think the $1 target is quite possible. At the moment, they are receiving positive signals for development, so I am not too surprised with the large community supporting the project. This airdrop of the project is also very much looking forward to, I think everyone will be satisfied with the ID airdrop.",

It will gonna be a disaster once the other investors will only buy that token when it is first listed and it has a tendency to not recover from that. if you get your token from airdrop, it's not bad to sell it all once it gets listed at least you don't have any capital from that. the only problem here is the new investors that wanted to buy that token once it gets listed and surely it will be a suicide investment only people that have been doing this kinda stuff for a while will take advantage of this scenario and so it's better for the newbie to not get on the hype because they might be the one who will take the damage if the project will fall.",

I'm upset because failed to commit any BNB for this round at Binance. It's always exciting when Binance Launchpad announces a new token, and the hype is definitely acknowledgeable. Space ID token will be available for trading very soon. While I can't guarantee anything, though it's not impossible for the coin to reach a value of $1.Personally, I wouldn't consider myself overly bullish on the token just yet, but I have to admit that it has shown some promising signs. If you're not comfortable taking too much risk, then going for a short position might be a wise decision.",

But of course we should see more action when the volalitity wears off since its on launch.  That price isnt impossible if bull run has arrived.But the project seems nice and well systematic.
