  "content": "Hi, everyone, I am a miner from China, I have a large number of T17+ and S17+, they often have the problem of temperature sensor reading failure, I want to get your helpI often encounter the problem that a certain computing power board reports that the temperature sensor fails, causing the board to fall off and fail to operateI found that the 17 series mining machine has two sensors, one is TMP451, the other is NCT218, and the operating voltage range of these two chips is not the same, the former is 1.7~3.6V, the latter is 1.4~2.75V, And when I use the maintenance mode of the third-party firmware, it will show the NCT218 chip when it is normal at the beginning of the test, and it will show the TMP451 chip when there is a problem and the temperature sensor is lost. I don’t know if there is any connection between them.",

The 17 series hosts do not only have a model of TMP451. Among the 17 series models I have encountered so far, there are at least NCT218 and TMP451 two models, I found through the detailed log of my third-party firmware that he will first read the register of the temperature sensor, then obtain the device type of the sensor, that is, the model of the sensor, and then read the temperature correctly, such as The sensor of NCT218 is on the PCBA, and when the firmware cannot read NCT218, it will default to the device model TMP451, and then when it continues, the firmware will report that the reading of the temperature sensor failedAfter analyzing the circuit diagram, I found that the temperature sensor has 4 wires connected to the corresponding power chip, which are SCL, SDA, TEMP_P, and TEMP_N. The BJT of the PNP transistor in the chip is read through the latter two signal wires. The temperature of the junction, and then the SDA transmits this data to the rx and TX on the ASIC chip through the I2C bus, and then transmits it to the PIC control chip, and then the PIC chip transmits it to the control board, and the temperature sensor is uploaded to the Whether the signal of the upper end machine is accurate or not becomes the key to whether the temperature sensor can correctly identify",

I even have the original circuit diagram. I have a headache for this damn temp-sensor problem. I agree with your point of view through analysis, it’s his mother There is a problem with the computing power chip, and there is a problem with the welding process of Century Cloud Core. They even sprinkled rosin solution on the 17 series computing power board and re-soldered it. Maybe the board you saw with UV glue is that batch.In addition, I am using HulkOS, and his logs are not the same as Bitmain’s official firmware. I don’t know how to upload attachments to this forum. It seems that it is not good to post large sections of logs.Try this to see if it can be opened. This is the log of the same machine. It is normal to read the temperature sensor as NCT218 at the beginning. If it cannot be read later, it will default to TMP451 and start reporting an error.http://m.qpic.cn/psc?/V53cp4R00xIcKH0EHAvf1OQprC2kRuqc/6tCTPh7N*X6CBkvkDvKlZW7IcKWUta.hnJDG0METJ90Ar0e6SMIWli43jVioiJGuwTqZ4ca3US4144ps1sKKAzUbfzWRp.UfSI4nkFNwh7w!/b&bo=OARSBAAAAAABJ2o!&rf=viewer_4&t=5http://m.qpic.cn/psc?/V53cp4R00xIcKH0EHAvf1OQprC2kRuqc/6tCTPh7N*X6CBkvkDvKlZTUWsnYdM4Opujj.8Vzl0orUyQ4gUKypHmsJHlflbPfZ0.AxuI4iaZom9zyEezL6eGY2xnfXoy*ztOCOijPtreo!/b&bo=UwQ4BAAAAAABJ2s!&rf=viewer_4&t=5",

It is currently in the public testing stage. This is the built-in maintenance mode of the firmware. It only supports testing one computing power board at a time, similar to the official maintenance fixture, so my log is only testing one computing power board, this board is a normal operating computing power boardWhen I was analyzing this problem, I kept trying to start the test program, and I often reproduced the problem that the temp_sensor could not be read. I analyzed the log and found that it would initially read the component model of the temp_sensor, and the hardware used was NCT218. , if it is read correctly, then he will work normally, if the identified component model is inaccurate or not read, then he will replace the identified model with the default TMP451, then he will not be able to calibrate Temp_sensor Get the correct parameters, resulting in a temperature reading error and an errorThis test log is the result of testing under the same machineIf it is read correctly, it will prompt:temp_sensor_type=26 is NCT218If it is not read correctly, then he will prompt:temp_sensor_type=0 then he will set this temp_sensor as TMP451 by defaultNCT218=type26TMP451=type0Also, our firmware does not depend on the PIC firmware in the EEPROM chip attached to the PIC chip. We directly issue the operating frequency of the asic chip and the power supply voltage of the PSU from the hulkos firmware, which completely bypasses the problem of the PIC, and the frequency and voltage are dynamically adjusted, so even if the PIC chip is not flashed with firmware, or our three-chip computing power The PIC information of the board is not uniform, and our hashboard can still work normally, so it has nothing to do with the PIC, which simplifies the work difficulty of on-site operation and maintenance personnel. To a certain extent, you can understand that hulkos automatically sends the PIC program to the hashboard to run",

I am a little confused whether it is a software problem or a hardware problem.If you already did flashing the unit with different firmware stock or braiins or even HulkOS but the issue is still there then it should be a hardware issue. Have you tried to replace the hashboard or the chip sensor? If not, then try it first because without testing it you will never know if it's a hardware issue or software issue.",
