You can see how these new tokens get deployed and they get listed on Uniswap and trade for a few hours and then usually the dev ends up rugging them.I think I found 20 tokens today which were newly created and many of them were rugged immediately pretty much.

I think Ive been able to play with that and do 3x from initial entry, though it could have been 7x since Im early out. But its fine profit is profit. Im not sure if they are scam but most likely they will grabbed some of the money from it for sure. So as a trader it would be best to always take profit and dont regret whether it goes big cause you dont know what would happened right. Plus these memecoins have timeline they could rug that or abandon it anytime.",

Why need to follow the name of other token? The creator of that PEPE AI is just riding the fame accumulated by PEPE coin and they want people to believe that they are good because they attached the AI name on it. Much better to avoid those token and never hold it since you will just tolerate those scammers to create another token and scam people again. Also don't let those scammer became rich so avoid that and find other one since there are to many reliable alts which is far more better to invest.",

Those are all just stupid and non creative tries to get some money out of the whole attention that the launch of PEPE generated. They just took PEPE and also added AI to it. That is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. They just slapped together the two biggest buzzwords at the moment and really expect that people would take this project seriously. I know that a lot of people have become rich with PEPE but stuff like that only happends once every 2 years or so. The last time was with Shiba Inu and now Pepe. Just stay away from all those meme-coins now.",
