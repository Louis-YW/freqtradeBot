Yes MT. GOX FTX and who's next? That's Binance eventually.What's so ever called exchange's kill's Satoshi's plans which is Self Custody of your own Coin's, running of your own full nodes without any middle man. Please, if you're too stubborn you will be next, over $300 Billion lost in the recent FTX setback that was huge. Elon Musk recently cracked a joke of how they have fucked millions alone with this using Porn hub",

Now people are withdrawing their funds from cex like crazy. All of the major cex are now forced to show their proof of reserve. I got an email from kucoin about their proof of reserve and it seems they are doing it in a hurry. For some time people will not use CEX as they did before. Hacker drained FTX funds and sold them into dex. It could be an inside job too much SBF was trying to escape from his Bahamas mansion in a rush. This drama hasn't ended yet.",

However, this did not happen with the Internet.  Te Internet is actually under the jurisdiction of individual states, and some states seek to completely isolate their segments of the Internet from the entire World Wide Web.  People very easily give up their rights, freedoms, opportunities and conquests.  This is sad.",

In my opinion, it is not necessary to give up Cex completely, as long as we have a solution to limit risks, there will be no problem. Never leave funds on the exchange after the end of the transaction, assets in the long-term holding portfolio should be put into cold wallets. In the market nothing is absolutely safe, using DEX we also have to connect the wallet with Dex and grant the permission, they can still attack our assets if there is a conspiracy.",

Gas fees are also a reason behind cex dependency if you are a trader, not a long-term investor. Sometimes people do not care to sacrifice their security if they find a little bit of comfort even in an insecure place.",

You don't want your orders getting stuck because there's no buyers or sellers around. Then there are those people who still doesn't know how to use a wallet, cold one.
