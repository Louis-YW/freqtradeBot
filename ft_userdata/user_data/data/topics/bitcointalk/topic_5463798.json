Lending money to kickstart your business is not advisable, what if things fail to go as planned? You will eventually lose your collateral if unable to pay off your debt so You have to be well established before you should even think of lending. Lending money should be discouraged unless when you have no other means and not that i am encouraging sale of properties to raise funds. I can see how you have been earning and building an empire by trying to scam people, in just a few days you joined this forum you already have a bad reputation here. I hope no one ever falls for your collateral scams.",

Do not invest in bitcoin with money that you need soon or linked to deadline time.I think the op could arrange a loan where anyone can borrow money by collateral bitcoins to him. In this case, it can be useful for those individuals who want to hold Bitcoins without selling them, but on the other hand, do not currently have enough money to meet any of their needs. In that case he can borrow money by collateral his bitcoins and later repay the money and get his bitcoins back. I'm not sure that's what the op meant.  But I could guess that from reading his post",

You make things complicated and we don't understand what you want to ask in this discussion. Lenders seek to profit from their business and it is impossible for them to provide loans without expecting benefits or conditions to be provided. You can take the investment or trading route to grow your financial work and need capital to achieve all of that.Quote from: Collateralbank on August 19, 2023, 10:50:36 AMBy borowing against assets it's great way to benefit owning assets without selling them.It's not secret that \"financial people and bankers \" in the west use btc as collateral for the Loans before BTC it was gold used as collateral but since btc started the borrowing process against assets it's a lot more easy now. Nobody wants to lend out a large asset and let alone move independently asking for it and there's no guarantee we can provide for them. The only thing I know, forum has several people ready to lend, but I've never seen them willing to give such a large amount. Even if you are talking about a loan that uses BTC as collateral and that doesn't include us in it either.The financial strength that we have is not included in the category that you convey, so taking a loan for investment is not a good alternative, this will be much riskier when you run it because of the volatility problem itself. Do another way to have alternatives in grow financial work the way you want and look for a more rational way to do it.",

I have heard borrowing money against Crypto is really costly. Also I have a question what do you do after borrowing the money? Is the overall net return margins have to be positive to actually take benefit of the capital that you borrowed otherwise it's useless. So what did the key for the returns in this model of earning money?",

This is nice idea to maintain your holdings while participating on campaigns that will give you profit. I’m not familiar on how crypto loans work but the only problem on this strategy is when the airdrop that you join takes too long that cause your collateral assets already liquidated after the coins value dip below the liquidation price. Nevertheless, I’m intrigued on this strategy as I’m participating on airdrop that requires trading volume on some DEX to receive token. This will help to maintain holdings while gaining airdrops using stables.",
