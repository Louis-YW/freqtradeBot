  "content": "Finally, the Shanghai and Capella upgrades of Ethereum, together called Shapella, are now live. It activated on April 12. The fears of many that the price might nosedive following the upgrade, considering that it means those staked ETH could now be withdrawn from the Beacon Chain,are now allayed. There were worries and debates as to what will happen to the price of ETH as soon as the Beacon Chain withdrawal is activated. Those who worried and believed that a dump will happen are now proven wrong. Not only did the price of ETH remain stable, it rose and even broke $2,000. Although it helped that there is a daily withdrawal limit to staked ETH, the confidence that Shapella provided to the entire community proved to be a lot stronger.",

Consensys release a free nft mint to celebrate its launch.https://twitter.com/ConsenSys/status/1646679833605226498?t=84uGPwDUXyouFTmY6vDH-w&s=1948hrs from the post it would end. I believe this is worth a go considering nft possible hype might be also a criteria for possible airdrop that might occur. Who knows. Since its free anyone could just mint it. No harm in doing, like what Aptos airdrop to some of the holder of their free nft mint as well.",
