  "content": "Since it looks like a bull run is on the horizon, I'd like to hear about your experiences during the bull runs you've already been through, and which one was the best in your opinion, especially if you've been in the crypto space for a while. As for me, I experienced the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, but I enjoyed the 2017 one more because it was my first experience of a bull run. Back then, not only Bitcoin but also altcoins were bringing in substantial gains.The 2017 bull run brought significant changes to my life; I was able to do and buy things I had only dreamed of before the bull run occurred. I could afford properties, travel, dine in fancy restaurants, and enjoy experiences that money wasn't a problem for me that time. It's safe to say I was financially free for a while, or what they call a 'one-day millionaire,' hehe.So, guys, please share your experiences. Let's inspire the newbies with our stories.",

      "body": "Good question, my first experience of a bull run was in 2017, as you can see I registered early that year, and so it was a big eye opener for me. Not sure what to do though, didn't even save or accumulate that time and so that is a big lesson for me.So what I did is before the next bull run of 2020, I try to accumulate as much as I can, not big enough though. But when the pandemic came, it was a perfect opportunity for me. Obviously, everything is at a stand still. And I think it's one of the positive thing that happen to us that time. We are just at home and fortunately for us, we still have our signature campaigns. And so I just save as much as I can in the next coming months and years.And now I will continue with that strategy, saving some in 2023 and will continue even if we are already in the bull run. It doesn't mean that we can continue to accumulate and HODL and most likely will sell in 2025 to make some profits. Plenty of time for us to do this simple strategy but very effective, you just need to have that mentality to do it.",

The market won't wait for us any longer when it steps on the bull run and that's why I belong to those folks that have taken the advantage and profit on 2021. Not a lot but more than the year of 2017 when I didn't do a lot of profit taking. I don't hold a lot but it means a lot to me when I was able to get close to the ATH and sold there. I am looking forward to a better bull run and might be bigger than 2021. And as the cycle goes on, those that have never taken profits in 2021 because of greediness. They will for sure gonna apply the lesson they learn from there and will not have a second thought on selling when bull run appears likely on 2024-2025.",

      "body": "2017 was the best year for me, although I missed out on some opportunities due to bad decision-making. But we are only human, and we make mistakes. What matters is that we still made money, so we should be thankful for that. Have you already felt the bullish sentiment? I believe I've sensed it as I've read many posts about a bull run, including this one. Since the halving is nearing, and according to CZ, based on his observations, bull runs usually follow halving events, we should be prepared.There's still plenty of time to prepare for a significant bull run, but if I were you, considering that most of us here earn income from promoting a certain brand, I think we should just hold onto our earnings. We earn on a weekly basis, so if that grows over time and Bitcoin rises, it would be a substantial bonus for us already.I love that the OP brought up this discussion. It can inspire newcomers who read our stories because a bull run can lead to some incredible opportunities and profits. It can take our profits to new heights if we are fortunate. Good luck to all of us; preparation is the key here.",

While I'm not a seasoned crypto investor myself, I have followed the industry closely. I also experienced the 2017 bull run, and like you, it was a memorable period for me. It was my introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies, and I was amazed by the gains that both Bitcoin and altcoins were generating. It felt like a thrilling roller-coaster ride with prices soaring and creating a lot of enthusiasm in the crypto community. The ICO (Initial Coin Offering) craze was at its peak, and I remember being eager to invest in new and promising tokens. Some did exceptionally well, while others fizzled out. The 2017 bull run didn't make me a millionaire, just almost hehe, but it certainly opened my eyes to the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Since then, I've continued to follow the crypto space and witnessed the 2021 bull run as well, which, like you, was also remarkable.",

Those were the golden times because you didn't need merit to rank up; you just had to complete your activities to reach the highest rank. Unfortunately, with that system, there were lots of spammers at that time, and accounts were being sold because ranking up was easy. This is why the merit system was introduced. However, to be honest, I benefited from that era because before the merit system was introduced, I had already reached the legendary rank.Quote from: DabsPoorVersion on October 19, 2023, 09:04:04 AMQuote from: mirakal on October 19, 2023, 08:38:35 AMQuote from: bhadz on October 19, 2023, 04:53:56 AMThe 2017 was like the bull run that has taught many the lesson that we have to take profits and take those withdrawals.

In 2017, it was the era of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). I can recall a few altcoins like Lisk and Ethereum that were launched through ICOs. However, it's worth noting that the Lisk project has struggled and is now worth less than $1. In 2017, it seemed like altcoins were more profitable than Bitcoin because even what you earned from bounty campaigns could translate into a significant amount of money. I mean, most of the bounties during that time offered substantial rewards.Just Imagine how much you make from ETH ICO. https://icodrops.com/ethereum/QuoteICO Token Price: 1 ETH = 0.311 USDQuote from: bhadz on October 19, 2023, 11:36:59 AMQuote from: mirakal on October 19, 2023, 08:38:35 AMQuote from: bhadz on October 19, 2023, 04:53:56 AMThe 2017 was like the bull run that has taught many the lesson that we have to take profits and take those withdrawals.

      "body": "Definitely 2017 bullrun yung pinaka mas masaya at solid for me. Hindi kasi si Bitcoin yung pinakafocus, rather pati yung mga altcoins ay nagsilakasan talaga. Nung time na yun din yung nagstop ako sa bitcoin campaigns at trading at sumali sa mga altcoin campaign kasi mas malaki yung mga profit. Nagtry din akong maginvest sa mga ICO at halos lahat ay profitable. Kaso grabe ka worst din yung bear market after nung bull run dahil kahit successful yung mga altcoin projects ay nawalan ng value ng tokens nila.Masaya din naman si 2021, nakabili rin ako kahit papano ng mga personal gamit ko pero hindi katulad ng 2017. Siguro rin hindi ako masyado nakasabay dahil more on NFT at memecoins naman dito.",

In 2017, it was the era of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). I can recall a few altcoins like Lisk and Ethereum that were launched through ICOs. However, it's worth noting that the Lisk project has struggled and is now worth less than $1. In 2017, it seemed like altcoins were more profitable than Bitcoin because even what you earned from bounty campaigns could translate into a significant amount of money. I mean, most of the bounties during that time offered substantial rewards.Just Imagine how much you make from ETH ICO. https://icodrops.com/ethereum/QuoteICO Token Price: 1 ETH = 0.311 USDI've earned from some altcoins during that time and I can't forget that. Man, you just made me remember the mistake that I have done when I was too focused on other things and not on Ethereum at that time. The price of Ethereum back then was too cheap and we've seen how it became for the past years and even now, it's now a lot. And at this time, I don't think that we'll ever see some of these projects again do well like how ETH did in the past and other altcoins too.Quote from: mirakal on October 19, 2023, 12:30:10 PMAs we experience more bull runs, it also helps us become more mature and wiser in making decisions. So, for the upcoming bull run, we shouldn't waste time and opportunities. We have to enjoy it and aim for big profits, and it all starts with accumulating.Definitely, those that didn't sell during the last bull run will now wait for the right time for them to sell and they won't waste that moment when it comes.",

As for me, I experienced the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, but I enjoyed the 2017 one more because it was my first experience of a bull run. Back then, not only Bitcoin but also altcoins were bringing in substantial gains.The 2017 bull run brought significant changes to my life; I was able to do and buy things I had only dreamed of before the bull run occurred. I could afford properties, travel, dine in fancy restaurants, and enjoy experiences that money wasn't a problem for me that time. It's safe to say I was financially free for a while, or what they call a 'one-day millionaire,' hehe.So, guys, please share your experiences. Let's inspire the newbies with our stories.2017 was the best bull run for me, because during those times I somehow made a good profit in cryptocurrency. I also lost some of my bitcoin or crypto earnings during this period.And I dreamed of experiencing it again, but during the last bull run, I was not prepared for that because we are in the time of the pandemic, and it is quite difficult to make money in those times, to be honest. I hope this coming year I will experience more of what I experienced in 2017.",

I wasn't able to fully ride the 2017 bull run, but I surely made some huge profits during this time. I must agree, yung peak ng axie last 2021 and the crypto market looked crazy diba, hindi inakala ng lahat na that year mangyayare yung dating haka-haka lang nung mga nakaraang taon, and given the short period of time is ambilis lumaki ng market ng crypto, talagang game-changer yung dating sa financial space ng mundo. Nung 2021 naman yung best bull run ko, together with my friends, kumita kame ng malaking halaga na nagamit ko para makapagtapos ng college and syempre personal expenses",
