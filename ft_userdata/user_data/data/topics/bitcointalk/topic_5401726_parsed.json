I really wanted either #1 or #21 and thought I was going to be able to get #1 if I showed up here on the dot. I will take my chances by withdrawing from #4 and try to time #21Best,BTCOVERFIATS",

I had the gut feeling that it would be too chaotic at open for me to manage the serial number requests, but it has turned out to be rather manageable. Number 6 please or next lowest",

In the ideal scenario these posters are professionally framed (mounted). Art lights can be hung over top and it would make for the coolest aesthetic you have ever seen. OH!  I had totally misunderstood this poster.  I thought it was double sided and framed in such a way that you can see both sides.  Not sure why I thought that, but in my mind that would be an awesome way to showcase it in the right spot.  I may have to find some sort of double sided frame to put both of them in and display that way.  In my mind, that's how it was going to be, so that's how it will be.    Thanks for clarifying!",
