When the algorithm change, you will make wrong decision based on your bot's prediction. But good work on making this. Keep it up. Try to find bugs and fix them. Hopefully you will be able to unlock its full potential then.",

It just takes away the fun in trading, and you will most likely get addicted to it.I don't agree with youThe bot is just an assistant to you. I started by writing bots to send me the situations I needed on the market.When I received signals, I traded, sometimes there were a lot of them and I did not have time to gain 10-20 positions.Then I decided to just write a cryptocurrency bot based on my experience.Yes, the market may change, but backtests for 3 years show that this strategy works on cryptocurrenciesYes, I will continue to try to improve it.",
