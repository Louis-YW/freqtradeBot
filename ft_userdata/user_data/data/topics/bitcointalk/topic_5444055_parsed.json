      "body": "I confess this is the first time I have seen about this NX31 ASIC, supposedly TP-LINK.For those who understand at least a little about mining, which is the case for most who will invest at least $1,440, and at least do a brief research, I think it is difficult to buy this Asic.Already by the name they try to make the customer think it is a TP-LINK product, there is no need for this.They say it is a router and an Asic, but for a product that consumes 1,200W I don't know what is the advantage of being a router.They comment in the article that they sold the first batch already, I don't know how anyone can risk this way, if it is true that sold a whole lot already.Thanks for posting, it is good that it is already indexed in Google searches, and may alert some interested people.Just one more detail, look at the logo, they copied the exact logo of official TP LINK",

I can't imagine they will actually ship a product with the TP-Link logo on it.Their supposed Scrypt miner, the image of which also carrying the TP-Link logo, not sure what TP-Link product it is, is said tostart shipping march 24. We'll see.Edit: Apparently this is nothing new for TP-Link.https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/1963/",

Mining is subject to false positive malware detection as wellas real malware, creating a gaping security risk. It's not the kind of thing I want running on a router.Exactly.If the router is infected it can lead to all sort of malware and the hardest of all of them can be someone to inject a RAT-Remote Access Trojan over it and get access to a lot of your data,including passwords,keys and whatever information you put at it.Routers are the devices which connect us to the Internet and as such if they are compromised things will only get worse.Using TP-Link though is not wise and this means that these impostors are dumb enough and nobody will fall for such a scam.",

It was irresponsible to publish the arcticle in the first place. It's just another example of how easilly fake news can be spread.TP-Link is pretty common around here, I have some of their stuff.",
