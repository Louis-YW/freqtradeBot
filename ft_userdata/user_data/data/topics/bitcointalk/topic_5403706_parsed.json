      "body": "No doubt if ripple can still do this. This company is still having billions of reserved funds and that makes sense if the new office can be opened easily. I think that community know this so well as ripple has been liquidated so many coins to be used as reserved funds. This can open so many office instantly. That's why ripple is depend on its reserved funds. Just waiting for the comeback from ripple to happen maybe soon or later.",

This developer is in great demand. Business is booming in Toronto's startup scene and many companies are opening new offices now.

Full Details: https://u.today/ripple-opens-its-first-office-in-canada This was another good point for the action of Ripple, and because of this XRP did, I am pretty sure that Ripple holders will clear hope in the future that their holdings will yield good results in the future as they wait for it to rise again in its market price. Perhaps, I need to buy it alsothen hold too in the long term while the price so far is cheap in the market. Quote from: Godday on June 23, 2022, 07:22:16 AMI've invested around $1,000 in Ripple between 2021 and 2022 at some prices.  I firmly believe in Ripple's extraordinary future.  The opening of this first office in Canada could be good news for Ripple investors and of course it is also a great first step for the Ripple development team.  Good luck!That was a huge amount here in my country, I wish I could have the capital too to buy coins also. Moreover, all crypto enthusiast in Canada will surely happy too because of what XRP made a branch over this place.",
