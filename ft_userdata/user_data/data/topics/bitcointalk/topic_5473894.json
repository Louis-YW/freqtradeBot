You really spoke like a legend that you are, in this life there is need to always take risk no matter the outcome if you will win or not already anything one is doing in life two things are always involved, is either you win or you lose, disadvantages and advantages. Had it been say those first people wey been know about bitcoin then took it serious at least by now almost all of us here for be legends in this bitcointalk forum but because the awareness know reach us on time come make us still dey struggle for the industry. Okay take a look at Indonesia board you will see almost all of them are legends because the awareness reach them on time.What am really trying to say is that we should learn to follow things as it is hot. Even if it fails then we move, there are some businesses we even do physically yet it still fails us. Everything is what giving a trial though I know that due to frauds and lots of scams has made lots of person to lose interest whenever something new are being introduced to them but we should try as possible to remove the spirit of doubt in our life and always look for ways by which we can find solutions within ourselves.The 2go experience almost dey like this platform in the aspect of the ranks but it's more of a chat platform unlike this bitcointalk forum where lots of things are being discussed and analyzed and people's views and opinion are also taken into account.",
