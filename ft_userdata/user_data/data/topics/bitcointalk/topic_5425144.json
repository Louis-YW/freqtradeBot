  "content": "Hi.On my journey down the bitcoin rabbit hole i stumbled across something i consider confusing, or misleading.Some info:Bitcoin Core 22.0 linux ARM version running on a raspberry pi with debian.I bought a coldcard wallet, created a descriptor wallet in bitcoin core with the arguments disable_private_keys=true descriptors=true, and imported the descriptor key's into the wallet with the argument \"watchonly\": true.When i do a getadressinfo query for the addresses, it shows as \"\"iswatchonly\": false,\".From bitcoininformation.org on watchonly:\"DefinitionAn address or pubkey script stored in the wallet without the corresponding private key, allowing the wallet to watch for outputs but not spend them.\"Isn't that a little bit misleading or confusing? It sure confused me. Per definition, as far as i can figure out at least, \"iswatchonly: false\" means that bitcoin core has the corresponding private key. Which it does not. I did a getdescriptorinfo to double check that the descriptors i imported does not contain the private key, and the output clearly shows \"hasprivatekeys: false\".Is this a bug, or is this intended? Or is there something i don't understand here?",

So it is intended to be this way then I guess. Nevertheless, quite confusing.",
