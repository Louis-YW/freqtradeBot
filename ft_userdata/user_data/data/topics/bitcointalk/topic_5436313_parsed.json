Matches with possible draw result is not allowed for the current moment.At the end of the match a special fact certification Oracle would be run to ask the network members about the winner of the match. So, after the end of the certification Oracle the winners will split the losers prize fund divided in proportion to individual bets each of the winner side bettors.Quite interesting approach, the final WCUP 2022 match was quite successful and got a bit less than 20 000 iDNA prize fund.The platform fastly evolving and now they are accepting bets for the final match of Supercopa de Brasil between Palmeiras and Flamengo which will take place on January 28th at 16:30 GMT-3.It would interesting to know your opinion about the idea using certification Oracles to prove the sports event results to unlock and split the prize fund of the match via smart-contract.More information about OracleLock principle is available here:https://docs.idena.io/docs/developer/node/oracle-lock",

About Casino, I am not sure if that could work. In general the idea is to ask (fact certification Oracle) who is the winner of the match? And then majority would take a decision who is the winner. The fact certification Oracle is always cover the whole network and each of the member to be available to vote must to lock some amount of coins and that coins would be returned back in case if his answer would be part of the majority. Also it could be returned more coins in case if some people would put the vote to the opposite side by mistake or for self-interested aims. So people, gonna be motivated to vote on the true winner favour.About the stake, they have a special conception called Quadratic Staking you don't need to have any stake to make a bet but take part in a vote for the fact certification Oracle your identity in the network must be validated. The validation in the network happening regularly (currently the period of each validation is equal to 12 days. It's called Epoch) depends on the network size. People to keep validated status must solve a special test called flip, which looks like a series of images that represents a logical story that has beginning at the top and end at the bottom, more information you could find on the idena blockchain official website idena.io. The point is that the network because of the that flip test accepts only humans as Oracle validators each of the validators has a special status which represents kind of advanced eco-sytem with a special rights and privileges. Also, people must pass the test for each of the epoch but this is a separate topic, the point of that conversation is that network members by majority taking a decision who is the winner after the match is over and based on that decision the contract unlocks the prize fund to the favour of winners. That's why there is no needs to have any KYC and everything is 100% on-chain and anonymous. The platform is always getting the interest from each of the bet and bettors splitting the prize fund of losers. So, it's like a WIN/WIN strategy.",

Also, to work via web-application you would need a special API key, which you could generate buy running your own shared node or by buying it in the shared node marketplace. API keys + Shared Node URL it's like an access to the API interface of the blockchain. In case if you have doubts you could create a wallet only for bets for example and keep your savings on independent cold wallet that you can create buy running your own node.For now importing your encrypted private key is the only method that is accepted.Please note that we are just developing the betting platform in partnership with Idena core team. If you want to know about the roadmap or any futher questions related to the future plans on improving Idena auth mechanism it would better to ask in the comments section of the latest Idena Chronicles.",

I mean everything is on chain and the results of certification Oracle would unlock the losers fund for winners side.This is an example of fact certification OracleAs you can see the question is pretty simple: \"Who won the WCUP 2022?\".

Which mechanism, is that also on chain verifiable? You say it asks all members of the network for the result, why?

The network is way bigger than quantity of bettors. So, to cheat the system you would need to manipulate with a huge amount of people which is almost impossible or the expenses would be way bigger than the potential profit. That's why it's called Proof-of-Personhood. The blockchain paying you coins after each of the epoch to motivate you to prove that you are a Human. The unique point of Idena that you don't need to show any ID, or any other information about yourself, the only thing which make sense in the network is to pass the validation ceremony/create flips/report others flips in case if they are against of main rules. Also, rewards are depends on your stake, the more stake you have the more rewards the blockchain paying you after each validation.The [ANN] topic about our platform is available here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436434 [Moderator note: consecutive posts merged (separated via horizontal lines)]",
