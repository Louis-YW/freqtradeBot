      "body": "It's actually quite disappointing to see some names whom which I personally think are quite good members of the forum to have actually bought into the scamdemic and its ploy to poison the population. For those who are actually blind, the pandemic was primarily a ploy to turn the eyes away from imminent economic disaster and to buy time to be able to patch as many holes as possible while the economy was shut down. Anyone who thinks otherwise is being blindsided. The proof is in the pudding if you look into how much money was printed during this period of time and how many companies were bailed out. The vaccines on the other hand...we won't know what the end game is there until later on. I don't see how anyone can see good in something that was forced upon most populations and had little to no research as to how it effected the body. Pfizer already came out and said that they weren't even sure themselves whether or not the vaccine actually prevented covid or not. So, what exactly did people put in their body and what was the real purpose? Was it just money, or something more? I won't invest anymore effort into the topic because I have already done my own research and I don't have any time to argue with the unarguable. The fact is, if you are being blindsided, that's your problem. Not mine. I recommend you take the same approach OP. Your life will be much easier",

It’s among the latest in “alternative” treatments touted by anti-vaccine advocates during the pandemic.Christopher Key, known as the “Vaccine Police” said over the weekend on his Telegram account, the Daily Beast reports. Key, who was freshly released from jail, told followers of his group, “The antidote that we have seen now, and we have tons and tons of research, is urine therapy. OK, and I know to a lot of you this sounds crazy, but guys, God’s given us everything we need.”Key, who was arrested Jan. 5 related to a trespassing charge at a Whole Foods Market last year, previously made headlines for claiming he planned to perform a citizen’s arrest of Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who he claimed was forcing child vaccinations. The Alabama resident has also called for the execution of pharmacists who administer vaccines and called vaccinations a “crime against humanity.”When reached out to for comment told the Daily Beast he believes in “urine therapy.” Also known as “urotherapy,” the alternative medicine practice of ingesting or applying one’s own urine is currently unproven to have medical benefits.The consumption of urine, known as urophagia or urine therapy, has been practiced by some for centuries, though benefits have not been scientifically proven. Over the years, there have been many disproven or unfounded claims about ingesting urine, including reports it can stop cancer growth — which the American Cancer Society has no scientific evidence of.https://www.kxan.com/news/weird-news/drink-urine-anti-covid-vaccine-advocate-tells-supporters/He def has that anti-vaxxer look.",

One fact that in general remains the same everywhere is that covid exists and that's where it ends. There are multiple possible origins of covid, for instance some people still believe a mutated bat flew into the Wuhan market, despite Wuhan Coronavirus Lab being just around the corner. It wasn't the origin of the coronavirus and nothing escaped from there because they have top notch filtration systems Some doctors say covid vaccines work and don't cause problems, some say they don't work and cause problems, some say they work, but cause problems. From my experience, they work but for a short time. I have a friend who had 3 doses and was sick twice. Once before he got the first dose and about 6 months after taking the last dose. I did not take a single dose and and felt great if not counting that one time in the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 when I got sick and gained natural immunity. My father also took 3 doses and got sick a few months later, so if they ever try to shove a covid vaccine down my throat, like they did in Austria, I'll fight them. Guess that makes me an anti vaxxer.",

The theory of diluting to increase effectiveness of medicine sounds like the opposite of science if you asked me.

Why use vaccines which work, when we could use homeopathy which doesn't? It's a real conundrum! I'm sure this meeting of Bitcointalk's finest anti-vax minds will figure it out though! Vaccines don't work as they are said to work. The only reason they seem to work is, they 'scare' the person's immune system into putting out tons of energy to fight the vaxx, thereby getting rid of the target disease along with a whole bunch of other diseases. This weakens the immune system so badly that, once it relaxes to rebuild itself, it's much easier for the person to get sick from something in the next attack. Constant vaccination weakens the immune system until some, dumb, little thing like covid actually makes a few people sick. The example of this is that a very high percent of the covid-sick are the people who have been covid-vaxxed.Proper nutrition, hygiene, along with homeopathy keeps the person from getting sick in the first place.",

Most often they would tell me that they were quite overweight, or that they had a lot of risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, etc.).I don't know if when you say \"younger than us\" it's because you and your colleagues are like 63 years old on average so I would understand better what you are saying.",

But when you find a few people who show you the truth to your face, it's then that you start picking on the people rather than the data and the processes for getting the data. Del Bigtree of The Highwire fame, has interview at least dozens of professionals linked to the Covid disease and the Covid vaccines in some ways. These professionals have shown exactly the various ways that standard medicine is a lie, especially regarding Covid, and all vaccines.
