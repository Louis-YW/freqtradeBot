You have given incorrect authentication credentials to the blockchain explorer software, so Bitcoin Core continuously returns that someone attempted to connect incorrectly. Check if you have written the correct password, or if you're using a cookie file, check if that is configurable by the blockchain explorer software.",

This is true for JSON-RPC, though I suspect it also applies to the REST API as well as I have not seen a different set of credentials for it.If you don't specify -rpcuser and -rpcpassword, it defaults to a \"cookie-based authentication\" where the username is \"cookie\" and the password is randomly generated at launch and saved to a file.",
