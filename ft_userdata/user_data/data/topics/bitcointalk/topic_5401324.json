(I've seen the advice to get Umbrel, etc - I just want to get this running before I spend more money on tech I don't understand.)",

EPS only scans the addresses in your wallet, as opposed to ElectrumX which scans every address, so it should rescan in a matter of minutes. EPS (on Linux, at least) also tells you when it is rescanning and gives you a progress bar.Really not sure why this isn't linking up, but as I say, I'm not very familiar with Windows. Are you using Tor maybe?",

Be careful doing this if you have ever used any of those wallets though! Don't want to accidentally delete access to some coins. (If you have ever used any of these wallets, better to just move them out to a different directory rather than delete them, just in case.)Quote from: doggoboi on June 05, 2022, 09:17:18 AMSince EPS is supposed to give the wallet data TO bitcoin core how come I need to start a separate wallet in Bitcoin Core?You need to create an empty Bitcoin Core wallet first for EPS to import the addresses in to. If you point EPS at a wallet which doesn't exist (or no wallet at all), it will return an error.Quote from: doggoboi on June 05, 2022, 09:17:18 AMCould you take a look at my previous post where I put the config file settings and see if all the ports match up properly?I can't see anything obvious that would be causing issues here. It looks like EPS successfully finds your Bitcoin Core client, so the ports, etc. must all be working, but then cannot actually import the addresses in to the wallet file.",

It got installed in C:\\Users\\xxx\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python310\\Scripts  This .exe in there does not do ANYTHING, it just flashes the command line for a second and it disappears automatically.That Python command from setup.py sets up a whole new EPS.exe that can be found in the file path mentioned but am I supposed to be doing this step  in this new version of EPS?  Seems like I'm supposed to skip this step in the video.",
