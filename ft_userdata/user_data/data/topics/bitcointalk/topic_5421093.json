  "content": "With all the ruckus in the market made by FTX. There have been some good news in the past few days that we haven't noticed and this is what the title is all about. Let's take it first about bitcoin mining, so for those that have been thinking if Shell is going to mine bitcoin. I've read a few articles about it and I've been also jebaited by those headlines. What these articles are talking about is, Shell is going to help bitcoin miners with their cooling system from the technology that they have and through their coolants/lubricants. So, it's like they're going to enter the market indirectly through those data centers that might need their cooling systems.Lastly, Shell had a 2-year deal with Bitcoin magazine and will sponsor the 2023-2024 BTC conferences. It's a great deal honestly, knowing that Shell is an oil giant so, this is like two birds in one stone for the whole bitcoin community. Read more from the sourceswhere I've read this news: Oil Giant Shell Makes Move Into Bitcoin Mining Industry – Here’s What You Need to KnowPhoto & article: Shell oil company will bring solutions for Bitcoin mining",

For people who are home miners like many of us in this forum there will always be GPU mining available to us and every crypto we mine we can always convert back to Bitcoin.We should see the overall good in this move that a giant like Shell wants to enter the Bitcoin mining game and that surely is only positive news for Bitcoin in the long run.In fact I would have loved for Shell to have entered this game exactly more than 1 year ago when Musk said he was not anymore accepting Bitcoin for his Tesla cars because the Bitcoin mining pollutes the environment,that would have been a perfect moment in total contrast with what Musk said.",

What's good with this is that it is Shell. Talking about resources and that matter, they've got a huge resource that can really be useful for most miners and help them with what they're offering. But hopefully, this is going to help also the small time miners and it's not just only limited to mining farms with huge facilities.Quote from: hZti on November 15, 2022, 05:17:22 PMWell it is an obvious step, since a large portion of energy prices are actually caused by delivering the energy to your location.

They will only offer the solutions and technology they have for maintaining a better operations for these mining facilities. But who knows if they'll have their own bitcoin mining facilities and I guess that's better since they can really do it on their own.Quote from: OgNasty on November 15, 2022, 05:18:50 PMThis is great news for Bitcoin but probably terrible news for at home miners.

I think we might be seeing the final evolution stage of Bitcoin mining. Somehow, a good news will always have the other side of it. But looking at the brighter side, this is just starting and we can all have that conclusion that this is a huge company that's put interest to give some help to the huge miners.

It's an easy thing for them and I agree that having a huge budget if they ever plan to take over, they can. We may see them acquire some companies that would be taking care of this business as they're more focused into energy industry. So, this is just like an introduction for them and maybe they've got already roadmap and plans set all along.Quote from: romero121 on November 15, 2022, 09:21:28 PMThis is pure business.

Though I would still wonder what the overall availability of mining equipment is? Chips are rare these days anyway and producing an amount of hash power like out of nowhere even with old equipment could perhaps be less of a threat than one would think. Regardless of the outcome, I would still say that it is also kind of a legitimization that can have a positive influence and be protective in favor of Bitcoin when it comes to regulation or even soft ban considerations by the respective governments.",
