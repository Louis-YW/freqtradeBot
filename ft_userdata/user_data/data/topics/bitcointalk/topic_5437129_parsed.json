She ultimately managed to amass over $12 million in prize money.The preference of gambling games has no gender, they are chosen based on the personality and skill of each player.",

I don't think \"suit\" would be apt to term it as well, since I don't think they'd really compare competitions between males vs females in the first place, and all sports that I know of are capable of being played regardless of if you are male or female.As for gambling games, well, I'd say the same, but just because most games are non-gender specific in the first place. Maybe the themes may make the game intended for a specific gender, but it doesn't necessarily stop the unintended gender from playing it.",

Not only basketball, even women's football clubs also exist and we often find competitions that are the same as championships held by male footballers, especially for the European region and of course women are also very active in following developments and betting on this women's football competition.",

One of my cousins likes to watch Women's Volleyball games so I think she will prefer to bet on those games. But I never heard her do such a thing as to bet for the winner but she is a really big fan. It will be easier for her to analyze the game or who will have the higher chance to win, score, or lose because she knows it. Because there is no such thing as betting blindly when it comes to sports, you got to know your game. I have seen women also prefer poker games, they are actually good at it because of their poker faces.",
