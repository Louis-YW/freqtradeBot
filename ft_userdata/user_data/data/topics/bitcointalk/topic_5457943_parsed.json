Let's be realistic and accept the fact that Zhang will never ever be given a match against Tyson Fury. If this Chinese old man is thinking he will defeat Joyce the second time around so that he will be having a huge payday when he finally faces Fury, then he is having an illusion. He better just fight and defeat any opponent for its own sake rather than dreaming of a fight against the gypsy king. He should have entered the scene much earlier with his record and perhaps he could have gotten the attention of anybody from the top.",

Zhang is full confidence that he can beat Joyce a second time here since he already knows how he gonna handle him. he will also train to get himself even more strength and confidence to easily defeat Joyce this time. I wonder what would gonna happen to Joyce's career if he get easily beaten by Zhang in their second fight.",

First fight is really ugly for Joyce as he was clearly outpointed.Since this is a rematch, hopefully, we will see a more exciting game. Joyce also has a decent record; he is a KO artist with 14 KO wins out of 15 fights. Maybe he was just too aggressive in the previous fight and forgot to be cautious against his fellow giant.So what would be the betting odds for the rematch?This was the odds in the previous fight, QuoteAt -1000 (bet $1,000 to win $100), Joyce is a bigger betting favorite than I would make him, and there could be some value in wagering on Zhang as the +600 underdog (win $600 on a $100 wager).https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshkatzowitz/2023/04/14/joe-joyce-vs-zhilei-zhang-odds-records-prediction/?sh=56a65288b7f1",

In the first match if I'm not mistaken, Joyce also is a huge favorite unfortunately, he lost that one.And a sign of a good boxer is that if they can adjust on the rematch, so let's see how Joyce will deal with Zhang left. That is the weapon that really hurt Joyce in the fight as Zhang is throwing that left with bad intention.Will likely skip this fight though, I wanted Joyce to win, but still though, there could be another upset.",

And perhaps Joyce might underestimate and never see how tough and powerful his punches are even at his year and this is supposed to be like tune up fight for Joyce.",

He has previously beaten Daniel Dubois as a professional and has also defeated Filip Hrgovic in the World Series of Boxing when he was amateur. And this could be the reason why this rematch is immediate for him and his team.He wants to go back and have his name in the discussion for a Fury or Usyk fight if he wins here.

He just keep on plodding as if Zhang is putting a trap on Joyce and working throughout the fight until the referee has to stop it.So in this rematch for sure Joyce has train to move his head a lot, he can't just go square with his face out and then going left to right movement.I'm expecting a big adjustment here and maybe Joyce winning this rematch and moving forward to maybe a fight with any of the British Heavyweight.",

He got some power in his hands. Joyce was probably too confident during that time, with no worries in his mind fighting an old dog but suddenly got the trouble after a left hook that ruined his eyesight. Fighting with one eye handicapped Joyce in that first fight. I doubt Zhang can win again, I think he was just lucky to have pricked Joyce's eyes that lucky day.",
