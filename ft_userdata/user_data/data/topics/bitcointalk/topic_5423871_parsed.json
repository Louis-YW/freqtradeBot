You will have better odds asking with your relatives or parents.",

Even an account created today  can get the loan if the collateral given is valid enough to cover the costs if he/she defaults on the loan.Quote from: yusrime on November 28, 2022, 04:00:45 AM...this board is only about truthfulness of the person not about rankingAnd how should anyone believe you are truthful ? Have you done any successful deal with anyone to prove your truthfulness?",

Someone may create an account one month ago and create a helpful post while the account gets 200 or more merit. The person may get more amount than you asked. But based on your merit history, trust history, and rank you will not get 5$ loan only from you. Also, a user who is about 3 years older than me and his/her rank is a hero but I have not accepted as the person could not post any content for what the user receives any merit. All the merit received by him/her is by airdrop.",

As I Think this board is only about truthfulness of the person not about ranking.Don't get angree with me.  Collateral is everything.  Just ask a fiat bank.  You may not be a customer when you chose a bank to take out a loan with, but if you offer collateral for a short term loan such as this, then you'll usually get a loan.  Same with the pawn shop lenders or pay day lenders.  They want to be assured they will be reimbursed by you.",

On the forum, only the altcoin is valid if you take a bitcoin loan. But the market cap of the collateral should be enough good. Also, if you want to take altcoin as a loan then you can provide bitcoin or other altcoins as collateral.",
