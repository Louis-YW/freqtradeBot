  "content": "After the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced the country's newly redesigned currency, counterfeit notes also started to circulate.It's crucial to arm oneself with the knowledge necessary to tell a fake naira note from a legitimate one.There are variations to watch out for in order to distinguish authentic Naira notes from counterfeit ones; this does not require academic knowledge.You can tell real Naira notes from fake Naira notes by following these five easy guidelines.Quote1. Check the texture: If the texture of the Naira note is soft and the image in it appears dull, you have the right to be concerned, reject it and demand another one.This means that you should be sensitive to the touch of the money you are given when involved in any transaction.2. Observe the gold foil: The N1000 note has a gold foil on the right side, just near the CBN governor’s signature. If you scratch the gold foil of a fake note it will peel off instantly but the gold foil on the original note does not peel.3. Use water or other liquid: You can differentiate fake currency from the original by using water or other liquid. Scammers release fake money and the colours they use in printing counterfeits are soluble in water and some other liquids.If you are not certain about the originality of a Naira note, dip it in water or petrol and scrub it gently. The colours will change immediately if it is fake money. The colours of counterfeit money will wash off like an artwork painted with watercolour.Again, the moment you immerse it in water, the paper becomes messed up. It will get rough and look more like a paper mache. However, the real note will not look like this when immersed in water or any liquid.4. Examine the ribbon/thread: There is a thread which appears like a ribbon on all Naira notes, running from the top to the bottom.In real notes, this thread can be felt with a touch. It is more noticeable on old Naira notes. However, in fake notes, there is something that looks like the thread but it is not.In the counterfeit notes, what is there is just a straight-line painting that looks like the thread in the original notes. If you scratch the painting, it will peel off like the solver panel on recharge cards.5. Use mercury bulbs: Some qualities of the paper Naira notes cannot be seen with the naked eye. These features are only in original Naira notes, and one cannot see them except with the help of mercury bulbs.

That was the easiest way to go for this one. I mean if you have 100N notes then they should have introduced 500N, if they had 1000N then they should have gone for the 2000N. I am talking about any viable option that best fits as per the costs circulation within the country. But they should not have created the same denominations again. This is not upgrade, this is just improvising the current printing. An upgrade would have had current notes / denominations going off the limits.",

Knowledge and information is the key my friend, don't sleep on it when they share it with you. I have not go through all the updates that central bank has shared with commercial banks to disseminate to their customers but I have received more than 3 videos of POS merchants complaining how the new Naira notes has increased the rate of counterfeit currency and I have learn how to avoid them from the videos, like the years on the money, the stamp from CBN and fake colourings of the fake notes. It's a good thing if you check the official one before you become a victim, it's the Christmas season, stay safe.",

This is not upgrade, this is just improvising the current printing. An upgrade would have had current notes / denominations going off the limits.  Even if they make a 1000 changes to it there will still be counterfeit of them although not so quick as the current one. Paper money can never fight off counterfeit one just has to learn on the difference from the original one to stay save.

Funny enough do you know even a color change is redesign. I usually disagree with most of this current government policies but I second this one. If you divide the total paper naira in Nigeria into 3, 2/3 of it is outside the bank and that means most are in the hand of wrong people and this could cause devaluation of the currency",

The new naira note is an improvement from the former one. The one thousand naira note has up to twenty security features, the five hundred naira has about thirteen and the two hundred naira has about ten. The CBN also claimed that the new notes are more durable and would be very difficult to fake. I know these security features would be potent for a few years until currency counterfeit experts would be able to develop the necessary technology that would be potent to print the fake ones. But the truth is that the new currency is not in the same class as world-leading currencies like the dollar, pound, or euro.",

I guess the government has determined that the older notes were increasingly vulnerable to copying and they needed to step it up a gear, hopefully the new notes are cheap enough to produce that the benefits don't outweigh the cost. It's even more important in countries that are heavily reliant on using paper money, which some sectors of the Nigerian economy can be, but even at the street level it is a surprisingly digital economy especially for the youngest generations.",

The government need to flush out bad eggs from her system otherwise the sabotage will continue and that is affecting the economy.
