Peachbitcoin is a great service and I like the fact that you recommend a non-KYC service. (May I suggest that you also add the link to kycnot.me ? The more we spread the good addresses, the more they will be used!)Otherwise, I would like to highlight that your site is clear, responsive and I personally found it very pleasant to browse.I hope you will soon be able to integrate direct payments in BTC without contact by email, even if it is concretely the same result, it will be potentially easier for the laziest users  QuoteEven though we have made every effort to distribute the Bitwear brand professionally from the very beginning, Bitwear is currently not our main activity.I wish you success and a good continuation",

We are all here to support startups like this.I have also looked at your online shop and I see that it is very good. The design you use is very attractive, that I am interested in buying it, but it's a pity that my country is very far from you. And because of that, I want to ask if you support international shipping going forward?",

And because of that, I want to ask if you support international shipping going forward?It seems they do support international shipping, although the cost will be quite expensive depending on where you live[1]. I also notice that the pages are mostly in Germany, even though there is an English section. The shop for example does not support English, so users will need to translate it with Google if they want to add products to the cart. Is this intended or you're still planning to translate other parts into English?[1] https://www.buybitwear.de/lieferbedingungen/",

Is this intended or you're still planning to translate other parts into English?Yes, I noticed that too.It is unclear whether the website was made with a pre-made template or if it was custom-built. However, if the site's target audience includes international customers, its implementation of multilingualism may not be effective. The fact that most of the content is only in German means that it would be difficult for an international customer to make a purchase. If the target audience is only German users, however, this would not be a problem.",

Yeah, I think OP just needs more time to update his website and it is already on his plans. No reason to include international delivery if your target audience is limited to German-speaking users. On the other hand, what exactly does the delivery fee rate based on? I'm not sure if applying a fixed fee rate is a good idea. 50 euros is not exactly cheap, not sure I'd buy one if the delivery cost is more expensive compared to the product I buy. The delivery estimation date is not exactly precise either.",
