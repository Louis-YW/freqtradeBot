  "content": "Dear Average Joe and Jane in the Bitcointalk Community,I hope this appeal finds you well.I am writing to appeal to you to please consider buying more bitcoins now and not wait for big institutions to start adopting it before making a decision. Why am I making this appeal to you? First, these big institutions, who may have bitcoin on their radar, do not necessarily care about bitcoin's current price when they decide to enter the market. Bitcoin may be at 50k or 100k; they do not consider the price. Their adoption approach mainly focuses on market sentiments and trends. To buttress my point, big institutions that would adopt bitcoin make the decision to invest based on their analysis of the bitcoin market's potential for growth, rather than the specific price at the time of entry.Another reason why I appeal to you to buy bitcoin now is that there is always a price push from institutions when they enter the bitcoin market, as we have seen in the past. Because they buy thousands of bitcoins all at once, they create a lot of buying pressure that eventually leads to an increase in bitcoin's value. The result is that the price is driven up, and this makes it difficult for retail investors to buy bitcoin.My Recommendations and Suggestions for YouThe Dollar-Cost-Averaging Strategy: This strategy helps you create a plan to accumulate more bitcoins over time. With this strategy, you can invest a specific amount in bitcoin periodically at your convenience (e.g., weekly, fortnightly, monthly) irrespective of the price. Start now.Diversified Acquisition: My recommendation and suggestion for you is to also look into alternatives for accumulating bitcoin. These alternatives may include receiving bitcoin as payment for a good you have sold or a service you have rendered. By doing so, you will slowly increase the amount of bitcoins you own and potentially make a profit in the long run when there is a price surge.Your Bitcoin Colleague,AlphaKilo",

So if someone buys now and then sells at some point in the future he made a profit, but the big investors are again in possession of these BTC and control the game.If at some point in the future most decide to sell their BTC (and when the price is tempting they certainly want to) what advice will you give us at that moment?",

Sure, if they are lucky and ride that first big wave possibly coming in 2024 well, they will be excited. Until the correction comes and then the journey usually ends there because \"Bitcoin is obviously dead now\".Still, glad you mention dollar-cost-average and your second point isn't too bad either. : )",

When you say that their adoption plans are based on how the market feels and what the trends are, you are telling the truth.Your idea of DCA is like wearing a protective vest in a gunfight. It spreads out the risk and takes the guessing out of timing the market. You always buy, no matter what the price is. Your plan is the honest-to-goodness, blue-collar way to spend.But lets keep going. Bitcoin is a giant, and we all know what it can do.

If the Bitcoin price goes below 30 RSI on a weekly timeframe, you simply buy the dip with more amount than DCA. This will improve the average cost a lot than anything else.

My advice is DCA if you can, it's the best strategy, but if you can't, it's not a must, we all have other things going on in our lives that requires money spending, just make sure you have Bitcoin before 2025, that's all.",

You don't even encourage people to buy, they should be allowed to make their choice. People can decide to invest in order areas apart from bitcoin, so let them make their decisions. If you have the opportunity tell people about Bitcoin and you have done your bit. QuoteAnother reason why I appeal to you to buy bitcoin now is that there is always a price push from institutions when they enter the bitcoin market, as we have seen in the past. Because they buy thousands of bitcoins all at once, they create a lot of buying pressure that eventually leads to an increase in bitcoin's value. The result is that the price is driven up, and this makes it difficult for retail investors to buy bitcoin.Which organization do you want to compete with. They have the funds to buy as much as they can and nobody can stop them because it is a free market. I know there are wealthy bitcoiners but I doubt our capacity to compete with these multi-billion dollar firms. You don't need to buy one bitcoin to be part of the market. Retailers will always have the chance to buy Bitcoin according their capacity. There is no need to rush because there will always be opportunities to buy and sell. QuoteMy Recommendations and Suggestions for YouThe Dollar-Cost-Averaging Strategy: Diversified Acquisition: Your Bitcoin Colleague,AlphaKiloThank you for this recommendation. DCA investment pattern makes investment easy and spreads the risk. If you have a monthly plan, you will b surprised how much you have earned in one year. Receiving bitcoin payments for selling goods or offering services is a good means of joining the Bitcoin train. Many people wouldn't have had the opportunity to own bitcoin if not for bitcoin-paying services.",
