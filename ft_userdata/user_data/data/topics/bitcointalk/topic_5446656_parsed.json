Crypto is rapidly going traction as an investment opportunity, and now you can use digital currency while playing all type of sport bettingActually, regarding the use of crypto for sports betting, there is no need to mention it anymore because all the sportbooks on this forum accept quite a lot of cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin to several Atlcoins.I don't know what your purpose is for making this thread because there is still a lack of clarity and detail in the topic you created, which makes me or maybe other users still confused.If you really mean you want to explain the use of crypto to be used in sports betting with the aim of making a profit then it seems that it's not necessary. All members of this forum must have understood and understood it all.",

At first when I saw the title I thought maybe you have written a guide or tutorial as to how we can maximize our profit whenever we use crypto in sport betting but to my utmost disappointment it turned out to just be a normal post which I'm still finding it difficult to make sense of up till now. It would have been better to have provided a guide even if the guide is outdated than to present your thread like this.I feel the title was made as a click bait.",

So do you have any strategy that you will love to share to the Bitcoin community? As that will be a pleasure if you could share and show proof that what you claim to offer is not fake.",

One for betting and another one to hold in long term, as (I assume) most of people do.",

In fact, it is one of the first industries that have adopted the usage and acceptance of cryptocurrencies mainly, bitcoin.So, what you're saying is no longer new and that has happened years ago and today, with the pandemic and other world problems that has ever existed. It just gained the attention of many but even before that, it's already in the gambling industry and made its fame through crypto casinos.",

We are aware on that. And there is different between investing in crypto and using Crypto to bet on sports. If you use Crypto to bet that is not an investment but just like the way you used the Fiat to bet physically is the same way in Crypto in the digital world.

Crypto is rapidly going traction as an investment opportunity, and now you can use digital currency while playing all type of sport bettingThis is too vague. Lacking information.Also, digital currency is being used for years already in gambling. It is in form of fiat based digital currency. Cryptocurrency can be used indeed to gamble but that does not mean or would give an advantage to maximize the profit, also has no direct relationship with sportsbetting. We are talking about gambling in general and whether you use fiat or crypto, won't make changes with one's fate. The only advantage you'll have from using cryptocurrency in this industry is to avoid taxes while having faster transactions. It could also expose you from added risk because the price of cryptocurrencies are changing from time to time; more of an investment converted to another investment, not to mention the risk of gambling itself.",
