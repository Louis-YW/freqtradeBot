  "content": "I'm writing this to explain the word \"miner\" and show how important these people are to the blockchain environment. Whether you're new to blockchain or want a better understanding of this critical topic, I'm trying to give you a broad picture without getting too technical with mining.So let's get started first with the term Bock Chain:Blockchain is the digital technology that saves user data in the form of blocks over blocks and combines all of them in the form of a chain. Every blockchain block has a unique address that can be used to perform personal transactions. Who is Miner?We know a Miner is a person who mines raw materials from the earth, and in blockchain, the miner uses software that allows their computer systems to connect through any node being used for the mining process.Who is a miner in blockchain:Miner in the blockchain is one who participates in creating transactions of cryptocurrency and also one who is creating new cryptocurrencies and validating their transactions on blockchain. Blockchain is the way of saving data in the form of blocks over blocks and forming all of them in the form of a chain. Blockchain is basically a decentralized system that cannot be hacked. Data on the blockchain is present in encrypted form. To hack any particular transaction, the hacker needs to decrypt all the blocks of the blockchain to decrypt that particular transaction he wants to hack.There are three types of miners that you must have to know.Single-Person Miner:Solo mining is one in which a single miner is responsible for carrying out the mining process on their own, without participating in a group of miners.Pool Miner:Pool mining is a technique that allows individual miners to earn payouts that are more consistent than those that they would receive individually. Because a large number of users are operating on the same network, pool miners in blockchain have the potential to produce a more significant profit.Cloud Miner: Cloud mining is a way to get cryptocurrency coins or tokens without having to use any tools or gear. For the most part, bitcoin mining coins are made by computers. Cloud mining lets you rent computer power from other people and make money. You will make more money if you rent computers.Let's understand the advantages of Mining in Blockchain:When you mine, you secure transactions and put them into blocks, which makes everything very safe. Hackers can't easily change transaction data because these blocks are secured. A block is part of a record that can't be changed once it's added to the blockchain.Decentralization is a key part of building trust in the blockchain network, and mining helps it happen. There isn't a single point of control like in standard centralized systems. Miners check activities as a group, and a distributed network helps them come to an agreement. There is no longer any need to accept a central authority.Anyone with the right hardware can join the network and mine, which makes transactions possible across borders. The fact that blockchain technology has wide adoption makes it easier for people from everywhere to use it, no matter where they live. It would make me happy to hear about any questions or ideas you have. As I explore the complex subject of blockchain, your insights and participation are highly appreciated.",

Blockchain is the way of saving data in the form of blocks over blocks and forming all of them in the form of a chain. Your statement is not true, I've highlighted the wrong one, Minner has nothing to do with the new cryptocurrencies/tokens on the blockchain that are deployed under the smart contracts, by developers. For the rest, it's simple and easy to understand. Elaborating more on this, dinner has the role of validating the transactions made by users, securing the blockchain, and creating new blocks on the chain. The total network decentralization is based on the number of nodes and security is based on the number node participants / minners.Quote from: ScoobyDu on November 23, 2023, 11:51:31 AMBlockchain is basically a decentralized system that cannot be hacked. Data on the blockchain is present in encrypted form. To hack any particular transaction, the hacker needs to decrypt all the blocks of the blockchain to decrypt that particular transaction he wants to hack.Blockchain is designed to be a decentralized way to store data but the decentralization of the blockchain may vary from network to network, on the basis of nodes participating in a network as Bitcoin's network is the most decentralized network compared to any of the other Blockchain networks.Blockchain is secure but there are many things to keep in mind, blockchain attacks are also possible, direct & indirect attacks can be categorized here, the direct attack will be the one in which the hacker attempts a try to hack the blockchain data directly such as by lucnhing 51% power attack. An indirect attack can try to find the variabilities of the Dapps of the network to gain access to the keys and manipulate the assets before getting interacting with the blockchain (Supply chain attacks and smart Contract attacks).",

Miners don't create transactions den miners don't create coins either.Users create tractions, lol, obvious and miners just receive a default reward with every block mined, you can be a miner and never produce a single coin if you don't get a block. Also miners don't validate tractions, nodes do!Quote from: ScoobyDu on November 23, 2023, 11:51:31 AMTo hack any particular transaction, the hacker needs to decrypt all the blocks of the blockchain to decrypt that particular transaction he wants to hack. No, there is no such kind of hack and the attack doesn't make sense at all!Quote from: ScoobyDu on November 23, 2023, 11:51:31 AMA block is part of a record that can't be changed once it's added to the blockchain.Yes it can, it's called chain reorganization!",

There is no longer any need to accept a central authority.It's be noted that not all Blockchain are entirely decentralise while others are more centralise than others. Bitcoin uses pow mechanisms which is makes it totally decentralise and not like others that use the PoS ( proof of stake), POA (Proof of Authority) and others.They are other POW Blockchain but are not as secure as Bitcoin and so they have been affected with the 51% attack example are bitcoinCash and bitcoin gold and others. The 51% attack is not possible on Bitcoin currently because the cost to get the computational power and resources to successfully affect Bitcoin is not feasible and this why we can say its impossible for the 51% hack to affect it. While others of the PoW Blockchain still suffer this, is because their number of miners are small comparably to the Bitcoin network.",

      "body": "Your definitions of different concepts are a bit weird and in some parts wrong.For example why define blockchain like this and what is up with the last sentence, it makes no sense.Quote from: ScoobyDu on November 23, 2023, 11:51:31 AMBlockchain is the digital technology that saves user data in the form of blocks over blocks and combines all of them in the form of a chain. Every blockchain block has a unique address that can be used to perform personal transactions. Blockchain is simply a chain of blocks.Blocks also don't contain \"user data\", they contain transactions.Blocks are also not \"combined\", they are \"chained\".Quotein blockchain, the miner uses software that allows their computer systems to connect through any node being used for the mining process.That's another weird definition.A miner is someone who is using their computing power to perform the \"work\" needed in the Proof of Work algorithm to find the next block.QuoteMiner in the blockchain is one who participates in creating transactions of cryptocurrency and also one who is creating new cryptocurrencies and validating their transactions on blockchain.Wrong.Miners do not create transactions, they also don't validate transactions. They only perform work to find the next block and get the block reward (which is creating the new coins of that cryptocurrency).Users create transactions and nodes validate these transactions.QuoteBlockchain is basically a decentralized system that cannot be hacked.Wrong. Blockchain is just a chain of blocks. It does not have to be decentralized (example is all the centralized shitcoins and the new nonsense known as CBDC).Whether or not it can be \"hacked\" depends on the cryptocurrency, blockchain is just the database. For example if you use a weak cryptography algorithm (eg. weak hash or a weak EC curve) it can easily be hacked.QuoteData on the blockchain is present in encrypted form.Wrong. Nothing in blockchain is encrypted.QuotePool mining is a technique that allows individual miners to earn payouts that are more consistent than those that they would receive individually. Because a large number of users are operating on the same network, pool miners in blockchain have the potential to produce a more significant profit.It is not about profit though, pool mining is about getting paid for the amount of work you perform without worrying about whether you find a block or not.QuoteCloud mining is a way to get cryptocurrency coins or tokens without having to use any tools or gear. For the most part, bitcoin mining coins are made by computers. Cloud mining lets you rent computer power from other people and make money. You will make more money if you rent computers.Theoretically. Otherwise in reality cloud mining is a Ponzi scheme.QuoteLet's understand the advantages of Mining in Blockchain:When you mine, you secure transactions and put them into blocks, which makes everything very safe. Hackers can't easily change transaction data because these blocks are secured. A block is part of a record that can't be changed once it's added to the blockchain.Only if the cryptocurrency we are talking about is bug-free and follows the concept of immutability.Otherwise there are many shitcoins that are filled with bugs and some that don't care about immutability like ethereum where they have and can roll back blocks anytime they want. Which means your transactions are not safe in such blockchains!",
