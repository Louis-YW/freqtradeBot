  "content": "Hi guys!This has been on my mind for a while now, though I'm not a coder yet I've seen it on many forums and websites and it had availed my work from being lost many times in the past. If possible on BTT, I believe it's time that we have the 'autosave draft function' on the forum. I'm somewhat aware of what this could take but a unique forum like this is long overdue for it.I don't know about you, but I've lost many of my drafted posts/topics due to my multitask attitude, system/browser malfunction, personal error and other reasons, which could be painful.A simple function that could save our drafts as we type (provided the browser is connected to the internet) will go a long way.Thanks!#Edit: For those who doubt if it's possible, see an example that I just deliberately did on a forum below:",

You can set it up big or small period but it won't auto save in miliseconds or seconds (?). Forum is not like a platform for real-time content composing and interacting with others like Google, we must hit Post to release our post so I won't think it will be available for this SMF forum or Epochtalk.The auto save feature is bad too if we are composing contents (which will be auto saved) but we change our minds, don't release it. Unfortunately, with auto save, it will be scraped by the forum, that is just bad.",

Sometimes you can never get it written out again exactly as the first time as the brain tends to skip some words when recalling to write again. Having an auto save draft option will be of great help and would limit loss of posts due to any malfunctions that can tender that. I haven’t had an experience like this when creating topics, since I write them down on phone notebook before bringing it to the forum to post. This is where I then preview and do necessary changes to the post to make it look exactly as I want it to appear in the forum.Quote from: tranthidung on April 26, 2023, 08:27:58 AMDraftsDraft page - Pros & ConsIt only works if you either click on Post or Preview button but it has limitation to last 100 posts/ previews and will be available for 7 days.So drafts works like this too? I always thought only previewed post before posting can only be found on the draft and not the ones posted without previewing first. The period validity of posts and number of posts the draft can take is okay. But what OP wanted was an auto save as you’re typing in a reply post or topic, this won’t solve the problem unless the user is used to clicking on preview often as he/she types.",
