I will advise you not to stop reading books that contain BTC, because a day is coming you will find favour from those books that will transform your life for good and your generation too.",

This thing that Yinka has brought you people for is not for everyone\"I totally disagree with you on this very statement of yours of \"hunger\" being a good thing, because we all know that a hungry man is an angry man, and when a man is at that stage, he is capable of doing the unthinkable just to have a piece of meal to eat and survive. Because judging from your statement the most poorest countries with lots of hungry people would have been the most productive, but why is the reverse the case now? Note: Hunger doesn't make people successful, but the determination to succeed does.",

We should be  the ones to rebuff some of this baseless narratives because it doesn't hold any water.There is no Field of expertise that you won't see the black man, ranging from academics, sports, Business etc. So please let's continue to have a positive mindset for our people.",

      "body": "@AgbamoniYou have good topic, but the content is poor. I have searched online before I understood more about what your post is all about.In short, you mean blacks do not read. This is different from what I have known, what I know is that blacks can prefer the theoretical ways and also prefer to follow the first and second world countries. Blacks do not want to be practical and make somethings in their own way but to following whites is what we prefer.What I think is right about this is that blacks do not think, but that goes to our leaders. What if other people become the leader, the people also will become like the leaders that are not getting it correctly. I hope that the shame on blacks will one day be gone after they do things their own way with more thoughts in it that can make the blacks compete with the whites. Because if we blacks shows that we stand out too like the whites, their will not be anything like blacks do not think. I think this can be proper during slavery time. When I was small, I thought it was the white that invaded blacks and enslaved them, but it was later that I knew that blacks are selling blacks to people in North America and South America and few to Asia. But I will still prefer to use 'blacks do not think'. We are more self-centered, our government are not working the way they should and we supposed to be better than this.",

However, from my brief research about the book, it tells the story about four young men who wanted to become wealthy at any cost, and happen to come across powerful drug and human trafficking syndicate who offer them a job, which they accepted simply because they were hungry and poor individuals who had no choice.",

What happened is that there is destiny that manifest with time.Hunger is not responsible for the reason people got better financially because If you are a notorious person, when you are hungry you can only think of nefarious things to do or except we agree that people should do heinous things to get rich.
