  "content": "Welcome $OPTIMUS , is the next potential 1000x TokenMost of us know the power of Elon Musk in the crypto world now, specifically in the meme coin sector. He is the main reason behind the huge DOGE and SHIB pumps to over 60 billion which sparked the whole meme coin sector in crypto which has been crazy ever since, with certain meme coins running to the hundreds of millions even in the bear market.$OPTIMUS caught my attention MASSIVELY because it is based on the robot Elon Musk and Tesla have created that is set to be available to purchase to the public in a couple of years. It is fully AI based and Elon expects it to be a bigger business venture than cars. We have seen on Twitter he is constantly talking about optimus, sharing information and engaging with other people that post about OPTIMUS to his 130 million followers. Elon pumps DOGE and FLOKI whenever he mentions them by 100s of millions of market cap... Yet OPTIMUS is currently sat under $20million total.For those that remember when Elon posted about FLOKI, we saw an insane run up to 3.5billion market cap. I think we are seeing the start of a FLOKI like run with this in the very early stages. I have read over the whitepaper completely and they are building legit AI utility as well which is another massive trending narrative at the minute as well.The reasons I think we are extremely early and this will run to the billions ; - It is less than 6 weeks old and only listed on Uniswap so far, I expect this to be listed on several exchanges shortly.- It is not even listed on coingecko or coinmarketcap yet. A sign of how early we are.- There is only 1700 holders (for comparison, Floki has 500,000 on dexs and even more on CEXs and SHIB has over 2 million)- The co-founder of FLOKI (petabyte) has bought a large position and posted about it this week. This is the first meme coin I have seen him talk about since FLOKI- Huge influencers such as CryptoWizardd (500k followers) and Pentoshi (650k followers) have dropped hints that they have invested by liking + replying to OPTIMUS posts, but they are yet to have make a real post.- Elon hasn't made 1 tweet about OPTIMUS since it has been live... Just imagine when he does.Sometimes in crypto we are given that lucky opportunity to invest into the next 100-1000x early and I believe this is undoubtedly it. Check the links below and of course DYOR as I'm not a financial advisor but I think you will all be thanking me later!Lots more text on the website:  https://www.optimusbot.io/",

      "body": "Just so we are clear here, you are \"just an enthusiast\" and not part of the team? You're here just to hyped this project, which... is not related to Musk at all and hebprobably wasn't even aware about this at all? The project simply borrowing his name and riding his Optimus project to reach a hype-and-dead, which also known as pump-and-dump?I have other question about the details of the project that crossed my mind when I read the WP, but first let's clarify your position here.",
