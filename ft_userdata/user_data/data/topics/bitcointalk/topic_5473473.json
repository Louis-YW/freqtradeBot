In addition, the easy availability of information on income and taxes paid, which is a consequence of the fight against corruption for a very long time in that country, makes the work of thieves even easier.Those who live in that country should seriously consider increasing personal security, which means installing security cameras, alarms and hidden panic buttons, as well as acquiring firearms.",

All  these possibly happened as a result of data leakage from third party exchanges which I believe are mostly the only source where such information could be gotten accurately. The government should be able to come up with measures to protect her citizens from these criminal minded individuals perpetrating such act of wickedness on her citizens. Just like a member has already said, that measures of self defence should be taken as quickly as possible to forestall unforseen circumstances in the nearest future. Individuals should secure their perimeters with security cameras, alarms etc to protect themselves from being attacked. Being on the safe side by taking such steps would be okay.",

Based on his description, Sweden looks to be an awful place to live in if you're into bitcoin/crypto.Quote there's now officially a situation in swedenthis monday, a middle-aged swedish couple was tied up in their home and robbed by 4 masked men. they were physically abused and threatened with their own kitchen knives. they were tied up for hours and one had to be escorted to the hospital via helicopter. the purpose of the assault was to steal the couple's bitcoinunfortunately, this is not a new occurence in sweden now. only last month, two well-known bitcoin/crypto profiles were targeted in their homes by masked, armed menone of them had no physical bitcoin, but was physically abused for 3 hours. the other got away because only their spouse was home at the time.the first time this happened was last year, one of sweden's most well-known bitcoiners had criminals break into their apartmenteven though that person gave up a significant amount of bitcoin/crypto, they were physically beaten and abused for hours infront of their partner. that person was scarred for months and largely withdrew from public life after the assaultwhat appears to be common for each of these cases is that the victims had livestreamed a podcast about bitcoin/crypto days before their assault, or mentioned bitcoin in a public contextthis situation is occurring because in sweden, you can easily search for any person's residential address and drive straight to their house. if you're curious, you can also search for their tax records, and find out exactly how much they paid in income or capital gains tax, and size them up from thatsweden is probably one of the least safe countries to be active in the cryptocurrency sector in at the moment. i've personally left sweden and i don't expect to return until the laws around personal privacy change. \"The Principle of Public Access to Information\", known in swedish as \"Offentlighetsprincipen\" (the law that makes residential addresses and tax records public) is the main culprit behind this strangeness relative to other countries. while the intentions behind this legislation was to reduce corruption, it is not fit for modern society.https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1722371132026712143",

It's more likely a social media exposure some people like to indulge. I've often asked myself why those who expose themselves on social media to flaunt their so called riches do that. Will they die if they've made it through cryptos and don't display it on SM? For me, it's childish to flaunt what one as got in public. Modesty should be everyone's watchword but sadly it's not.

This will make the thieves to think otherwise. But there is nothing impossible as thieves will look for ways to mask themselves online. But exchanges are worse, if attackers send coins from a victim account, it is easy to transfer the coin to noncustodial wallets and mix the coin.Data breach can also be beyond exchanges. Just like in Sweden Offentlighetsprincipen, which gives the public to request/search for information regarding residential addresses and tax records of citizens from the government, this can also be the source of data breach. In such country, the best would be to just trade your coins on a decentralized exchange and avoid ways your privacy can be breached, like not talking about cryptocurrencies on social media and online in a way it can be linked to your personal identity.Quote from: mk4 on November 09, 2023, 01:34:18 PMSaw this Tweet by Eric Wall (a bitcoin personality).
