Any sport betting gambler that gamble very well would have noticed a match or some matches he thought he would have lost, but just favoured him during the extra time added to the 90 minutes play in football. Also the most disappointing bet is when you are expecting win, the team taken is winning but it changed during the extra time given to the 90 minutes and you lost.",

So you try to increased you bets again but the scatter are not appearing anymore.But as far as crash games, yeah, exciting when you are about to hit that ridiculous multiplier when suddenly it just stop.Or even in games where you have a parlay and the only one bet that is missing for you to win is the favorite, suddenly they were upset on the handicap was not covered, so frustrating.",

Although,  I know betting is a game of luck there are some games when you can just predict that this team will win because of their general performance but as soon as the game commences those weak teams will start to dominate the whole game and sometimes I do place a large amount of my bet allocation on the team that's supposedly going to win base on the game stats.P.s is there a way for you to convert the text in your image?

If sportsbetting is to be counted then I think it's those parlays that includes betting on at least 5 huge underdogs. I have tried that quite a few times but I haven't been lucky yet.

Suddenly just one bet destroys everything.I certainly agree with this. There was a certain time when I bet with small amounts and continuously won and because of greed I believed that I could even win higher if I would increase my betting amount. When I deposit, I tried to triple my bets and to my surprise, I have lost all my funds. Chasing big wins because of our high emotions could really drag us down. Instead of enjoying ourselves, we will only feel upset in the end. This has happened to me a couple of times and learned from it as well.",

Personally, I use a strategy where I raise my stake significantly, but I don't do it according to any particular plan, like every 5-10 rounds, but I do it completely randomly, minimizing the machine's ability to predict my next move if it uses such an algorithm.

My browser crashed at exactly the wrong time and I lost my money but I think the bet went through but I would have lost anyway. I just did not see the end result. That was quite disappointing.
