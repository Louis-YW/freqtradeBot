      "body": "Yes, that's right, Japan has recently begun to relax some of the rules related to crypto in general, the goal is to make it easier to register crypto and given the competition of exchanges to have their own charm especially about digital assets.The draft agenda that want to implement includes, among others, what you mentioned above, by allowing crypto types to be listed on exchanges without problems, of course it will be made easier without many twists and turns, In this case there is an exception, namely a new type of coin that operates in the crypto market, especially in Japan.I think there are positive points in the policies that Japan is currently doing towards the exchanges operating there, one of which is that it provides opportunities for new exchanges to start their pioneering easy in every way, whether it's coin registration, documents, distribution and so on, I think it's a good step to help revitalize the existing crypto market in Japan.",

Japan has embraced crypto, and I hope that the exchanges there would list the ones who are worthy of listing or something like that.",

This isn't the first time that Japan is doing this according to the article. This move seem a kickstart to push crypto to rally.  Lessen rules doesn't really mean they will list just about anything, they'd still be screening to hopefully a scam token will not be listed.",

That's going to make things easier because they've given already the requirements and standards before a project can apply for a listing. It's making also their job quicker in determining what the good projects are. But that doesn't mean it will completely gonna give hard time for the scam projects to proceed, there could still be some ways but we have to know most of the details before having such conclusions.",

How will the listing process be removed?I do not see how this news can be positive, because the most important thing is not the platforms, but cryptocurrencies themselves.",

I think Japan is actually want to get more taxes since they're allowing their exchanges to list any coins, this would make anyone can trade any coins and would increase the trading volume.This is not a good news, it's better if they're cancel this proposal and continue to screen a coin before the exchanges list it. It would be better if they're do screening based on the use case of the coins, not from the marketcap only.",

If they don't do it and list scam coins I bet their reputation will go bad asap. They don't want to kill their own business, do they? While regulation is lessening, doesn't mean they don't need to protect their reputation if profit is their goal.",

The JPY doesn't look great. (Still a surprising move, I won't deny that.)I somewhat like the move, it could reverse the days the privacy coins got delisted from some major Asian exchanges, but on the other hand I fear they open the doors to all kind of shitcoins and scams.",
