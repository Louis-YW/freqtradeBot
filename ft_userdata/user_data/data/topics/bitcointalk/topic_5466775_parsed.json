Then you compare this to the bookmaker’s odds to see if you can make a positive return on a wager. This approach to sports betting requires knowledge of expected value (EV bets) and the bookmaker margin.First, the EV of any wager is the difference in probability placed by the bettor and the bookmaker.

Isn't that money more prosperous for you than the bot you have? I don't think anyone here is bored with money.",

As far as I know, betting sites like Bet365 are vigilant about detecting suspicious betting activity, and using a value betting bot might raise the risk of being banned.The cost is a % per bet. It-s not fixed but it is 2,5% per bet made.Yes. Will post results soon enough.I run the Bot in the cloud. The client needs to share the account details with me.There is no guarantee that anything is going to be profitable all the time. www.rebelbetting.com / for example this valuebetting software exists since 2009. Since 2019 the software is profitable if you consider all the users database. Valuebetting is known to be profitable, you just have to use tight filters and in the long run you will make money.The bot cannot be banned. I have known a lot of bots from previous years. They all work, they work as humans. What can happen with any bet365 account is that when you win much, they limit your stakes.Quote from: Dunamisx on September 14, 2023, 01:08:04 PMQuote from: simplierthenever on September 14, 2023, 11:00:30 AMHi Guys,I Run a value betting Bot for bet365 that bets automatically.Anyone interested i can give more details by PM.We can also deal with Escrow from here to manage the payments.

How attractive is it for gamblers, and how profitable can it be if we subscribe to a system? To be honest, this is the first time I've come across this system. I've been consistently gambling on sports, but my predictions are solely based on my personal analysis. If there's a system that could simplify my approach and potentially increase my profitability, I'm interested. However, I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information and education on the subject first.https://www.rebelbetting.com/valuebettingIt's easier this way.In summary: The true odds of an event/sport is often the one from PinnacleSports. When Pinnacle changes odds for the betting events, other websites take time to also reflect those changes. That's where valuebetting comes in. Let's suppose you are betting on a match of tennis betwenn Alcaraz and Djokovic. Alcaraz has 2.1 Odds to Win and Djokovic 1.8 Odds to Win. Pinnacle has new information on the market and lowers the odds of Djokovic from 1.8 to 1.6. In bet365 probably Djokovic 1.8 Odds will stay the same for a few more minutes. If we bet there at 1.8 we have an edge over the market because we are taking a better price and returns.Everyone can subscribe to this services. The problem is making accounts last because you will be a winner.Quote from: CryptSafe on September 14, 2023, 01:46:52 PMQuote from: simplierthenever on September 14, 2023, 01:22:37 PMQuote from: CryptSafe on September 14, 2023, 12:26:14 PMQuote from: simplierthenever on September 14, 2023, 11:00:30 AMHi Guys,I Run a value betting Bot for bet365 that bets automatically.Anyone interested i can give more details by PM.We can also deal with Escrow from here to manage the payments.

Isn't that money more prosperous for you than the bot you have? I don't think anyone here is bored with money.No bot guarantees nothing. How is that even possible? Would be stupid to say such thing.Just think about SP500. They do not guarantee anything but their returns for the last 100years were on average 9.8% per year:https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returnsThe advantage with Valuebetting is that you can have 8% ROI every year because the long run does not take 10years to happen.I don't have accounts to use the bot. So i'm delivering the bot services to someone who still have accounts.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on September 14, 2023, 02:36:54 PMQuote from: ryzaadit on September 14, 2023, 12:37:59 PMQuote from: Wiwo on September 14, 2023, 11:50:25 AM-snip-IMO, it's just automatically a betting place.You still need to find the resource you are gonna use for the bets, example you have some tipsters and they posted it. The bot will automatically place the bets for you based the information resource you are using.I believe, these kinsd bot are being used for arbitrage bet as well.If this is exactly what the bot does, then any need to have to pay it?  Why the op made it look like it's the bot that will automatically scan for games that are sure to win and then automatically bet on them for me?Anyways, I am not surprised though, people are looking for all means to make money, and I believe the gullible ones are still gonna fall for this most especially, if op does not put the price too high , they probably will fall thinking it's a bot that will automatically find games and bet for them, If I will still have to look for tipsters to pay, so the bot can automatically bet their games for me, then I don't need it .You don't have to look for tipsters or analyze anything. The Bot will select automatically the best games to bet and bet it also automatically.Quote from: Yaunfitda on September 14, 2023, 02:10:17 PMQuote from: simplierthenever on September 14, 2023, 02:00:08 PMQuote from: coin-investor on September 14, 2023, 12:52:24 PMQuote from: simplierthenever on September 14, 2023, 11:00:30 AMHi Guys,I Run a value betting Bot for bet365 that bets automatically.Anyone interested i can give more details by PM.We can also deal with Escrow from here to manage the payments. And i can offer 10bets for you to confirm that it works.Why not post all the information here and be transparent we have seen so many newbies offering bots to make a lot of money or automate everything you can do screenshots of how your bots work and how much you've earned here, and if you're making money here why are you selling it.If I own a bot and make money out of it, I will use it to make a lot of profit and also what guarantees that your bot is clean. You have a point. Thanks for reminding me how important is to market everything well.I will not post screenshoots because the Bots works in the cloud.But i will soon start a new thread with a more approachable view of the service.By the way im selling because i dont have more accounts to use it with and dont want to buy more.If I may add, maybe you can have someone trusted here in the community to test out your bot first? And then you can ask them for a honest feedback on your bot?And another, there is a bot that has been here in the community since 2013 if I'm not mistaken and this has been used by many gamblers here.It's here:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=307425.0 (Seuntjies DiceBot -Multi-Site, multi-strategy betting bot for dice. With Charts!)Best of luck.Yeah why not. Just get a guy that owns an account and i'm ok to do it. Or get one guy that lives in a country where bet365 is available, register and i will also send 10$ for the deposit.About the Dice Bot. You are joking with me right? How can a game where the Casino has a superior chance of winning than the client (51% vs 49%) can have a profitable bot?",

If you have guarantee that your bot work then it should be efficient enough to bet the casino because it should have that capacity above the casino to win most times and that will be a good reason for patronage but if no hope to go above human profitability, then what is the need using a bot?",
