I do not believe that it is a global payment method for all payments first because there is the problem of scalability, second because Bitcoin is valuable and it does not make sense to spend Bitcoin and keep alternative payment methods, such as fiat currencies or shitcoins and third because the trend that leads the history of Bitcoin tells us that it is not so. It was created as a P2P payment method but it is succeeding more as a store of value than as a means of exchange and I have no reason to think that this will change in the future, on the contrary, what I think is that as the price continues to rise and there is more and more scarcity of Bitcoin will consolidate even more as a store of value.",

Bitcoin is an asset already, it has all the valuables therein as an asset. In terms of daily usage as a payment system, there are lots of firms across the globe that accept bitcoin as payment. Don't also forget that it is also international valuable, because you can send bitcoin to anybody in any part of world. Over the years, you should understand that bitcoin has really penetrated significantly into the international market, so it will also take time before some of the wish your asking for to come into fruition, as there has been restrictions of bitcoin in some countries across the world, but that isn't going to stop the growth of bitcoin.",

Nobody will love to use a valuable assest for payment when there is fiat currency or some valueless altcoins. It means that you are not aware about the potential of bitcoin and how it can be used to hedge against inflation. Fiat is depreciating and it is more better to use fiat for daily spending than bitcoin. It is only some companies that pay their workers with bitcoin, because they are rich and have enough of it or better still they are promoting bitcoin to be used as a payment method. As time passes,bitcoin becomes more scarce and every bitcoin holder will appreciates their bitcoin to use as an investment and a store of value rather than using it as an alternative payment method.",

XRP for example and few others are partnering with banks for international transactions, if seems that these projects are 100 times closer to been a daily payment system than Bitcoin and this saddens me.Investments and means of payment are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Bitcoin (even including the lightning network)Â  is not ready to act as a global payment system.The major reason for people not using Bitcoin (or any other crypto) for everyday transactions is that they're not earning in crypto but in fiat. Nobody will be purchasing crypto for fiat just to pay for their groceries with crypto. That simply wouldn't make sense.There's also the \"bad money drives out good\" principle:QuoteIn economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that \"bad money drives out good\". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will gradually disappear from circulation.Ripple's bank partnership also doesn't mean that the world will turn to using XRP. As far as I know, it's not clear if the XRP would be utilised at all in such systems.Quote from: Outhue on August 28, 2023, 07:47:01 AMDo you think that Bitcoin been decentralised will draw it back from becoming something like what XRP and Chain Link are achieving right now? Should we just for once shut up about Bitcoin becoming a well acknowledged payment solution and focus on it becoming only asset? Nah.

Should we just for once shut up about Bitcoin becoming a well acknowledged payment solution and focus on it becoming only asset? Comparing bitcoin with centralized altcoins like XRP is not ideal. Bitcoin is not competing with them because they have different purposes and targets. The people who know the advantages of bitcoin will always use it and its usage keeps growing over the years, not just among the old timers but newcomers. I don't also think that we should compare a centralized payment system with bitcoin. Bitcoin was not created to partner with any intermediary but for P2P transactions. However, volatility and government regulation are all barriers to the adoption of bitcoin as a currency. People will not be willing to hold a currency whose worth fluctuates easily. Except the currency gains stability in the future, it might not be suitable to be used as a currency by most people. Also, I am sure that more people will be willing to use bitcoin if the government doesn't restrict its usage. Decentralization is not a weakness of the currency, in fact it is what makes Bitcoin unique.",

Bitcoin continuous use as investment is first because of bitcoin adoption rate, the number of its users are not realistically up like that and this has affected the use of it as payment method. If you go to some developing countries you will definitely see that itâs only the learned that are into bitcoin but once the adoption continues to grow and people see the effortlessness of using bitcoin as payment method, they will begin to see it as such. Secondly, Government continuous restrictions is actually stopping people from using bitcoin as physical payment. The use of it in countries where there is restriction it will certainly be a barrier to how freely people use bitcoin, so a more lessen restrictions about it from the government will definitely help. Thirdly, Bitcoin is still seeing as a precious asset and using it for just payment purposes most especially little transactions is seen as wasting oneâs precious assets just like how the Gold is viewed. Yes bitcoin primary aim is to be use as payment method but with the advantages like it been a good hedge against inflation and also a perfect ROI has made investors to hold on to it rather than using it. Many still believe it is still at an early stage and it should be hold on to and not spend just anyhow.",

Satoshi's plan for BTC is unique from what bitcoin users think of BTC. Trend followers invest to gain extra profits because of the constant increase in the price of bitcoin. People also hold Fiat in the face of inflation, which means that anything with value will have to be held by people. Not only bitcoin. Calling bitcoin an investment scheme, wasn't the initial idea of its creation. Since, people made profits out of bitcoin, everyone else wants to partake in the profits that follow bitcoin trend.",

So it's very unlikely that they accept bitcoin as a currency, the government controls the economy, controls us with fiat.

Initially Bitcoin was meant to work as a payment system because Satoshi introduced it as a p2p payment system but after sometime people realized that Bitcoin can be a great asset for investment purposes. The investors started investing money into it and as more money came into Bitcoin the value of it increased overtime. Now in current times it works as a store of value and also as a p2p payment solution, but it has lost some of its p2p nature due to intervention of centralized exchanges. However, it still works as a p2p payment solution without any doubt.Bitcoin is still a well known payment solution and many people are using it for that purpose even till this day. If you carefully read the signature campaigns of our forum then almost all of the participants that are working for those campaigns are paid using Bitcoin and that shows us the importance of Bitcoin as a payment solution. The payments made with Bitcoin are still decentralized and transparent at the same time. I don't think that Bitcoin will ever lose its main purpose even if it's value goes above $120k per coin.Bitcoin also works as a multipurpose solution these days, it's working as payment system as well as a store of value. The ones who invest in it consider it as a store of value while the ones that are being paid with it consider it as a payment system. We can find example of both of those approaches in this forum. The payment system example can be found on the signature campaign threads where participants are paid with Bitcoin, and the asset example can be found on speculation board also on WO thread where people consider it as an asset of investment.",
