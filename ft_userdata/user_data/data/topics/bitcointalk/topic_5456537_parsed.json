Although, Binance has been doing very well for the crypto users and specially the traders, but now the odds are against them and they might leave many other countries in fear of getting accused. After the allegations of Sec on Binance and its ceo CZ, the things are very totally blown up for them. I'm pretty sure that CZ is aware that he's being targeted this time very harshly and that's why he will exit his service from all those countries which are against Binance.I'm very sure that the exchange will do its best to continue providing its services to international users and they won't exit the crypto-market like others. However, things will be tough for them in coming months and that's the reason due to which they are stopping their services in the countries which aren't favoring them to continue the services and they aren't even giving them the required licenses.",

But one big reason is that it is, the regulators are being hard on them and won't allow to be on their jurisdictions operating with their own market. Hopefully, more reasons to come out coming from Binance themselves.",

They're slowly but surely leaving parts of the world that require some sort of proof that you're not running a scam outfit. As more people want proof that they're doing shady things, they seem to be bailing from those jurisdictions. If it was just one or two countries or regions that they were leaving or being forced out of or being sued in you could say it was just that one particular country or region or whatever. With them having to stop operations in so many places you really can't at this point still think that there's not something funky going on behind the scenes there.-Dave",
