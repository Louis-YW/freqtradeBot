Though, I don't know for sure if directly converting DAI to some other token is available.",

      "body": "I can suggest you these. 1. FTX, this exchange site doesn't need KYC if you are wanna sending your DAI but remember it has low limit which was around 2k USD for the new account (non verified).2. Kucoin exchange site. As far as i know this doesn't need KYC but there would be also limitation for the new account. As far as i can remember if the limit was around 2 bitcoin for daily withdrawal limit for non verified account. You can try to use both. If you are sending big amounts of DAI and you can use kucoin. FTX is very good exchange site.",
