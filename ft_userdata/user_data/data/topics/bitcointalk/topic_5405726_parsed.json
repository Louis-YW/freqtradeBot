Care you put your links?eg wolves of cryptoinvest answerstrader universityWhat kind of info you are looking because there is fundamental and technical aspect of Bitcoin that channels differently tackle or focus. Am I right that you are talking about Fundamental Â Bitcoin news when you are ralking about info? Many news channel on telegram that provide crypto updates in general and only few focuses on Bitcoin because most viewers preferred general crypto news. I share below few of trusted news channel that provides all info but they mainly focus on the securities and critical events in crypto.https://t.me/alphacryptoprojecthttps://t.me/CryptoVigilanteANN",

I know about BTC since 2011 though.If you really think that someone is posting some important information about Bitcoin on social networks, then you have not learned anything in the past 11 years. You can read everything important that is happening on this forum, and considering that you are not interested in trading, the speed of obtaining information should not be too important to you. Maybe you should look at the selection of various apps for smartphones that, in addition to the price, also have news aggregators so that you can always be up to date with what is happening. However, sometimes it can be quite irritating because you will be bombarded 24/7 with a bunch of news that will not have much sense and meaning.",

There are so many sites that people named but for me YouTube and Google did wonders. I agree with you. It's a case of putting the cart before the horse when one who is starting in the cryptocurrency space jumps the basics, history, and the technical side. However, it is complimentary when you learn you are learning about the fundamentals and when you are staying updated with the latest happenings in cryptocurrency. If you are looking to learn the basics, I'd recommend Andreas M. Antonopoulos. He is a household name. There are a lot of resources on his Website: https://aantonop.com/Check out his YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/aantonopFor the latest news update, I enjoy watching CNBC.",

I think all is more than enough to get information. If the problem is that you always miss information, it doesn't mean that the information arrived late, but that you don't have a scheduled time. Try to manage the time of day. So no matter how much information you miss, you can start very regularly.The above has a lot of advice, so you just need to take the time to read it.",

Mine might be a little cliche but I watch Humphrey Yang and Andrei Jikh for crypto stuff and even financial stuff.",

If not, why do you need all this constant flow of information? You are already subscribed to some of them from your words. To know about the latest significant changes, it is enough to use this resource. One way or another, each event is covered here and discussed in the comments, in which, sometimes, you can learn something useful. Personally, it is a pity for me to spend so much time reading news from various sources on a daily basis. I allow this in the event that it is required to check different points of view.",
