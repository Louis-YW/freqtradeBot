      "body": "Well, big changes in the 2nd round. The prize pool decreased drastically which is a bit disappointing to me. Even if the prize pool is not that much, you can still divide the prize into at least three winners. Those are just suggestions from me as I feel this gets less interesting compared to the first round. Since the contest has some restrictions like minimum bet and minimum multiple limits and the prize pool decreased too, unfortunately, I lost interest. It's still a nice contest for Crash lovers. I hope many players will give it a try. Good luck everyone!",

I just tried it and have been playing for over an hour now. This is a deadly game, especially when you are looking for a specific multiplier. I lost a lot already to hit this small multiplier. Then decided to play for fun and suddenly hit this. The round had already ended while I was taking the screenshot.
