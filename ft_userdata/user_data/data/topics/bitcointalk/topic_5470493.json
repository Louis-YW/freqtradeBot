I can say right away what it is, it's a cannabis-shop so you know. (Yes cannabis is legal here)But now I want to start to accept crypto as payment, I already tested this MetaMask but it's so limited since you can't pay with BTC. Or can you? If so then it's me that are stupid, but lets pretend i have right for now.  To the thing! I want to be able to accept payments with more crypto currencies other then ETH or those who are in the ETH network.If anyone have any knowledge of this subject and if you want to help me I would love to get any ideas, tips and recommendations whatever it may be, no recommendation is to stupid or to logic. I am a rookie at this.For example if I want to accept BTC and a few more the most used ones. What is the best way to do it? Should be friendly and easy for people to use, just scan QR code. I want to do it as easy as possible for the customer to pay, and I think a easy way is just to take up your phone open your app you pay from, scan the QR code and done. But that maybe not how it should work when you take a payment with crypto?If it's complicated to fix, it's not a obstacle I will learn my way how to solve it. Is it possible to just like example take your QR code from any online wallet print it and put it at the cashier? and then just cash out the crypto from my wallet to my bank or whatever I choose to sent it.I know that you can cancel a not confirmed tx and in this country cannabis and crypto is legal as hell. So this things won't be a problem for me.Please feel free to share your ideas & if it's some don't and do's with this type of payment method, yeah basically anything and everything, no reply is to stupid or to advanced, I will read it all very carefully and are very grateful for you people that choose to take your time to try to help me.I can pay something if someone guide me really good to something also of course or even helping me with it step for step then I can pay even more.Any questions or want to come in contact with me? Just send a PM or type in the thread. Cheers BabyBandit.EDIT: How safe / unsafe is this to do? Is it same safety as an hot wallet have or a cold wallet or is not at all like that? In safety concerns that say.",

      "body": "I have never implemented a crypto payment sollution for a physical shop... I did include crypto payments in online shops tough...If you're not afraid of managing your own crypto (for example: if you're ok with exchanging the crypto you earned for FIAT on an exchange), it might be a good idear to start \"small\": you could buy a hardware wallet with multi coin support, paste some stickers at your door announcing you accept crypto, and if somebody wants to pay using crypto, just generate a new address for them on the pc behind your counter? Same can be done with several other SPV wallets (it doesn't have to be a hardware wallet).Offcourse, if you want a more \"automatic\" or a professional looking approach, it might be a good idear to search for POS sollutions... I've seen a couple very professional looking devices popping up in the past... And some payment gateways make sure you're payed in your local currency by automatically converting your crypto to FIAT...Personally, if i would have a physical store, i'd probably take the first route: just install an SPV wallet or use a dedicated hardware wallet to create addresses (QR codes) whenever a customer asks to pay with crypto... Let them send their funds, wait for a confirmation, finalize the sale and use an exchange to convert crypto to FIAT whenever i need FIAT money... This way your investment is very small, and you're able to gain some experience accepting crypto before going for an automated sollution.BTW: if you're only talking about accepting bitcoin, you could look into btcpayserver, like the others have already mentioned...",

If that's what you mean, I will have to advise you to make use of any non-custodial wallet. You can use one that's built only for bitcoin, get any of them from the right source, and generate your wallet. Keep the phrase or private key intact, and you can generate a QR code from your address. You can also do the same with your altcoin since you also want to add them to your payment option. I read something like you wanted to convert your bitcoin and transfer it to your local currency whenever you wanted. If it's something that you will do very quickly, I think receiving payment in crypto you will have to be careful, because the time when it was used to pay for goods and the value as of then and when you will want to sell it and use the money to buy back products might not be the same and it might affect your business a little, so plan yourself well and proceed with caution.",

If you have access to the wallet, you can use it. This is the same recommendation I made for you: get yourself your own private wallet where you have full access to it, generate your personal wallet address QR code, and place it on your desk. I even prefer that method to using any third-party service because you can track your transactions, you don't need to pay any service provider any fee for using their service, and you have full control over any payment you receive with it, so why not? If crypto is legal in your place, then this is very much legal, and you don't have anything to worry about, provided that you can keep your wallet safe.",

There's no relation about legality.For safety, I think if you always use a new address from your own private wallet, it's nothing different with payment processor.I think using payment processor will make the customer easier to pay the stuff because it will be automatically converted according to the current Bitcoin rate and this mostly related to online marketplace.So if you not bother to convert fiat equivalent to BTC equivalent or even better all stuff you sell in BTC equivalent, you can use your own private wallet.",

You will lose your coins if you share your private keys.You can share your Public address for people and consider it as your receiving address. Problem is if you use only one receiving address to receive Bitcoin from many people, it will be hard for you to note what a transaction is.You can edit each transaction description but it takes more time because you will have to do it manually.QuoteIs it not legal or is it to unsafe?

Is it possible to just like example take your QR code from any online wallet print it and put it at the cashier? and then just cash out the crypto from my wallet to my bank or whatever I choose to sent it.First, I have the utmost believe that if you placed your company properly in the manner and shape which is best for the business, for example, the location, the products placements, the Publicity and the Customer Relationship Management (CRM), you will definitely sell as hell. Because the cannabis business is yet one of the successful businesses I've noticed other time, no cap.Secondly, if I was in the position to advise you on the best coins to go for, I will suggest none other than these stablecoins, like the USDC, Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI), Binance USD (BUSD), TrueUSD, TerraUSD, and Reserve (RSV) coins. They are digital assets you can bank on for your B2C business transactions, so that you don't suffer the price fluctuations in the wider crypto world.Lastly, you will have to generate your unique QR Code with the use of the wallet addresses you're using for the business transactions. Just like the conventional bank account numbers, you will generate a unique address use to accept your transactions and then generate a QR Code for it which you can then print out and place it on your cannabis shop.To generate the QR Code, the best platform I can recommend for you, which I also use for generating other QR codes for my businesses is the CANVA App. You can simply download the app through your Android or iOS device.Step 1: Sign up with your Google account or other available options to keep record of the details of the QR code and navigate the Menu bar by your left-hand side of the screen.Step 2: Navigate the 'App' button in the menu bar.Step 3: A page will be opened to you where you will be able to scroll down until you find 'QR Code', click on it.Step 4: Upon clicking on the 'QR Code' option, you will be given another option to select between existing design or a new design. Click on 'Use in new design'.Step 5: Select the option you most preferred. For me, my most preferred option is square and I do select the 'Instagram Post (Square)' option as the size of the white space where the QR code will appear.Step 6: A page will be opened where you are meant to add a link where the generated QR Code will redirect the viewer to, after scanning on your QR Code. In this space, copy and past your Bitcoin/Crypto wallet address to the address bar. Please ensure that the information on the Address is correct so it doesn't take your customers to another address. Check the alphanumerical carefully to ensure it's a match with your address.And voila, you have your QR Code ready. You can now go ahead and save the picture in a PDF document ready for print out. With the QR code, your customers are able to see your Bitcoin/Crypto wallet address immediately they scan and can therefore send in your money to your wallet, seemlessly.Above is the QR Code for Learn Me A Bitcoin website. You can however take your time to go through the contents on the website to learn more about how the Bitcoin technology works. Thank you and let me know if this helps!",

The more the better since people would really be having tons of options since not all would really be having that Bitcoin balance on their crypto wallet but somehow its not really that hard to make some conversionfrom coin to coin if ever they would really be only accepting one but i would really be that recommending on having multiple coin payment option. As for wallet then it would depending or according to preference but in speaking of security and assurance then better to make those transactions would be directly be that putting up into your personal wallet but if you do want to go with those common payment processors then its your choice. Recommendations above been mentioned with some users or posters above on which it would really be that a considerable option to take.",

If you manage your store well from product quality and quantity of goods in the store, it is easy to see if the goods in the store decrease but input revenue is lacking. Furthermore, if your employees can do it with bitcoin, they can also do it with fiat. I think it's a problem in recruitment and human resource management and has nothing to do with using bitcoin or QR for customers to pay. QR is a convenient method and is being implemented in most stores in developing countries.",
