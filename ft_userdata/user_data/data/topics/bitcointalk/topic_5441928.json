  "content": "Yesterday i came across an unfortunate incident and i never thought people will be so dump here We are having a PSL season 8 (a very popular cricket tournament where local and International players play the game) and it is being broadcast over the national sports channel locally and also worldwide.One of my friend told me that he has heard about bitcoin as it is being advertised in that tournament and he asked me if he should buy Bitcoin as it was advertised in PSL ?I was shocked as I never saw a bitcoin advertisement on national TV but later the whole story fold up.Actually, they were advertising the Bficoin BFIC coin to which my friend thought that it was bitcoin.   I told him that this is not real bitcoin but he insisted that I was wrong. I told him that bitcoin has 21 million supply and he told that this coin also had the same supply https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bficoin  He was of the view that since BFIC was advertised on national TV, it is a real coin and Bitcoin is just a clone or a scam.  He was not agreeing with me as he said if bitcoin was real, then it would have been showing at the PSL matches and not this coin.This is how the young generation can easily get detracked because of a lack of knowledge. I was really sad to see people don't want to accept reality or even research. https://twitter.com/BfiCoin/status/1630464832674594817",

      "body": "Perhaps you could explain to him further what is the difference between the two. I was on the expression that your friend just saw a part of the advertisement or it is too short that he didn't have a good look of what he really saw but when you told him it is different and he is debating over it then that's a signal that he got it all wrong.Bring him here in the forum, perhaps that would help if he won't budge about his belief. Maybe he will be enlightened more when he saw the magnitude of the difference between the coin that he saw and Bitcoin.IIRC, years ago many bought Bitcoin Cash just because they got confused with the two coins, but what they are really after is buying Bitcoin. Ticker symbols are very important because they are unique.",

You can only warn him but if he still not agree with you, only time will prove that he was wrong. That is why there are so many crypto scams in the industry and the main reason why people lose money in crypto is their own ignorance.Quote from: UmerIdrees on March 03, 2023, 03:33:04 AMHe was of the view that since BFIC was advertised on national TV, it is a real coin and Bitcoin is just a clone or a scam.  He was not agreeing with me as he said if bitcoin was real, then it would have been showing at the PSL matches and not this coin.So what happened in the end ? Did he agree to you or trusted the media? By the way, the media never said it is Bitcoin, it clearly says it is Bficoin. So you cannot also blame the media is wrongly projecting bitcoin.",

BfiCoin is abbreviated as BFIC, and Bitcoin is abbreviated as BTC. They share the same maximum supply; however, a quick Google search will reveal how distinct they are, beginning with their market capitalizations, the circulating supply, and the exchanges on which they are traded. Anyhow, if a lazy and ignorant individual continues to argue, it will only make him or her dumber. I would rather ignore the person and stop wasting my time.",

I had a friend that came to me just after Bitcoin Cash started to be traded.. and he bragged with me that he bought Bitcoin at $20 ... when the Bitcoin price was something like $30 000 (I cannot remember the actual prices) ...but it turned out that he bought Bitcoin Cash and not Bitcoin (BTC) I think it is cheap tactics to confuse people with copycat naming, but it only works for a short time and then people dump it again for the real thing.",

Marketing in itself cannot prove the legitimacy of anything.I guess that your friend is delusional. Bitcoin is NOT a company(or a product) and there's no need to be advertised, as if it's a product or a company. Many crypto companies are advertising themselves (just like Crypto.com on the last World Cup), no crypto company would pay for an advertisement that says \"Buy Bitcoin!\".This Bficoin clearly has nothing to do with Bitcoin. It's not even a forked version of BTC, like BCH or BSV. The names Bitcoin and Bficoin don't even sound similar. I'm surprised that somebody could be fooled into thinking that Bficoin is Bitcoin.",

I don't like to interfere in other people's decisions when it comes to finances, but I would definitely warn everyone that this is not the Bitcoin they may be thinking of. However, if someone really wants to invest in altcoins, it is his decision and we should respect that decision. I know some people who bought BTC forks and still keep them today, but I guess it's a good feeling to have one whole Bitcoin, no matter what it was called and how meaningless it was.",

There's a million other clones, scams, and traps that are disguised as the real thing just for the intention of taking money from innocent people thinking it's a safe vehicle of investment. It's really sad actually.P.S. If someone's profession is soccer, some other sport, making music, or entertaining people online, and they try to get you to buy anything other than a legitimate market leading coin, RUN. Run as fast away as you can and tell everyone you know that your favorite online/television personality or sports player is now a scammer. I bet you every single person in OP's picture has no idea what the heck bfiCoin even is. They are just being told to stand in front of the sign I'd imagine.The difference is very clear but their are some person that don't pay attention to details. The sound and the spelling looks somehow alike and many uninformed persons might be deceived. In my country many people have been misinformed and scammed because some set of fraudulent individual choose to clone a particular product making it look like the original. Many shitcoins promoters claim that their coins are the same or even better than Bitcoin. That's why I always encourage anyone that engage in Bitcoin awarenesses projects because we really need them.
