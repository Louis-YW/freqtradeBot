Nice story,I didn't know this one.There are very few persons on earth compared to the earth population which in percentage is less than 0.0000001% that have experienced a life changing event by going to a casino.These people are the ones who have hit a multi million dollar jackpot,only this can be considered a true life changing event.I have seen people winning small jackpots from 50.000 dollars up to 250.000 dollars but most of the time they have lost it again,while winning a multi million dollar jackpot can at least change your life for a minimum of 5-10 years even if you gamble that money away.",

It managed to keep the company up and running for a week which enabled them to basically make a comeback, basically turning the entire situation around. I also liked how the mindset of the founder was like, \"We're doomed anyway, might as well try doing something with it\". A true kind of YOLO moment for them. Honestly wouldn't even consider doing it at that moment if I was in their position, especially even considering to turn to gambling at that point.",

I am not sure if this is really a good success story for gambling. There are a few issues with the story that are not really good in my opinion. First of all, going to visit a casino with a \"depressed mind\" is the wrong state of mind before gambling. Personally I only try to gamble when I feel good, because when losing in a casino everything feels worse. So if I am already in a bad mood before by gambling session I would be afraid to downward spiral into a depression after losing money. Gambling with $5,000 as a CEO seems alright, his salary must have been quite high even during the startup phase. But making it to $27,000 within a week doesn't seem so live changing for such a huge company like FedEx. With that money you could have maybe bought one new delivery truck, or hire a few more employees. Not sure if it was worse it to spend one week for that money. Couldn't he just get a loan that is much larger and spend the week working to advance his business? We shouldn't forget the opportunity cost of gambling for a whole week and not being in the office working.",

If you think that winning multi million dollars is the only way for you to experience life changing success then you're wrong. It actually depends on the individual and how he will manage his funds and winnings on the casino. Just as you've said, you already saw a lot of people who won more than 50,000 dollars. More than 50,000 dollars may change an individuals life depending on how he managed his winnings as not all of them lose these.Based from the story above, 27,000 dollars is more than enough to change his life situation as he invested his money on his own company.",

He was just lucky i suppose, but how many users are this lucky? what if he had lost the money, he was already depressed if he had lost more possibly he may have ended his life. There are many other scenarios that could have played out if not for luck. I agree that casinos can play a role in changing fortunes when one is lucky, but how do you know when you look will play out or not, is the big question?Analysing how Mr Smith entered the casino, I am setting he had no intentions whatsoever to win, he most probably just came to play and have some fun maybe as a solution to his depression. in my opinion I think our intentions when playing in casinos matter a lot. if you play with an intent to win you might over analyse situations and make mistakes in the process. but when you play more freely, maybe just for fun,  luck may shine on you.",

It seems to me that the main figure here is the founder of the company, and circumstances may not have played any role at all - for example, if he had lost these 5,000 dollars, then I think he would not have been upset. On the contrary, he would clear his mind of doubts and stupid ideas about winning at the casino and in the same way would work with tripled energy and still succeed.",
