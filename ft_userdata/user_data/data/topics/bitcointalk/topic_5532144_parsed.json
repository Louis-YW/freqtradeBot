  "content": "I've been hearing a lot about Trump and other world leaders, big corporations, and countries and how they can impact Bitcoin and make it grow. While I agree that these people can impact Bitcoin, Bitcoin does not revolve around them. Bitcoin has grown so much without a federal reserve from the US or China. In less than 15 years bitcoin got a market cap of over $1 trillion without having presidents pushing for it or a leading economy having a bitcoin reserve, so why does it now seem like without these people or these things bitcoin can't get bigger than it is currently? Bitcoin got to this level in a time when there were so many regulations and scepticism, a time when some people made it their side hustle to make sure they shit on bitcoin, despite all these, bitcoin soared.The point I'm trying to make is that Bitcoin will keep growing and getting bigger without reserves so we shouldn't see these things or people as the authors and finishers of bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware of the significance of a bitcoin reserve in the US, but bitcoin doesn't need a reserve to succeed. It simply needs the market to keep trusting in it. Even with a reserve and people don't trust it, it will be worthless. The reason for the talk of reserves and the reason for big corporations getting into bitcoin is to make a profit, which means they need bitcoin to make a profit, but bitcoin doesn't need them to grow and that's why I said they need bitcoin more than bitcoin needs them.",

They are getting into Bitcoin to get a slice of the cake they have missed or neglected in the early beginning. The rejected stone has not become the Chief corner stone now everyone wants it, including those with powers has brought down their ego to embrace it. Bitcoin doesn’t need them, but they need Bitcoin to stay relevant and successful in the new financial world. Woe to those who still think that because Trump and some big companies are embracing Bitcoin, that's what will make it succeed.",

Bitcoin is not dead and it won't be dead in future in my opinion.In past years especially earliest years since 2009, Bitcoin was more sensitive to be dead but now in 2025, we all know that Bitcoin is not dead. Moving toward future, it's very likely Bitcoin won't be dead.Expectations changed very fast, from Bitcoin trades for something (pizza for example), to centralized exchanges, Bitcoin futures in 2017 with CME and CBOE, and Bitcoin Futures ETFs, Bitcoin Spot ETFs. But now it's not enough and people want to have Bitcoin national reserves. Without it, will Bitcoin be dead?No.https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/https://bitcoindeaths.com/https://bitbo.io/dead/",

They see that they don't have any options than to join the bitcoin moving train or miss out. Of course, bitcoin doesn't need anyone to grow, and bitcoin has proven that several times in the past. What spike up the price of bitcoin is the demand, and that's why you see that people are looking up to government. If they start buying, it will make bitcoin price skyrocket since they're big whales who are only stacking.",

Some of the government policies we have actually been talking about that will affect bitcoin is maybe it been banned by top countries like the USA this can cause FUD and as such result in the price dump as many of other country’s citizen wouldn’t want to get into trouble with the government also it could reduce the adoption rate coming from there just like what happened during The Chinese ban but would it stop its growth? No it wouldn’t even if it will be slower with the bans. Same thing is what will happen should the government turns towards bitcoin for reserve storage or even by relaxing the restrictions placed on it, policies like this will simply just cause many people to embrace bitcoin more and this in turn increases the adoption rate and increases the price of bitcoin, just like we saw with the ETF approval.But would the government turning away from bitcoin now actually make it die? I think you know the answer is No because bitcoin has grown so well even the FUD was high during its early years so right now where the adoption is almost global and the importance is there for all to see it wouldn’t be much of a thing without the government support.",

No it wouldn’t even if it will be slower with the bans. Governments can do things they want under constitutions in their countries and yes, they can ban Bitcoin in their countries but the fact is they can not control what happen in other nations.China ban Bitcoin, China crack down Bitcoin mining, in short term, it's bad for Bitcoin miners in China but they can do migration to other countries. Same with other bans against Bitcoin in other nations, and fortunately Bitcoin network is decentralized so that one or some governments can not kill Bitcoin.They can make impacts on Bitcoin market with their policies but if there is no global universal agreement among all nations and governments to ban Bitcoin, Bitcoin will keep crawling and become stronger with time.",

Assuming such a thing happens, bitcoiners would still find a way to thrive.  You're making it look like a decentralized currency like Bitcoin needs the government to survive. If that is the case, the essence of Satoshi creating it to be free of such dependence would then be lost.",

If Bitcoin miners could successfully migrate from China to other nations around and very far like the USA, they can do the same if the USA cracks down Bitcoin mining for example.Regarding to the USA, they have been becoming more friendly with Bitcoin and we have Bitcoin Spot ETF approvals in January 2024. Bitcoin adoption trend is up and it is shown with a massive Bitcoin Spot ETF approval wave in the nation, and globally more countries are following the Bitcoin adoption trend. I can be too optimistic about Bitcoin future but I see Bitcoin adoption trend is upward and irreverisble like how Bitcoin transactions are irreverisble and Bitcoin blockchain can not be rolled back like Ethereum blockchain.",

Aside the influence of Trump, Bitcoin wasn't created to be dependent on any alternative source, as long the market experience purchasing power continuously following the different pattern of the market, the price will always make new highs on it's own.
