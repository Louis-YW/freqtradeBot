I know a lot of people who explain to me that it is impossible to earn money from one account to provide food for yourself and your family. Therefore, bounty hunters create dozens and dozens of alternative accounts. What do they end up with? Daily participation in bounty, indiscriminately in all of them, with the hope that at least some bounty will pay out. This takes a lot of time; it’s not for nothing that they call it bounty work. This raises a direct question: when will these people learn something in order to actually acquire normal knowledge? Therefore, the topics are good, and the motivation also seems to be there; however, it is difficult to interest people who are convinced that they do not have time to study something else. People love their comfort zone, and this is why many people do not succeed.",

So if you see there are one thousand participants, actually, there are less than 700 unique individuals only. Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on October 18, 2023, 09:06:15 AMPeople love their comfort zone, and this is why many people do not succeed.This is why people remain in the same position for years. If someone doing an accountant job and loves it because accounts mostly work on the table, then he will stuck with it and he won't feel like he should get promoted. I have worked in a life insurance company where I see accountants even denied promotion to manager because the manager has to visit clients with field officers. If someone making good money from bounty and they are okay with what they doing, they are unlikely to learn more. But I don't think these people make much money from bounties as most of them end up scamming participants and sometimes these tokens do not get listed anywhere.",

But, if we talk about market condition of last 1-2 years, it is bad which has also affected the bounties and airdrops. So what we learned from here is that sometime earning through bounties and airdrops aren’t enough. We might not see good days until mid 2024, and maybe such days come again where market again crashes and making is impossible to make good money through bounties.

But we can only recommend what is best for them and how they can change their lives while making some extra income. These guys are privileged they get to know crypto and bitcointalk forum. We are very few and I can proudly say we are early. If, new comers can start learning skills while earning some money through micro task, it’s best in their interest. But if they keep insisting on making hundreds of accounts and cheating bounties eventually they are going down. They could earn in some bounties but not always, as they are going to get caught and all the work they have done will be going to waste. It’s not the best technique and unethical which most people give a shit about, but one should learn how to earn with ethics and follow rules. Things you mentioned does concern me, that’s why created this thread so, they can learn the importance of investing time in learning and come out of their comfort zone. As, bounties and airdrops earning is small and temporary. This not going to get them anywhere in their lives.

It is very thoughtful of you to read book, but it is important to understand books are not always good source of knowledge, One should select a books that is well-reviewed and interesting. Learning always challenges us and more we learn more we feel powerful. Why don’t you give a try to trading books and courses. As in your free time you can try some trading strategies and start building your portfolio. You must be already earning good, try investing it properly and once you mastered trading then you can choose another skill that is relevant to your field like management etc. As one day you are going to be manager in your company which might be beneficial in your promotions.

You are doing such a great humanitarian work, it’s must felt rewarding when you help people who are in desperate need of help. Hope you get rewarded in some way. As you are in field of crypto one must give a try to trading strategies, do learn some and give them a try as few exchange provide dummy $ to try different strategies. And if you got enough time I think you should go for marketing and designing skills. As you are doing humanitarian work, you must be doing it through some organisation, do learn those skills and start building your portfolio while working in that organisation social media advertisement through banners marketing and such.",

You really don’t get the chance to be innovative or productive.One reason I don’t blame them, they don’t know any better but, you wonder if they aren’t reading what’s been said about bounties , oh yeah! They aren’t having the time to research and improve themselves.",

CourseraedXUdemyHow about adding Youtube in the list. Youtube is the modern day university where you will get all the courses for free. You may have to pay for certain courses at Udemy and other platforms but Youtube is the best learning platform where you learn each and every skill.Some people may want a certificate after the completion of the courses and some platforms like Coursera may give you a certificate in the end but a certificate does not matter when you apply for a job / online work. All they want to see is your skill and your portfolio showing your work, the certificate won't matter at all.You are right about adding YouTube too, I didn't add it before because i think earning a skill with a certificate looks more credible, While pitching to clients through Fiver or Upwork they can showcase their certificate too, this way new users with zero reviews having a certificate will have edge over the one who does not have any certification. Yes, Surely YouTube is very effective in learning anything new, Will add in the OP.Quote from: Richbased on October 18, 2023, 06:37:12 PMSometimes these online learning platforms doesn't give precise information on what one really want to know and sometimes the terms used are either contradictory or difficult to understand so in this course it still requires the service of someone who is accustomed to the basic terminologySorting the advice of people that are conversant with the trading terms and pattern is very important as they will guide you on the various techniques to be applied in other to earn money and profitsI do not agree, i have been taking courses with Zero prior knowledge in the filed never stuck anywhere. There are courses for beginners, Join those.",

Thank you for this helpful topic, which will help many members here, especially beginners, who consider bounties and airdrops as their sole source of income. It is worth mentioning that Bounty works, such as social campaigns and airdrops tasks, do not require specific experience or skills at all. The only requirement is to have accounts with a sufficient number of followers and continue to share project posts and promotions in their accounts, forgetting that market conditions may constitute an obstacle for project owners and Bounty managers to cooperate in running marketing campaigns on the forum.For this reason, bounties, airdrops, and task websites mentioned above, such as Galxe, Taskon, and others, should be a secondary source of income for them, not a primary one. Instead, they should intensify their efforts in learning through reliable sources and accredited courses and acquiring the necessary skills for the fields that customers demand and in which they have an interest and prefer. Through well-known Freelancer sites or any famous platform or forum, they can provide services resulting from the experiences and skills they acquired and put in their time and effort. It is sure that within years, they will have an exciting future with many opportunities to earn money they never dreamed of collecting.",
