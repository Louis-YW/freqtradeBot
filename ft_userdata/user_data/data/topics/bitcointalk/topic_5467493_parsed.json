Kinda frustrating tbhI haven't mate since I don't use credit card for buying crypto and even if I'm allowed to do, I won't do it. Where are you located mate? Maybe the other exchanges that allows the purchase of crypto through credit card won't also work for you if you're in a location that's not supported by them.Otherwise, check bitpay, crypto.com, kraken and others which you can find through googling about buying crypto with credit card.",
