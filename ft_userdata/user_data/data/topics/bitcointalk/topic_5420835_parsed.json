  "content": "Too many topics recent days about FTX, this one is not about them. I would like to discuss something more general  In the past, I wrote Reminder for crypto newbies, traders. Be cautious with new exchanges and now I would like to remind newbies about exchanges or platforms with too good offers.We know the saying \"Too good to be true\". Again, it is true in cryptocurrency market. During this year, we have had two big lessonsTerraFTX exchangeTerraTerra and UST was built with a Ponzi scheme, with very high APY up to 20%. Below is a remarkable point on its vital Achilles.QuoteThe large demand for UST was driven because of a savings protocol called Anchor on Terra’s blockchain, which promised 20 percent in annual percentage yieldThe Ponzinomics were just too obvious: When you pay money for nothing, and stash your nothing in a protocol with the expectation that it will give you a 20 percent yield—all you end up with is 20 percent of nothing.FTXMonths ago, I am not sure when but maybe in 2020 when transaction fee on Ethereum network was very very high and expensive as consequence of DeFi and NFT hypes, FTX is a first or only exchange which waive withdrawal fee on ERC20 chain for users. The cost for them during those months should be very expensive.Honestly guys, I enjoyed it as many of you but I have never stored my money on that exchange too long. Back in that year, I did not like their user interface too and maybe it is another reason which keeps me away from FTX exchange.Institutional investorsIt is a terrible trend in the last bull run when people over-talked about institutional investors, venture capitals and they made decisions mainly based on backers and VCs. I am sure majority of cryptocurrency degens in the past bull runs simply look at a project's backers to decide spending money or not.They are lazy and believe in third-party, skip their own due diligent research and Alameda Research and FTX are very bloody examples for them this year. It should be recalled in future to remind people about consequence of over dependence on VCs.From Terra, you can learn that if a platform (in any area) gives you 'too good to be true offers', you should be extremely careful and should not touch it. Not only Terra but also many exchanges and DeFi platforms have a lot of staking programs for users (in altcoins or stable coins). I never touch them and you should not too especially if their offers are too good.From FTX and from my past topic about Altex exchange, you should never believe in exchanges which give you too good benefit. Short term, you can enjoy it but long term, you will never know how it end.Reference[CZ’s FAQ 8 - On LUNA/UST and Taking the Right RisksWhy Stablecoin Interest Rates Are So Damn HighTerra’s Crypto Meltdown Was Inevitable",

There can also platforms without offers, that don't give off a bad feeling but they are not not legit in their own way. My point is, regardless of the reputation of a platform or exchange, don't let your guard down that you become careless with them. Be careful with all platforms, offers or no offers.",

You have seen some of these loopholes as a sign for something not right and was able to take the hard decision not to leave your coins there. I think it is right when we see these things to stay outside and watch maybe we could be right some day in our observation. I have not search this myself to confirm what your point is but if I see traces of something being too good of an offer, my sixth sense is activated.",

Learn the lesson and stay safe with your keys.At first it is difficult to identify what is the purpose behind all the tempting offers as some of them have good support and are trusted by many. Yet the case of FTX has been one of the reasons why we have come to the conclusion that anything that looks mighty today will most likely collapse after the troubles that befell it.Nothing is ever really safe in crypto, but by being concerned with good security practices users will be able to minimize their losses. Don't put your funds on the exchange, and now echo this. Don't keep your funds on the exchange, and now consider this [Withdraw Your Money From The Exchange].",

Of course they are going to get stinged.The increased fee rate on conducting ICOs and IEOs on the bitcoin blockchain, drived the focus on the ETH blockchain and we had projects pulling in, pushing its fee rate higher and then, we have other chains promising blocs and protocols coming up and still do, the  you have a project, function on an expensive blockchain, promises to wipe up your fees and pay returns on qhat what deposited with them and you don't get scared, such investor deserves to lose that money and learn some lessons off it.
