It would only be economical to use Bitcoin in cases where the amount is huge.",

If you have a bitcoin wallet, there are many servers that you can connect to automatically which are available, all the servers can not all go down or stop working at ones.A supermarket chain has a central server to monitor loads of things such as stock levels, payments and customer traffic. If that server goes down, then it can cause problems for the supermarkets. My thought was that each supermarket could have ( may have) a local server to monitor the tills, cameras, stock levels and other stuff. Each of these servers could be used to facilitate payments and bypass the banking system. Bitcoin transaction fees could be a problem, hence the reference to lightning. Another option would be to use Bitcoin to fund an account or a gift card, and this could be used to make payments, although this may require connectiion to the main server. I'm really thinking of short term work arounds, rather than long term payment methods.",

Also, if the government of the country in which the Super market operates has placed a ban on cryptocurrencies, it could b accepted. Besides this I don't see why a blooming business of any sort should refuse to accept BTC as a means of payment when it is in that direction the world is veering. If there's a banking failure not occasioned by network providers lapses, the not just only supermarkets but any business at all can accept BTC as mode of payment for transactions.",

The next question is that those buying stuff in those supermarket will adopt Bitcoin or LN? Whereas they can go for cash like you are doing now in case the servers are down.",

But you need to understand that a busy super market can’t accept Bitcoin because for 1 the fees at the moment might be high for the sender and the second reason is the confirmation times.Even if the fees are low and network is not congested it might take over 30-60 minutes to get the confirmation. If they don’t wait for confirmation it would lead to double spends.So I would say l2 solutions would be perfect for this. As they are cheaper and faster.",

However, that's under the assumption that you have a custodial mobile wallet with a few thousand sat in it. Non-custodially, this can't work practically. Nobody carries a lightning node in their phone, neither a mobile wallet connected to their lightning node running at home. And there is always the possibility that the payment will fail in the cash register. On-chain is a no-go. You would pay a Big Mac for transaction fees alone. Also, customers can't be expected to wait 10 minutes (in the best case scenario!) for their order to finish.

At least, Sainsbury's allegedly fixed the contactless payments pretty fast. With online orders, I think that even accepting payments straight onto a Bitcoin address would be fine. People can pay less than a dollar for a transaction, which isn't that much. But I suppose the legal implications of it in the UK (considering that cryptos are treated as assets, not currencies there) are just not worth it for the supermarket chains to try something like that.I wonder why Tesco and Sainsbury's were both down at the same time. Does it mean that they use the same providers of some services, or was it a coordinated cyberattack?",
