I don't need a  golden cross to buy it and hold it.This golden cross is another confirmation of the coming big bull market for Bitcoin.When will halving happen?We don't know the exact date of the halving but can use estimated date.https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/176 more days and it will happen around 24 April 2024.",

If all could agree on what you said, that means Bitcoin might be getting ready for your disposition. Only that your image quality is poor and might lack the necessary information as I couldn't see the timeframe you used for it.On my chart;Daily: 50MA+100MA+200MA = PassedWeekly: 50MA+100MA+200MA = PassedMonthly: 50MA+100MA+200MA = Failed (only 50MA passed).Regardless, even with these combinations, Bitcoin is heading for the moon.",

We are going to see a lot of surprises incoming soon as we go towards the year's end and more closer to halving the event. This is happening always, there is no turning back in terms of halving and bitcoin going upwards in its valuation. This is why Bitcoin is meant for long-term holding only. Man, I am just having thoughts about \"those\" peeps who are still holding their Bitcoins from the initial days. They must be having fine dining right now and enjoying their 8th Bitcoin Hike.  As usual, we gonna see lot of threads where peeps will be sad as to why they did not choose Bitcoin back in the time and even some of them still not understanding how it works and fail to HODL.",

Therefore, I agree with you, but since political and economic changes may accelerate in the next two months, it is better to wait to see some upcoming economic data and the next Fed meeting before the certainty rate increases to more than 80%.",

And we have seen a lot of TA in the past as well when we are fast approaching the block halving that is a hit or miss.There could still be some noises in the background I believed like what is happening in the Middle East. Or the positive news that a Bitcoin ETF can bring in the market for next year. But one thing is for sure, it's going to be very hard to stop the market once we goes on another bull run in 2024-2025 despite the 8th golden cross or what indicator will take shape.",

So that is a big surge in the last 48 hours or so. And Since the OP has open this thread, the prices also goes up very fast. So it might have validated the golden cross but if I'm not mistaken, it will still goes on another run so most likely the price target is $40k for this November.So let's see, even though the halving is still very far, it seems that the investors are preparing for it as early as this month.I'm still wanted to see my speculations of around $40k-$50k at the end of the year.",

Usually it opens up being a trap and even if it’s correct, it’s a lagging indicator and if you entered when it crossed you would buy at a top more or less.I found the 200WMA to be accurate because it worked like 3 times without fair, however last year it failed to hold: think it was $22K but Bitcoin went lower to $16K or so shortly after.

Today eve, halving even, after halving even.When $100k happens, it all will be good buys.People are simply different. Some will focus on a shorter goal for a while. This is why they can use the halving event as their boundary because they expect that the price will soar high when that moment comes. Now for those people like you who have a higher goal, you can easily think beyond that.I think there will be a time where BTC can't increase anymore because all people are already here and then BTC already reach its highest potential. So, don't say that all time or each price is a best buy. Even today there are people who are still in losses because they bought above the price that we are seeing now but they have a good chance to recover as long as they continue hodling.",

However, fundamental is like the fuel that propels the movement in support of the technical analysis. In my opinion, from fundamental standpoint,  there are still so many uncertainties surrounding Bitcoin. First, what happens when the Bitcoin ETF are not approved? Will Bitcoin still go to the moon now unders such situation? Will this not make investors disappointed that they might decide to dump Bitcoin so hard? Secondly, what will become the future of Bitcoin if government insist on regulating it? Will this not change everything? These are many other questions are begging for answer to clarify the fundamental aspect of Bitcoin.",
