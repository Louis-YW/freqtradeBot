      "body": "Transactions with at least two to six confirmations are seemingly impossible to reverse because of the number of blocks built on them. The transaction with just one block confirmations is what bitcoiners believe is reversible because of the cases of the block in which the transaction is been orphaned. Orphaned blocks occurs when two blocks are sent simultaneously to nodes and as miners mined or build blocks the longest chain one is been picked by the nodes and the later dropped back to the mempool. So if your transaction happens to be in the short chain then it can be reversed. So seeing this means it can only occur to transactions in the top top blocks. A 5 blocks downward transaction can not be orphaned and there cannot be reversed. So 6 block confirmation can not be reversed Quote from: Obari on August 16, 2023, 06:00:47 AMJudging from this, the writings stated that it is difficult  and not impossible and I've been wanting to know if will be possible to reverse a transaction after a 6 block confirmation?",

Blockchain is immutable. It's decentralized and there is no central power, that's why you can't alter the data that's stored in blocks. Imagine blockchain case like, you upload picture on your facebook and then people start to download it and upload on another websites. How can you get your picture permanently removed from the internet? Keep in mind that if you ask them, they never respond. Your only way is the network's consensus, so, the only way to remove transaction from blockchain can only be done with the network's consensus.That's just what I know but there are people like o_e_l_e_o who definitely can give you a top-notch answer.Quote from: SmartGold01 on August 16, 2023, 06:29:36 AMThis is never possible to get it reversed after 6 block confirmation..Let say if a transaction is being sent immediate you can't reversed it because you had initiated the transactionElectrum Wallet has an option called Cancel that cancels your transaction by making a double-spend.

But most of the nodes do have full RBF yet so you can check your transaction in mempool. If you see the RBF option in green color like the segwit in the picture then it is flagged RBF I don’t think trustwallet support RBF just yet but is ok to import the seed into BlueWallet, it supports RBF and if you see the pending transaction then you can click the bump fee option and then increase the transaction fee. But if the transaction doesn’t have RBF flagged then you can double spend it by sending same amount of the bitcoin and then using a higher transaction fee than the first one initiated",

So if your transaction happens to be in the short chain then it can be reversed.The correct term here is stale blocks. Orphaned blocks refer to blocks without a known parent (as the word \"orphan\" implies), which is something different.Also, a transaction which is included in the losing chain will only go back to unconfirmed if it is in neither of the block at the same height or the block at height +1 in the winning chain. Otherwise it will remain confirmed despite the chain split.Quote from: Fiatless on August 16, 2023, 07:35:49 AMThe sender can increase the transaction fees and also change the recipient of the funds which will make the former transaction invalid (Replace by Fee (RBF).No, it won't. Broadcasting an RBF replacement does not make the original transaction invalid whatsoever. The original transaction remains entirely valid and could still be included in a block if a miner chose to do so or did not learn about the higher fee paying replacement.Quote from: franky1 on August 16, 2023, 08:46:42 AMif a pool only matches the speed(50%) of the rest of the network it will never catch up and always be 6 blocks behindYour numbers are all wrong.If you take the equations from section 11 of the whitepaper and plug in the numbers for an attacker with a probability of 0.5 of finding the next block (i.e. 50% of the hashrate), then the probability they will catch up from any deficit is 1. You are assuming that both attacker and honest miners will mine blocks at a regular 10 minute interval. Given that there is random variance, and given an unlimited amount of time, then the attacker will in fact always catch up. With honest nodes simply following the chain with the most work, then honest miners have to stay ahead at all times, whereas the attacker only has to take the lead once for all honest nodes to then switch to their malicious chain.Further, a 60% attack does not mean the attacker is 10% faster. If the attacker has 60% of the hashrate against an honest 40%, then the attacker is 50% faster than the rest of the network.A 70% attack results in the attacker being 70/30 = 2.33 times faster, and an 80% attack results in the attacker being 80/20 = 4 times faster.Quote from: franky1 on August 16, 2023, 08:46:42 AMas you can see even after doing over 20 blocks costing millions of mining power you may only get to overtake within 20 blocks if you had like 80% of hashpowerAgain, not true. With 51% of the hashrate you are mathematically guaranteed to overtake any deficit. You certainly don't need 80%.",

As long as you don't have that power or other miners ready to join hands with you, that is a mission impossible because once a transaction is confirmed, that is the final, it is good as dead living that no longer breathe, that block will remain sealed forever. However, if it's an overpaid fee in a transaction, perhaps you made a mistake during the course of a transaction, they may (low chances) return the fees to you for the error.",
