  "content": "A whole lot is going on in our society's today through different channels, and the social media is one of such. There's a whole lot on socials that  many persons haven't taken into consideration as they get carried away with the events and cruise going on on social media platforms to the length that they compromise their privacy and security at the expense of social media cruise catching and fun.There's a fast growing trend on social media platforms over the years now which caught my attention. An instance, like on Instagram or Facebook where a stranger will just make up a post asking interested persons to drop their phone contact numbers so they could be added to a hot Whatsapp group or a platform where they would have to connect with men and women for dating and sex talks, or have access to funny jokes/memes etc. Then you will notice a lot of phone contacts dropping like when it's raining. And I get amazed by what these persons really believe to achieve by exposing their contacts freely and easily to the public.Here's a few probable factors you should bear in mind next time you want to do that:1. Anyone can see and have access to your contact any day anytime as long as such social media platforms like the Facebook for instance still exists. And more often than not, it may not be your targeted person's or reason as to why you gave up your contact. what I call wrong target.2. You may end up being bugged constantly with calls by strangers, not just any strangers but wrong and parasitic strangers.3. You can easily be traced, accessed by persons with evil intentions, and moreso, sometimes these contacts are contact numbers we might have used as part of a requirement from an online registration of some financial account or instrument. If you're observed to be one rich folk some bad dudes might wanna clone your contact number (I don't know how they possibly do that) and be receiving certain vital financial related informations that could be used with a brute-force to crack down your asset and others, etc.All this post is just particularly about is that don't get carried away by the antics of social media platforms as there are more wolves than folks.",

So as a user we need to more aware what we post and simple put in our minds that we need to think before click for our awareness.",

Throughout this time, I was carried away until I was duped, at that point I realized my errors.I just saw an advertisement on Facebook for the sale of eggs and the prices was amazing, if I purchase I will get a lot of gain, if I sell in my own place. what really encouraged me is that you will receive the eggs before the payment then I starting to put calls across to confirm whether it is legit, which I confirm by contacting the number I saw there. We all reached an agreement with them that I will pay after receiving the goods, few hours later I received a call from them telling me that for me to get the goods in time I have to pay a sum of #5000 before getting the goods fast, since I'm eager to get it I then rush and send the money to them. After all this process they called again to request for another money again, from this stage I began to realise I mess up, that is how my just go. I then start to receive phone call from different persons claiming to help me get me my eggs. This is how I know disadvantage of advert on social media platform.We should be careful not all adverts are real.",

Most of the young girls learn prostitution from social media, parents are carried away with social media, no parental guide and care no more, homes are broken and friends are broken too because of what we learn from social media.I pray the damaged social media has caused us don't go beyond the level it is now.

There are many ugly stories of fraud, sextortion, or other hateful crimes.Therefore, everyone, especially young people, must be warned of the need to exercise extreme caution and not display any information that violates privacy on social media.",

Somehow how these guys have a way of sourcing people's phone numbers. They may call you and tell you all sorts of juicy propositions and deals, they're all scams. Also the kind of places you register with your email. Be very careful with the kind of sites you give out your emails to. A lot of them are just phishing sites. The kind of apps you grant permission to on your phone is also a way for scammers to target you. Only grant permission to your contacts, location, and other sensitive things to trusted apps if you must. You have to make a conscious effort to protect yourself from scams because they come in different and sophisticated ways.",

It is essential to be cautious about who we give access to our contact details as we can never know what their intentions might be. We should always be vigilant and protect our privacy and security by being careful about the information we share online.Furthermore, it is also crucial to remember that once we put our information out there, it becomes public property and can easily be misused. We should always think twice before giving out any personal information, especially our contact details, and only do so when necessary.",

Don't be carried away, what an interesting topic, most of us now are easily carried away, which is very bad, we are move by what we are seeing. For example my neighbor is driving an expensive car, and because of that I will do anything either good or bad just for me to get money and be like neighbor. This things are more common with female then compare alot without knowing how that person is doing, they are easily carried away with what they see and hear, life is not suppose to be so, if we can live life in our own way without Envying other people or trying to compare ourselves with others we won't be having much problem in life.",

But they don't have proof of any method that could have produced an accidental nature of this complexity. All they have us talk.Even though they don't have any proof, they keep on talking more and more that nature is an accident. Many people believe them, because most people are too busy to think a little. Think about what? That machines have makers. So, the machine of nature must have a maker, too.Studying the history of the Bible and its writers, and the nation that produced the writers, in a scientific way, shows that the Bible is a record of what happened in the past. So, what should people believe? The record or the self-styled liars of much of the scientific community?",

This is why phone numbers now a day are crucial information, especially in those countries where their phone numbers are also connected to their personal information.

Do we even know that there are voice-changing apps that can be used when a male is speaking, but because he is using the app, you will hear a woman's voice talking about sex and other inappropriate topics. In order to get your attention, he may even promise to visit you when you're ready if you send money to the specified account; after that, he won't even return your call.One of my friend had an experience similar to this before the guy was very serious about doing even video call, the guy doesn't know he's using his girlfriend when they want to do the video call I was warning him don't do these but he insisted that he'll even marry her that's how he end up getting scammed by a stranger.OP I appreciate your advice for young people.
