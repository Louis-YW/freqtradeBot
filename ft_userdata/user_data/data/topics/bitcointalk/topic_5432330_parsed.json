I never gamble actually when I am emotionally bothered due to some personal problems because that will always affect my decisions on where and what to bet. It’s safer to just stay at home than to lose everything in gambling in times you think your negativity rules over your positivity. However, in times I’m feeling good and lucky, that would be my best time to gamble and explore different games in casino.",

Yes. Our own mood usually determines whether its best to gamble or not. Otherwise, forcing ourselves to gamble even if we know there is something wrong within ourselves will only make the situation worst and will mostly end up our betting into the losing end. So when I gamble, that is the time I’m feeling positivity and lucky and hopeful that I would be in profits and attract more winnings.",

However, in times I have a bad feeling or my mood isn’t good at all, there’s no way I will gamble. Because I know for sure, I won’t like the outcome either since it will all be losses than gains.",

      "body": "For me, it's all about the feeling of urgency coming over you. If you have to force yourself and subject yourself to some sort of fight or flight, it's most likely your ego taking over. But if you just feel it in yourself, like you don't have to force anything, and you just know right then and there it must be done at once, it's most likely your intuition talking. But honestly, especially when making bets or major decisions in my life, I tend to be deaf on both sides. There have been instances where people sre biased towards their intuitions because they tend to inflate the times it was right over the times it was wrong, I myself am guilty of this too. So I trained myself to never base major decisions over things that don't make sense at all, gut feeling and ego included. So as a result, none of my games were ever connected to anything without scientific or probabilistic basis. I still lose games of course, but at least I don't blame it on anything, I just know it was a chance encounter. And I make smarter decisions relatively.",

But I find it’s profitable enough that you gamble for entertainment, because gambling will never actually us avoid from losing, we only make profits at the start but everything still end up back in the casino especially if we still insist to gamble after profiting.",

I can understand what you mean and I admire people who can differentiate the source of their inspiration. In my case, unfortunatelly I still haven't managed how to do this properly. I feel confused if it's my intuition of if it's my greed which are leading me in gambling. All I can do is to stop playing when I reach my limit. Regards that I have no issues, but I would like to be wiser on the aspect you mentioned to make my gambling sessions more productive and profitable.When you develop genuine intuition you are likely to make profit more often and leave the table when things aren't favourable.",

This will give you time to do other more important things in your life;Quit while you're winning. If you continue, chances are you will lose, because the odds are always against you;Stay away from high risk games where you can lose large sums of money very quickly;Limit the amounts to be spent, so you won't have so much trouble if you lose.     Practically all of the points mentioned above involve controlling our emotions in order to be applied, so I believe that much more than intuition, it takes wisdom and a clean mind to achieve good results.",
