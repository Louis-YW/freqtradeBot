  "content": "It is very rare to see a Nigerian, with the Nigeria spirit, that is not hardworking. But the question is: are you working hard in the right direction? Do you have the result or progress to justify your input? If the answer to these questions is no, then you need to stop and evaluate what you are doing to know if that is what you should be doing or if you are actually doing it well. Nothing beats hardwork but when the energy is not directed to something worthwhile or the right approach, it will be like working like elephant and eating like ant. I am not saying that failure and mistakes are signs that you are not hardworking; they could be part of the learning process but it is better to make mistake and sometimes fail in something worthwhile not being busy for nothing. Some steps to adopt to ensure you are working hard in the right direction include but not limited to: 1. Evisaging the end from the biginning: Before you even get started, inquire about the end result or imagine the end result to see if it is worth the time and energy. By doing this too, you will be able to be properly guided. 2. Always do self appraisal: Aways find time to evaluate your achievements so far as one step as a time is the key to great accomplishment. You can effectively do this by setting short term and long term goals. Always do well to check how much of them you are achieving before you work so hard for nothing. When you find something worthwhile, give it your best and by then, you will not be working hard in the wrong direction.This is my personal observation/experience, I will be more than delighted to know yours.",

Let me just take it as my life story.Quote from: adultcrypto on October 13, 2023, 01:44:25 PMIt is very rare to see a Nigerian, with the Nigeria spirit, that is not hardworking.

If the answer to these questions is no, then you need to stop and evaluate what you are doing to know if that is what you should be doing or if you are actually doing it well. talking about 9ja true spirit being rear. Working hard and not achieving your dream does not mean that you are not a 9ja with the true spirit.One of the problem sometimes is that we work hard but in the wrong direction. That is quite understood. Talking about proof of work, you can only achieve your goals when there is a contentious stream of income just like this forum. It's very difficult for some people to show you the way but always use the past to judge you. Or blame you for not being smart.Talking about evaluating  this opportunity. Life us a gradual process. In anything you do in life you must start somewhere just like this forum we have different ranks ranging fromBrand New toNewbie Jr. MemberMemberFull memberSenior memberHero memberLegendary.From this arithmetic progression, you can see that one is gradually growing. Rome was not built a day.

I think verse two of the thread is taking almost thesame thing in verse 1. Anytime a man wakes up is his morning. Someone life story can be a mutivation to others but not really  following the wrong part. All are still the learning process. No matter how smart one tend to be you can not run faster than your shadow. There is always a beginner in every field. (JJC) \"journey just come\" It takes time to grew up in a new line of business and not busy for nothing. Afterwards before you became who you are today you just started like this. Some things are left unsaid than criticisms.Quote from: adultcrypto on October 13, 2023, 01:44:25 PMSome steps to adopt to ensure you are working hard in the right direction include but not limited to: 1. Evisaging the end from the biginning: Before you even get started, inquire about the end result or imagine the end result to see if it is worth the time and energy. By doing this too, you will be able to be properly guided. Evisaging the beginning from the end. Life don't give you what you expect. Sometimes you might work through out your life, thinking you are on the right track but only for you to discover that you have been working the wrong direction just like you said. Working hard in the wrong direction does not mean someone did not see the end from the beginning. But sometimes nature gives you what you don't expect. If your pretty lucky to have achieved most of your dream, it doesn't mean other are joking.Quote from: adultcrypto on October 13, 2023, 01:44:25 PM2. Always do self appraisal: Aways find time to evaluate your achievements so far as one step as a time is the key to great accomplishment. You can effectively do this by setting short term and long term goals. Always do well to check how much of them you are achieving before you work so hard for nothing. Goal can be achieved when you are in the right track. If a man is given an opportunity in a right way, I think his hard work will not be in vain. No body is happy planning and not being able to execute any one. Each an everyone has his/her own story of life. So if yours is a good one then you are lucky. But don't always see peoples mistakes as inability.Quote from: adultcrypto on October 13, 2023, 01:44:25 PMWhen you find something worthwhile, give it your best and by then, you will not be working hard in the wrong direction.Still working on it. And I believe this time will not be like before. And I pray that the previous experience should not repeat itself.Quote from: adultcrypto on October 13, 2023, 01:44:25 PMThis is my personal observation/experience, I will be more than delighted to know yours.All has already been answered.",

But I guess the most important thing is to work smart and pray for grace to meet the right opportunity/people at the right time.Some people are very smart and at the same time hardworking, but they are not successful because they are not connected to the right source of information that will accelerate their growth.Most of the successful people around world just got connected to a right idea, got consistent on it and gave a bit of hard work towards it.If God don locate your normally like this eh, everything go just de very simple but you self go need put in the right effort and energy to fit de successful.",

      "body": "It is very unfruitful to work in the wrong direction, but the major problem is, how you know at first that you are working in the wrong direction, this thing most times happens unknowingly, no matter how smart you are, it takes grace but that's if you believe that grace exists.Life itself is full of so many uncertainties, so it is easy to troll this way but we pray we discover it early and retrace our steps.It will be very disappointing to see oneself working so hard to make it in life but victory ain't coming, I believe in diversification, trying new ideas to see if things will change for good.",
