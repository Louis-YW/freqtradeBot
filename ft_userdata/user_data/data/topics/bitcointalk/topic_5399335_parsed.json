By the way, you can add the betting odds of this fight if it's already available as that's very important so we can discuss the \"gambling\" matters. 15 KO vs 16 KO, this is a good comparison as I think both are heavy puncher based on their record.",

There are no betting odds for this particular fight yet, I tried to google it and I could not find any. Well, this is an interesting fight as both boxers have a good record, but you are right, maybe Bryan will be listed as the favorite here.@OP, please make a poll so we can vote.",

Ruiz Jr beat AJ, but Joshua was able to avenge his lost. Perhaps there will be one from the US,  but it could be in the next 5 years I reckon.

While Dubois is the more fitted fighter, muscular.Dubois though, still a huge favorite, 1.05 and this could be over in less than 5 rounds. Even the opening for this is over/under at 3.5. Clearly the bookies know that this fight is not going to last. Unfortunately, I have to skip this one though. But for those who are going to bet on this fight, best of luck.Dubois is also my favorite to win the fight, he started out strong earlier in his career and he was touted to be the next Mike Tyson, and many predicts that he will the next big thing in the heavyweight, but it was derailed by the fight against Joe Joyce, but now he can fulfill his dream to become a champion, this is not going to be an easy fight as both fighters are knock out artist, of course, I will not rule out an upset as Bryan also has a good record and has a big punch. 9:1 underdog? Wow, it will really be an upset if Bryan pull this off. And we all know that in heavyweight division, anything can happen as this guy as so powerful that a single punch can change the outcome of the fight.So for underdog bettors, this is a dream,  , Lol, and yeah, who knows, we can't rule out an upset if Dubois become too confident and just walk through Bryan and then caught with a huge punch.",
