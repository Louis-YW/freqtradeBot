You can follow these tips written on this article[1]Simple Ways To Keep Your Wallet SafeThe good news is that there are simple ways you can protect yourself from these types of attacks:Do not click on any unknown links. If it’s too good to be true, it usually is.Do not interact (swap, trade, sell, or use) with any unknown tokens you didn’t verifyDo not attempt to connect your wallet to a Decentralized Exchange to collect free airdrop tokens or swap the unknown tokens. The moment you connect, you’ve given it permission to drain 100% of the crypto funds in your walletAvoid posting any identifying information in tandem with your wallet addressYou can read more information about dusting attack in the link below.[1] https://anchain.ai/blog/crypto-dusting-attack/",

If you find those, just don't click any links provided by those tokens, don't interact with the tokens as they will drain your money with the fees, etc. One way to check this is to check the discussion on bscscan or any block explorers of your choice, they will tell you if it's scam or not because so many people have faced this shill tokens.",

Thank you in advance computer ninjas The network is overrun by spam tokens. I also have lots of them and do not even bother to check what they are. In your case, the \"different wallet picture in the corner\" asking you for a code could have been a way of getting your code and eventually leading your wallet to be drained. So, sending the token back to its owner could trigger the same reaction.The best course of action with any unwanted tokens appearing in your wallet is to simply ignore it. Anyway, here you can find 5 simple tips to identify spam\\scam Tokens!",

Never think to send back tot hem ebcuase this may also open tanotehr scam process by them. This may be also a trap.However, you may become one of the types of scams, so, beware, and better to stay away from whatever they order from you. If you follow what they instruct, you may be trapped in their scam cycle as well. This is very common to happen. Actually, people or especially scammers can easily send shit tokens into Ethereum wallets or whatever wallet address because it is easy to create such tokens. This is one of the ways why scammers commonly will use this trick to trap the victims. Once more, whatever they want or instruct, never follow. Just ignore it. But, if you are so worried becuse you have been a target of scammer, you may no need to save many assets in your account. This is not safe to save your inevstment in online wallet or exchanges.",

Thank you in advance computer ninjasThis is very common and if you have a big enough amount of money in a single address that can be more than enough for you to become a target of scammers and hackers, after all we must remember that transactions are public and anyone can see how much money is allocated to each address.So as it as been recommended by other users the best thing you can do is to ignore those tokens and to never open any link or try to interact with those tokens at all, or you could lose the money you have at that address.",
