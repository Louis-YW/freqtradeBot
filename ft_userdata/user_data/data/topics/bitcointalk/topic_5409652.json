  "content": "As my favorite site \"preev.com\" seems to be down(entirely terminated?) since a few days ago, I now found a clone site that's basically doing the same thing so I'm happy but really wish to know what happened to that site as it was my go-to site whenever i wanted to check value and to see how much i would send etc.Where do you check btc value and converter to fiat currencies?Thanks in advance",
