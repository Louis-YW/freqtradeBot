  "content": "It is pretty great that we can participate on such an old and legenedary forum.    Imagine the amount of BTC it has helped to exchange - by now probably more than even localbitcoins.com even did. It also goes to show you that forums are timeless (maybe, more on that below) and that despite all of the 'social media revolution' they are still a great way to get to quality content and have engaging discussions. And even as Google et all phase out forum threads as part of their search engine result (part of a larger problem of big tech intentionally enshitifying/sabbatoging/censoring /monopolizing the information landscape)  at least we can still do site:bitcointalk.org \"my query\" to lookup stuff or even - yes - use the search engine here.   It's pretty decent but we probably should admit to some extent the UI here is a tad cluttered if one was to start getting nit picky.   Yet I'm not trying to nit pick here.  I want to address a deeper issue.   And this is the issue of bots and real people who just use ChatGPT to create content on here.  Perhaps to spam their avatar/banners or to harvest cred for better conversion in the forum's marketplace. Could not help but notice a friendly competitor site that is gaining some popularity which uses Lightning network to allow its users to 'zap' one another aka v4v micropayments.  Perhaps now, 2023 being a pivotal year in the advances of AI, is time to look at the next major version of Bitcointalk and what kind of features we would need to maintain & encourage healthy organic discussion here long-term ie- 'post mainstream AI'. Ideas are welcome; feel free to share your thoughts and or perhaps the mods/admin can chime in as to any progress or plans on said next version. And on that regard, one more idea to consider - of course we need to protect anonymity but a way to currate users or lists of users and share them with one another (perhaps in the form of whitelists/banlists) migth be another way to mitigate the issue of grifters and bots.    This might also imply some fundamental UI updates to make such a feature more seamless with the general UX of the site. edit: and yes btw I'm a bit of a longterm lurker only most recently awakened and that is primarily the inspiration for this post; I'd  like to begin particpating here more often but find myself a tad skeptical of the sheer mass of users and the obvious type this legendary site attracts.",

It's my opinion on it.Chat GPT relies on available big data to cook their answers and it even uses lot of information from legendary forum Bitcointalk to compose its answers. Chat GPT actually depends on Bitcointalk for many answers.If you see AI-created posts in bitcointalk, report those posts in AI Spam Report Reference Thread",

In the forum, there are rules against the use of AI and suddenly changing the rules just to make it at par with other sites will defeat it's purpose of trying to keep it free of such. It's as if one is trying to monetize the forum, hence they'd need to encourage anything that will rake in profit, right? Bitcointalk is not some social platform like Facebook or X(Twitter) that needs to change or conform to a certain style to meet up market demands or beat competition; it's just a place where individuals meet up to share ideas. Believe me, I don't think Theymos will be in a rush to consider your suggestion.",
