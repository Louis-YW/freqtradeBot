  "content": "The scope for growth in stablecoins is much greater than that of TetherDollar supply is very limited and cryptocurrencies are plentiful, According to an estimate, the number of cryptocurrencies created so far has exceeded 8000, which are much larger in volume than dollars, To fill this gap, large amounts of dollars are needed that banks are not inclined to print, so this gap is helping to create a (multi-quadrillion dollars) market need for stablecoins. It is possible that we can create stablecoins in the amount of quadrillion, compared to Tether, which can be exchanged at a rate Â of 1:1 to Tether, which can create a quadrillion or multi quadrillion dollars market. For which a separate blockchain can be created that can print stablecoins by providing liquidity to your assets. This way it can avoid many different pairs like DAI and VAI which creates a lot of complications, as that reduces liquidity and reach, as too many pairs trap cryptocurrencies in different places which reduces their demand. Moreover, it can eliminate opportunities to provide liquidity by spending dollars from your own pocket, which is the cause of most scams.",

      "body": "Central banks, commercial banks are not related to cryptocurrencies, stable coins.Central banks can print their fiat currencies without gold back behind because the gold standard was over decades ago. Their fiat currencies with high inflation have decreasing purchasing power with time.Cryptocurrency companies, stable coin companies can use Mint function in Smart contract to mint their stable coins without US dollar or fiat currency or gold back in their treasuries. They claim that their stable coins have good pegs because their treasuries have enough and equivalent assets for their stable coins. However we can not trust them and the fiasco of Terra UST stable coin as well as failure of Terra Foundation Guard to protect that stable coin peg is very bloody lesson.",

You also can't compare all existing cryptocurrencies with just dollars, in fact all countries have their own fiat with (again) unlimited printable amounts.When the dollar's depreciation rate is too slow, perhaps the issuing company will create another Xfiat-pegged stablecoin. On the other hand, if fiat can really be set limited then the law of supply and demand applies in the crypto market. Banks don't have to print more.",

Banks don't have to print more.Governments don't care about inflation in long run and they only want to reduce problems from short term inflation on their political career and their chances to be promoted in their career. With this mindset, it's hard to have well-thought economic policies from governments and their staffs.They have every tool requires to make inflation and their citizens can not stop them. The coming tsunami of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDCs) will make inflation of fiat currencies worse.Stable coins are different stories as they operate on blockchains, with smart contracts. You will not have stable coins on Proof of Work network because stable coin companies have need to mint new supply for their stable coins when they want. Proof of Work blockchain can not help them to Mint new stable coins instantly like this.Because they can mint new token supply when they want, their stable coin values can be not stable. We don't know when a stable coin peg will be de-pegged.",
