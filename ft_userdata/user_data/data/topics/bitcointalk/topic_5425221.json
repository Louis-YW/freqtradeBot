You might have given out your email id to someone on the internet and it got into the hands of scammers in the end, hence you are receiving these mails. On the other hand, try contacting paypal, they are already aware about these problems.",

Have someone ever bought Bitcoin in Paypal and how it works?I'm just worried that my email is registered without me knowing.They cannot register your email without activating the link they will be sent you on your registered email, and you cannot use your Paypal without providing basic info like email or location you have to KYC before they let you use PayPal for purchases obviously it's a phishing email I used to have Paypal but I'm more on Crypto I abandon it but they do have tight security, these scammers are brave enough to use Paypal to scam they have tight security and they can trace you because you need to provide bank details and debit card before you can transact a big amount, they always monitor the location of their users, but still Paypal or other accounts that involve your fund you should practice good security.",

Weird enough to say, Paypal can charge even someone who isn't a user to pay for someone else's bitcoin purchases.QuoteDo you mean their platform buying service? afaik it's not available in indonesia (or was this country because of your vpn or something?). Was this an unsolicited email? Yep it was unsolicited email and yep it doesn't work in my country.Just curious what are the chances of this type of scammer withdrawing money on a platform that possible to chargeback.",
