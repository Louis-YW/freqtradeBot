  "content": "I offer my service and help in WIF & seed recovery. Depending on the case, I offer support and explanation of potential solution (and chances) to recovery partially lost WIF using one of my programs:- WifSolver - for CPU, for simple cases when only a few characters are missing or if they are missing in several places in WIF- WifSolverCuda - for GPU, for cases when there is a large gap at the beginning or in the middle of WIF, when public key is unknown- Kangaroo - for CPU/GPU, my version is a JLP's program patched to support solving WIFs when public key is knownAs any clues could be helpful, I also work with partially lost QR codes from paper wallets.Additionally, for recovering missing words from a seed I offer using:- LostWord - for CPU, for cases when there are some clues what the possible words are and/or only 2-3 words are completely missing- LostWordCuda - (in development phase) for recovering seed using GPUI also offer recovering access to brainwallets knowing a partial hints.Of course, if it is suitable, other public tools could be used (BitCrack, btcrecover etc.).If it is needed, I offer writing a program dedicated to a given problem.",

How can I change cuda settings in VS? Or do I need to install an older version of cuda? I currently have version 12.Isn't there a way to automate these configs? Why do open source programs have these manual configurations?Lol too many questions, appreciate the respond.",
