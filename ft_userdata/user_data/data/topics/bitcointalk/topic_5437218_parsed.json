      "body": "Quote from: Ivekzg on January 29, 2023, 01:50:16 PMAs the title says this thread will be for arbitrage betting tips only.So lets go.NCAASiena @ MaristMarist  total 60,5Under Cloudbet 2,27Over Pinnacle 1.813Profit 0,80%[...]Unfortunately most of users don't know much about betting here. So I think it would be useful to tell them which fraction of their stake they have to put on each outcome to get those profits. Or at least to explain how they have to calculate it. Because if you put the same stake on each outcome while one odds is below 2.00 you won't get any profits if this outcome wins.Here if I put $100 on Under and Over 60,5. If Over wins @1.813, I will lose $100 for my bet on Under and only win $81.3 for my bet on Over. That is to say, I will lose $81.3 - $100 = -$18.7So to know how much you should bet on each outcome, you have to apply this formula :For the first bet : Odds_1st_outcome x Total_Stake / (Odds_1st_outcome + Odds_2nd)For the second bet : Odds_2nd x Total_Stake / (Odds_1st_outcome + Odds_2nd)or simpler : Total_Stake - Stake_first_bet",

I'm not an \"arber\" but from what I see here many opportunities come from bet with handicaps, so I assume there should be opportunities from the asian handicap bets too.@Ivekzg, no your thread is very good and very interesting, it's generous from you to share that for free. I'm sure it will attract more bettors in the coming days but as I said above they are not many here.",

Those pick with  >1% profit is pretty solid these days since it’s very hard to spot one on crypto bookies.Just a suggestion. Please include the date of the match for your picks so that user can know if your tipster is still valid or not just by simply looking on this thread without manually checking all the match on the sportsbook.

I'd say that's probably an improvement, at least from financial perspective.Banning users just for being profitable is not a practice that should be tolerated.

I have been doing that myself for some time. But like you say at the end it can be very risky. In every arbitrage bet there is a risk involved when one of the involved bookmakers changes the odds while placing, do not accept your Betsize,....Since then I got involved more into valuebetting. Value betting can cause downswings but at the end in the long term it should be profitable cause you constantly beat the closing line value. Only downside on the valuebetting also is that after a while betting restrictions and limitations on several bookies can appear",

I once tried this for more than a month, but I gave up because I did not have enough money to make significant gains and we cannot have a hundred percent win rate on arbitrage. However, seeing this without having to pay anything makes it tempting and interesting. Because there are no issues with cryptocurrency and fiat arbitrage trading, I do not think it is wrong for some resourceful and hardworking gamblers to do the same thing in gambling. However, bookmakers are entitled to limit bets when they consistently lose to someone.",

But I totally disagree for the bigger ones. They are far from only surviving. According to one Stake co-founder, Gambling is nothing less than the killer application of cryptocurrencies. QuoteSo big is Stake that its owners claim it accounts for about 7 per cent of total Bitcoin transactions around the world daily (blockchain.com statistics show there are usually 200,000 to 300,000 Bitcoin transactions per day). “People have been trying to find the killer application for cryptocurrency,” says Tehrani. “Well, it’s gambling.” QuoteDocumentation seen by The Weekend Australian Magazine shows that Stake ­customers around the world bet an ­average $US400m ($590m) each day using cryptocurrency – although none of it in ­Australia, where online casinos are banned. The business is set to crack $1bn in profits this year – as much money as supermarket giant Coles makes and three times the earnings of the privately held Chemist Warehouse last year.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/weekend-australian-magazine/these-men-are-conquering-crypto-but-are-the-stakes-too-high/news-story/11cb0db4257ec9e703e225f1d91a5b8c https://archive.is/0kRLnAnd the money they make from their customers is just unbelievable.QuoteSince the media investigation, 27-year-old Craven has been dubbed the country’s youngest ever self-made billionaire by The Australian Financial Review’s annual Young Rich List. (Tehrani, 29, is a US citizen and precluded from the list but is also estimated to be worth more than $1 billion.) The Coffs Harbour-raised Craven recently splashed some of that cash, breaking the Melbourne house price record in 2022 with his purchase of a Toorak home for $80 million soon after picking up another home in the neighbourhood for $38.5 million.https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/drake-could-be-key-witness-in-blockbuster-case-about-australian-casino-20230117-p5cd81.htmlQuoteWe saw a monumental 65+ billion bets on Stake throughout the year (that’s over 2,000 bets every second)[...]Here’s an awesome stat that all of us at Stake are incredibly proud of. In December, Stake was responsible for over 5% of global Bitcoin transactions, over 12% of all Dogecoin transactions and over 15% of all Litecoin transactions.https://medium.com/@edcraven22/a-look-back-at-2022-what-2023-could-hold-in-store-for-stake-our-community-7d0066f02902",
