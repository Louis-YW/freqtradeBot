  "content": "I had to create a new wallet with a new incoming TRX address. I sent my TRX mining profits from Tronset to my new TRX address. When i check for confirmation on Tronscan blockchain. it says “inactivated address.” is this because the address is brand new within my wallet? My last two days of profits was being sent to my old TRX address which was compromised. if it is not because it is brand new, how do i get it to be an active address?",

From the site that shows that funds were sent to this address? Because by looking at Tronscan (a Tron explorer) We can see that this address has never received nor sent anything[1]As for you not needing to activate your bitcoin address, then that's normal. This \"activation\" is something related to the Tron network, and not the bitcoin network or the Exodus wallet.[1] https://tronscan.org/#/address/TFvgkttfyCmmyS8HZzJCnMtkPK7VUMADdT",

There's no point in sending funds or activating anything.But I'm starting to think that the problem here is the site you're using and not your wallet. Are you sure it's not a scam? I have googled it, and it has barely any online presence. How did you come across the site?",

Had they sent your new address some TRX, the account would have been automatically activated, and we would be able to a see a Transaction IDtronset.pro looks like a scam to me. Yes, they may have paid you the first transactions, but that was just to fool you into investing more, and then they stop sending you anything. That's how Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes or exit scams work.",
