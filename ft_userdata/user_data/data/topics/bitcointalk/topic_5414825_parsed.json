  "content": "After going through several posts and rules that guides this forum, I found out that most people found to be creating their own rules at the detriment of others. A clear example of such can be seen in here. There are more related of this kind here that accuse users of doing one of these:- You will be suspected to be using or controlling more than one account when you receive or send some payment or merit to a particular account often.- You will be suspected of using multiple account if in anyway your writing style is the same with another user. There is no place among the rules that guides this forum, that is stated that someone who is found of doing this, is going against the rules. It is clearly stated that having multiple accounts is allowed.My question now is, is it a violation of law for hunters to send token to one another? Even if the linking address has nothing to do with the forum like in their POA? Why are many being accused of alt accounts even without enrolling multiple accounts in one campaign?It's like a depriving of freedom preventing users from sending and receiving token outside the forum.",

Another is LoyceV that a campaign manager (Icopress) invited him to join Cloudbet campaign with his alt. In fact there are some other alts. But keeping to the rules and staying away from what other forum users can  frown to.You can have alt and still be a reputed member on this forum as long as you keep to the forum rules. But not only that, to what also you know people would not take politely. Example, as it is stated on each campaign to never join with alt. Joining same campaign with alt, and later known could get your account tagged with neutral or negative trust.If you have alt and you did not act like two different people in cases like voting, competition, joining campaign and the likes, then you are good. About merit, why meriting your alt, that is uncalled for. Just continue to post good and let both rank up.  (not you this is about, but people that are involved)Before people can conclude that someone is an alt, there would have been concrete evidences. That is why some people are alleged of having alt, but no evidence, or enough evidence to prove it.",

Can you imagine if forum rules will state how to catch multiple accounts? of course everyone will learn to find another way in order to evade from that's rules, not all rules should be written!@OP seems have many accounts in this forum that the sole purpose is to milking this forum Low quality posts or abuse of trust?",

It is true that having alternate accounts is not explicitly prohibited by the forum rules, but it may constitute a violation of established community norms as well as local campaign rules set by campaign managers. Of course, there are legitimate reasons for having an alternate account, but there are numerous situations in which using an alternate account is immoral, to say the least. For example, you are not allowed to use an alternate account for: evading a ban, bumping your own thread excessively, creating fake conversations between multiple accounts, participating in contests or bounty campaigns if prohibited by campaign rules, etc.Quote from: Abbati on September 25, 2022, 10:46:55 AMMy question now is, is it a violation of law for hunters to send token to one another?

The explanation here is pretty self-explanatory because I've never come across a campaign or bounty that allows multiple accounts. So when they are found guilty then the tag is the consequence they will accept.I very rarely expose newbie who joining the same campaign, meanwhile I have nothing against others wanting to do so. The problem is, this case looks like it will never be resolved so I can honestly think that eventually the thread - Known Alts of any-one - A User Generated List Mk IV (2022 Q3) [MODERATED] - will archive hundreds of dozen newbie per year. There are very few newbie who will make excuses and try to explain what the problem is, while thousands of others will create new accounts to do the same job.",

Why are many being accused of alt accounts even without enrolling multiple accounts in one campaign?What we now refer to as \"Accusation of owning an alt\" according to OP, especially when linked with a particular account is just a statement of fact. It's left of you to clarify if it's true or not by disproving the evidences against the accounts. Have you eve wondered what the case might be if an alt account owner just accepts the obvious?If it happens to be true, you didn't deny the obvious and you haven't violated any rule, your surely going to be left alone with your alt. It only becomes an issue when certain forum rules have been violated such as, merit exchange, spamming etc.In fact, sending tokens between wallet addresses isn't a violation. Your free to do that. I've seen some forum users transact coins between themselves and even get to rate themselves on the trust system. Your not by anyway restricted from transacting on the forum. Just ensure you go by the rules and the rules will keep you safe.",
