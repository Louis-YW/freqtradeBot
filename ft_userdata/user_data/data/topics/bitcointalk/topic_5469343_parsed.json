GeophphreighDamn I missed that @Geo... Personally, I think you should just get the spot myself, 1. being the first to respond, and 2. Having known you so long here and you are one of the best & trustworthy peoples I've met here! No offense @Alouain, I just think the faster we fill the better. Edit - I guess then again, changing the terms of the raffle might be considered a bad move, but let's see what replies materialize now...",

Looks like a fun project, not sure how I missed it originally? LMK. GeoAlso owlcatz recommendation carries some weight for me ! and we do need to fill theposition quickly.So as of now geophphreigh is awarded the spare position but to be fair I will leave this thread open for 12 hours from now for any objections.We can then move forward and update the original thread...",
