  "content": "The S Plus cost about half of the X.  Also it doesn't require a battery which i heard the X has which leads to more problems?The X has bluetooth so that is only for people who do transactions on the go.  So can someone explain this?  Would do transactions where i connect the old nano ledger s to my laptop and use ledger live with it.  Never done transactions outsideSo if you have the X, you don't need to connect it to a laptop?  But can you choose to as well or you don't have the option?  Who exactly does transactions on the go?  But if you have a laptop with you as well, then this bluetooth isn't necessary right?  Also if you do a transaction on the x, it would be using either your iphone or android assuming you have no laptop with you?  But this also requires you to be on your cell phone data as well right to have the transaction go through?  Read that the S Plus only works with android and not ios.  So that is the other benefit of the x?  So people with the x would go on their data plan while outside on their iphone and go to ledger live and transact on their iphone?  Would not be comfortable doing a transaction on phone as oppose to laptop since laptop most likely won't contain malware compared to phone?So how is the X better than the S Plus while costing double?  The battery having that seem to might cause more problems so wouldn't most get the S Plus even if same price?  So its for people that want to do transactions whenever they don't have their laptop with them then?",

I doubt battery will cause more problem because we are talking about hardware wallet here that is not being use most of the time. It's battery doesn't drain frequently so it has a long life. Quote from: jerry0 on April 24, 2023, 05:44:30 AMThe X has bluetooth so that is only for people who do transactions on the go.  So can someone explain this?  Would do transactions where i connect the old nano ledger s to my laptop and use ledger live with it.  Never done transactions outsideI preferred Bluetooth so that I can connect my wallet without connecting it. I learned my lesson on my trezor wallet which the port got broken by connecting it to my computer frequently. Also is it advisable to use hardware wallet on normal transactions? It might lessen the privacy of your assets.

I only think of a scenario when you don't have an OTP cable to connect your ledger to your phone when you are on the road. It's pretty handy to have a hardware wallet with a battery and Bluetooth to be used since you can carry it anytime without thinking specific cable that you don't normally use.",
