What do you think really happened?",

      "body": "First I will say why don't you sell your bitcoin and keep the funds ready while the delivery services arrived as they said? You wouldn't wait for them to call you to come pick up your goods and even as you were called you didn't sell your bitcoin and get the required cash to your local account before moving to their office. To me it's not a good choice you made haven known that anything could likely happen at the cost of you wanting to sell off your bitcoin and, besides I don't think you would focused to do your conversion to NGN why because you could be at tension to settle them immediately but since you didn't prepare on time to exchange it through p2p you will definitely face some challenges as most times p2p doesn't credits your account immediately it takes about 45 minutes time for the counter to elapsed, so if you are that in a haste to make trade you can't exercise all this patient for your funds to be credited,. Although there is 15 and 30 minutes minimal so if you are that lucky enough to see such trader then your funds could be delivered quickly to your account.Quote from: examplens on September 27, 2023, 10:01:23 PMIf you want to get some more specific opinions about Bitcoin transactions, you would have to provide more information.

      "body": "It is normal for the buyer to cancel sell orders when the price of Bitcoin goes down.  I also have this kind of experience in Binance but I do not mind it.  Since buyers want to get profit, they have the right to cancel orders since we are the ones initiating the trades.  I believe if you don't want your sell order to get canceled frequently, you can convert your Bitcoins to stablecoin and sell it.  This way there is no fluctuation of price that can trigger the buyer to cancel the P2P trades.",

They've got the automatic market trade but of course the price is not the same and could be lower than the P2P market where you're trading. I guess that option is good when you're in a hurry but if not, P2P is still your best place to go when you like more some quite higher pricing.",

I mean you still need to have some local currencies in your wallet just in case you need some emergency and so that you won't rely on your bitcoin as the means to sell it for that kind of situation.I have been in that kind of situation before, the last time was 2019 wherein I need to sell because of emergency and I don't have the money in my pocket. And it took hours or days before I can make that transaction to a CEX and sell my bitcoin. So just always remember that you need to reserved some fiat money always in your pocket, just saying.",

      "body": "Since you were already on a centralized exchange, why didn't you stick to normal spot selling, which would result in a sale in just a few seconds? I'd use P2P for anonymity and privacy, but you're already on CEX, where you've probably got a KYC-verified account. Not only did you lose time by having to go to the courier twice, but there's a chance that you'll end up paying more if Bitcoin's price falls until you conduct the next sale and pickup the shoes. Am I right? On top of that, I generally don't see why you'd resort to selling Bitcoin to pay the courier when it would be easier and more profitable in the long run, since we're talking about an asset nowadays, to use fiat straight out of your wallet.Unless we're talking about a tough situation in which you have no cash or money left in fiat currency, I'm guessing that's not the case, because if it were, you probably wouldn't be buying shoes online.",

What do you think really happened?I think your experience has little to nothing to do with Bitcoin or P2P exchanges available on centralized platforms. Some notes:You could have made the transaction earlier in anticipation. It's often possible to know the fee for shipment/clearance of orders (I think shipping firms send this information prior to pickup) P2P is actually a business for those merchants and if price gets unstable, or lower than the price at order time, they would likely cancel the order. I'm sorry about your experience but you canndo things better next to ensure the experience it's smoother. This is not something that decentralization can solve at any scale because if price gets lower, merchants can push forward with the transaction otherwise, they'd end up losing.",

But when I saw the seller I knew why it was canceled, because he set the price too high and then changed the price again. There are many price scams like this and the order will never be processed. But first I need to know which CEX you are doing p2p transactions on. Now even P2P transactions can be done very easily and quickly.Since I often use Binance I use the P2P Express Feature so that the Order price will refer to the top price and which seller is the best. Since using the P2P Express feature there are no more rejected orders and everything runs quickly. Not only on Binance, but some CEXs also provide this latest feature.https://www.binance.com/en/blog/p2p/what-you-need-to-know-about-p2p-express-421499824684903381",

You knew you had a package that needs to be paid, instead of being prudent enough by initiating the P2P transaction as early as you can, you waited for the package to arrive which puts you at a time constraint. IDK how your P2P works but if it's BTC-USD then that just means you had the opportunity to sell your bitcoin at an earlier time to ensure you don't get pressured into selling especially since bitcoin's price is a little volatile nowadays. You can't change the whole system just cause of a single instance, and while we share the same problems every now and again you have to understand that Rome was not built overnight, make wise use of what's available and don't assume that things will always go according to your plan.",
