  "content": "I was wondering if any has any direct experience with Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) and what challenges and limitations you have, if any.I just got introduced to it, and it seems like a fascinating consensus protocol that allows its miners to do useful work that can solve real-world problems like data classification, protein folding, deepfake detection, etc.And you can also mine coins like Flux, REM, and PAI Coin. Curious if anyone here has any experience in this. Thanks in advance!",

The project pays additional rewards to miners if the miner does not sell their coins. Another way to make money comes from renting out equipment, but there are more self-renting scams now, because the reward is more profitable than the service commission.",

The \"POuW\" stuff people actually pay for like on vast.ai are very expensive.The administration of rental services recommends setting the stock settings for the video card and specifying the characteristics of the equipment. Not all tasks require 8x to 16x PCIe bus speeds. If you bought an expensive motherboard for this, then it will be a plus for renting out, but so far it is not profitable. In most cases, mining farms mine cryptocurrencies and are not rented for useful computing.",

POW making on video cards may come back if Nvidia and AMD want to increase sales of their video cards. The price of the Casp coin is growing because the manufacturers of ICERIVER KAS KS3 want to profitably sell their equipment at a high price.Not all video cards are suitable for PoUW.",

For such calculations, it is not always possible to use standard mining rigs. There are many points on the selection of equipment and Internet speed, and such standards will not always be convenient for miners because of expensive investments and without guarantees of profit.",
