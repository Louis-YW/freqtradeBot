I am not familiar with that logo and can you give an idea on what project is that?Quote from: clear cookies on October 18, 2023, 04:31:09 PMI'm going to update thier announcement soon, but there's a little twist, if the community wants to know, ask this guy on telegram @Justinpump I just sent him a message.Why not just do it on this thread so that everyone doesn't have to go through with that guy. And since you've messaged him already, why not share what he has told you about such announcements or what's with that logo?LOL, I'm curious to know but I won't go there and message him.",

As in Justin?Thats a suspense statement OP, if this was really the meta on uniswap then why would we need to message someone. Isnt it that it will be popular on social media already if its a meta. Being meta on uniswap means its a talk of the town project but seeing the logo doesnt ring any bell for a top tier project. Maybe a shitcoin being market right now?",
