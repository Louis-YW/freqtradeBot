So those are the only few edits I think you need to do. Thanks",

Can you drop a picture of your setup? I think it's easier to judge people on this forum without trying to understand some facts about running a Node. The solution to those leaving their coins on centralized exchanges is not running a Node, it's keep their coins in a hardware wallet or Electrum wallet, if running a Node for them is impossible, it has nothing to do with how or where they keep their coins.I believe it's not easy to run a full Bitcoin Node for some people, because of power epileptic in their country, them downloading the blockchain data and the power goes off will be frustrating, waiting for the wallet to get full sync is another problem without stable grid power.",

I also believe OP needs to be clear about this. For example, what kind of hacks are you referring to? Hackers can still implant a keylogger whether you run a full node or not. Some readers usually take anything at face value, it would be a bad idea if some people believe running a full node provide some kind of immunity without setting up any security rules properly.
