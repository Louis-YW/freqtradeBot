Many new coins created using POW algorithm doesn't really have any utility and usefulness, when the coin lost it's adoption, the developer either change it to POS algorithm or abandon it. At least other coins beside Bitcoin e.g. Doge, Litecoin and Monero will still exist since they have a lot holders.",

I think pow mechanism won't easily die because investors (or buyers) think pow concept makes value of currency stronger mentally. Its like physical proof. So there will always be some pow coins.

It's said mining won't become unprofitable, because miners only sell their bitcoins for a price that can pay for the mining costs, plus some liquid profit for themselves. Theoretically they would never accept mining at loss. So the market has to adjust itself to the currently costs of mining operations.Less bitcoins mined per block = more expensive bitcoins. And mining profits remain stable...",

They keep their operations and running their miners, collects the coins that they've been mining, hold it and then will be eventually sold to the market when the price increases.And that takes a lot of patience to happen because they have to sustain the cost through their other means but, not all miners has the capacity to do that strategy.",

Cheap electricity is one of the biggest factor on determining how much profit you can get from mining, Weather is also a factor in it given that it is much suitable to mine on a cold weather country. If you only want profit, There are still active POW coins that can be mined and if you have the certain qualifications like cheap electricity, cold weather, good space for mining rigs , etc. you can still be profitable on it. Miners unload their mining rigs and the mining cards have surge the market for a really cheap price as ethereum transitions to POS.

That would be illegal as hell but i guess it would be hard to prove as trading with inside information. 1 hour of attack would cost that much in case you could rent half of the hashrate , which is pretty hard with rented hashpower . One other case is you own the miners with half of total hashrate , that means that you have made a tremendous investment and you want to depreciate it . Third case is to bring new miners and gain the control of network , which means that the investment should be double than in the previous case . So , i think no one would try to double spend by attacking the network ( remember that you can double spend only your transaction ) as he should find someone to take a load of money without any confirmation . Not to mention that if he acts honestly , probably will earn more .",

Yeah it's shit. So many collusions happened with miners in any of POW blockchain. ETC has proven that if 51% one of disadvantage from POW. There's also another point that can be discussed and what will you get as a buyer from POW coin other than bitcoin? You were just giving miners your money. You get nothing from what you have bought.   Quote from: Coronofud on February 05, 2023, 06:39:47 PMThe whole POW Model needs the network to be very busy just for security and to functionMore nodes = more decentralized. what's who POW is working but POS is almost the same.

The worst thing is the collusion between miners. They act like they were parties who have been owning the coins. The buyers and holders have no power and miners decide everything. lol.",

It is true that when the market is in a bear season, many people have to stop mining and sell their machines, but if you live in a country with cheap energy costs, mining can still generate some profit for you. I also like mining, but because the conditions do not allow it, I can only invest a small amount, if you have a large capital, you should mine, I believe that mining will bring better returns than investment.",
