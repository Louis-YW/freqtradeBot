  "content": "Are you guys aware that only 5% of futures traders are consistently earning money in the market? The 95% is traders like everyone else that keeps blowing their account and losing their money. People think that market analysis and intelligence can be the key to becoming part of the 5% of consistent winners but it is not the defining factor. Most traders think that their strategy is wrong without knowing that the determining factor is the winners think differently from everyone else. So, it means that psychology is the most essential thing if we want to become part of the 5% or the winners. There are 2 groups of traders, 1st is the consistent winners and 2nd is everyone else. We have options on what group should we belong to. These are the factors on how can we become consistent winners:1.   Psychological – Trading is inherently risky; futures traders should be aware that no trade has a guaranteed outcome. When you put a trade, you are correspondingly accepting the risk but that’s where the problem comes in. All of the traders are taking the risk but are they accepting that the trade has a non-guaranteed outcome? The answer is No. Consistent traders are aware that there is no sure profit or magic in trading. They embrace the risk where if they lose, it is okay for them because they know that there is no guaranteed outcome.2.   Trading system – The trading system is considered the blueprint of your trading journey; all of your strategies and steps belong to the trading system. You can create your own system but you can also buy or learn from someone to lessen the curve of learning. There is a lot of trading system online and you choose a system that is you fit your preferences, habits, and lifestyle.3.   Risk management – The reason why people blow their futures account in less than a year is that they have poor risk management. Always remember that it is not about how much money you make, but it is about how much money you don’t lose. Risk management helps us trader's accounts from losing all of our money. Through risk management, we can know if the trade is worth it or not.",

And if there is no mental strength to acquire enough knowledge of trading, the trader's account will be washed out again and again. Most traders go into futures trading to make a quick profit, and they are gambling rather than actually trading. And those who do futures trading with trading knowledge actually know how to manage risk and when to take entry and when to close position. Experienced traders also make losses but overall they keep a positive balance in their account.",

So therefore i adhere to your contribution, because experience trader knows when to be in market and also knows how to man over a huge loss in trading irrespective the obstruction in the market.",

      "body": "A well structured trading plan is expected of a trader who plans on managing their trading psychology. Trading generally be it futures or spot has high risk to reward ratio. Not even trading strategy nor risk management can limit the losses of future traders. A trading plan defines what the trader expects from every trade, it also magnifies strategies and clearly defines what risk management measure a future trader wishes to deploy.  Trading plan has been neglected by many traders, many who draft their plans don't bother referencing them before every trade. The factors that hinders traders from making consistent profit most times are not as ambiguous has it is painted to be most of the times it might be as a result of simple negligence to things that are meant to be priorities just like having a plan boldly crested where a trader will easily sight them before executing their trades..",

Actually, Exchange is the only entity that I know that consistently wins on futures trading since even whales are sometimes caught by the price manipulation. I really believe that exchange is somehow the culprit for those huge wick that hitting stop losses or liquidation of open position since they are not completely regulated and the SEC is not auditing what shit they are doing inside. CZ and Binance is the best example which is why CZ don’t want to cooperate to become a fully regulated exchange.Price behaviour on crypto is very unpredictable and no person nor bot can catch up on that price data to open an accurate position. Futures trading is purely a gambling with an extra difficulty from exchange that liquidates open position at random basis. Even with a good risk management will not stand on a manipulative market.
