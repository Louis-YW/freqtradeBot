By including a variety of assessments and artifacts in the portfolio, students can demonstrate their understanding of the material in a more comprehensive way than through traditional exams or quizzes.",

What criteria did it use or should use to grade Depends on what the grading is based on. If it's based on their past performances, it won't be a good idea to fully depend on that to judge their future performances as that could fail considering that there are lot of unserious projects that are mostly in Crypto space to make money or serve a selfish agenda. Â It's important you or the graders choose those with sustainable or reliable future growth/development... and that are based on the right Bitcoin/crypto fundamentals or principles.*There are growths that are unsustainable.",

What criteria did it use or should use to grade It is good. So you can track the progress or the history of the portfolio. Also, you can brainstorm with some other person to get his feedback. This will improve your technique or skills.",

What criteria did it use or should use to grade there's nothing wrong with that, all crypto tools are developed with a purpose, maybe for some people this grading tool is good for them to be able to monitor the performance of the portfolio before deciding to invest in certain assets. but for me personally, I prefer to keep doing research before investing and see how the use cases and performance are in the past few months. if it's good and potential, maybe i will invest or not.",
