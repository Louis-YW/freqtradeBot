In addition, we do not store any private keys, nor do we have any way of accessing them. Well, ya fuckin' generated the private keys for all the wallets you made yourself, so sure you won't be able to access them after you've distributed them to resellers, but just like Ballet wallets you have to trust that you didn't make a master list....and Jesus, if you can't even trust Ledger anymore, why in the world would anyone trust Material Bitcoin?  Unless I've missed it, they're an unknown manufacturer with no reputation.  Blows my mind.  But it doesn't look like many people have bought this wallet so far, as there aren't many reviews and the ones that are there are probably shills.  And look at how much they're asking for this piece of shit!",

After the card gets shipped to you, they will fund it with the amount you want.  I really love this part:QuoteYou don't need to rely on anything to use your Material Bitcoin Wallet.You need to trust their unhackable method of adding a metallic security strip over the private key that absolutely no one can see. But hey, don't focus on that. Focus on Buy bitcoin with the safest wallet in the world.Let's talk about how to withdraw your coins from the wallet. After you peel off the military-grade metallic security strip , you have to manually enter the private key into whatever wallet you are using character by character.Check out their tutorial on how to do it on a phone where they suggest installing a different mobile wallet:QuoteTake off the metallic strip covering your Material Bitcoin’s private key and copy all the digits into the notepad app on your mobile phone.Copy and paste it into the Blue Wallet app by clicking on the “Paste” button to import your Material Bitcoin’s address.Erase the first 6 digits (p2wpkh:) and click on the “Import” button to link the Blue Wallet app to your wallet.That's how the military does it btw.  https://materialbitcoin.com/en/https://materialbitcoin.com/en/blog/how-to-send-bitcoin-from-your-wallet/",

Apparently, the Standard and Customized plates have a sticker on the back that protects the private keys. the 3rd one, DIY, allows users to engrave 12-word seed phrases. The DIY is the only steel plate that makes sense because you can use it as a metal backup for one of your wallets. And that plate is the cheapest at $59. The other two where you have to use the private keys they generated cost $89 and $199, and include bullshit features like your real name written on the top, etc.But there is no need to worry because the company offers aQuote100-year guarantee.https://materialbitcoin.com/en/",

In the comments[2] section of KS they keep referring that they have no way of knowing the private keys that are engraved and they also say that their private key (the one that supposedly \"is generated by a state-of-the-art, open source, offline, cryptographic engine\") is generated by Electrum. Even if they were the most honest company in the world, I wouldn't believe that there can't be a malicious actor, or even worse, that they do something manually during the process that could put in jeopardy the safety of their wallets.They reassure their clients by saying that their \"autonomous\" process has been certified by Lambda Telematics[3] but I don't see quite well how this certification could have been issued. Perhaps Lambda Telematics wrote the code that their \"robots\" use to manufacture their cards? If so, what stops someone to hide a malicious entry in the numerous lines of code so that every private key is sent to some random address without anyone knowing?What is even more weird - How come that with just ~40.000€ - they were able to build a production line (I suppose that there is one) that engraves the plates and packs them in a security bag with no Human intervention when 70% of the funding went into developing the product[1]?[1]https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/materialbitcoin/material-bitcoin/description[2]https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/materialbitcoin/material-bitcoin/comments[3]https://lamtics.com/",

I may be wrong but I don't see sustainability in the long term for the company, unless they massively market their product. I do reckon that the costs to produce the wallets may be low if they purchase and manufacture in big batches but that doesn't seem to be the case here (unless they are able to finance themselves again in the future to grab a bigger market share of their product).I've been looking at their Telegram channel (it currently has 630 members) and I have to say that I've seen some information that is... incorrect. Here's an example:Rough translation:QuoteDo you know what would happen if the company that runs Twitter disappeared for any reason? The social network would also stop working and would vanishQuoteThat would also happen with Ledger and Trezor but, guess what, if Material Bitcoin (the company) disappeared, the wallet would still continue to work without any problemI don't know what is worse - Misleading their clients into buying their products by making unreal comparisons or not fully understanding how their competitors (in this case Ledger and Trezor) hardware wallets work.",
