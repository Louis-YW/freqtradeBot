It is not just limited to gambling and related activities but this can be attributed to any other profitable sector as well. If you see a housing boom in your country, you can always buy stocks of cement companies and steel companies because they are the raw material suppliers of this sector. If you see a motor vehicle boom in your country, it is always good to buys stocks of Motor companies, tyre companies or car accessories manufacturer companies. But I don't think we do have any opportunities to buy stocks of the crypto related casinos here or to profit from it.",

Even also someone which have a big of funds only play at casino, many of the whale rarely invest in casino, because they are not looking for money only but they also want to feel the sensation.By investing in an online casino, you most likely meant investing in a casino bankroll, which was very popular for a while. But that has nothing to do with the investment the OP was talking about. With such an investment, you do not acquire any rights (unlike buying shares of real casinos) but only get a promise to share future profits in accordance with your contribution.I have doubts about real investing (buying shares) in a casino: when I look at the market, I see that when it falls, all shares fall at about the same rate, and when it grows, innovative companies show the greatest growth. The casino does not belong to the \"new\" type of business and in fact does not have any innovations - in fact, it is a conservative business and it cannot generate income above the market. In addition, this business is always criticized by a large part of society and always carries the risks of tightening regulation.",

But there are crypto enthusiasts here not keen about stocks and would rather stay with crypto. And if I'm not mistaken, some casinos that we know allowed investors, but I'm not sure how profitable it is in the long run.

This is not new, all businesses today have one way or the other they want investors to invest on their sites, gambling sites are one of them.Two questions to ask:Are the listed gambling sites paying in crypto to investors? I noticed I have not even heard about the gambling sites beforeHow much is the smallest amount of money investors can start with? I will first prefer to gamble than to invest unless I huge amount of money to start with. Gambling is just fun and entertaining, the reason I am doing it and nothing more. If I do not have time for it, I do not do it. People have different preferences. Investment in gambling sites would require investors to invest huge amount of money before they can earn good income from it. That is investment generally though.",

The thing with here is that users will prefer crypto over traditional assets but we never know if there are people still out here that invests on kind of stocks especially if it's regarding gambling. Since the pandemic started I think most of these casinos in the list have been down considering lot of people won't visit an offline casino. This have take a toll on them but likely will bounce back now that restrictions on public places are lifting up. Not financial advice but it's likely the case here, tourism industry and gambling will likely boom next year.",

Lake Mead -- the main source of water in Las Vegas is drying up at an astonishing rate. Water levels in the lake are declining by a factor of around 5 feet every 2 weeks or so. This has been documented by many boaters in the area who published video clips on youtube to draw attention to the crisis. The long term viability of las vegas casinos could be in doubt with their supply of water on a steep decline. Whether they can find alternative sources remains to be seen. Suffice it to say that the explosion of the human population in the area is far too massive to be supported by normal desert rainfall. There have not been any real steps taken to address the issue. It is possible that the entirety of las vegas could end up a ghost town in the years to come. Which could make investment in casinos and gambling establishments with a presence outside of las vegas the better option.",
