Because end result isn't keeping anyone safe. In fact Further attempts to drive down stablecoins could lead to catastrophy in markets and might hurt people more then FTX ever did. Dedollarisation would be an interesting thing to see but ultimately that could mean not only end of stablecoins, it would mean end of fiat pairs. And i don't have a clue how we would survive that.",

Of course the Department of Financial Services' actions have considered many things and most likely they have smelled the dirty practices of Paxos.",

Also, if I'm not mistaken, only the holders located in the U.S. will be affected.Then there are many more options to use stablecoins in decentralized than in centralized exchange to be honest. or others will just switch platforms, it's that simple.",

If Paxos won't close their company, they will find resolutions and agreement with the NY Department of Financial Services. We saw many cryptocurrency companies had to pay fined charges when they failed with lawsuits to continue their business like Tezos XTZ.It's not the end if Paxos has enough money to pay fined charges and I believe they have it. However it is early to say Paxos will accept that accuse against them.",

So, Binance will need to take the necessary action to stop those things from happening and I'm sure this incident will not gonna be the reason for them to stop their service and platform.",

      "body": "Well even if people underestimate this issue its actually big. It can create problems with supply of busd in near future. I feel cz probably seeks other options for Busd to do 1:1 but he didn't announce anything yet. I remember his last tweets about busd. He said they will keep supporting busd. That means funds are safe (for now). But I think decreasing competition is bad. I mean, like, we may need to trade only win usdt in future. Which is loss for investors. I loved to divide my portfolio between different stable coins.",

I do think though that this is another blow for the whole BSC-chain. I mean like until a half a year ago or so it really seemed like Binance and the BSC chain will continue to grow and that they are ahead of every other crypto company and chain, but in the recent months that has significantly changed in my opinion.The volume on the BSC-chain is going down, while other chains like Arbitrum are getting used more and more. I don't hold any BNB myself but i am not sure if this coin will see it's ATH ever again.",

A crackdown means to restrict something so yeah it is. I click on the link provided by the OP but I can't find the post there about Paxos and BUSD so I search and find this website: > https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/20/how-the-sec-and-paxos-busd-fight-could-impact-the-stablecoin-market.html.It is said that SEC sees BUSD as a kind security and they mentioned something about registration. Maybe the issue can still be sorted out once the registration has been done so I think this isn't something that everyone should worry about. By the way, you can try to click on the link to have a better understanding because the post is a bit lengthy and I might missed some key information there.",

I see zero similarities with FTX case. FTX problems weren't because of stable coins but because of ftx having no reserves and using FTT as reserves of all things. That seems in insane in hindshight. And it's not like everyone was losing money with FTX. Anyone who shorted FTT with leverage from the tweet of cz in binance made themselves rich.",
