If users have to submit KYC to do transactions, what is the difference between DEX and CEX? If I can compromise my privacy, why do I have to use such DEX where my funds are not safe? At least CEX still refunds its users if they do not go bankrupt. If a user's account gets hacked, it's not their responsibility. But if the exchange gets hacked, it should be their responsibility to protect their users.",

If I can compromise my privacy, why do I have to use such DEX where my funds are not safe?  This is very strength that one dex asked for kyc and I completely agree with you that people prefer dex over Cex because they doesn't want to reveal identity but here situation is totally different. I searched for this and found that actually Kyberswap managed by Kyberswap protocol team which is regulated company under Singapore region and their dex is also regulated, This why user have to complete kyc for using it. complete details can be found in this postQuote from: Shishir99 on November 23, 2023, 11:10:36 AMAt least CEX still refunds its users if they do not go bankrupt. If a user's account gets hacked, it's not their responsibility. But if the exchange gets hacked, it should be their responsibility to protect their users. Kyberswap should also refund all users who lost fund in this exploit. Currently Kyberswap team is working to solve the exploit issue so that they can save user fund and then I hope team will announce something which will better for team and project.",

It is a pity that KyberSwap has not yet solved the problems related to DEX security.According to official news from Kyberswap,Frontrun bot able to recover 5.7 million of fund. These fund are on the Polygon and avalanche network. It is some good news that users will be given back fund which they lost in this exploit. I don't think that people will use this dex more after this exploit because this is second time dex is facing same issue and they are not doing proper security setup to secure users fund.I checked out thay under every tweet is full of scammers link in the comments pretending to be Kyber admin and ask to connect wallet for recovery. I also near to be decieved but then judged when ask for connecting wallet. I think some people will lost fund however admin also warned in tweetFund recovery Source",

And the fact that users will be reimbursed for the lost funds will be a positive signal for the entire community when KyberSwap operability is restored.",

Perhaps the Op thought that the topic was related to hacking, so he thought that this was the appropriate section.In any case, it is no longer strange to hear about hacking exchanges every day. In the beginning, we used to hear about hacking central exchanges, but now this infection has spread to DEX and on-chain services.The worst is the DEX that requests KYC, but since they have all the users' data they have to pay compensation to those affected.",
