Bad taliban donot do good things and they spread only terror among peoples.That's the trouble with followers of the Koran. You never know if they are going to be good or bad, because the Koran calls for violence in lots of areas, as well as peace... https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx. You just can't trust the Taliban, because you never know where they stand... violence or peace.",

      "body": "Knowledge is power, right? People can use their knowledge in two ways, for good or bad. The Holy Quran teaches people how to maintain peace and how to live to achieve it. It's not the mistake of the Quran rather, it gives people knowledge. It depends on individuals how they use that knowledge. Unfortunately, some people manipulate younger generations using Quranic references and they causes trouble. I believe that those who know the true meaning of peace won't harm others. However, we can't control their actions, and it's up to them to use their knowledge in the right way. It would be helpful for us if they are able to achieve peace and if a majority of them cause trouble in future, the big organizations will definitely take action against them.",

Bombs are sent by the US that kills innocent people. How do we know some of these Taliban didn’t lose family members to stray US missiles? I do not like to judge people until I know the full details. There are two sides to every story. I know that if US soldiers killed my Mother or Father I would consider revenge if i was able. Maybe if the US stopped fighting for oil, gold & minerals there would be no terrorism.",

Some of the best reasons and justification for their violence is found right in the Koran.

The U.S. were one of the first to pull it off successfully but many countries in the Middle East still insist on implementing theocratic law (sharia) on their citizens. The real problem is the Quran. Violent holy book with the commitment for all nonbelievers to be killed. You should not be surprised of the violent tendencies of anyone foolish enough to follow the literal text. The bible also has violent verses, too, except Christians have accepted modern cultural values. Islam still is going through the modernization.",

I do agree with you. With the endless bombs and missiles the US and Western World has sent to the Middle East and countless Islamic leaning countries around the world for decades. I wouldn't be surprised if some bitter innocent kid or orphan grew up with only one aim, to avenge their dead parents and loved ones.As A kid, the Western media made us think that the Talibans and Islamists were some really very bad people but, as I grew up, I noticed that something was amiss.",

The act of forcing people to accept your own ideology without giving them options is violating thier rights. The girl child in that nation should be allowed to make the choice of attending school or not. People should have freedom to choose thier profession without restrictions. It is important for the Talibans to change thier views or ideology because many of them are not applicable to current realities. They should be able to learn from counties like Qatar, UAE and even Saudi Arabia that have been able to adopt positive changes that have brought economic and social prosperity.",

Perhaps it's the religion but, I like the idea of being free, as long as I don't get to hurt anyone or maybe something not within my fundamental human rights. I read some policies put down by the Taliban rule and I be like, \"what the heck\".And yeah, God thing you brought that up (Qatar, Saudi, etc). These are Islamic nations too but, less radical. I get it with the US campaign over there which instead justifiable but, so also not the violations to human rights going in there now.",

It is not a matter of good or bad Muslims, there is a whole grey scales in between (specially when we talk about civilians)",

But in their own way. If a country (even if it's a super power) thinks other countries are stupid and (feels like) helping, but by imposing their way of thinking or ideology or the US fighting for oil, gold & minerals, then who is actually the criminal?Quote from: Gyfts on February 17, 2023, 07:22:18 PMThe real problem is the Quran.
