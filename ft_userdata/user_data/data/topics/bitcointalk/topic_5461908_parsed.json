On-chain data (https://twitter.com/redactedp4mp/status/1686095057143881729) suggest interactions between the meme coin BALD’s deployer contract and one of the wallets tagged by Nansen as belonging to Alameda Research - the trading company founded and controlled by Sam. The data was cited by several blockchain sleuths on X (Twitter) and later validated by CoinDesk.I got in $BALD and I regret it. It was a degen play and only invested what I could afford to lose.

And if you look at it, seems to be well orchestrated from the very beginning.And hopefully, there will be no whitewash here as it involved politicians as well as far as I understand. And it should be fair as well, no extra privilege for this criminals who run out of billions of investors money.",

Tbh, i've lost sympathy for people who lose funds to these meme coins and shitcoins, because it is obvious they know the risks and what they are doing, just like the op here.Developers won't stop creating these scam coins because they find it easy to allure victims, people want to become rich overnight, they want to invest in a shady project that has no actual utility to see if they can make money out of it, of course shady developers would create it for them and in the end ennrich themselves due to the avarice of people, it is a never ending cycle.",

Wow, it is so surprising that you quickly moved on leaving all your regrets in one corner which is the way an investor need to do things since we are meant to invest what we know we can afford to lose. We need to play safe as an investor so that we are not going to keep blaming ourselves for mistakes we made based on our decisions. What is lost is lost and there is no way we can get it back. The cryptocurrency market is very risky and we need to watch well and scrutinize our decisions before we go in fully investing in the cryptocurrency market.",

Or course the first suspect would be its founder obviously but with bald developer action, it seems like they really try to game the system on base network and rekt a lot of users by removing huge portion of liquidity. Many have gain for those who arent greedy but some losses on this degen play.
