Over all, the managers of these campaigns are good.I advise you to design a good example of the topic that you can update easily and the information is clear. Unfortunately, your forum rank does not allow you to create tables or even post pictures. It would be better if you work to develop your rank for better posting.",

You can use search function to check on those and have ideas for that. So next time you think of a certain compilation topic you could do that in organized format.",

We already have the Overview of Bitcointalk Signature Anti-Spam Campaign Managers and there are other threads that were made the same too.For those that have many spare time, you can check their portfolios and list of their active bounties, per manager.",

Actually visit the bounties section is more better than using your list since I can see who manage the campaign, how many replies and views so far, usually a legit campaign with have higher replies and views. The better thing to do is create a list campaign that will pay the bounty hunters since it's full of scam.",

I do know that OP was a newbies and he maybe wanna earn merit from creating the list of campaign. he is not active again. Checking his post history and it seems like OP already forgot if he has ever created this thread. that sounds good if he was learning from what he can learn before.",

I think creating a table is not constrained by account ranking, it's just a skill in setting up the BBcode language, and the language is very simple, it just needs a combination. If want to import images, of course, you need a minimum account rank of Jr. Member, or 32 posts with a one month time limit.",
