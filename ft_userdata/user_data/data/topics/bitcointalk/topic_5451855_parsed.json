  "content": "Mining cryptocurrencies is intensely energy consuming. The use of energy intensive computers keeps creating problems for the miners as it has adverse effects on the environment and also pokes their finances in terms of high electricity bills. Because of the environmental effects, crypto mining has been banned from some countries such as China, Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Oman, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Bangladesh. Though, some of the bans are due to domestic currency concerns. So how do miners regulate activities that result in carbonization of the ecosystem? My little research came up with the following recommendations.Miners should be incentivised to operate in locations with the cheapest and most accessible energy is available.Use of environmental friendly sources of energy such as solar and wind energies. This one seems difficult for third-world countries.Crypto halvings could also accelerate green energy adoption among miners.What do you think?",

You are always going to blame miming crypto for all that.I haven't seen people make noise about how watching TV or using electric ovens to cook can impact the environment, for example.Quote from: Jamala on May 07, 2023, 04:55:25 PMCrypto halvings could also accelerate green energy adoption among miners.You mean these \"green energies\" that use batteries that need the extraction of raw materials which process leads to the destruction of the environment somewhere deep in a Third World country, like this?Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on April 10, 2023, 11:43:48 PMLet someone convince me how the process of attaining the raw materials for the manufacture of Lithium somewhere deep in the Democratic Republic of Congo is Environmental friendly.",

      "body": "First off solar works without batteries.It can be grid tied and uses very little shit materials when grid tied.I know this as I use a 45kwatt array115kwatt array265kwatt array425kwatts produce for about 5 hours a day on average. That is 2.125 megawatts a day.Very little pollution caused as they grid tie not battery tie.Grid tie = good when laws are done fair and square battery = bad unless a new battery is invented.“Normal” power grids between 45 lat north and 45 lat south could handle a huge amount of solar tide to their grids. Far more than then do.That said solar used to mine on a grid like I do is not employed much as many power grids do not do a fair and square 1 to 1 kwatt swap.Ie when my 425 kwatts of solar are peaked at 12 noon I used about 100 and send 325 to the grid.So in a normal average day 5 x 325 = 1625 kwatts which are sent back at night at no cost.a fair and square trade.  Many power grids just take your excess during the day and sell it back at 2x the price they paid you for it in the daytime.All in all solar could expand 100x and help but not fix the energy issues in the world.I cant speak for wind or hydro but grid tied solar should have 100% agreement that it is helpful.Energy future if the world is not to wreck itself is in fusion reactor tech. I am too old to think I will see it working but it could solve all the energy issues we have.",

Fighters against global warming will first of all direct their anger at the miners, and it is impossible to mine stealthily due to the high consumption of electricity.",
