And did you take the permission of the author before publishing or own the copyright, because I see a lot of paid books on your site, which is strange for a new site.I think most of the books related to Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies and the blockchain are copyrighted. It's is an obligatory act to get the permission of the copyright holder before selling e-copies of a book. The authors have put a lot of work in creating the content, and selling their work without their permission is against copyright law.However, if you have complete permission of the authors to list their e-books on your site then that's okay. I think the royalty sharing model works in such cases where the original authors get some percentage of the earnings generated by selling of their work. That way every author will get the rewards for their hard work.",
