You will only panicked if you placed a position on futures trading your SL or liquidation will surely hit in case the direction is against your position while I never placed a position on futures trading.Futures trading is already gambling on this volatile market. I preferred to trade only with spot and use the casino to play real gambling which I enjoy rather than opening a risky which I donâ€™t get entertained while they are both considered as gambling already.",

I'm not one of those people, a sharp drop means another entry position (if i still have money allocated for investment), a sharp drop will only impact traders and not investors, because they need balance to continue doing their daily trading.The rainbow chart can be a real reference for continuing to hold our bitcoin without having doubt how our bitcoin portfolio will perform in the future. And if a sharp decline occurs in bitcoin and it ruins your days, to control your feelings, you don't need to think about it and don't need to keep looking at the market, it's better to go to real world activities that you enjoy, bitcoin has proven that it able to recover (although it takes quite a long time).",

Why panic so much when the price is still going to move up?. Except you are a trader or a short term investor that wants to take profit within a specific time.For a long term investor who is hodling for long, then a decline in price shouldn't cause panic in anyway, as they are after the future price and not the current.My plans are clearly for the future, I don't know about you.",

Honestly speaking I used to be, but years passed now I got used to it so even if the price dumps 10 or 20% it does nothing and when such incidents happens I don't look into my portfolio tracker and you can also follow it because that's what frustrates us, so avoiding gives us the space we needed that time.And for long term holders such dumps are profitable because they will just look in the situation as 10 or 20% discount on the original price.",

Or you are no longer affected by such price drops and continue to invest on each dip ? Any suggestions on how to control own feelings in case of such drastic drops in bitcoin price ? Bitcoin price has been dumped from ATH several times like in 2017 after first ATH at $20k it dropped back to $3200 and again made a new ATH at $68k but then again Bitcoin price came down to $15k. So when the price of Bitcoin drops by 15-20% it can definitely cause panic. Because it has been seen that Bitcoin has been dumped a few times before but it recovers again. However, if the price is high and Bitcoin can be sold and bought again at the dip, then during the next ATH, a lot of profit is available. For this reason, it is normal to feel some fear when the price of Bitcoin starts to decrease significantly.",

I actually rejoice when I see such kind of drops in Bitcoin price.Â  10-20% drop means the Bitcoin is available to buy at 10-20% discounted rate. So I try to buy Bitcoins in small amounts during search drops. If you have faith in any asset class and you are thinking of staying invested for longer term, such drops are actually great opportunities to lower your buying price. Typical DCA! But if you have entered the market at ATH, then it's bad for heart.",

This is more like asking us are we still human, or have we evolved into robots. Of course its natural to feel some sort of disappointment when you see your portfolio go down in value. I only encourage myself with bitcoin proven track record of bull runs. Beyond seeing it ass an opportunity to increase your portfolio, Every Investor now is in great expectation of the bull run and don't feel too happy when the prices keep going down.The good thing is that we've seen it before and we're convinced that the season is on the way. That singular hope keeps is optimistic and encourages us to BUY AT THE DIP AND HODL until the bull run comes around and we smile.Quote from: Oshosondy on June 28, 2024, 01:55:28 PM it would be a profit for me later as it is giving me another opportunity to invest in bitcoin at a lower price..Definitely, we all need to accumulate as much as we can before the bull run arrives, that's the only way to makingÂ  profits as investors",

Volatility is also not bad per se, as it gives traders opportunities. As for long-term holders, it is irrelevant to them, and it teaches a good lesson: patience.",
