Quote from: SeeBiscuit on February 02, 2023, 08:42:24 PMI have. But I think I would have to use the way back machine on my own profile to see it.I feel you didn't understand Little Mouse correctly. He/She isn't referring to the address shared on your profile. He/she is referring to the addresses posted on this topic and you haven't posted any address there.",

      "body": "OP: Like Little Mouse mentioned, if you still have access to the e-mail that you've got tied to your account here ( I suppose it's the one in your profile - 7777BONKz@proton.me), then upon using the link provided by Little Mouse you should receive the e-mail that would allow you to change your password.On a second note, what I'm seeing in this post[1]terrifies me - you definitely need to start using a password manager to avoid having all those passwords in your notebook. Imagine that you loose that notebook and someone else finds it - have you considered the damage that that random person could make to every account of yours? Or imagine that your house burns and your notebook as well, what will you do then?For your own safety, do consider using a FOSS password manager such as Bitwarden[1][2], 1Password[3] (audit results here[4]) or if you want something local, you can always try KeePassXC[5].[1]https://bitwarden.com/[2]https://github.com/bitwarden[3]https://1password.com/[4]https://support.1password.com/security-assessments/[5]https://keepassxc.org/",
