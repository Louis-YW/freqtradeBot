The service can for instance create 2 million different PGP signatures, which is enough to last 30 years. The user first encrypts a text with his own PGP keys, then with the service's keys that match the desired future date (and if needed with his own keys again). This ensures the service never knows your data.Then, you give the encrypted data to someone, who can decrypt the data after a certain Bitcoin block has been mined.The flaw in this system is of course the centralized service: if it disappears, decryption is no longer possible. And if it provides the keys too early, decryption can happen before the Bitcoin block was mined.The first problem can be mitigated by having several (trusted) services that share and store the same (2 million) PGP signatures. If one of them disappears, another takes over. But this increases the risk of leaking the keys. So this idea isn't perfect either, but if someone can improved upon it, that would be great!Ideally, it should be completely trustless.",

What I mean is that does it accept sign up or free from registration? That is as you download it, you use it at once?Now after saving my private key in this site, can I access it without internet?In what way your Capsule would be stolen because it is not registered app to be used, or physical address to be. But online so I have not really gotten the stolen part of the story. That was why I asked if the app is for registered before using. If it is not registered before using then it is not safe to keep or save keys there. It is prone to attack.Save measure taken by your site is not clear for me",

The Python code is open source, but for my .exe, the Python code is converted to C and compiled. From what I understand, it’s theoretically possible to decompile C code, but you can never get back all the information. At first I used PyInstaller, but I figured out I can extract the pyc files, change the HEX, make Decompyle++ from CMake, and extract the original code. I have searched through countless forums, and have not found a way to extract or decompile my exe with the method of compilation.",

Also, add to all that the already large shortage of IPv4 addresses, and it is difficult to predict now in which direction that protocol will go in 20-30 years.why did you get attached to Google times at all? maybe in 20 years, we won't live by that timer, it would be much more basic if you used a timestamp from the blockchain.",
