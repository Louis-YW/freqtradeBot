Elly De La Cruz..boy oh boy!  There's been very few top prospect call ups that I've been blown away by.  Griffey Jr, Alex Rodriguez, Miguel Cabrera, Chipper Jones are the ones that really come to mind for me.  But now, there's another..this guy is the future of baseball. His swag is unreal.  His recent 3 steals in one at bat being only 1 of 2 players to do so since like 1961, incredible! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT42mCeAII4All Star Game was boring for me.  I put a few dollars on it but lost.  American League typically wins.",

The most interesting thing to me right now is will the Angel keep shohei ohtani or will they end up trying to get some value trading him? There's talk he could get upwards of 700 million - 1 billion dollars. How nuts is that?https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/angels-rumors-mets-executive-thinks-shohei-ohtani-could-get-a-billion-dollar-contract/ar-AA1dMMYu",
