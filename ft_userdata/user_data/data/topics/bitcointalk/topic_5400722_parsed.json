      "body": "@win.com, You should split the image of the ANN on few segments so that it will be fitted properly on the thread. The current image is unreadable because the image height is too long and not in proportion to the width. You can ask @Hhampuz to help you with the ANN thread to look presentable.You can use the image code below for the ANN image so that it will stretch the image width to the proper proportion to make it readable. Browsing now the casino and probably will play soon. A bonus such as a free spin to try the casino is really appreciated.

The images in OP are very small and people can not view it well. Must be adjusted with your bbcode.Furthermore, I see a good development strategy from Win.com team. They are prioritizing mobile experience for their users. When people play games or bet, they usually do it on mobile. Perhaps 80% or higher of users have experience on mobile devices, not on computers either desktop or laptop.Focusing on mobile will give best experience for Win.com's users.Not all crypto wallets are available and adaptive on mobile. What wallets are recommended by Win.com team?",

      "body": "@Eternrad thanks for the suggestion! As per your suggestion, we have made an initial adjustment to the image to make it more readable. We will definitely consider splitting it up in multiple images & improving it to make it more presentable and easy to follow.As for the platform itself, stay tuned as we'll be launching the first games very soon  @SquirrelJulietGarden making it fun and making it mobile-friendly have always been among our top priorities, along with making everything simple to use and secure. For that, we're developing our own non-custodial wallet that's easy to set up, simple to use, and secure. You'll be able to store your FTW tokens, trade them, stake them, and anything in-between, along with seamless support for NFTs, and much more.
