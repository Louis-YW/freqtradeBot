  "content": "Hey everyone, I wanted to start a discussion around the topic of anonymity and KYC (know your customer) requirements in cryptocurrency exchanges. As we all know, there are exchanges that require extensive KYC verification, while others operate with little to no verification process.On one hand, KYC can help prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illegal activities. It can also provide a sense of security and transparency for users who want to know who they're trading with and ensure that their funds are safe.However, KYC can also compromise anonymity and privacy, which are often highly valued by cryptocurrency users. Some argue that the need for KYC goes against the decentralized and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, and can even put users at risk of data breaches and identity theft.So, what are your thoughts on exchanges with and without KYC? Do you prefer exchanges with strict KYC requirements, or do you value anonymity and privacy more and prefer to use exchanges with little to no verification process? What are the disadvantages and advantages of each approach? And what measures do you take to ensure your anonymity when exchanging cryptocurrencies?Let's have an open and respectful discussion around this topic and hear everyone's perspectives. Looking forward to your input!List of KYC data breaches.",

You are absolutely right.The state has always sought to control its citizens. Under the guise of combating terrorism and money laundering, the state aims to regulate the financial activities of everyone. However, the state's desire to control its citizens should not come at the expense of people's privacy and security.Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been accused of being a tool for criminals and terrorists to fund their activities. However, this argument is flawed. Criminals have always found ways to launder money, and they do not need cryptocurrencies to do so. In fact, the vast majority of criminal activity is still carried out using traditional banking systems. Additionally, corrupt officials themselves often launder their own money using traditional banking systems, as evidenced by documents published on Wikileaks.",

While KYC requirements can keep the feds off your back, I think there are other ways to stay safe and keep your business on the DL.One way is to use decentralized exchanges where you don't gotta give up all your deets just to trade. But let's be real, there's always a risk when you're doing things off the grid.Another option is to use exchanges that have a tiered KYC system. That means you can choose how much verification you want to give. You can keep it low-key for small transactions, and then do the full shebang for the big bucks. That way, you can have some privacy while still keeping it secure.At the end of the day, it's all about what you're comfortable with and how much risk you wanna take. Me? I like the tiered KYC system. And I ain't taking no chances - I use VPNs and anonymous email accounts like a boss. Ain't nobody gonna catch me slipping!",

Let just take it as you said already that \"it's to prevent fraud and money laundering\" yet they are being hacked those who are involved can't be tracked and trace, now tell me where do you think the hack is from?Naturally this might comes from their staff or an insider who knows very well about the exchange.Therefore, I don't like any platform which involves kyc and for trading it would be better of using p2p to trade in order to maintain anonymity and privacy.",

If you do not want to use KYC, you can try your luck with instant exchanges like ChangeNow or Changelly, but the risk is that they are still centralized exchanges and if they see your coin as tainted, they will ask for KYC. People nowadays uses centralized exchanges which are trading platforms like Binance, Huobi and the likes, thinking it is easy to buy and sell coins, but they do not know the stress they go through when they were registering up to a fully verified account. For centralized exchanges that are trading platforms, you can try Kucoin or OKX, but they may ask for KYC at anytime too.",

I mean we trust the exchanges with our data, but who will be blamed when the datas are leaked? Moreover Bitcoin are famous for it’s anonymity feature, and hence many people like to remain anonymous while dealing and interacting with Bitcoins or cryptos. I have also came across with such people, who don’t want to do KYC in any exchanges because, Bitcoins and Cryptos are not yet regulated in their nations. As a die hard Bitcoin lover, I would also prefer no KYC exchange over any centralised exchange.",

It is absolutely trivial for a money launderer to buy the identities and documents of hundreds or even thousands of users on the dark web for only a few bucks, and to use their names and information to open fake accounts in order to launder money. KYC does not prevent laundering - all it does is frame innocent users who have had their data stolen. And given that literally every major centralized exchange has had one or more data breaches in the past, if you go around completing KYC, then chances are your documents will be leaked, stolen, or sold eventually.Quote from: death69 on February 19, 2023, 09:24:32 AMMe?

I mean even I prefer to stay away from all KYC things, I am still enforced to clear KYC because my needs are seeming like more important than my preference of protecting my identity. I was trading in bittrex exchange and they suddenly locked my account and when I contacted their support, I was directed to clear KYC. I got no other option except submitting my documents to enable withdrawing my coins.If I was not into bounty campaigns and if I was not into the need of exchanging altcoins and tokens to BTC then probably I would have stayed complete anonymous by now but after cleared KYC in one exchange then I started get used to it. Still, I use old and reputed exchanges. I am not thinking on future problems as of now.",

Its more of you having to size which is more to you at certain points.
