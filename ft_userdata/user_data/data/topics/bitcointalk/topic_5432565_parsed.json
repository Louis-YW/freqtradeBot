Due to Nigeria's presence in cryptocurrency, especially with trading, I believe the country will be able to raise blockchain/cryptocurrency innovation by developers that will be peculiar to Nigeria from this year forward. It's time to move away from scam phone mining in Pi to exchanges that can serve the entire continent. It is important that exchanges allow those wishing to send their stable coins in foreign currency to their banks that accept the same currency, and that it can be implemented in this era.",

I support every endeavor that bring development to our local board, with or without merit source we can do it. I will be focusing here more to find quality post to merit to encourage us so members no go run go outside with good post. Cause if there is no merit flow in this board the quality posters we have will prefer to post good content in the main board where they have more visibility and more chances of getting merit. So far the kind of topics we have are Economy/ politics and society related, I hope with time we will have more discussions across bitcoin, altcoins and politics and society.",
