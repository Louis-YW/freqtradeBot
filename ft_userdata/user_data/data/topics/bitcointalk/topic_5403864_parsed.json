I didn't make it!I'm just recommending it to you because I think it's a good resource, especially for someone like me who is learning to code with Javascript. Plus, it will help me practice and apply the concept I've learned throughout the course.I only have a basic understanding of algorithms, therefore I'm still not heavily involved in some of the technical aspects of this bot..",

I don't really think so, preferably go for Manual DCA only it's not that tough all you have to do is keep on buying a certain percentage on every fall in price. Bots are scary not only there are chances that bots can run into bugs there are major chances that bots might also not be very safe from hacking etc. Go for manual DCA.",

I don't think we actually need DCA service or bot for this investment approach.Manual purchase may be the easiest solution, but it requires that emotions intervene and therefore will affect your decisions. For example, if you think that tomorrow the price of Bitcoin will be cheaper, you will sell now and vice versa.Unfortunately, when people lose, they withdraw all their money, and therefore greed and fear are the biggest threat to trading withered.The automatic DCA forces you to save and the amounts will be deducted directly from your account.",

I don't think we actually need DCA service or bot for this investment approach.The whole purpose of DCA is to buy an asset at a specified time interval, regardless of the price of the asset. Once you start waiting for price dips in order to purchase the asset, even of which they are random, then that's not DCA.A trading Bot like 3commas.io also has an option for DCA",
