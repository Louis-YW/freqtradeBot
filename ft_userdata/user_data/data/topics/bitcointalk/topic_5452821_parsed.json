But Binance enable manual deposit for any user that uses old address. Is this what you are talking about? I saw several notifications that Binance displayed on their site several times before the exchange start to use the new addresses but I did not know the coins that are affect.Binance is an exchange, people should know that it is not your own keys, it is Binance that have the exchange and the keys. If you want to give your Binance address to anyone or you want to send money there, go to Binance to get your address.",

I remember reading article this news shared on our local board. There’s a note on the bottom if I’m not mistaken that funds might potentially loss if user deposit on old address that’s why they are encouraging to use the new address because it’s part of their security update for all their wallet.But ofc, Exchange is just saying those words to push user on using the new wallet address. It’s absurd for Binance to toss all their private key from their old wallets.",

You are right that centralized exchanges are not the best option for trading, but change of addresses is not done to exercise censorship or to make one lose access to their assets, it is a security measure and also a privacy one used by exchanges regularly.Besides the announcement to double check deposit address, it is a good habit to always check the deposit address from the website and not have it saved somewhere on your device from where you copy it.Do go completely decentralized.- Jay -",

I hope all binance users see this updateAs you can read with the blog that they've made posted above. There have been users that have already received the notification and if you haven't got one yet, you have no problem of using your old depo address. And much better before making a transaction, always check the deposit address if you ever will deposit to your Binance account.",

Excluding Binance exchange changing their deposit addresses, there could be malware in your device that could change the deposit addresses you have copied and stored on your phone/laptop so always make sure you're copying an address directly so you can crosscheck to make sure the wallet address is correct before usages.Also I think Binance exchange have done enough by constantly sending our notifications. I can't remember the last time I used my Binance account but I received the notification on my email severally. There's also an update of how you can recover your funds if you send them to the old addresses. Binance exchange has done the best they could so it's left for us to be extra careful when making a deposit to confirm if the address we're sending the coins to is the same as that of the wallet service providers that we're using.",
