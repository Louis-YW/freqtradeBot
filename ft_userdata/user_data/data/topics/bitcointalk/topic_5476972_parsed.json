  "content": "Unfortunately I must report that light_warrior, a participant in the UniJoin campaign ... has passed away. He and his daughter are refugees from Ukraine who lived in Europe, in the house of one of the forum participants all this time (starting from the moment of the invasion of Ukraine).At the moment, his body is already heading to Ukraine.Below is a Bitcoin address for donations (just over $1,000 in Bitcoin was just sent to this Bitcoin address).Therefore, anyone can contribute, moreover, I encourage you to do so!Donations are no longer necessary. All funds are located at this Bitcoin address (a corresponding announcement will be made a little later).One of the forum moderators is aware of this sad event, and is familiar with the family of this participant, so when the moment is right, he will make sure that all donations are transferred to light_warrior's family. If you were familiar with this user, then this thread is the place to express your condolences ... üïØÔ∏èI assume his family will read all your replies one way or another.",

Or do you check it manually?I search for plagiarized posts on the forum manually. I don't have any scripts or any software for this. All manually. And the verification is of course done by special services, which are designed for this purpose and which I use. There are free, and there are paid. I use both of them. I can say that the paid ones are much more convenient. But here it is up to you. You can find the services with the help of Google. I am sure that no one can check and find plagiarism among billions of pages on the Internet manually. It is impossible. I also have my own criteria for selecting posts to check for plagiarism.Quote from: Xal0lex on December 07, 2023, 11:24:02 PMHis daughter has all the information to access the wallet.

I think a bitcointalk account can be used, of course she has to learn to know bitcoin but in my opinion it doesn't take a long time. And she can join in the signature campaign to support his daughter.",
