  "content": "Hello everybody,I am brandnew here, and relatively new to the whole crypto story. Last year, I signed up with freebitco.in, just a few weeks getting my second referal, a buddy of mine.Now, for the past two weeks, he's been staying over, and so we kept comparing the results from our free rolls on freebitcoin, finding that he consistently gets considerably less than I do!?Is that due to me receiving a referal bonus, or what's going on?The last couple of days, I am getting 7 toshis, while he's rolling in only 4!?Thanks for bothering!!!Martin",
