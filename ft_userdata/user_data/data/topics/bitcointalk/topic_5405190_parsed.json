  "content": "OK set up my first bot yesterday built in pine script placed on wundertrading tied to binance usdt futuresIts working and both platforms are showing me similar results and after 1 day is profitableI have one issue however It seems to have opened two trades at the same time one short and one longI do not know how it did this I have set my script to invest 100% of capital per trade (no leverage) and set the same on wundertrading I may need to check an open position to see what is happening but anyone know if this could be an issue or is possible;e",

On OKX, you can use long/short position to do that also, but if changed to net mode, it is the same as one-way mode on BinanceÂ  and you will not be able to do that.But the fault is from the script not the exchange.",
