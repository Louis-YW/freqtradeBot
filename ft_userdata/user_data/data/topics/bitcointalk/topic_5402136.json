Their job is to keep the forum a better place by moderating spam post and remove them if someone report it or take actions if some other issues have been raised as each board has its own moderator.So if you are abiding by the rules and making post then you don't have to worry about them at all.",

This is much easier for beginners to understand despite the fact that many people prefer writing to reading. Beginners are expected to understand the forum rules from the start because they are important guidelines so as not to deal with moderators or other users especially because they are breaking the rules. Beginners don't need to get too convoluted answers, it won't help them much because they seem very confused about what they should do in the first place. But maybe they will be more focused if the person who brought him here can provide the knowledge and explanation needed. The conclusion is that beginners should read more than write if they really want to gain knowledge.",

To explore the forum and understand how these works certainly can't be done in just a day, it is somehow you need to spend more time in the forum to clear out some of your doubts and questions.

Since you are curious to learn and understand the rudiments of the community and also acquire the knowledge of cryptocurrency which is free.
