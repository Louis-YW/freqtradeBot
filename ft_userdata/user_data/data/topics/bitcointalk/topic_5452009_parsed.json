There we so many factors why it was so popular1. It was one of the kind2. The fee (It was the lowest, If I recall well, they weren't charging any mandatory service fee)3. Obviously exposure, they were one of the biggest advertisers here in the forumWe all know what happened when the mixer was seized. Some people lost money because, for some reason, Chipmixer did not delete the data logs as promised.",

Probably because these private keys contained dated UTXOs. For instance, if I deposit bitcoins today, I could get UTXOs from weeks ago instantly.In mixing, it's good to have a good gap between your deposit and withdrawal. Competitors either let you withdraw instantly or have you choose to delay your withdrawal depending on the set of choices given (e.g up to a week) which means you'd have to wait. With CM, you could get a gap instantly and it's before your deposit = less extra step. Since people withdraw private keys, they could also set their own time better before sweeping.The set your own fee plus good reputation were definitely up there too.",

While it shares some similarities to trading private keys, I don't think you can really be confident with random users on some marketplace giving you private keys for money. As others have mentioned, you do need some trust to use a service like that, but they were able to build that through one thing or another in this forum, which is impossible to happen for private trading private keys IMO. Not to mention other safer alternatives exist if you want to do P2P.",

We cannot say that it is an off-chain mixer because transactions are still taking place inside the network and have not left it, but the link between the sender and receiver addresses has been broken.As for the reason why this method of mixing has not been used in any other sites, it is because of the risks of managing private keys in hot wallets, as hacking the site means end to that mixer, and such a method requires a lot of liquidity that the site must have (more than 500 bitcoins ) to ensure that every user who deposits will receive a private key to an address old enough to break the link between the current and past transaction history.In short, such mixers need a lot of liquidity at the start of work, which is rare for a legitimate service, especially since they will work on the donation system.",

      "body": "I'm not entirely sure what you are looking for when you ask for an \"off chain mixer\", but two options come to mind.The first is obvious - leave the bitcoin chain entirely. Trade your bitcoin for monero, move that monero around a bit in various transactions, varying amounts, varying times, etc., and then trade it back to bitcoin in multiple different trades with multiple different trading partners. Do all of that with Bisq, Tor, and your own monero node.The other would be to use Whirlwind's pay to note feature. Deposit some coins to Whirlwind as you would with any other mixer, and you can then mix them off chain by moving them between notes you control, paying to notes other people control, or swapping them with another user whom you trust.",
