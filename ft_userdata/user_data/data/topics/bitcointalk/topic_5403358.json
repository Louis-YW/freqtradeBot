There are some articles that indicate casinos that people can play roulette that accept bitcoin and such can be called bitcoin roulette. There is no other special thing about it. If you see most casinos on this forum, you will see that they support roulette and they support bitcoin deposit and withdrawal.",

These funds are escrowed?I think you need to explain and test this system before any official launch. Please note that due double spending/blocksize/fees estimation etc these kind of games are really hard to be deployed in real life setting.",

In my opinion, if the OP is thinking of launching a substandard roulette game, better not to launch it. Because in every casino that we have right now, they usually have roulette in the list of their games. So from my impression, he will just introduce a low-quality gaming site with bitcoin roulette.I don't think people will patronize his site over the reputable and tried-and-tested casinos in the forum.Don't add another poor quality gaming site that will screw up naive players.",

As they already said in the casinos that accept bitcoin, there is this game you mentioned, so we are talking about bitcoin roulette, so I don't see the need to enter your scheme. I'm not questioning your honesty or not, I'm just saying that it's much better to continue playing roulette in established casinos.Quote from: TimeTeller on June 20, 2022, 06:31:28 PMIn my opinion, if the OP is thinking of launching a substandard roulette game, better not to launch it.that's what i thought too.

If you make it dependent on the next block who wins you can be shure that there is not a rigged algorithm behind. Do you have data about a large amount of blocks to show if the numbers are really random and evenly distributed?I think roulette is maybe the wrong name but you could pull it of as some kind of lottery that is drawn every day for example.",

If your roulette game result is using the next block hash then I think knowing the result will take some time if it is using the blockchain.

There are instances where the forum has hosted a few of those afaik but those were hosted by trusted members so people were willing to play it. Hardly doubt anyone who's unknown would have much traction with it imo. I don't think casinos would implement it and even if they did, it's probably going to be a lottery type of thing?
