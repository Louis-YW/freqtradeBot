      "body": "You don't really need to share someone else site because if the site is that important to owner they would do their marketing and findings to come here in a proper way for them to launch here instead of you posting here. Although nothing is wrong posting here but I think the owner should do that maybe if there are any technical issues it could be very much easier to lodge complaint in their ANN thread than you just sharing here. Besides people don't know about the exchange and can not easily build trust with them if they aren't properly presented here.",

I don't think so many people fully know what a p2p service is lately, or maybe they are just trying to sell us falsely represented services.Secondly, this should not be under Bitcoin discussion, please move this topic to Service announcements board.",

Cashapp already accepts bitcoin transactions, you can buy or sell on the app without going to any third party sites like this.Quote from: logfiles on September 12, 2023, 10:55:14 PMDoesn't seem like a p2p exchange to me if it is centralized and is going to require me signing up and verify my KYC documentsThe site doesn't require KYC yet, but that doesn't mean it won't require lately. Well, most p2p sites that require kyc are bound to disappear like what happened to other p2p exchanges the shutdown.",

      "body": "Op, is this the kind of exchange you plan on introducing to the forum? they already have a bad manner of approaching their clients. Some wanting to register and sees this will definitely be discouraged. How is it possible that they actually make an error in privacy policy repeating it twice. This already raises a red flag and not advisable for anyone to use it.
