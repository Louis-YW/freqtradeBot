Off grid could technically mean  travelling back to pre industrialrevolution to shun all technology, then again what is technology? everything we have used since our existence is technology.@ Jet Cash - this year I hope to take a big step closer to being partially off grid,clear my debts and take a step away from politics and banking. I have alreadystarted the process!",

Since you are living in a van you must be traveling around a lot or moving from one place to another so you won't be able to mine Bitcoin and I am not sure it's safe running in a van, you can mount a solar panel on your van roof, someone I knew in the U.S did this but that's for GPU mining algorithm coins like Ethereum. Asic miners generates more heat than Graphic cards and they also consume a lot more power than graphic cards. You are better off running Bitcoin nodes with Raspberry Pi like you said, they are better for someone like you, you only need your own mini power station to use electricity in your van, watch TV and run your Nodes.",

      "body": "I never seen the definition of offgrid but how I see it is finding a way to live by yourself, with the least Third Parties you can have in your life, without having to rely on pretty much anyone.  Jet Cash is very close to how I see it, but this may of course be different from culture to culture or from mind to mind.I do know of some people living similar to you, Jet.  I am moving closer and closer to that as well and I think much of the conventional life style is a waste.  Of time, money and other very precious resources.  This includes fashion, trends, having new cars, more luxury houses and other stuff like this.  After all, unless you are a fashion model, no body will ever care how you dressed 1 year ago in the mall let alone 5.  No one will ever care you own a Porsche rather than a Renault.  And so on.  Life does not tighten down, does it.  You are coming close to 81 and you know this more than most of us.Of course.  One may argue my life style is a waste too.  I am spending a lot of time and resources finding new ways to become invisible to 2023s tracking and surveillance technology when I could live a normal life and not care about this at all.  But if I could stop spending time and also not be monitored like a house arrested criminal I would be grateful and would gladly stop caring so much.  Life choices, right.If I think about it.  If there are any Bitcoiners living off grid like you or even more to the extreme (least technology possible in their lives).  I think very few would spend their time writing posts on Bitcoin Talk unless it is a thing they like to do.Also.  To me, living off grid is much like a luxury.  Not every one can make this change.  Well done to you for doing that.",

I don’t know but it seems that you are truly making the use of bitcoin and it’s on chain presence this avoiding everything that can expose your identity mate. For example no documentation at all and no banking visits at all. I would be straight with you I have not seen anyone who is living such off grid life and neither I have ever thought of this. I think you are 81 and you truly know the power of being free from everything. For example, I’m way younger than you and I can’t really live a day without my devices, hand held copies of documentation requiring for banking, taxation and what not. I will always have my smartphone with me, cant even work without written SOP in my office. So yeah dam, I can’t go off grid at all. It would take me guts to live such life. Definitely I salute you for what you have achieved so consistently.",

My kind of offgrid world will be something that perfectly suit my Nomadic lifestyle... everything has to be mobile and easy to move around when necessary. I'm also considering motorhome for moving around our stations, spreading the Goodnews and saving lives. I hope to design the interior myself and possibly keep things mobile/modular, easy to move around and adjustable to possibly fit in as many people as possible when necessary. Not sure I will allow any rigid/stationary object inside the vehicle. And I want it to be as light as possible. In my opinion, this kind of lifestyle is how you know true Bitcoiners or Crypto enthusiasts. It's a lifestyle of living a life that's independent of the system and joining an offline/online community that uses Bitcoin/crypto as currency to survive the coming crisis.",

Not like the one portrayed by John Malkovich as Marvin of the Red 2 movie who literally lives in the jungle beneath the soil. No phones, maybe hacked internet, and the thought of every move he makes is being monitored by the government. Cash basis for every transaction too. The powering of the mining rig might be the biggest problem here, if not you will add more budget for the expensive solar panels but you literally need a lot of it.

He did so as a form of civil disobedience. Now, my heart is gladden because I see Jet Cash doing going it.  Sadly, I can't do so in my own country for security reasons but it is my goal that someday, I am going to amass so much bitcoin that would give me the power to migrate to a country and live off the grid too being self-sufficient and 90% dependent on bitcoin.

Others who have life like yours surely must know what's happening with banks etc.Only if you are living a life with a farm and you can have almost everything you need for your life to survive except medical care, you will not have to think too much about bank system.In addition, you must have survival skills to do things in your life by your own with offgrid lifestyle which requires more skills than usual.",

I think whenever someone comes to understand BTC so well and appreciates how it works and gives us freedom, questioning the current banking and political system is inevitable, because you would then understand that what the banks and governments are doing is just to use people's money and control them for their own good and not yours; but BTC takes you out of that bondage.I am decades and decades away from getting to 81, that's if i would be alive by then, but living off-grid does not look like something i can survive doing, to be cut out from the outside world is really a brave thing to do, and it may be popular in some cultures, but rare in mine. Probably when i get very older my ideas may change, because i believe age may have something to do with people moving off-grid, though i am not so sure of that. Right now i just want to use BTC, live amongst the people in the society, use the public utilities provided and enjoy my life with my family.",
