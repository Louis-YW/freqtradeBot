It looks like only yesterday when Satoshi was trying to publish the white paper.¬† This is a day worth celebrating in the history of Bitcoin as it has managed to beat all odds and thrived. Prior to Bitcoin, there has been several attempts at creating digital currencies like eCash, BitGold and HashCash but none of them saw the light of day like Bitcoin has done. No matter how much criticism and backlash it has received, it still is the highest valued digital currency to be created and as if he(Satoshi) knew that one day fiat will be in great trouble. Atleast we have him to thank for his foresight.¬†The Bitcoin white paper with it's 9 pages, twelve section long document is so detailed that I feel that financial institutions could borrow a leaf from the wealth of knowledge Satoshi Nakamoto poured into it.¬†Well, let's raise a glass to this!üçª",

This unique whitepaper can be read in more than 40 languages. Its effect, reach, and resonance are undeniable and huge.But there's an important problem that we need to face head-on: Are we making sure that the spirit of Bitcoin stays pure over the years? Or are we getting off track because of quick wins and flashy things? Nakamoto's ideas were complicated, deep, and multilayered. Right now, every Bitcoin fan and crypto investor needs to dig deep, ask questions, and think about what they're doing. Are we going in the right direction, or are we just skimming the surface?",

That's how time flies with bitcoin and this community as a whole. And we should be looking in the next 15 years or even 150 years. Specially that there are good news around. Block halving next year could be the biggest in it's history as it's touted to bring the price into the 6 digit figure for the first time.Quote from: crwth on October 31, 2023, 08:36:06 AMIt's best to focus on the betterment of everybody and not just one.

The rate at which Bitcoin developed is really astonishing to the point that one would think it was created some three decades or more ago. Satoshi, (whoever that dude is (are), deserves a mention as one of the most influential people of this century.Yes, I know the aim of the P2P angle to Bitcoin as captured on the document's first page is valued less than the asset part of it today. I guess the latter part is even what has drawn more people to Bitcoin than the payment option and P2P part. All the same, it's still a win-win for Bitcoin and we celebrate Satoshi for all that.",
