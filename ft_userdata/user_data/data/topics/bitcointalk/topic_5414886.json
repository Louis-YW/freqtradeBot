  "content": "The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, making money tighter, and popping the crypto bubble as well as many other speculative bubbles.   Almost all financial assets have gone up since 2008 in the face of massive money printing, and now that party is clearly OVER.   With the Federal Reserve now tightening, we will see cryptos and Bitcoin fall by more than you ever thought possible         BE HONEST:  Who here would have believed last year that Bitcoin would be near 18,700 today ??  Everyone knows darn well that anyone correctly predicting such a price drop in bitcoin would have been ridiculed here in this forum.   So stop the self delusion for a minute and consider that Bitcoin could still go FAR LOWER...So here is the question I am asking you guys:1.   At what point do you guys lose faith in the dream of Bitcoin going to the moon, cut your losses and sell ??2.   At what point do you sell your Bitcoin, Convert to cash, and wait to buy 20 times as many Bitcoin at a much lower price, say something like 1000 dollars ??3.   Would you never sell, no matter what is happening in the crypto world, and ride Bitcoin down to the bottom ??",

But however, by virtue that you are a member of the bitcointalk forum makes you a partaker and promoter of the Bitcoin movement, which means even though everybody forsake Bitcoin at its bearish stage, it is our duty as members of this forum to stand by Bitcoin to prove to the world why they need to believe in Bitcoin again, and not giving up just like others. Because thats the reason why we are been rewarded for signature campaign here, because if members of the bitcointalk community don't stand for Bitcoin, then who will?",

Maybe if it becomes zero. There's nothing for me to cut though.  2. If this like asking the price when to buy, I'd say that below $10k for me where I'll buy and use some from my savings to buy as much as I can.But selling, I'd sell whenever I want and if I need to.3. I'm selling because I have to and there's a need for me to get those cash, I'm in profit though and there's no regret whatever the price is currently sitting down.",

A. when bitcoin goes to new ATH. it ALWAYS corrects back downbitcoins ATH are not a point of sustained value where bitcoin should remain. the ATH are the temporary events that are high premium speculation bubble that pop and correct back down to valueB. value is not found at the top where the dip/correction is the surprise. value is found at the bottom where the ATH is the surpriseC. the new \"bottom\" aft a new ATH is a higher bottom than the previous bottom before the ATHD. if you think that people selling today can buy back in at 20x less. you do not have a clue about the value cycles and the underlying value function..E. the underlying value where NO ONE is stupid enough to sell below (the bottom of the bottom.. the non zero value. the no mans land that supports the market above that line.. has an actual thing supporting it)f. that thing is the underlying most efficient method to acquire bitcoin where no one on the planet will get it for less.. which is the most efficient mining cost. at the moment this sits at $15k. and by the next halving cycle will be more then $15k meaning the market orders above this amount will also be higherethereum for instance went into a change where the underlying cost of acquiring ethereum has taken a 20x drop.. so expect ethereum to do as you dream of having a 20x fall.. this is because PoS is alot cheaper to mint new coin.. but bitcoin is different. it has actual hard costs in its creation of new coin. people that cant afford to mine it. instead buy it. and so they are wiling to pay a premium(ontop of the underlying cheapest cost) to get it with the convenience of getting it without the effort and time of mining it. which makes the market above the underlying cost.if you understand the things involved in price discovery. you would understand for bitcoin to drop 20x the underlying costs have to drop by that amount.. remember the ATH are not the value/sustained price.. the ATH are the temporary events. so calm down when you cry that you bought at a ATH and didnt realise that it was going to correct. because now you have learned. you can take advantage of bitcoin now that its near the low. and cheap to buy. to be in the buying phase now..so last pointG. buy low sell high.. dont buy high cry low.. bitcoin is at its LOW. not its high",

I am observing how the market evolves in the next months to come. I have very little bitcoin savings at the moment, it's less than a single bitcoin. I am buying gradually. DCA is better than a one time buy. I have this hunch that bitcoin is still to bottom down this year or next year but it is hard for us to timing it.",
