It is a good idea by El Salvadoran government.",

The people of El Salvador will now know about Bitcoin from childhood. The people of El Salvador will see Bitcoin as a part of education just as we used to understand math, physics, chemistry, etc. by education. El Salvador's government is linking education to Bitcoin where other countries are deciding to manage their education systems differently.  It is a very good aspect for El Salvador if they can control this issue properly. As a result of this move people of their country will get education as well as know a lot about Bitcoin which will help them to eliminate unemployment.",

It will take a while but they are doing so well. Bukele is a pioneer, he will save so many people from poverty. The murder rate which was pretty high there has plummeted. He is a living legend, the people owe him so much, he is totally changing the future of the country for the better.",

Currently, they are working with Mi Primer Bitcoin (MPB), and they have an upcoming event where they will be incorporating Bitcoin into the public school curriculum posted on their official page. With everything they are doing, El Salvador is gaining recognition, and other nations will soon follow suit and adhere to the technology. and I like the idea Mi Primer Bitcoin (MPB) is coming up with training 150 teachers and after the training, they can go to their respective schools it has been fully introduced, and in places like Africa the government is not showing much concern for bitcoin. However, I know with time people with knowledge of Bitcoin will become very useful to the government because if they see other governments keying in fully they will not have a choice.",

There are many fraudulent investments in the name of bitcoin and blockchain, this kind of thing will definitely appear a lot at a time when the El Salvador government is intensively introducing and adopting Bitcoin in its territory. By intensively providing appropriate education to school students and the community, hopefully it can prevent fraud under the guise of Bitcoin investment in the country.",

Exactly, If bitcoin is being taught in schools, learning will be spread over a long period of time, the kids will not need to learn everything at once. It will be introduced to them according to a curriculum in bits, and they will be able to comprehend.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on October 06, 2023, 12:35:23 AMThere is already an existing thread that contains all that relates to El Salvador Bitcoin adoptionThat thread has become a mega thread, many spams there and some users like myself may not be interested in contributing to discussions in such threads. This discussion will also get lost there. The other thread should even be locked.",

I for one is looking forward this to also happen in my country, maybe at the right time. I believe that Bitcoin, the blockchain, cryptocurrency including AI will be a big part of the future and so educating people about these things is something I do appreciate.",
