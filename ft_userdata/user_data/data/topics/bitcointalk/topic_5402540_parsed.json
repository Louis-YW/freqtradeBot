When I bet, I do that with soccer and I eye high odds.Betting on high odds is profitable if you follow the rules of not being greedy. The simple rule is to bet fewer games or possibly just one game. This gives a higher chance of winning after all is just that one game you are looking out for. I shared an example of a single game someone bet with large amount on Real Madrid against Liverpool HereQuote from: Oshosondy on June 14, 2022, 08:20:14 AMI gained experience but I preferred to gamble on low odds.

If you bet more frequently than usual, regardless of the odd, be it high or low, loss is inevitable, it is guaranteed.This is shows low odds are not guarantee, yes it is not. Like you said it will get you playing often times and replying same slip after you lost some games. This is worst when you are doing your booking on line from your phone   The hopes will be high that you will get it right but no you won't because a lot of games in one slip limit the winning chances.Quote from: Oshosondy on June 14, 2022, 08:20:14 AMI play less often unlike before, I reduced the money I am using to bet, emotions gone and I win than before. Playing lesser times can make you think better with good research. It puts the emotion in orderQuote from: Oshosondy on June 14, 2022, 08:20:14 AMHow about you people, are you high odd punter or low odd. Can you also tell us your experience?Yes years back I have taken high odds and won. One time I remember I took off as high as 38 odds and amidst fear, I was lucky to win but I bet with small amount, about $.06 in naira (yes amidst fear   )Quote from: Oshosondy on June 14, 2022, 08:20:14 AMAt you losing or you make profit from the odds you are taking?There is no guarantee whatever the odd. Gambling is luck base but high odds are preferable.",

If you select low odds you have to accumulate more games so that your winning can be ok and this also increases the chances of losing the bet because the possibility of a team losing is there since you play multiple games to accumulate more odds.

At you losing or you make profit from the odds you are taking?I love to gamble on a couple of games like one,two or three games with high odds, I aim to make profit regardless of the amount, so i choose to predict a few games with high odds. In my head, this strategy ensures that the probability of winning are higher than accumulating multiple bets with small odds. The fewer games i bet on with high odds, the bigger the amount i stake because just one high odd entering for you is enough to add some more figures to your account balance.I've won once on just one game predicted with high odds, i was lucky to have won, but since then... coupled with the fact that i do not gamble always, i haven't won again.",

So in essence just take the risk whichever the luck works for you but avoid getting addicted.One of my mistakes was that I chose low odds, could you believe I have lost a bet of 1.05 odds before and many times? I remember one to be in 2016 or so, it was in Brazilian top league, Série A between one coin and Sao Paulo over 0.5 goals, I accumulated 11 matches totalling over 10 odds with 1.3 and above odds, but only two among was lower than 1.1 and one of it made me lost the bet. Another one was 1.06 odds when Spain under 21 played with a small country in UEFA that won (or maybe draw, I have forgotten) Spain. I do care now about odds, I do not often accumulate and choosing only one match is better for. I use what I can afford to lose, this gives me the courage. Example is when a club is playing another club and have like 1.2 odds, if I think the club can win, I sometimes just go for first half win which makes the odd to increase, it has helped me and also failed me and I prefer going for over 1.5 odds matches. I make my analysis before placing bet as well, but I do not bet often.",

Of course even in this case no one guarantees a hundred percent victory, but the probability of it is higher than betting on the outsider with higher odds. I agree with you on this, high odds are more risky in betting because the possibility of the teams with the odds are always slim in terms of winning games, but betting on teams with low odds you have more chances of winning your bet because low odds are given to teams with higher possibility of winning and most times those teams are in good forms, have better winning tactics and have good quality players too.But in betting, odds don't almost win the game but good performance and utilization of opportunities does.",

As far as my experience though, if I'm going for a high odds, I just put small to medium bet. But let's say the odds are very low, I might put a good money on it to enjoy the returns, specially a team that I'm familiar with, I might go all-in.",

When I started to gamble, I go for high odds, but I was not that experienced and I lost a lot.In sports betting, especially soccer betting, in general, gambling sites place the lowest odds, for the club with the highest chance of winning, for example 70% and the club with a 30% chance of losing, for example.but the name of the game on the field will prove or vice versa high odds can win or can draw and vice versa.But if you want to bet looking from the side of the highest odds without looking at the team, field conditions and players in the club, most likely you will lose repeatedly in your bets, the point is: don't be tempted by the highest odds, team analysis, highly recommended.Example:Germany vs. England on June 7th, the odds and chances of winning are greater for Germany, in fact on their field (draw) 1-1, for that some analysis of the team is needed, in order to create a chance to win bigger bets.Honestly, if I place sports bets regardless of the odds, I'm more focused on players and clubs.",

Odds fluctuating doesn't really determine the team that is going to win if the both teams are equals. Like you said it doesn't mean we have to look at odds while betting but to do our research but we know that in soccer, teams that are on relegation line are standing smaller chances of winning the bigger teams although this also depends on the players lined up for the match and the preceding match follow up if the big players are reserved.",

I do think that many points made here about the parlay is not even relevant because only some sports book offers it and you won't be finding it in your normal sites that often.",

Back in 2016/2017 I bet heavily on CSGO and Dota games, but after a 2 year break I came back to bet much less now. My most bets now are on big tournaments in football, like champions league or the upcoming world championship. In general I prefer bets with high chances of winning, the only problem is they are not profitable. Betting on games with 1.1 or 1.2 only gives a small return and we still have the risk that we lose all our money. To build up a bankroll slowly with very save bets is a good idea if we have the time to do the research for every match. When my favourite team plays and I feel good about them winning then I go for lower odd bets, here the chances of winning are not so high but atleast the payout is good.",
