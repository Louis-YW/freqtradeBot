Sometimes coins show up there in their new POW coins area that have already been mined to %#$ and are 5 days old…. Just looking for better info.It's difficult for a site to list all projects since its inception, because most only list after they are launched.You can use the information that appears here on the forum, about new coins. For searching a lot on social media, other forums and the internet to find new things. But the best way is to search for projects that haven't been released yet, but already have information. That way you can find new projects even before they are released.Good luck in your search, and share what you find. Tip from other members is the best way to find new projects.",

Just looking for better info.Probably now telegram channels for miners are filled with information about new coins faster, but the competition among miners is very high. But the forum information is published much later. And most new coins die after a few months.",
