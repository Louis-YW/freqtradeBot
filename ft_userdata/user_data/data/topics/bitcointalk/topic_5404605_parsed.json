The price must not become your main concern but the fundamental of project combined with the product result is the main concern for you. The ico price was good to enter in the market but what will happen once bitcoin will be going even lower? Quote from: Widdop37 on June 30, 2022, 08:00:41 AMDo you know ALUTRA? Also I target Vulcan Forged too but someone is saying it's never going back to it's ATH again, what do you think about PYR?. I don't know what Â it is but i guess that's a new thing. Anything is possible to go up again. That guy has no clue about how market works. Don't you see the token like sad. It was getting a huge dump but a few years later pumped again to go to the moon. As long as bitcoin will be reaching new all time high and it's always possible for vulcan.",

      "body": "ALU, I don't know about this.But for PYR, I think this can go back or even higher than its old ATH, that was between 40-50$. This coin has a lot of potential, has a nice community, is very activ in developping games and their games are cool to play.Now I am just waiting to go back to its price... But with the current bear market, it probably won't move, maybe next year ? Who knows.",

Do you know ALUTRA? Also I target Vulcan Forged too but someone is saying it's never going back to it's ATH again, what do you think about PYR?. I'm only aware of Vulcan Forged but not with ALU. I think I'll just go ahead with the game but not with the token holding it. If you're earning PYR then it's just good to sell for the profit as you play their game. But if you're optimistic that they'll be back again in ATH, nobody knows unless bitcoin goes back there and make its come back to the top again. Neither of the two coins I'll be getting.To understand the economics of these tokens, most of them are really unlikely to get back on its former ATH.",

      "body": "I guess if you meant about altura not alutra. I saw the similar pattern with PYR. Both were touching the ATH when bitcoin was reaching the ATH as well. So the main point is if bitcoin will be bullish and both will be following it. You can also try to take when bitcoin was reaching its ATH which was around 11th months 2021. It has not been a year since the ATH for bitcoin and going down like this already predictable for people who aware with the yearly bullrun of bitcoin. ATH is always possible to be achieved by the question is when bitcoin will be touching ATH? this is the main question that must be asked first.",
