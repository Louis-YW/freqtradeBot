No good reason. In reality, the government people also like bitcoin, some speak of bitcoin bad while some speak of it good which is the reason bitcoin would be hard to ban.

What will happen to countries that based on Bitcoin like El Salvador? If some countries ban Bitcoin that doesn't mean every other countries will join, I am 100% sure that some countries will see crypto as a big opportunity and those who ban crypto will have no choice but to lift the ban, this have happened too many times years ago.",

I think some time ago they realized that banning it was not going to help them and that it was much more useful for them to tolerate it but with maximum regulations, so that in the future doing Bitcoin transactions will be in most cases the same KYC as doing banking transactions, although there will always be a space for privacy and people doing P2P transactions escaping control.",

So they can regulate the use and what else to keep people away from using it but other countries will conveniently keep using it.

It is a set back to have a decision to prevent youth from investment in bitcoin.",

But it is terrible that they have no other option for control than to curtail it and propagate disinformation so that its citizens will not acknowledge it.

It's not a thing of if the government want to, as it stands already many government's have put down so much efforts to making sure they stop BTC from operating but bitcoiners who find themselves under such government had always created other routes to ensure the continuity of it's operations and the zeal shown overwhelmed the government authorities themselves that even when they tried to create a supplant system to bitcoin it still doesn't work like bitcoin cause it's under government control unlike BTC.The control the government lacks towards BTC is one issue that bothers them and not that BTC is a bad idea for her citizens.",

I agree with OP that bitcoin cannot be stopped unless its users decide to abandon the project. What the government do is for instance buy it out. They can print the money so they have infinite supply while supply of bitcoin is finite. If they decide to buy enough of it to stop people from transacting they will and centralized exchanges will make it easy for them. You'll be left with fiat money that was inflated to maximum and they'll have your bitcoins.That's unless you refuse to sell.
