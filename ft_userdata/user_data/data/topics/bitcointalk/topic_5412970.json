Only for tax evasion, money laundering and other illegal activities.The \"Nothing to hide\" argument has been so utterly debunked so many times that I am of the opinion that anyone who still repeats it is either a moron or is actively malicious and has an ulterior motive they are trying to push. Further, the evidence shows that only ~8% of mixer use is tied to illegal activities, and that by far the largest input to mixers is coins coming directly from centralized exchanges, i.e. average citizens who are doing nothing illegal and simply trying to reclaim some privacy against the global surveillance programs we are all subjected to.",
