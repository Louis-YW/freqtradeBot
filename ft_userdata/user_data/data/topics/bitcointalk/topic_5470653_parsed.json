It's always recommended to keep multiple copies of your seed phrase in different locations. For more security, you can consider graving your seed phrase on a stainless steel plate instead of a writing it down on a paper.",

Or can you get the coins back?I didn't even think about getting there. So if that happens then I'm not ready for all that. But it seems like we really have to be prepared for all the possibilities that could happen.Because with war conflict, the worst things we never imagined could happen. Not only matters related to finances but also matters related to safety. And if we survive and we lose our wealth assets then it's not the end of the world for us. Because we can fight again from the start. But mentally, of course we definitely need to recover for some time.And losing your wallet can even happen even if it's not because of war. For example, because of a house fire and so on. And when that happens, there's nothing we can do. unless we memorize our wallet seed phrase.",

Even the PC you back up alone is not that safe, even without it getting burned. There are cases where the PC can crash unexpectedly, and those funds will be stock in their forever if you don't discover a way of recovering them.Â If you have a wallet that contains more, it's always advisable to share the wallet's access with a different location, even if it's on a different device that you know is secured. If one gets bad, you can also access the wallet through the other one, and you can also save your phrases on paper and move them to a secured location where no one can think of them and only you can have access to them. If not for hacking and all this security bridge kind of thing, moving some part of the phrase in an encrypted message through cloud storage could also be a good option.",

If you are unhurt after a conflict, then you are lucky because many people lost their lives during these trying times. You are the one who worked hard to acquire these coins, you can still regain them since are alive and well. If you didn't keep your seed phrase in any other location apart from the ones that have been destroyed, you might not be able to recover your funds.",

We never know what could happen to us, and in the event of a war or other unforeseen circumstances in our country, if we keep our wallet phrase and password in the same location where we live, there's a real possibility of losing access to our cryptocurrency. That's why, even though we hope it never happens to us, it's important to prepare for such scenarios.Putting this information online can be quite risky, so keeping it in writing is a safer option. In this case, make sure you have copies in different locations that are only accessible by you. I understand that this can be challenging, especially if you don't have multiple properties. In such cases, you might consider entrusting copies to family or friends who do not live in the same place you do. While there is some risk associated with this, you need to assess whether you can tolerate that risk because having backups in different locations is a best practice for safeguarding your cryptocurrency assets.",

Or can you get the coins back?In case of a war your computer burns and your bitcoin phrase which is saved in this computer system is fully burned then recovery of your wallet is impossible and all the bitcoin in your wallet will be gone permanently. Bitcoin is a valuable asset and the phrase is for its security you can not unlock your wallet without the phrase. Do not save your phrase in a single place when you save it in one place the chance of losing the phrase and risk increases. You also cannot save it in your office or other places if the body meets your phrase it will also cause complications so I think the best thing is to write down your phrase on a steal plate and put It into a save if anything other than warlike fire or any else occur your phrase will be saved and if you lose your phrase luckily you gotta live then life will be very difficult for you and you have to do all the work again which will take more time.",

If we lose the phrase we will not be able to access it. Therefore, backup other than on the computer is important, maybe we can make a copy of the phrase with several alternatives. Natural disasters, war are unexpected factors, to anticipate these undesirable things alternatives such as writing phrases on iron plates, printing 12 phrases on paper or something similar are very necessary, of course we have to consider this option which is resistant to water and fire.OP, I'm sorry for what you're experiencing, to help your problem now is your memory, because a BTC wallet without 12 Phrases is impossible to be access.",

Or can you get the coins back?Of course, you have drawn attention to a very important issue, because when there is war, often everything is destroyed. We often write down our passwords and seed phrases in a diary or somewhere secret, but in the destruction that follows the war, all this can be lost. A password can be memorized, but a 12-word or 24-word seed phrase is extremely difficult to remember.We have never thought that if such a situation arises, how we will get our coins back. After war again we cannot get our phrase safe. so there is no sustainable solution in sight. I don't think we will be able to get our coins back after the destruction of the war. It may be that if we feel that a war is about to break out in our country, we can secure our set-freezes with a close relative or friend whom we can trust, if he resides in another country, but there will be danger in this too.",

If I recall correctly, war torn country survivors are going to be refugees in other countries that's giving asylums, your best bet in that scenario is you become a refugee in a country that's not racist and against immigrants and if you can, establish a business (higher chance of business boom if it's food related given that new culture means curiosity for the locals who've never tried the new culture's cuisine), I mean that's what a lot of immigrants have opted to do when they went to other countries right? If you have the passphrase saved somewhere online, you can probably get it back.",

Or can you get the coins back?On reading this at first, I wanted to disregard it until I understood that there is a great sense in the post. What OP said is something that might likely happen. I haven't experienced any war since I was born but I think war doesn't just happen. There are some signs and build ups to war before the real war starts. When the signs were coming, maybe as Homas were sending missiles, I would simply grab my seed phrase or important my wallet on my mobile device. Either or both of the two methods will enable me escape with the seed phrase before the war intensifies.Steel made seed phrase is an option. But I'm thinking about a situation that a whole high elevated building is brought down and after the war you go back to excavate the collapsed structure in search of a seed phrase",
