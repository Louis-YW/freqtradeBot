Then it gave surprises after surprised and we finally saw Bitcoins at 69k usd. So yes 1 million USD for Bitcoins is not impossible and so do 1$ for a satoshi. Everything depends on the demand that is raised by the Bitcoin holder to acquire the Bitcoins.",

Anything is impossible could be possible but in the sense or the thing we do talk about on having that BTC on $100M/coin price then this is something that cant really be that possible. We know that 1 sat is the smallest number could a certain person to have. If things turns out that 100M per 1 sat then imagine on what would be the entire cap? I cant really be able to comprehend about those numbers and pushing up transactions wont really be going as low on 1 sat on which means it would really be that much higher on every transactions made on which it would be always having that standard 1sat/byte transaction and numbers or value of feesis something that you wont really be that relaxed about. This is why it wont really be that much of an interesting thing if you do assume out this situation because it would really be that too complicated or it isnt something that could really happen even in my wildest dream.",

I get that it's not going to be a simple thing, but I have to point out that it's going to take a while for that to happen. I am pretty sure that when we are talking about something as bleak as the \"future\", we can say that yes it's possible. Now I know we have talked about how 100 million is nearly impossible, but also.. it just says future, it doesn't really say when. So maybe we are talking about 100-200 years down the line? I am not even sure if bitcoin will exist in 200 years, but if it does, would it be impossible to think about? Considering the inflation, in 200 years it could very well be very normal, like today's 100k maybe? Thats why that \"future\" should be a lot more certain date before we can answer.",

I've just thought of the possibility of a satoshi reaching dollar parity due to Bitcoin's ever-rising popularity. It may not happen during our lifetime, but it could happen in the distant future. I certainly wouldn't want 1 satoshi to be worth $1, as that would mean paying ultra-high fees per BTC transaction (in USD terms). Maybe developers will introduce \"fractional satoshis\" to solve the problem? We're \"lightyears\" away from seeing BTC reaching $100m, so there's nothing to worry about. Just my thoughts",
