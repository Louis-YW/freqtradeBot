  "content": "After going through Bisq and not finding any offers on BTC/INR pairing I wanted to find out an alternative. Although we can create a thread on this board wherein we can post that an offer was placed on Bisq for either buying Bitcoin or for selling it for INR. Still, we won't be able to generate a lot of offers as most offers would come from members who would be only looking to sell BTC for INR. Therefore I did some research and found another P2P exchange that allows you to do an anonymous transaction for BTC/INR pair. The exchange URL is https://localmonero.co. What I liked about it is that it has a similar interface for Indians as Binance provides. There are a lot of offers available and some offer to pay INR using UPI. I saw 6 multiple offers today (crypto & INR), not sure whether they will be available tomorrow.I did go through the FAQ and found it similar to LocalBitcoins but with different terminology.QuoteAll online trades are protected by arbitration bonds. When a trade is started an amount of Monero equal to the amount of the trade is automatically reserved from the seller's LocalMonero bond wallet. This means that if the seller runs away with your money and does not finalize the trade, LocalMonero support can direct the Monero held in the arbitration bond to you. If you're selling Monero, never finalize the trade before you know that you have received money from the Monero buyer. Please note that local trades do not have arbitration bond protection enabled by default.If anyone here has done any transaction on localmonero then please share your experience.",

      "body": "I personally yet to try the localmonero but I can say it's a legit p2p website like LBC and operating for a years if I am not wrong so it can be one of the alternate to LBC but while I am checking the trade offers the highest price for selling BTC for INR is 5% less than market price for buying its over 10% than actual BTC price which is huge price difference in my opinion so I didn't find those offers attractive so for now Paxful can be the perfect alternative for LBC unless you care about their KYC system.",
