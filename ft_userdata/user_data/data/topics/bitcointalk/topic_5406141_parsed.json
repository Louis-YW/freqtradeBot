You need to experience how to do it and think for yourself if you want to continue or not. As the usual trade goes by telling buying low and selling high, that's all about it but to add flavor and getting more chance of winning your trades.You need to be educated on how to read the charts and know more about RSI and other indicators that you might bump off with your trading journey.",

Just like having risk:reward ratio for every trade and practicing sticking to plan (stop loss, take profit).",

If all the coins are stable then we will have a hard time making a profit.  You only need to learn technical and fundamental analysis to support your trading skills. As far as I know there are currently three types of traders, scalping, Day Trade, weekly trade, or holder. Try trying one by one, after that try to adjust it to your trade style. Whichever you think is quite convenient and profitable then use it.",

Most traders lose money. The majority of people who got rich in crypto bought something like BTC or ETH early and held for several years. You can do the same by investing in a good project (DYOR) when it first launches, like MAXX or LAMINA1 for example, and even better if you can stake it because then you will earn profit even in a bear market. And if you don't have the funds to invest, try mining with a gaming pc or participating in airdrops or giveaways. MAXX Finance has both of these and there are aridrop and bounties sections here on this forum that can aid you. That said, if you must trade for some reason, use a stoploss and consider copy trading.",

In trading, you don't need to acquire all those strategies, what you need is the strategy that you think you are comfortable with and literally effective. Focusing on 1 or 2 could be enough as having multiple strategies will only confuse you on which of them you are going to follow. I've prepared spot trading, anyway.",

There’s a lot of good topics on that section about trading, and since OP loves to trade I assume that he already have a good knowledge about it but it looks like he’s still looking for a perfect combination of his own strategy. The price will always fluctuates though, that’s the everyday scenario of a trader so better for OP to adopt it and live with it. Trading is fun but still a risky one, if you can’t find the good source here better to look have a good mentor in trading, this can be a huge help for you.",

Market is still remain unpredictable even when you are making so many technical analyzation. So many people have been predicting so many times but market was always going to the reverse trend. Im thinking about you shall try to take the basic strategy. Try to use your stop lose to decrease the risk to lose from trading your money. You must always try to take any bearish trend as opportunity to buy. You must always become a smart guy to scalping the market.",

I'm talking about a legitimate and recognized strategy. it may be for the creator it is an effective technique but not necessarily effective for others. The exception is a strategy that does not go through a validity test that only relies on the mouse path. And distributed through unofficial spaces. Like one of the free fake trading channels, most of which are just traps. What you need to know is to choose and sort out a strategy that fits your needs, not according to other people's trading conditions.",

To answer that you need to master one or a few strategies that work for you, you can mind the price fluctuation but take note that in the crypto space most tokens/coins do the same and it's just natural.
