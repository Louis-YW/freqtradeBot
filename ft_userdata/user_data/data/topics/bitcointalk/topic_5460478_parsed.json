You'll receive 1 spin for depositing over $100, another spin for depositing over $500, and an additional spin for trading over $100. That's how you can get up to 14 spins from each account. There are various rewards for this event, such as $10k, $100 Starbucks gift card, 1 air-conditioner, and more.",

I have never even shared ANY kind of referral links so I don't even have any profit hereYeah, you are right I am spamming! You need to understand that there are multiple tools available to prove my claim of you spamming my thread. Another reason for me accusing you of spamming is that you do not have any evidence that the exchange is providing NON-KYC trading. We do not take screenshots as an answer as in the past there have been many who did the same. As a result innocent members lost their investment. If you can show me written documentation by the exchange then I would clearly accept it. Otherwise do not spam! Do not act like an innocent newbie.",
