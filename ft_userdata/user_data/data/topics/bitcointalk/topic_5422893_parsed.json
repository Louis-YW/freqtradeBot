Unlike with gold and ither assets which are continuously rising over years. In this industry, not only with Butcoin, there are just seasons or periods wherein the demand increases continuously but also periods wherein it is low such as with the present, caused by factors.",

We might also see other businesses in the Altcoin scene go down due to the Altcoins tanking. People lose faith much more easily in Altcoins than Bitcoin. If we have several more bankruptcies, and god forbid another exchange go down; it could potentially tank further. Although, if nothing bad happens in the next six months, I'd imagine we'd see some sort of recovery. Probably a small increase, but nothing too drastic.

And with that, lowest low is $15,500, so I would say that we can still slashed $2k based on the previous lowest low then maybe we might be looking at $13,k'ish.We still have to remember that 2024 will like be another bearish trend, so the market is still open for another leg down before we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel in 2024.

And worst come to worst, $11k is still possible.It's too hard to know where the bottom of bitcoin is, I'm also one of those who think 17.5k is the bottom of this cycle as we've been struggling to stay above 19k for months. The Fed's rate hike is seen as the biggest impact of bitcoin's further fall, but it seems bitcoin is also insensitive to it. That's also why I think we've bottomed out but in the end the market always gives us surprises.I believe the crash of FTX is not over yet and this time we will have a new low, not stopping at 15.5k. IMO, this is going to be the worst bear season ever so I'm ready for more bad stuff and more fiat to buy as much bitcoin as I can.",

I think that this board already has several threads dealing with the same question, so I wonder if we need another one?We can speculate and guess as much as we want, but the only truth is that the only true bottom is the moment when the BTC price would touch 0, which of course will not happen. All that is happening is the result of human stupidity, starting with the fact that millions believed Mr. Mars, and then Kwon, and finally Bankman and various fairy tale sellers who promoted them with all the bells and whistles.The only hope that everyone can have is in the halving, which means that realistically before the second half of 2024, I personally do not hope that there can be any major positive changes. What I am more sure of is that some new world-class scammer will appear in that period and will catch millions in his net - but if someone has the mentality of a sheep, nothing can save him, that's a fact.",

Thank you. My forecast is unchanged from last year, I believe that the very bottom of bitcoin is at around $10,000. Firstly, these are the same 85% loss of value after ATH (this is how much bitcoin lost in the past bear markets of 2014 and 2018-2019). Secondly, in 2020, it was from the $10 000 mark (approximately) that the ascent of bitcoin began, the global bullrun began after a long recovery and accumulation. The bottom at around $15 500 does not seem to me the final point of this crypto winter, perhaps we will see the finale of this epic in 2023, not earlier, and at much lower price levels.The bottom is usually what ever price a top of the line miner does at six cent power.so s19 xp does 141 th that is 141 x 0.0582 = $8.21it burns 3100x24= 75kwattsthat is $4.50 for power add $1 for overhead$5.50 daily cost8.21- 5.50= $2.71 daily profit for a machine that costs over 4000So miners are hurting but if they own the gear outright they are not in trouble.So we are not at a bottom with current diff and current price.I see 10-11 as very likely based on breakeven numbers for the s19 xpnow if you want to argue do not use the s19 xpuse the s19 proyou get 110 x 0.05829 = 6.41-5.50 or $0.91which means current price is close and 15.7 was spot on.last factor is how many big companies took loans on the gear to get it.that means bottom is very likely in.Thats the mining side of it.Should be very interesting 6-9 months.Dca is your friend.",

It could stop at 15k, it could also go to 10k or somewhere 5k.

Most people are only into Bitcoin because of the price, so a major downfall would surely scare away the general public from investing into it. This will result in loss of confidence as we speak. Why do you think people still trust Gold these days even when there's Bitcoin in play? People trust Gold because it has never experience (AFAIK) a huge downfall in price, making it a stable and reliable store of value. You'd just invest into Gold, forget about it for a couple of years, and then come back with your money nearly intact (Gold is volatile but at a much lower rate than Bitcoin). If Bitcoin were the same, things would've been different by now.At least, we all know prices won't be down forever. The next halving comes in 2024, so it's likely market prices will rise after that. If you buy BTC at cheap prices now, you'll be able to reap the benefits in the future. Who knows how far will the cryptocurrency go? Just my thoughts",
