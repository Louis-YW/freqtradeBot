  "content": "I translated one of fillippone posts to my local Bangali language.  Here is the post link https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=631891.msg62888765#msg62888765But when I went to post the whole post the whole text was not posting together. After I put the complete text in the post box, when I click on the post button, almost half of the part is automatically skipped and posted. I haven't been able to post the entire text together after several attempts. Which is why I have to post this in two parts. why it happen to me? 1.Is there a specific character limit for posting based on profile rank?2. As there is no local board for Bangladesh. This is just a topic in Other Languages. So is there a specific character limit for replies there?3. Or can't post more characters on a specific character without being an op of a topic?  But I saw JayJuanGee posting 25k+ characters in some of his single posts.4. Or is it a bug in the forum? 5. Or it has specific character limitations for writing local language?",

Or it has specific character limitations for writing local language? 1. Nope, all ranks are same.2. Either topic or reply, there's a limit.Quote from: theymos on May 10, 2016, 04:25:11 PMYeah, that's what it is. Posts over 65535 bytes get cut off at 65535 bytes. If that makes the BBcode invalid in certain ways, then you get the INVALID BBCODE error.3. There's a difference encoding (Unicode Transformation Format) of each language, not sure Bangladesh language is using how many bits. But someone have pointed out in Urdu language..4. Nope.5. Maybe.I count your post, it consist of around 10,850 characters in Bangladesh language, so just assume it's half from 21,799 characters.",

But someone have pointed out in Urdu language..Yes, I now understand why this happened after reading Theymos' post. Bengali character byte count is much more than English character it is almost 2x. And that's why my post was auto cut. And I couldn't even give a post subject like I thought. Thanks for clearing this up",

I believe Bot will be able to give a better answer in this regard.",

I do not know if it is possible to increase 65535 bytes in some specific LBs, but the easiest solution remains the one I mentioned first.Also, the limit is per byte and not the number of words, so your calculation of the number of words will not be accurate, and each char consumes 6 bytes, which is more than English letters.",
