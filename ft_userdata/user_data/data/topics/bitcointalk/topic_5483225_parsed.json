  "content": "My recommendationsDon't try to find All time high, you can not predict it correctly and you will only know ATH of a cycle after you are already in a bear market.Don't time the market. Let's the market runs and try to exit with market cycle length, that you can base on Bitcoin history.Each cycle is unique and it can be longer or shorter than previous cycles but if you make your strategy on average cycle length, you will not take profit too far from the ATH & more important you will be able to avoid stuck too deep in a bear market.If you don't want to exit the market by taking profit with all bitcoins you have, do DCA for profit taking, withdrawal like this strategy.[ANN] JJG Sustainable Bitcoin Withdrawal Strategyhttps://bitcoindata.science/withdrawal-strategyBiggest common mistake of newbies is trying to find absolute bottom or ATH. Just don't!Now, let's use following flow of thinking and plan from LadyofCrypto1.I will keep her content originally as it is. My own thinking is above.Quote‚ñ∂Ô∏è Some questions & predictionsWhen will Bitcoin break its ATH? November 2024When will the bull run end? September 2025When will most of the new 100x alts be released? Jan-July 2024Why do I think this? I'll show you below üëá‚ñ∂Ô∏è This Time Is NOT DifferentAll I've heard for the past 2 years is \"This time is different\".They said the bear would be longer because of FTX and recession...They said the BTC would break its ATH sooner because of ETFs...Yet, things have been exactly the same üëá‚ñ∂Ô∏è Market TopsIn 2017 the bull market peaked exactly 29 months before the halving. In 2021 it did the exact same thing.Alright, I know, it might just be a coincidence. But what if I told you...‚ñ∂Ô∏è Bear Market LengthBoth the 2018 and 2022 bear markets lasted exactly 12 months. This is crazy when you consider how many people were saying this bear market would be way longer and deeper.But was it deeper?No, it wasn't. In the 2018 market, Bitcoin retraced 84%. In the 2022 one there was only a 77% retrace.So all the drama around the bear market and it ended up being the exact same length as the previous one and percentage-wise... better.‚ñ∂Ô∏è All Time HighIn the last two cycles, Bitcoin broke its all-time high 7 and then 8 months after the halving.The ETF has so far not propelled BTC to 100k overnight as many assumed. I think that like the last two time, it will be 7-8 months, so, November 2024!‚ñ∂Ô∏è Bull RunThe last three bull runs lasted 9, 9 and 11 months respectively. This one could be longer but I think 9-11 months is a good target to keep in mind.I think the next run peaks around September 2025 give or take a month. Let's talk profit-taking.‚ñ∂Ô∏è Taking Profit I'll take partial profit slowly the whole run up. I believe that if you're up big you should 5%-10% out to secure profit.A lot of people say \"Don't sell strength\"... meh. In crypto things can go from strong to dead in hours.I'll take a small amount of profit on alts that pump hard but as we get closer to Sep 2025 I'll ramp up profit taking. This is a loose plan and could change!Some profit will be moved out of crypto and the rest reinvested in new projects with more upside potential üöÄ",

The emotions will be high when we keep on seeing the surge and to the point that you may miss the ATH and not be able to sell, we can point that fault to ourselves if we are not able to take profits.",

My plan is to accumulate as much as I can and hold it until the next cycle of Bitcoin.¬† I know things won't happen in a instant so yes, I still create a margin for my bills and expenses and to avoid the tendency of pulling out my assets and holdings. I know most of us are having or thinking of the same thing and I hope all of us will make big profit by that time this market again break the ceiling. Planning will be always needed to lessen mistakes. Remember that entry point could be crucial so better be conscious of making rush decisions.Based on charts and previous witnessing of bulltrend, things will not be consistent. It is important to know when is the right time to sell or buy again if you are into swing trades. And if you are looking forward with long term holding, be sure to avoid checking smaller time frames or prices from time to time. Know your goal and create your own vision of how you will be making a move this time. Everything is in our hands and that should be an enough reason for us to be careful for the right timing.",

Not that it matters currently, we're in the middle of a bear and a bull. In general it is good advice, what happens is that if you have experience and knowledge on the subject, in addition to making DCA, you can do DCA partial sales at certain times. For example when the price clearly beats the previous ATH, say when it is at $75K, then when it hits $105K (I foresee huge resistance at $100K) and then put in every $25K after that figure. JJG has fairly detailed posts on this.With knowledge you can do variants of DCA by taking advantage to buy more in bear markets and do partial sells in bull markets.",

This is exactly the kind of phobia that long term holding pattern actually eliminates. The bitcoin price is always unpredictable with or without the ETF hype so if you‚Äôre having trouble about whether the price will fall more the bull run will kick starts now, which is not common according to past trends I will tell you to simply go long term and probably calculate the average price of your current holding and then set a price target to take profits, this way you‚Äôll be at peace holding and wouldn‚Äôt be scared of this fluctuations.

Totally agree on DCA though and if you really decide on the buy back part though, make sure that you're going to buy back big because you don't want to be regretting not buying a lot when it was the supposed lowest price of bitcoin and your only regret is that they didn't pay you more so you can buy more bitcoin.",

That will be so painful. I can say the same thing with Bear market too, timing the bottom have make many people to miss it already, the feeling of never getting enough is greed, when the FTX saga started I knew it will hit very hard, probably the best buying opportunity, I went all into Bitcoin then and I started saving some USDT again, and when 15k Bitcoin happened I did the same thing. Those who are expecting 10k Bitcoin will never get it again, and they will probably buy back at 30k range if they are lucky, instead of targeting the market price action it's better to use the cycle, Bear market is a buying period and bull market is a selling period, if you don't follow this you will miss out.",

But since we're not yet on the halving, there's still a possibility that we'd see it go down a bit. Maybe going back to $38k and quite lower than that.

      "body": "OP, good analysis. The bitcoin market cycles have been working like clockwork so while we can't know what the next peak will be, we have a very good idea of roughly when it will be and at least a general range it should be in, and we know how the cycle operates through its four years duration. This makes Bitcoin the easiest investment to make a ton of money on, not only is it one of the best growing assets in the world, but also it is extremely predictable. You analysis points that out for anyone who isn't already very aware of it.Though I did laugh at this: \"The ETF has so far not propelled BTC to 100k overnight as many assumed.\" hahaha I certainly hope no one was naive enough to think that! Though I do remember last year in March or April seeing people on here predict Bitcoin would be hitting $60k by like June of last year, so I guess some people just reallyyyyyyy overestimate how fast Bitcoin grows haha. For anyone who understands the market cycles and Bitcoin's growth, we've known $100k is coming in 2025 and no sooner. And second half of 2025 is the time to start DCA'ing out to take any market cycle gains for those who want to do that. I personally plan to do that with some of my Bitcoin this time around, and buy back a bit on the crash in 2026.Oh also good job pointing out that the last bear market was the least severe yet. While the bear market was going on I saw sooooo many people and even mainstream news sites claiming that the bear market was the worst one in history for Bitcoin, when in fact it was the LEAST severe crash Bitcoin has ever had. I was always so confused why everyone was under the delusion that it was the worst when it was the least worst. Granted it did have a bunch of collapses in the crypto industry, so maybe that is what people were talking about, but the thing is that DESPITE all those collapses of Terra Luna, the whole crypto lending industry, some crypto investment firms, and finally FTX, the bear market was the most shallow one yet! Which really strongly shows that Bitcoin crashes are getting less severe since the industry ecosystem collapses were the worst yes, but even that couldn't stop the bitcoin price crash from being the least severe one in Bitcoin's history. In the next bear market, if the companies in the industry can learn from the mistakes of last time and avoid those sorts of collapses, I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin crash only maybe 55-60%.",
