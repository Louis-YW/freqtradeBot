We can help in cleaning this board, if you notice any post which are not meant to be there you can either report them to moderators to move it, after they have checked if the report is correct or you can either suggest for the OP to move the thread over to the appropriate board that it belong, it might even be a currency related topic which could be for economics but most people drop it under politics and society.",

The chicken or the egg. But there is some relation. There are some trolls who spend the day there and then there are others who look like political activists with whom you know you are not going to get anything clear if you try to debate with them, but they will keep reaffirming their message although this tends to happen in political discussions in general, not just in this forum.",

It seems some posters are missing the whole point of the board and because it's tagged \"society\", they feel those kinds of posts are included. Maybe they need to be reoriented about what posts are deemed for the board? Because I dunno if reporting them to mods will curtail such and that would just be leaving much work for them (mods) don't you think?",
