Anyone? Now who is to blame for this? The casino or your internet connection or something else? I've asked this on Twitter and some said it's technical glitches, that's acceptable, but if this costs you some money, all because of technical glitches who is responsible for your loss? What will you do about this? It's a shame that technical glitches and server errors still happen on some online casinos, games that aren't even graphically intense, they aren't even using lots of data resources to run e.g upload and download speed. This doesn't happen to me but my very close friend and he is at a loss because of it, im just wondering what I would have done if it happened to me?",

      "body": "Yes, glitches affect the gameplay... it can be very annoying when slots freeze and ask me to refresh the page so I can continue to play. Usually, those spins get refunded immediately, or when we refresh the page we continue where we stop, but still nobody likes such interruptions. Technical issues occur here and there, and we can't say if it's on our side or if the casino has some issues before we investigate the problem itself with the help of support of course. Anyway, when it happens it affects the experience. I had a little situation a few nights ago: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5389679.msg62713805#msg62713805. I couldn't play normally, so I just moved my funds to another casino and I played the same providers without any problems. So I guess it was some problem on their end.",

      "body": "I think if you have made the bet already and it was ongoing before the error or glitch happened, the casino should be able to identify if you won or not and should be able to show you prove if you are debating your loss due to the glitch when they are up again but at the end if the whole program or prove/evidence of your game was wiped out then it shouldn't be your fault that you must lose your money, at least they should return or refund the bet money because the liability should be on them. In any case if the casino is not able to resolve the issue to my favour if they could not prove that I lost due to their own negligence and they want me to bear the cost of their inefficiency then depending on the bet money involved, I could either sue or lick my wound and move on and never to play with them again because the glitch could be a scam attempt if I didn't get my money back. However, such kind of glitch is in consequential in soccer because it is a global game showing in different countries. So a glitch in a bet company would not affect another bet company and by any means it won't affect the outcome of the match and even where the transmission from the field of play is cut off for whatever glitch, the game would still go on and the outcome would still be uploaded through livescore or any other means including google and team website. So the excuse of a glitch can only be for casino and encrypted games.",

Anyone? This kind of experience as you know is very common on games and not on sports bettings because they are life game match we place bet on, all other virtual forms of games can have such experience and we cannot say it's either the casino or the connection of the internet, to me a casino cab rare engage doing this form of manipulations as you've said, your own friends do encounter such but you never did, maybe your connectivity could be faulty, the internet may also be incase of the online games, weather conditions can also affect the connection making it skipping, we can't tell which exactly but there are many related chances of it resulting from what had just been said now.",

      "body": "I haven't experienced this since before, but I've seen posts on social media or people asking for support about the glitch before, which really affects the gameplay and your momentum in playing. The problem really before is that the game has not been fully optimized, so it is still experiencing some bugs. In today's status, only a few of them are still not optimized, but right now it is really rare to hear about this issue. What is worse is that if they can't track it, meaning you bet, then a bug happens, then you lose your money, which is really sad and frustrating. When I  heard this before, I would have stayed away from that casino just to be safe. Though right now there are no perfect casinos or even the game, you will still experience a bug, but again, it is rare right now as it has been QAed already and mostly the casino used the code that has been implemented or used by other casinos also.",

Maybe it varies based on the type of game, but it would definitely be a terrible game mechanic, considering the potential for connection issues and such. If the game is provably fair, then I don't think it's possible. In provably fair games, the result of every round is calculated even before you make your bet. So, any issues with the game like freezes or glitches shouldn't impact the result.",

Maybe your friend is playing at a new casino that doesn't have a very nice appearance and is easy to access, so there are problems and disturbances with it, for example from the casino, whether the server or whatever, you will usually be asked to refresh the page, indeed there are some casinos that are still like that It seems that it's not just our internet network, but the sites are a little problematic, usually sites that aren't too big.So far, I have played on gambling platform sites, there have never been any problems with any constraints from their site, even using a cellphone, you can still gamble without problems, and those of us who play also need to pay attention to internet speed too because if it's not stable, don't ever try to play gambling because that too can hinder and have problems later, but if that happens to you when you see an incident like that you should not force yourself to gamble, try to take a break and come back after everything is normal.",

If it would gave me actual money that i could withdraw and they took it back, it would be more than a glitch. But my glitches so far have happened all in new casinos. One time crash game just didn't stop, and i couldn't click cash out in crash because the button didn't work either. Even if it said that i made more money that exist in the world, i wasn't obviously winning.So it hasn't cost me money. In fact an opposite has happened in one smaller casino, that i leave unnamed. It had a glitch that gave my account nearly $70 in SOL. I know that account was empty before. I checked everything, bonuses, transactions, wins and tips. Everything. But it had no trace of origin what so ever. So i tried to play one slot with it. It worked and i withdrawed it. I didn't bother to contact helpdesk that they have made a mistake. I might have done that if it would be a significant amount.",

There's always a chance for that to happen. Just like what had mentioned it usually got refunded if the casino detected it while playing after the glitch, if not, you can actually report it and wait for their verdict of refund you, the casino probably have error logs of it, if it actually happens, and will refund you after. But not all casinos will do that, that's why always use a reputable one so your issue will always be catered once reported.",
