I'm just general and not much different, as long as I know when it comes to borrowing, especially when we apply for loans at traditional banks or other financial institutions. The terms and conditions apply, first and second, a strict identification process is applied, starting from verifying credit whether you have applied for it or not, then checking a person's financial capability in terms of repaying the loan in the future by the bank.And if I'm not mistaken, loans with a high enough rating allow you to get BTC quickly via credit card. But, it's best not to. There is a downside, prices may not reflect this reality for long because everything is volatile.",

Because I have had some experience from loan app companies I will share with you. Literally anyone can get a loan within 30 minutes from a loan app. You do not need to be known or even to need to be employed. Those details are unnecessary what these loan app need from you is your KYC, your bank account information, and you would be required to connect your bank account to the loan app such that if you default on payment, the loan app will automatically deduct the money from your bank account if you have any money in it. In my country you will be required to take a picture of yourself, grant the app permission to access your contacts, text messages and other apps on your phone, you'll have to submit national ID with tracking number on it. These qualify you for a loan.",

What about the interest, is it going to be any better?There's a rank requirement of course and sometimes they ask for a collateral. But it depends on the lender if what is the minimum rank to apply for a loan. A few requirements are being applied as we do not know each other here and an identification is not being required. These requirements are being apply to secure that the borrower will pay the debt. Even for you if someone ask you to borrow money with someone you do not know, you can't simply lend money and trust someone especially a newbie rank to have a loan.",

It’s not about the need to be known but rather your capability to repay the loan that’s why most of the bank choose known people that can repay the loan since they need to guarantee safety of their capital.You can loan anytime even you are just still new if you can prove a strong source of income or assets that can be use as collateral. Banks just need to secure that loan will be paid through financial capabilities of their client.",

I highly doubt if you would.Lending money to people is a risky business and to mitigate your risks you have to go the extra mile in knowing more about this person you want to give your loan to, so I don't see any issue with that. Before you go applying for loan you have to give some information about yourself and still you have to be of good records, if you don't like that then avoid taking loans.",

Knowing your personal information is one their assurance that you could pay them cause they know your identity. They would also process if your monthly salary could pay up your loan, and they would interview you like how much money do you spend to provide your needs so they could calculate. And if it happens that you just by passed and did not pay literally the debt, they could just simply contact the place of your job so they could less your debt to your salary which is legal.",

      "body": "To be fair the reason why they get all those is to know what to do if you do not pay back. If there was somehow some hidden anon person you are %100 sure that would pay you back, the nyou could give them a loan too, whats the point of asking anything you are %100 certain that the person will pay you back. However, since we are not %100 sure, the reason to get identification is that if you do not end up paying the loan backı, they could sue you and take you to court. For example I take out a loan from a bank, and I give all my information to them, I end up not paying it back, since they who I am and where I live, then come to my house with cops and lawyers and take my stuff, that's always how its handled. This is why the idea of identification is not to see if you are worth it, that's what financial statements are for, not your house address, not even your name, they just need your financial information even if the name was hidden, for you to be able to get a loan or not, the other personal information parts are there to make sure they can come after you if you reject or can't pay the loan back.",

If you are known, people easily can identify with what you do and have an idea of what you earn. If people know what you earn or have an idea based on your profession, they can become more willing to help you out with loans knowing that you have the capacity to pay back the loan. This is my thought on why unknown people who barely can provide any form of identification are rarely eligible for loans from individuals or companies like loan apps. If you are not known too, it can be easy for you to disappear with loans and never repay.",

However, it's not a must in every deals, because anyone can borrow money from a bank without having to be known. But then, they have to offer another guarantees: collaterals or guarantors who will sign the papers within the borrower, compromising themselves to pay the debt in case the borrower fails.It's really common when signing papers to have access to a financing at educational institutions, buying properties and starting a business. The lender will never get annoyed by the fact you aren't a known person. His only concern is about solid guarantees the money is going to be paid back somehow without setbacks.",

You would really be needing to provide on whatever they've been asking and of course it would really be just that normal that collateral should be there or whatever that assurance that you could really have on having a loan.As for online loans then i have experienced for needing up such location but i dont think that it would really be that something to be precise considering that locations could really be altered out on makinguse of data connection on which you could really still be able to skip out if you do really intend not to show up your own place on the said transaction.As for P2P then it would really be not that possible yet you are really that still touching up the platform on which in regarding to be able to make use of that p2p then you should really be having that verified account and the rest then dealing up with real user or bot on the platform in regarding p2p transactions is unlikely.",

Meaning will I loan money to someone that I can't get the money back from despite his or her verbal promises and of course that is why guarantor comes in and the place of a guarantor in a loan contract is important.So whether offline or online, a first timer in a loan contract is well scrutinized than the person who has been getting the loan and repaying as at when agreed. In other words, the first time stand a lesser chance to get a loan than he who defaults to repay but he who repays at when due would always get loan and even more if he request.You can get a loan while staying anonymous at least here but you must meet the conditions and those are means to ensure the money is recovered. So to loan is a business and whoever is in the business works to sustain it and profit, so they won't give out loan to who won't pay back including interest. Banks ensure they get a collateral above the value of the loan you are going for.",

That has always been the case, in the past banks used to be local banks and not the multinational corporations that we see today, and they will not lend you any money if you were from a region which was outside of their influence, so a bank at New York will not lend money to someone from Texas and the reverse was also true, so it is not that surprising that banks want to know as much as they can from you before they give you a loan, as otherwise they may lend their money to someone that may never pay them back.",

You see, human beings are very wicked and they change at slightest opportunity. If documentations are not done properly and they lend money to them, more than 75% of them will not come back to pay back their debt, so don't blame the banks for going overboard to loan known individuals and people they can easily track down.How do you want a loan to be given to a strange person that you cannot track when he dafualt a payment? What are you going to do if they don't really have a means to pay back? These are the problems you should ask. Even in a decentralized lending platforms that document and information are not collected, a collateral deposit is required before you can borrow money from any of their protocols. If you wish to have a successful business in lending, make sure you know who you are lending but if they provide collateral, I may depends on safe the collateral relative to amount needed.",
