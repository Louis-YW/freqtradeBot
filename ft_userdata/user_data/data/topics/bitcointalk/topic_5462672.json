I think one ETF has been named BRRR which is in itself a funny name. BTC in itself is decentralized but if a company \"X\" will have 1000 BTC and used them for ETFs then the ones who will buy shares from that X company will not buy real decentralized BTC instead they are buying Centralized pegged type BTC from those companies. Which make the whole scenario as centralized.",

SO the perception about cryptocurrency is changing so as a result governments, regulators, and financial institutions accepting it and trying to make more benefits.",

The situation is so intense that now what matter most is who will control the market. In the current situation, it seems, no one wants to be the last one to jump over space.I assume you are referring to the spot Bitcoin ETF approval application by BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, and Ark. These firms are profit-making organizations so they want to make money from investing in Bitcoin. They might also have other hidden agenda which will unfold in the future. The SEC has not approved any application and it has not shown any sign of shifting ground. The SEC believes that approving spot Bitcoin ETF can lead to Bitcoin price manipulation by these firms. This rush to be part of the Bitcoin market has its advantages but there are also dire consequences.

Currently, these firms are making Bitcoin to be accepted by some traditional investors. But they can also spread FUD to hurt the market.",

Couple of weeks back, I saw a news that a small country called Bhutan is setting up a Bitcoin mining firm. So countries have started taking part in the game and it's not good. The only way Bhutan earns money is through tourism. Also, the place is cold so it is ideal for a Bitcoin mining firm. They also run four major hydroelectric facilities, some small facilities as well. They are in a very good position to operate a Bitcoin firm. For being operated and controlled by a government their bitcoin firm can be a potential source of income for the country. Perhaps it's not good for the overall bitcoin market but it makes them a potential candidate to make bitcoin as a legal tender.",

They came with restrictions, ban and termed it illegal but they still failed to understand that this era is a technological era which cuts across all divide  and the finance industry is not left out. Finally, they came up with policies to confine crypto activities putting it under their watch and then they remembered that they could generate revenue through tax payment from the crypto owned organizations which worked out for them because the owners of those crypto organizations are well known with location and identity. So they were able to penetrate crypto industry to do their bidding's but one thing I know for sure is that  the government can not and can never be able to control the BITCOIN as it has no body claiming control over it and all other crypto assets are dependent of bitcoin in existence.",

Another fact worth considering is that most organizations can't easily pivot to using Bitcoin as a payment gateway or integrate it into their platforms simply because it was a new technology with big promises or cutting off intermediaries. So they choose to ignore it at first or probably because you need to get approval across the board before you would be able to make a change as big as adopting bitcoin plus possible legal implications in their organization region.Better late than never in my opinion but no one person or individual can control bitcoin network at the end of the day.",
