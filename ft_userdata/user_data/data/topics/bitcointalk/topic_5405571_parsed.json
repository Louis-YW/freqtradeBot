  "content": "The U.S. Treasury Department published a fact sheet Thursday outlining how it could work with foreign regulators to address the cryptocurrency sector.The fact sheet, which is the first report published by the department as a result of U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order on crypto, said the framework \"is intended to ensure that ... America's core democratic values are respected,\" pointing to consumer, investor and business protection, the safety of the global financial system and interoperability.According to the sheet, the framework's policy objectives also include reducing the potential use of crypto for illicit finance, promoting access to financial services, supporting technological advancement and \"reinforc[ing] U.S. leadership in the global financial system.\"To support this work, the Treasury Department said the U.S. should hold \"engagements\" and other types of forums, the fact sheet said.(Source: Coindesk)",

      "body": "I'll quote this part:Quote\"The United States must continue to work with international partners on standards for the development of digital payment architectures and CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) to reduce payment inefficiencies and ensure that any new payment systems are consistent with U.S. values and legal requirements,\"It seems that the news is related to the digital currencies of the central bank, which are completely different from the concept of cryptocurrencies, as they are central and can be based on any system, not the blockchain.The difference between these currencies is significant and we cannot compare them or consider that the news is related to them.So I think the title of the news is misleading.",
