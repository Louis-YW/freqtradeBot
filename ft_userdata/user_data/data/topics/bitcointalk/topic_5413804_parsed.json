If we simply evaluate this, I think we are safe to say it's a method to make rich people more rich as they will have more power with their holdings. This makes the system more centralized. People with heavy investment can easily have the control of the chain.Your discussion would better fit in altcoin discussion since it's all about altcoin discussion here.",

But I guess it's open source - perhaps a rival chain can come out.",

Such as large investment funds that allow you to invest in ETH. So sooner or later ETH might become centralized and controlled by US government. My bet is that the bigger winner of eth merge is bitcoin",

Whales or not they should not have the power to control the market.",

It's not surprising that such a system produce that kind of output, even their community itself mostly just simply doesn't care about it. So indeed it is expected, the question should rather be how much centralization they are willing to get through. In another hand, measuring centralization doesn't solely able to be perceived using a consensus mechanism, rather there are many factors to see about, a cryptocurrency could still be using PoW but centralized in specific aspects.",

Sure it may cost a lot of energy to maintain and secure the blockchain, but no approaches or algorithm has been made to put security against centralization at the top except for PoW. Also, I think a lot of people who bought into PoS coins know the risks of centralization and they are just trying to shrug it off since they believe that no foolish moves will be made by those who control a huge number of coins anyway, because it also affects the value of their investment.",

That being said, i am also pretty sure that those huge mining farms in china also had a pretty big share of the whole Ethereum mining power under their control. That is also the reason why those big mining companies where tryping to push that ETHPoW fork now, but so far it seems like that will be not really successful.In my opinion the switch from PoW to PoS had to happen because otherwise big companies or institutions would be reluctant to use Ethereum as their network for blockchain applications. In the word of today it is a huge bonus if you are a climate friendly project.",
