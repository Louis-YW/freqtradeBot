There are casinos that force you to change your seeds once in a while, for example Bitsler does that. I have tried to frequently gamble with one seed for about a week and then I tried changing seeds 3-4 times a day for about a week and what I can tell you is that I still lost and didn't notice any improvement in outcome from bet.By the way, games are purely based on luck and it doesn't matter whether you change your seeds or not, it doesn't increase your winning chance.",

For me, still based on our particular luck (everyone is different), maybe what works for him, might not work for the rest of us. Or even if it works for him, it might not be working all the time.Just like the superstitious belief of wearing red for lucky charm when you play on a traditional based casinos. You will observed the some of them are wearing red, however, maybe all of them are losing or some of them are winning, or almost all of them are winning. So it's very different for everyone.",

Casino would not provably allow that one lucky seed and used always used by people since this could be a reason on why they lose casino lost a lot of money. Casino offers provably fair system so for sure this will implement to any game that's why anyone can't take advantage on certain situation and use it to have huge chance to win. Also I don't really care much about such thing since I rarely play Plinko and will just play that if I'm so bored.",

There's afaik no way to prove whether it really works, most people just do it because of the \"feel\" for it or something similar. Otherwise, the casino would be damned since just \"resetting\" the seed to increase the chance means that the game itself has factors involved that are manipulable by the game. Who knows, it might not just stop at seeds at that point and may have other factors that players can artificially manipulate. Kinda funny how a seed that's supposed to be proof of provabaly fair is being used to increase their chances when the action of \"increasing their chances\" goes against provably fair itself.",

I think I won a lot of times in that game because I am always afraid it will crash so I cash out whenever I feel like the profits are enough.

Then, I also had seeds that wouldn't give any multi-win after 1000x of the bet amount. Regarding Plinko, I also have a seed that won't hit the highest win amount in high-risk 14 lines but does give the second-highest a lot of times.Now my new seed gave me a lot of the highest win amounts for less than X5000 bets.It's difficult to explain things like this happening and maybe that is why gamblers will have their own beliefs when we talk about seeds.Quote from: Maus0728 on October 07, 2023, 12:53:29 PMI'd rather be cautious of casinos that cannot provide a means to verify their clients' bets themselves, rather than worrying and wondering whether changing the seed for each individual game at the casino could have any substantial impact on the outcome.Probably, that gambler you have seen believe to some kind \"Illusion of Control\"[1] fallacy where they can influence or control the outcome of the game, in his case not changing the seed, even when it's based on luck and randomization of numbers.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_controlThank you for sharing that.

I don't believe there's a correlation between your seed ad luck. If there is luck, it is in you not in the seed.I don't believe in luck that much. I do believe there's a part in the seed though that will give you a multi-win but we don't know when it will happen. It could be in the 10,000th bet or it could be in the 9th bet. Last month I had a seed with a record of 400k bets and I can say I made some profits on it because it gives a lot of multi-wins in just a short span of bets. Like in every 2000 bets, there will be a surprising multi. That's also where I got the x1500 multi-win in Tome of Life then x500 and x900 which made me happy so I withdrew those funds. But, when I used that same seed in other games like Keno and Scarab Spin, I could not even see those numbers of multi-wins anymore. I guess that incident in my betting experience is also a part of what made me curious about the guy who said that in my opening posts.But we don't have the resources to confirm it so it's just a superstitious belief or a theory.",
