My brother no be lie wey u talk for here oo, greediness na one thing wey dey make many forex trader dey loss well well, because instead of them to place their take profit for were get high chances of actually taking profit(just small higher than the candlestick) them go make the distance very high from the candlestick, I nor no weda dem dey plan to buy private jet with just one trade. Another one na their lot price, some people dey do just $50 trading and dem go set their lot price for 1,1.5,2,2.5 and so on, but dem dey forget say if the trade go beyond their prediction wey dem nor quick see all their money don go and dem go con talk say forex trading na bad thing, na all those kind people dey spoil the name of FX, dem dey forget say before u start anything you go first learn and study about that thing, normally for professional trading:$50 for trading amount the highest risk of lot price wey u fit take na 0.10.$100 lot price highest risk suppose be 0.20.$200 lot price for high risk suppose be 0.40$500 lot price for high risk suppose be 1.00And so on but some people go go take unprofessional risk wey go make dem regret of trading at the first place.The one wey come pain me pass na those wey never get reasonable amount of knowledge about forex wey con enter inside and the worse thing na be say dem go con go subscribe for one telegram channel wey go dey supply dem signals and dem go still dey loss their trade. Majority of telegram signal channel owners na people wey subscribe one channel wey subscribe to another channel wey subscribe to another channel.... So if one person bring out fake signal many forex traders go loose wella, normally those signal channels nor go fit guarantee ur success forever because dem go fail u well well. Some traders sef nor even sabi set stop loss and take profit.The surest way wen i think say person fit make some reasonable amount of profit na wen the person learn well before e enter into the forex trading. I nor be forex trader oo but I don do many study about forex because at a time in my life I been dey consider am as watin I fit do to get money but till tomorrow I go still pick investment over forex trading.",

Greed is when you entered the market without setting your stop loss, because you feel the market is going to move in your favor.As I been see this topic. The first thing that came into my mind na greed. Greediness for life dey cause plenty pitfalls whether na forex investment o abi any other type of investment, applying greed to any business model or investment plan will only makw it look ambitious from the beginning but will be prone to failure at the long run. This is why as a trader or investor, you must identify your stop loss and take decisions when you find them deem fit. Also, don't be dependent on procrastinating when to leave an investment, especially when you have the knowledge on the ups and downs of the market trend. Due to the volatility nature of the forex markets, one must be ready to accept failures regardless of your experience.QuoteOne thing to note is, don't enter market with what you can not afford to loose.

Before you go into any investments as a forex trader, ensure you start little cutting down your high expectations in your profit margins. Expectations do hurt indeed.The pitfalls are enormous. However, one of the best ways you can mitigate these errors and mistakes is through connecting, networking and make friends with other forex traders in the market. If you try build strong relationship with other successful forex traders, that one go teach you on the trading disciple you need.
