      "body": "Hi there Y'all,I was, many moons ago, part of the Noso team.I was a developer and I did a bunch of cross language libs(Pascal, C#, Python and PHP) to access the TCP/IP Protocol and the raw data of the block files and I coded the first (Edit)explorer in CakePHP.The wallet code and all the surrounding tool's code is so bad that I never touched any of it. I couldn't follow the immense qty of functions/procedures spread over a myriad of source files(No OOP at all). It was just a very hard spaghetti to follow.I pushed really hard to try and get the only Dev to evolve on his not so good coding skills and to bring other programming languages under the Noso umbrella.For that and for telling some harsh truths to power I was rewarded with a ban from the Discord server(I got really irate many months before that and had already left the GitHub Org).And the truths are quite blaring in the face of a self named cryptocoin:Noso is centralised: Without the seed nodes, and when the seed nodes go bust, the whole network ceases to workNoso is not verifiable: Every transaction should have the public key present in order to validate the signature. For some obscure reason, when building the block, that key is replaced with the Sender's addressNoso uses MD5 as the hashing algorithm: The fact that it's so easy to create collisions by simply changing one to three bytes on the block file is very scaryNoso uses Pascal Short Strings: If you're a programmer and understand that between length and capacity, there is the space for memory garbage to be stored in the block files, this makes what was said above, about MD5 even more plausibleNoso has a government: In order to participate on this government you must pay to acquire one or more GVT tokens. Paid democracy... Is that still democracy?Noso software executes orders from centralised person in power: The software has code paths that will restart your wallet after triggering an upgrade on itself. But if it can do this, what else could the only dev code in to do with your coins?Noso freezes assets: Some assets have been frozen because they are perceived to be mined via GPU. The responsibility of a mining algorithm to be GPU/ASIC resistant lays squarely on the shoulders of the dev/dev team. Blaming the miners for pushing the boundaries is like a very bad parent blaming it's own child for the mistakes he does!!And these are the few things that I so hardly fought to make the only dev of this coin to realise he should correct. But alas, here we are and now, Noso is even listed... OMFG, how did this happen?!?!?The bullet points above are the most blatant issues with this coin. I could go on forever about the fact that the code is complete spaghetti. That said spaghetti is now so entangled that even the only dev is now suffering the pain and has not released any new version in quite a while. And the 1 or 2 times he did attempt at testing new code changes present on the GitHub repo, the main net has always collapsed.So, yeah, this is a cryptocoin that disrespects the ethos(still centralised) and even the math, the cryptology math(it is not verifiable).You can try and gaslight everyone else with any rhetoric about this and that, but the buck stops at the code itself, and me, as an Object Pascal programmer of more than 15 years experience, I'll say that the code is rotten to the core.But hey, continue trading this \"wonderful\" coin that is... How did you put it? Quotedeveloped from the ground up by a team with more than a decade of experience in blockchain technologies.Yeah, let's go with that!!!Cheers,GusP.S.: Gus a.k.a Gustavo 'Gus' Carreno, everywhere else.",

If you have more info about one man noso teams experience, please let us knowI am not a member of the Noso Project, but only a supporter of it at the level of side applications and the backend of Explorer. You can easily see that I did not create my account here yesterday, like you, and from the few posts I have, you can understand that I only speak when I have to speak. In the Noso Project, there is a lot of innovation, which is difficult to understand by those not related to the crypto . Of course, like any innovative project, a lot of study is needed in order to understand its operation. For what I can guarantee, is that continuous, good work is being done, which will pay off soon.You're new here, and it's easy to see that , because you don't even know how to quote. Try to understand first how BtcTalk works and maybe, after a long time, you will understand that in every project there are people like you, who are just trying to slander. At least here, I can prove that I've been around for a decade, so it's not hard for me to understand who you are.",

      "body": "Hey Iscal,Quote from: iscal on April 04, 2023, 10:14:08 AMFor what I can guarantee, is that continuous, good work is being done, which will pay off soon.When someone, anyone, makes these type of claims, with no proof whatsoever to back them up, we in the Software Industry call it vapourware.You wanna makes us believe there are changes coming, then back them up with a healthy amount of commits on the various repositories under the Noso GitHub Organisation!!One of the things that has always pissed me off about the single dev's way of using GIT is the fact that he does not commit often(Maybe because the very little that he knows, I had to force into him).In the Software industry, committing often is almost a religious thing in order to have a granularity of changes so small that you don't have to back track a whole day's worth of work.And committing often, when you have a good set of tests, makes it easy to isolate issues. And yeah, there is no Testing in Noso, cuz I don't even think that the single dev is aware of what Unit Tests are and how beneficial they are for the Software Industry.While I was making a monumental effort to have the single dev use GIT instead of uploading the project files via the GitHub Web Interface, I really tried to convey the \"commit often\" ethos, but alas it never stuck The single dev, and according to the timestamps on GitHub, has made his last commit on 30-Jan-2023 and the last released version was on 16-Dec-2022 with version 0.3.3Aa6.The most amusing thing is that the announcement made on the Discord server about what caused the latest network outage was due to a change in the consensus system. But... how do you change something that needs to be present in ALL the nodes when you haven't released a version since December last year, and the latest commit to the NosoNode repo is like 2 months old?!?!How does that work?! Can someone explain me how you introduce new features into a piece of software without releasing a new version? Cuz last I checked, we've been on version 0.3.3Aa6 since it was released in 16-Dec-2022.And, with all this brouhaha over the listing, what is now the fate of the much hyped Nobiex or even the Liquidity Pool? Is that also relegated to the vapourware cloud that you've been trying to con us with?So, please spare us of you smoke screens and mirrors, because it's getting really hard for the team behind Noso to actually present proof that this is a healthy coin!!!Cheers,Gus",

Development takes time.  From this argument alone you prove yourself to be an individual that wants to get into a fight, and not into a grown-up discussion of the state of the project.It also proves you know nothing about what the \"commit often\" ethos actually means. Are you even a professional programmer?Quote from: pinnedjoint on April 05, 2023, 03:46:49 AMI can understand your frustration/disappointment with your participation/ interaction with the project but I have to say that all this sound just slander from your part.As a professional don’t you think that you should think harder before you write something like that in public?And here it is. I was waiting for the first person to come up with the slander argument. With the argument that I'm all very unstable and my hurt feelings are clouding my judgement.This, is of course the easy way to throw away what someone is saying, even if it's the truth. Especially if it's the truth and the ones in \"power\" want to snuff it out, right away, or it will catch fire and burn the whole massive amount of power those people have amassed.I'm not gonna answer this trollish attempt at provoking a fight, and I have only one reason for that: Like I said before, the buck stops at the code.So, until anyone can prove that my statements are wrong, based on what the code actually does, no, it's not slander, it's just a statement of the facts.So, Mr. Troll, when you can come at me with proof based on actual code, then, and only then will I agree to argue with you on the same level.At the moment, the only thing I see in you is a troll looking for a fight. And to that I say: No thanks!!Cheers,GusEdit:I'm giggling of anticipation because I went and had a search for what slander means. And slander is when you accuse someone of something without proof.This means that the 3 line message you posted, accusing me of slander, and not substantiating that accusation with proof, is slander in itself!!!Wow, it's so meta, innit?!? LOL!!",
