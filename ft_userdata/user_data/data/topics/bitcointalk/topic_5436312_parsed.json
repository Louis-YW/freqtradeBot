That's really hard.It's probably a bit easier than mining a solo block with a stick miner though, and people in this forum have gotten it, so rare things do happen.It's also a good reminder to think about rare things. They are valuable because they are scarce. If everyone got them, then they would be just common and uninteresting.",

I used to hope it'd come out, there were some close instances at the very least, but it never really came. Heck, even a straight flush was a damn rare instance for me back then, maybe only a few times (can be counted in one hand) that it appeared, let alone a royal flush. If it ever did appear on my games though, I wouldn't even be mad. That's just how insane it is to come out.",

Anyway I have hit Royal Flush in Video Poker game few years back in Stake but it was with few cents bet only which gave me a 800x return. I did not know if the chance is the same as 999x/1000x in plinko, but if it is true, means that it is better to play plinko than video poker. Is the chance/odds to hit Royal Flush in PVP poker the same as in Video Poker?",

It during a flop someone raised their stakes and i tried to buff and raised more. He went all in and i thought what the heck, i have high cards but nothing. Maybe i get lucky. Can't remember what the opponent had but he had such a good hand during flop that i totally understood he went all in. Guy was a sore loser. But it was his choice to go all in, i wasn't even playing seriously. I was just lucky.I haven't really played a lot for a while. I don't like to play online and playing live is fun but i am way too introvert to do that with strangers. It's just too taxing for me.",

Had you ever hit that hand?I have never hit that hand myself, but I saw it two times already in the past. One time was around 6 years ago at a friendly poker game with my friends. We had to preflop all ins and my friend with Al in spades hit a Royal Flush. It was a huge sensation and we took a photo for Facebook even though there wasn't a lot of money involved in the hand. The other time was on a online poker sit and go table last year. I wasn't involved in the hand myself and only watched as one player lost it all on a flush against the royal flush. And then there are the famous YouTube videos where you can see the professional players get lucky on TV. My best hand was a straight flush, but it's been a while since I got one. Getting 4 of a kind is much more common, the only problem with these monster hands is that you are not getting paid most of the time. For really profitable hands you want your opponent to hit a good hand where he is going to call you down, but not good enough to actually beat you.",

I had some in casual games, when I played without betting money, but I never had big wins that ended with a royal flush. First of all getting a royal is very rare and even when it starts to look like you could get one people will often fold because they have bad cards or they'll read you. Most of the time holding on, hoping you can get a flush if you feel like you have a weak hand without it, is too risky.",

QuoteGoal: The main goal of poker is to win money by having the best hand or by bluffing your opponents into thinking you have a better hand than you actually do. In blackjack, the main goal is to have a hand with a total value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over.Number of players: Poker is typically played with a group of 2-10 players, while blackjack is usually played with one player against the dealer.Hand rankings: In poker, each player is dealt a certain number of cards and they use those cards in combination with community cards to make the best hand possible. There are many different hand rankings in poker, such as a straight flush or a full house. In blackjack, the goal is to have a hand with a total value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The only hand ranking in blackjack is a \"Blackjack\" which is an Ace and a 10-value card.Betting: In poker, players can bet, raise, or fold at various points in the game. In blackjack, players make one bet at the beginning of the game, and they can choose to hit, stand, double down, or split their hand depending on the cards they are dealt.Strategy: Poker is a game of skill and strategy, as players must make decisions based on their cards and the actions of their opponents. Blackjack also requires strategy and decision-making, as players must decide when to hit, stand, double down, or split their hand based on the cards they are dealt and the rules of the game.",
