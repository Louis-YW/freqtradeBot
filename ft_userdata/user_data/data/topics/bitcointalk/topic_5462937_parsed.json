Understand first that it takes time for one to understand the basics of Bitcoin. Like how volatile it is and what do you need to have in able to start holding it.Actually, it's not that complicated at all for you to start owning Bitcoin and first you need to buy it when you already understand that it's a volatile asset. And by mean with that, is that the price changes from time to time and it's a very unpredictable asset to have. But, we're all agreeing that someday in the future that the value of it is only one direction and it's going to be way higher.",

What are the don'ts and does here in forum, also I want to became an Investor what should I do?I want to learn more about bitcoin like how to get it.Hey Johnmatthew! Welcome to the forum.To answer your questions, let's break it down:How this forum works: How this forum works is pretty straightforward. It's essentially a forum for discussions covering all aspects of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Picture it as a place to ask questions, soak up wisdom from fellow enthusiasts, and add your own two cents to the conversation. Just like any other regular forum setup, it has various sections tailored to different subjects. So, whatever tickles your curiosity or beckons your input, there's a dedicated space waiting for you to dive in and get chatting.Dos and Don'ts: Be sure to follow forum rules, show respect, and steer clear of spamming or trolling. Also, keep an eye on what other members are saying and check out the suggested topics to get the most out of your forum experience.How to become an Investor? I'd recommend kicking things off by grasping the fundamentals of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Get a feel for their unique use cases and what makes them tick for potential investors. Look into their growth potential too. But remember, like any investment, it's key to do your own research rather than just hopping on someone else's advice.Learning more about Bitcoin: Don't tell me this is the first time you've heard of Bitcoin? No worries, we've all got to start somewhere! There's a whole bunch of info waiting for you out there on the web. Think articles, books, videos ‚Äì you name it. And don't forget this forum and other social spots. So, if anything's tripping you up on your Bitcoin journey, just give it a shout.",

I have a friend, who also hard about Bitcoin for the first time. because he was desperate to make money, he went and sold his propertys and invested all in Bitcoin, because he didn't know about thing about Bitcoin, he invested and loss everything. but he did not give up, he went back and lean and master it, but today his doing very well in Bitcoin. my suggestion to you is, before you invest here make sure you have learn and master everything about Bitcoin.
