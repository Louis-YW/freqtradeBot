The thing I could think right now that make bitcoin end is if no one use it which will be impossible or all of miners stop mining which is also impossible unless a world threat arrives like a meteor hitting the world that could end us all. Even if all government ban bitcoin, I'm sure someone will still able to use it.  We've experience news and situations like these in a bear market like we currently have so it's basically normal to have negative news about bitcoin from time to time now. Bitcoin have seen downslides like these before but where we are right now? Still using bitcoin",

You interchangeably use words bitcoin and crypto. A crypto crash doesn't mean a bitcoin crash and crypto problems aren't bitcoin problems. Bitcoin would never react to Luna's death if not for the fact that the owner of Luna used profits from selling his own shitcoin to buy bitcoin and then sold it all at once crashing the price. Celsius can die and not influence bitcoin at all but if its owners hold bitcoin and are forced to sell to cover their own liabilities, that's another thing. One more thing. Price doesn't say anything about bitcoin's life cycle. It can lose 90% in price and then gain another 100% and it will still be up over the course of 3 years.",

That's what you get when you don't understand Bitcoin. The only thing I'm sorry is the bad advertising it brings to Bitcoin, because at the end of the day, these people who lost money, probably when they hear again about Bitcoin, they will immeidately say \"ahh fuck crypto. I lost 50k last year or so\". You know what I mean? By that time, that people will put Bitcoin in the same bag as any other shitcoins. Evolution theory will take care of all those scams!",

The network uses BTC as an incentive for active bookkeeping and sends them to users who complete these tasks. How are bookkeepers chosen fairly from among the many users? Satoshi Nakamoto's method is to ask mathematical problems. The user needs to use a device to calculate the answer to questions provided by the network, and the first user to answer correctly will receive the right to bookkeeping and BTC rewards. This process is known as mining.Mining is a method of issuing new BTC and is at the source of the BTC economic ecology.There are 21 million BTCs in total. Initially, the billing reward was 50 Bitcoins, but for every 210,000 billings, the billing reward is reduced by half. The Bitcoin network bills once every 10 minutes, and the interval between two halvings is about 4 years.Initially, BTC was worth nothing. It was not until May 22, 2010 that the first BTC transaction occurred in the real world when Florida, USA’s Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas with 10,000 BTC. At that time, two pizzas were about 25 USD (1 BTC = 0.0025 USD), giving the BTC its physical value for the first time. This day is also known as Bitcoin Pizza Day by the crypto community.On July 18, 2010, the BTC exchange Mt. Gox went online. On that day, BTC price was 5 cents (1 BTC = 0.05 USD).On February 9, 2011, BTC reached parity with the USD for the first time (1 BTC = 1 USD).On November 28, 2012, BTC ushered in the first halving, and the price of the currency began to rise from 12.35 USD. Nearly one year later, on November 30, 2013, it reached a peak of $1,149.14 and then retreated sharply, plunging more than 51% at one point, falling to as low as 203.86 USD and signaling the start of a two-year bear market.On July 9, 2016, BTC ushered in the second halving, and the price of the currency began to rise from $653.70. Nearly one and a half years later, on December 17, 2017, it reached a peak of 19,535.70 USD, but then retreated sharply, falling more than 67% at one point, reaching a low of $3,209.76 and starting a one-year bear market.On May 12, 2020, BTC ushered in the third halving, and the price of the currency began to rise from US$8,879.80. Nearly one year later, on April 13, 2021, it reached a peak of 63,000 USD. Subsequently, it fell sharply, with a drop of more than 47% at one point, reaching a low of 29,987.31 USD (as of July 22, 2021).The three tiered increases in the price of BTC all occurred within one to one and a half years following the halving. After peaking, there will be a 50%-70% callback within 2 months, and then enter the slow bear until the next halving.Despite fluctuations, each halving will bring the currency price to a new level, and the bottom of the currency price has been increasing. Overall, the currency price shows a trend of volatility and increase.Everyone should own BTC.",
