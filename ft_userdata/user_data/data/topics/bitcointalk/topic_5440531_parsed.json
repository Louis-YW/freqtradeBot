Believing that it's not my week and there's no need trying more as I will only end up break my bank for nothing at the end. I do this for a long time now and it works for me by saving me from incurring wasteful losses and also having/saving me some money  for the next week to come. Indirectly this strategy also help to moderate my gambling habit and uncontrollable addiction tendency, and it also provide me the chance of having money for any winning opportunity that might come up for the new as I gamble.At this point what do you think about this gambling strategy I use? Although yours may not be with 5-7 streaks in a week you can also set a number of streaks convenient with you to use. Or is there anyone out there already using this strategy and how beneficial has it being to you?",

Or is there anyone out there already using this strategy and how beneficial has it being to you?What I do is that I have money that I set weekly for it, if I lose more than it, I stop gambling that week, no matter what. If I win and lose and the money has not finished, I can continue to gamble if I still see it interesting that week. I only go for gambling budget and just not more than 5% of my week income.",

You may able to beat the house today by using so called strategy, but there's no guarantee you will win tomorrow, next 2 days etc using the same strategy. You need to know your limit and don't chase your losses, it will make you losses more and regret what you've done.",

Or is there anyone out there already using this strategy and how beneficial has it being to you?This strategy might only works for predictable games like sport betting and not on luck based games because the results for luck based games doesn't guarantee you positive returns the next time you play. I think wait really matters if for everyone to know their limit and don't excess it. One way to know or determine your limit is by having money kept aside for gambling.When that money get exhausted then you know it's time to stop betting. Profits made shouldn't be kept in that account or you'll exhaust all when gambling. The only money that should be there should be your gambling capital and it can be top on as you keep winning your bets.",

If I started to see that it is not a lucky week for me, then I would stop betting for that whole week and come back again the next week. It would reset my focus, take me away from bad thoughts about losing and give me time to replenish my funds.I think your strategy is good. As long as it works for you, stick with it.",

Although yours may not be with 5-7 streaks in a week you can also set a number of streaks convenient with you to use. Or is there anyone out there already using this strategy and how beneficial has it being to you?Currently, I'm on a losing streak, and a few days from now, I might take some break as well to prevent further losses.Having this kind of strategy really helped me to be disciplined, to be aware of the losses that I get. Having self-control and knowing when to stop really is a big factor when it comes to gambling. Giving yourself a break especially when you are a losing streak is needed so that you don't regret in the end because you might lose your money on the process.I've been this using strategy for months already, and it really helped me a lot. On the other hand, I'm not only using this kind of strategy when I'm losing, but also when I'm winning. Giving myself a break also on winning would secure my winnings, and I'd do that all day than putting all of my winnings again and gamble it knowing that there is a chance that I might lose my money. It's my way of securing my winnings.Give yourself a break both when you are losing and at the same time winning.",

Though this should be the basic rule in gambling, we need to be able to control ourselves when it comes to losing. Though it doesn't mean that we are all using this, most of us, when we get into a losing streak, we should take a break, relax, and have a beer to ease the emotions, but there are still others chasing their losses, which, as you said, will break break their bank accounts.",

Although yours may not be with 5-7 streaks in a week you can also set a number of streaks convenient with you to use. Or is there anyone out there already using this strategy and how beneficial has it being to you?Giving yourself a break is almost the same as maintaining a discipline on your habit. The problem with gambling stems from its addicting and rewarding nature. For example, regardless of the result in a game, the person would almost always bet again (win/loss). This can definitely be deceiving especially if a person gambles frequently and he thinks that he won in a given game, but in reality, his total losses are overwhelmingly bigger than his winnings.I agree- give yourself a break and give time to reflect on your actions. If you struggle with this kind of discipline, then take measures (e.g. bring only a handful amount of cash, etc.) to at least force yourself to stop.",

Instead of getting obsessed with finding the right strategy (which don't exist) you should focus on risk management. Because the more you lose you spend even more to make up for your losses and then you lose even more. Here is your mistake.When you lose too much, you should just walk away and come back when you are ready.",

So, you are doing it right, in my opinion. Not only you are saving money this way, but you also make your future experiences more enjoyable. And to those not following this strategy I want to say: Don't make a boring work out of fun, which gambling should be in the first place.",

It's not wise for someone to continue betting after experiencing loss after loss because you'll just incur more and more failed bets in the long run due to having little mental headspace and tolerance to win. Your emotions will fluctuate and you'll eventually feel tilted which could affect your decision-making and strategy in betting.The best time to continue gambling is after calming yourself. The moment you have full control over your emotions and actions wherein your mind isn't clouded to make judgments anymore is your cue to try gambling again. Of course, still take not of your budget allotment in gambling to not go overboard and regret later.",

Or is there anyone out there already using this strategy and how beneficial has it being to you?It's actually a good strategy and most of the gamblers I knew here in the forum do it also. Whenever there is a losing streak happening they try to rest the next day, giving an opportunity for the brain to work better after the rest and analyze the game better. Most of them are in sports gambling. It's different for me though, I still do my daily bets but I will minimize them when I feel like it's not doing pretty well. Like 3/7 or 2/5 in consecutive days, that's already an unlucky day for me. The next day I may feel like only doing 2 bets or 3 and see where it will go. Strategies like yours require discipline so I wish you can keep that kind of plan. Good luck.",
