  "content": "Ledger Recover Service will provide you a chance to recover your wallet if you lose your wallet seed but you can verify your identity with ID card.Wallet seed will be split to 3 shards that are encrypted.QuoteHow this works:Your private key serves as the starting point for creating a backup of your Secret Recovery Phrase. Here’s how:STEP 1: When setting up your Ledger Recover login, you’ll first need to verify your identity using your ID card.STEP 2: You’ll be asked to connect your Ledger Nano X and give approval to the creation of the backup to your Secret Recovery Phrase. Once approved, your Ledger Nano X will duplicate, encrypt and fragment your private key into three parts within the Secure Element chip. These fragments become the backup of your Secret Recovery Phrase.STEP 3: These encrypted fragments are securely sent to three independent providers – Ledger, Coincover, and EscrowTech that will store them in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Each encrypted fragment is useless on its own. When you request access to your wallet, two of the three encrypted fragments will be sent back to your Ledger device, reassembling them to build your private key.STEP 4: The backup for your Secret Recovery Phrase is linked to your verified identity from Step 1 so only you have access to it.But we buy a hardware wallet to control our bitcoin keys. Now we have to choose to share it with three companies just to have another option to recover our wallet later. It breaks reason why we need a hardware wallet.Two videos from Andreas Antonopoulos and Jameson Lopp. The second video is about Ledger Recovery Service.Bitcoin Q&A: Why is Seed Splitting a Bad Idea?Ledger Recover: What The Hell is Happening?

With Ledger Recovery Service, you will be only one of four entities will own your wallet seed. You, Ledger, Coincover, and Escrowtech.Anyone feels safe about this new scheme?

I don't feel safely with it.Yes, it is true that it is primarily related to securing our coins, as you mentioned, there are many people who do not mind KYC, although it is very bad for others, but the problem here is that there are now three other parties that own part of your wallet seed!!!!how stupid!!! What's worse is that they want to get paid monthly for their stupidity!!!!Bottom line: You pay a monthly fee to: KYC and give away part of your seed to three other entities. What a great idea.You simply became a hostage in their hands!!! Thanks Ledger!!!",
