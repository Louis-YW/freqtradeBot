  "content": "I'm a long term trader and i use multiple platform / broker / exchange. So I can say I have a minimum of experience.What happened? I traded LOOMUSDT on Bybit (https://www.bybit.com) and they applied me 1414 USDT FEE instead of paid me them . 1) On 26/9  I started a short position of 509760 LOOM USDT at about 0.12163 so used margin was 3.700 USDT2) FUNDING RATE was 2.25. Look at the screenshot of my funding fee history where there are two operations: one on 9/26 with a rate of 2.25 and one on 9/27 with a rate of -2.25. So if rate is negative, funding history report it (see attached image) . Now, if rate is positive longer pay shorter , if rate is negative shorter pay longer (see attached image)https://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/28/PNxE9.jpeghttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/28/PNq83.jpeg3) AS YOU CAN SEE I WAS SHORT, RATE WAS POSITIVE, BUT BYBIT ADDED ME FEE INSTEAD OF CREDIT THEM TO ME . My opened position gone in margin call and all amount was liquidated and balance went to 10 USDT!4) To prove that I was not wrong and that I was right, on 27/9 I opened a long position and at the time and, as I expected, given that the funding fee was negative at -2.25,the fees were credited to me . To be sure again i opened another long position on a diferent  contract  (TRB USD , rate -2%) and it paid me too. (see again the 'attachment above). 5) I contacted support and my VIP manager (yes, due trading volume i'm a VIP) but they replied me that rate on 26/9 was -2,25 (see attached) and fee was correct. BUT I OPENED THE TRADE JUST BECAUSE I SEE POSITIVE FUNDING RATE  AND I HAD THE INTENTION OF MADE AN ARBITRAGE! And rate reported on my trading history confirm that rate was positive!!! https://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/28/PEuWl.jpegConclusion: I have asked bybit to return my funds, but they continue to deny the error. I report this just as a warning, to ensure that traders do not suffer the same treatment as me.",

I report this just as a warning, to ensure that traders do not suffer the same treatment as me.Can you provide your trading history on when do you open your short position in question and the record when does your position liquidated? It’s not clear on your records the duration of your trade while the Bybit support clearly provide the funding rate history of your account. Funding rate varies per duration set by the exchange. There’s a chance that the funding rate already change if you open position near the end of the countdown. That funding rate is surely sting because you use high leverage.Provide detailed evidence on when you open and liquidate the thread so that we can check if the support funding rate history is correct since your transaction history doesn’t have time stamp on it.",

I think you did not give the right information. This is what I think, but I may be wrongIf you have lost money massively, a funding fee may not be able to recover the loss which I think happened to you.

If you are doubting Bybit and you need another exchange, you can try Binance.I will advice you to use low amount to trade those shit coins with high funding rate. Do not think you can make money from funding rate, it can lead to a trap.I have a brother that complained about Bybit, but about spot market fee. I have no complain yet but I am not using the exchange often.",
