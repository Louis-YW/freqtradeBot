  "content": "I am setting up a 400 kW farm and just want to sanity check if anyone has experience with primary power from oncor. (The deal is, own and manage your own transformer and get a reduced delivery cost.)I want to know if I am missing something here because it seems like it is worth it. Savings ~ $0.004 / kwh. A lot of utility people have never even done primary power so I want to get opinions from other miners if this makes sense.",

      "body": "Quote#1: What do you mean by \"low power issues\" ?#2, who won't test the transformer?Low power means what it says: Voltage drops out of spec under heavy load - OR - there is a local brownout that causes a lower than normal voltage from the utility. Either way you have to pay for someone to test/verify what you are seeing.Testing the transformer: Due to the incoming voltages used, transformers tied to utility power lines are almost always oil-filled. The dielectric oil used provides both insulation as well as cooling. Most utility guidelines require the condition of the oil to be tested every few years to monitor its breakdown over time. You'll have to pay for that. If there is an issue with your voltage dropping when under full load, that can be checked using a (huge truck mounted) resistive load bank to provide known loads ranging from several 10's of kw to over several MW to the load side of the transformer. Most large cities have several companies that provide that service and it is NOT cheap.In short, if you have ANY power issues you have to pay for it to be diagnosed.Oh btw: that link Phil gave is not for a main incoming power transformer - the utility side is usually over 4.8kVAC and more typically either 9.8 or 13.2kVAC - not 480v.",

It's the fact that the will not even DO it until you have your electrician onsite. Being charged by your person is a different issue. If everything goes well there can and will be a cost savings. You just should be aware that there can be some major expenses that you can get hit with.-Dave",
