Dca is always good especially in bear market like this. But of course your gain is depend on the project you are choosing too. Well xrp is a famous coin and one of the biggest marketcap. But I wouldnt say its a blue chip since there are lots of factors why I dont like their project. Ecg is their supply, developer can unload some of the coins on their end and when they want which is quite scary. Though it can be monitor the fact that it can happen obviously can affect the market price.",

You have seen the price of XRP pumped a lot from the bottom due the news about optimism by some parties to see XRP foundation will win against SEC. The problem is when this is not predictable. That means when you are doing DCA and sometime you can get a surprise caused by the bad news was coming and then you are getting a trap. I will not put a high target for sure. Making doubled from the current price of XRP is more than enough during the bearish market like this. I will not expect a big increase to happen with XRP asap.",

Currently, the price of XRP is already at $0.5 and some people say that XRP has a chance to increase and may reach $1 in the short or medium term. And if you still want to do DCA at this time, you can start but be careful because ups and downs can still happen for XRP, especially if bitcoin undergoes a deep correction.Maybe it's a good idea to invest in XRP, seeing as it looks like they'll be able to win the case. I want to see first if XRP can reach $1 in the short term and in the long term, maybe I think to have a target above $3-$4.",

Rebound is real if ripple will issue another good news to the market about the progress to fight with SEC. This must become a turning point for ripple from the bearish market that is always happening due to the SEC. Let's see how it will be going on but im sure ripple may able to wing but the chance is still the same.",

DCA is a good idea but the choice depends on you. You know that you're in a bitcoin forum and most of us will tell you to DCA bitcoin instead.But if that's what you think that will work for you then do it if you think that someday it will be way worth of what you've started.

You have a very good decisions to not all in on this coin because this coin is currently under the short term hype due to there recent good position with there case against SEC. This is same with Celsius which received short term pric recovery after hilders create a false hope that company is restructuring but now the company is preparing for bankruptcy which means all holders that just got hype will hold useless token. This might be same with XRP, You should stay away as much as possible on it as long as they are not clear about their SEC lawsuit. Much better to combine your DCA with diversification to other altcoins which has no current  issue and just dumping due to the market condition.",

Im thinking about $1 as easy target for XRP as long as it can win the battle against SEC. According to this, there has yet to be a final result from the legal dispute between the SEC and XRP, if so, investing in XRP from now on is still very risky, everything can be reversed at any time. I don't think it's a good idea to invest in XRP right now, let's wait a bit longer, when the final official results come out of the court. If with a win, XRP will definitely pump right after but like other events it will pump and dump after that so there is still time to buy XRP so don't risk it now. XRP used to be a potential coin, so if we hold it for a long time, we should not rush it.",

In response to OP's question, I can say that, if you invest XRP just for profit, then you can invest some in XRP right now because with the recent leaked news, it can be seen that the lawsuit results in favor of XRP, the possibility of winning the case is very high. But be careful with XRP because it is difficult to say in advance, it can be said that XRP is too centralized, not only that, the blockchain of XRP is also used in the banking sector. This makes many investors unhappy with XRP, it goes against the decentralization of cryptocurrencies. Investing in XRP is still risky so be careful.",

XRP has been facing a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission accusing the said coin of misleading its investors which ruined its reputation and affected the trust rate of its investors. There's a risk of if XRP won't win the case, the coin would only be considered as a security rather than a currency. So it's up to you if you can handle the risk but as for me, the current value and status of Ripple are still in a good shape.",
