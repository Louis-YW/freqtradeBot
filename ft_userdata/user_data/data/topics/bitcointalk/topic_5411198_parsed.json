  "content": "I am unhappy most times when I miss posting a reply on the first or second page of a thread. This is because I think that my response may be a repetition. Another reason is that I am concerned about it's visibility. For instance, since I joined this forum some months ago, I have been keen to notice that some certain users such as mk4, Lucius, NotATether, jackg, Fivestar4everMVP, Upgrade00, Poker Player, *franky1, NeuroticFish, pooya87,hatshepsut93,hugeblack,GreatArkansas and a couple of others usually make either first or second page on most of the boards. Is this because they feel the same way as I do or because their signature campaign requires that they make first or sencond page. I know that franky1 is not in any signature campaign so I am curious to know. Is this normal? And are there other users who feel this same way too?",

      "body": "The thing that matters is the thread that you are posting in and not the page you post in, if it is a thread that the discussion is a quality and constructive one, and it goes on way past the first, second, third or even fourth-fifth page and so on, then there is no problem posting in a later page on such topics, because for the topic to still be ongoing, it means the discussion is still interesting and not redundant, the only thing you'd do is to read a couple of replies on previous pages so you'd know how to shape your own reply and how you can be constructive with it.Having said that, there are spam mega-threads, these are topics that the discussion was over many pages before, but the discussion continues with redundancy and unnecessary replies, in most of these topics users plagiarize quite a lot, they just copy what a user posted in the first page and paste it in the 10th or so page; posting in such topics isn't advisable and bounty managers might not be happy with that.But overall the forum rule isn't against a users posting in any page of a thread you like, but if you care about the forum and want it to be a decent place for people to discuss, you'd select topics to reply to and report topics that are filled with spam for moderators to decide what to do about them. Take note too that how early you reply to a post somewhat depends on how your day went in RL, if you have a busy day, you might meet topics late, but if you are always active in the forum and less busy in RL, you prolly will have the likelihood of joining discussions pretty quick and early.",

Upgrade00 ... usually make either first or second page on most of the boards. Is this because they feel the same way as I do or because their signature campaign requires that they make first or sencond page. The campaign I'm on requires only a limited amount of posts to be made in threads exceeding a certain number of pages. This is however not the reason I make replies often on higher up pages.Generally, quality discussions on most threads last for only a while, and a huge percentage of opened threads now should be locked already cause it has been extensively discussed and the current replies are redundant. If I stumble on a post that has already been answered to, (if it's a question) or I don't have a new suggestion from what's been said, I have no reason to reply.There are of course megathreads, exceeding 5+ pages, with quality and relevant conversations. Excluding those, users who comment on certain megathreads do so, cause they either do not read previous replies or just want to boost their post count (one reason some campaigns do not accept many of such posts)",

This is exactly the same solecistic barriers we are  battling every single day and yet,it replicates... I mean, you can prolly run some preview on your post just so you don't repeat the whole phrase. That being said, most campaign rules don't support post bumping but I don't think that's enough reason why those dudes avoid an already compacted thread;  when once a thread increases in page number, there are likely some repetitions and that, of course may limit you from getting merited: that's if you wrote something brilliant. N/B merit sources barely visit a 5+ pages thread except for important ones,the likes of the one on speculation boardSandra❣️",

That’s generally when it makes sense to keep on posting on a megathread such as this one. From the perspective on someone who reads a fair share here on the forum, many threads overdo their need such as this one (in my opinion), and I generally do not enter threads that go beyond a few pages unless, as stated, the topic is a lively evolving one.",

The first two pages also attracts the highest merits.   Maybe this is some kind of general opinion, but there are still exceptions, as I already wrote in the previous post, so it is possible for the discussion to be constructive and positive even after 2 or 3 pages, especially if it is about something that most spammers do not understand, and they do not try to participate in the discussion. As for merits, it is true that the first post usually gets the most merits, but here is an example where I got 9 merits on page 4 after more than 60 posts in that topic. There are always exceptions, and that's why I say that it makes sense to read the posts and try to be constructive in relation to the previous posts.",
