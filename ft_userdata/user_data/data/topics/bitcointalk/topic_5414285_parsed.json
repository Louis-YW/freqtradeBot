It is with great pleasure that I share a project that we have been working on for months that consists of connecting the user to the blockchain without having to have a server hosted on their machine.We know that this was a current need, so yes it is a wallet where you generate your wallet or import it with one click and you can receive and send transactions with the lowest rates on the market.For now we only support Dogecoin, but we are already working to put bitcoin.url: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finance.serpens Welcome to the Serpens",

I see you ask for a version for wearables?!Second: is this a SPV wallet? Does it work with the actual blockchain and official wallet RPC, hosted by you (I would doubt that) or is it working with a custom server/database built on top of the official wallet/blockchain, like Electrum does?Or is it something else (eg. custodial)?",

It is not about owning a private key or not, but how can the user make sure nobody else own the private key, or they are not using some address generated by others. If you have no reputation then going open source should be a good idea.",

Electrum nodes are ran by private individuals. Electrum is completely open source and anybody who knows python can read the sourcecode to make sure their master private key, derived keys, seed phrase,... are never ever sent to a node. Next to this, your local electrum client fetches block headers from 8 different (decentral) nodes so the node it gets it's tx data from is very unlikely to cheat...Now, i'm trying to be constructive here, and i'm trying not to be mean... You have written a wallet, but going on the way you answer the questions we pose, i can't shake the feeling you might not have the technical background necessary to write a wallet... I mean, you make a lot of confusing (and sometimes wrong) statements and you seem to be having troubles answering our questions in a clear manner.... I'd still give you the benefit of the doubt so i won't post what my gut tells me, but i would never use a wallet that:first claims to have \"no bridges\" but then suddenly has to admit they use a centralised serverwhilst in the meantime calling electrum a \"corporation\" having \"bridges\"and at the same time not being able to conclusively tell us if it's an SPV wallet or notand having a closed source binaryIf you want to build trust in this community... Get your house on order...Give us all the technical details, preferably let somebody trusted in the community read the sourcecode... Really...",

With this background, I consider you rather potentially harmful and untrustworthy until proven otherwise. We can neither verify your credibility, neither can we trust you.

You are just going around the questions.
