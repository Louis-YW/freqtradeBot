Text can be a seed phrase, a master public key, a master private key, a list of bitcoin addresses or bitcoin private keys. If you want to be prompted for an argument, type '?' or ':'(concealed)positional arguments:  textIt works fine when I use one single private key, either by supplying it into the command-line or using a one-liner text file with the key in it.Following two commands workCode:electrum restore -w my_wallet p2pkh:KyRNwetceteraCode:electrum restore -w my_wallet $(cat my_list.txt)whereas my_list.txt has following content:Quotep2pkh:KyRNwetceteraBut as soon as I want to import several keys it doesn't work.

      "body": "Hi BlackHatCoiner,of course, with a for loop in bash I can help myself but it doesn't solve the outgoing question with the Electrum command line. The for loop is also worlds slower than if the processing was done directly by the Python script. I just wanted to understand up front if there is anything I am overlooking in the syntax input and entering incorrectly, or if it is a bug. Maybe the developer simply forgot to include the list processing function that he named in the description.PS: You should avoid the obsolete form of `command` using those backticks (grave accent) for command execution in bash and use $(command) instead, which is also POSIX compliant.",

THANK YOU @ETFbitcoin, appreciate your helpful reply.I went ahead and tried various files (one privkey per line as shown above) to see how many lines Electrum can import. The limit seems to be at 2221. That means you can have a line which contains 2221 various private keys which you can import in one step into a wallet. Whenever you try to import 2222 lines Electrum will output an error message, that the file being processed is too long and no keys will be imported. Maybe this information is helpful, so I added it here.",

See here what my terminal outputsCode:$ getconf ARG_MAXQuote2097152Side note:As far as I understood, Electrum's restore command creates a new wallet with the -w parameter. In case you try to restore some more keys into an existing wallet, Electrum refuses this action with the error message \"Remove the existing wallet first\".What a pity that electrums similar command \"importprivkey\" does not work with file lists. With importprivkey you can import a private key into an existing wallet. What I've found so far it supports only one single privkey to import. So there is no chance to use Electrums internal routines to mass-import several keys. One would need to rewrite the code in python or use the alternative method with bash for loops (which is extremely slow, about 2 keys per second)",
