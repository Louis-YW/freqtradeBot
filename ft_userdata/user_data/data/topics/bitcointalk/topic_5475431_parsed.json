You only lose your money if you gamble with your money in this volatile market. Gambling with trading (spot trading), higher gambling level with Margin trading and Futures trading.QuoteTry not to be in the market when the market is consolidating, because there is a higher possibilities of you losing that trade.The consolidation phase of market is most boring but if you hold your bitcoin, don't trade, don't use leverage, and let the market does its own job, you are free of market traps and it's one of biggest tricks to succeed in this market.QuoteIt's one structure we traders look down on not knowing the danger it pose to our account,  during consolidation in a higher timeframe like 4hr is the most dangerous because it can go either way.4-hour time frame and bigger time frames are more like suitable for investors. You will have less chance to enter the market and exit it by trading with bigger time frame. When you are trading with a wider time frame, it will force you to trade in Spot because you can not control your account in long term by trading.A wider time frame you use, a more likely you are becoming a long term investor and no longer are a trader.",

      "body": "There are some things the OP is missing, consolidation is easy to know in the market, and this is obvious when the market is moving up and down without a definitive trend. Even as it is, some traders would still trade and make money in that condition. Now, are you saying because of consolidation, traders who have the tendency to trade and make money since their strategy permits it should miss out? I guess No. Instead of your advice, I rather advise traders to be sure of their experience in the market and trade what they know without deviations.If you are a scalper, scalp the market well and make your money, if you are a short-term trader, do it well, and the same goes for the long-term traders. This advice is important because when the market seems to consolidate in the view of the long-term traders, the short-term traders and scalpers are making their money, and when it seems to be consolidating in the sight of the short-term traders, the scalpers are making their money. The most important thing here is for traders to know the reason why they enter the market and not just trade anyhow. Traders should mind their timeframe and plan in relation to it and not poke their noses in another person's trading style.",

OP no one can kill your account except for your own, don't make any entries where you are not certain about the outcomes, and don't let your account be used as a gamble on any trade.Most people can trace out the consolidating market but today, everyone can as most people follow others, In the social media age every analyst shares his perspective from time to time, so indication is easier. To service in the consolidating market better broaden your perspective to the long term (Consolida) and reduce your position sizes. As you are not certain so why are you playing or would say gambling?",

Either market looks like going side ways but it's not he said the market is always doing what it has to and always moving up and down and always has some plan. When I heard that the last consolidation of BTC which lasted for many days and after which the market was dumped, came to my mind and it confirmed his words that the market always had its plans.Because at that time, the reason for the dump was not being found some were saying, that spacX sold the remaining BTC and blah blah. But after some time an OG member of BTT shared it was due to the liquidity problem that BTC dumped after remaining in a consolidation state.Then I realized it had a plan and followed it, and you OP saying consolidation is risky and I pretty much agree with you if I even consider the existence of consolidation otherwise I will say the sideways movement of BTC is risky for swing traders especially the ones doing futures",

So risk mainly comes from what you do, not what phase of the market.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on November 26, 2023, 01:45:12 PMConsolidation can be seen on chart and based on its pattern.

Well not all can recognize that movement consistently but there are eyes whom really awesome to take that into account. Account killing is with trading, not with a portfolio for investment. With an investment, storing money on exchange is risky too and the reminder is not do that.We can not predict the market so trading is risky, trading with higher risk types like margin and futures will bring risk to a higher level. I lost money through Margin so if any newbie asks me, is it good to do margin trading, I will say directly no. Not only in consolidation phase or any phase.",

We expect that after a consolidation possible advancing phase is the next or declining phase. It's not too difficult to identify a market because you can study it, but it's not 100% accurate.

They don't take advantage of buying potential coins when the price is low.For example, when the price of Bitcoin decreased and finally reached $15k-$17k. People tend to be afraid to enter the market and start buying Bitcoin. But when the price starts to increase and often moves quickly, they start to panic. They immediately buy in a hurry and hope that in the next minute, they can see the price increase very high. But the reality is not like that.That is what often causes traders to experience losses.

It is really necessary for us to carry out analysis in the Consolidation Area so that we can know at least the direction of the market, whether it will experience a continuation of the trend or a trend reversal.

Because we all understand that trading is more dangerous than owning Bitcoin, we as biginners don't wait to start trading in order to enjoy a new experience. Even if we come to trade, there will be no problems. It is beneficial for us to remain calm when making decisions. However It's simple to succumb to dread of missing something, make a snap decision, and make emotional decisions that can result in financial losses, which is not good at all, especially for biginners.
