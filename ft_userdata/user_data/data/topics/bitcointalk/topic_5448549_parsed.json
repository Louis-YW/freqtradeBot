Maybe most of the boys and girls are 10 to 15 years old. I also have many young children come here to learn work. But I always ignored them. They learned the work through some alternative means rather than learning from me. I've noticed lately that a lot of attention has gone away from their studies. Maybe all these boys earning from here have made them greedy for money and education is getting destroyed. So here I mean it's better not to let the little boys and girls enter here because whenever they stop studying and start earning here then their education will be destroyed.",

I mean we all do a lot of stupid things when we're just getting started on bitcoin investing, accumulating 60$ of bitcoin was a good job of yours. 2$ weekly in your pocket was a good strategy I mean it's not wise to invest everything in Bitcoin so it's already a good start.Good luck with your Bitcoin investment continue to accumulate Bitcoin and wait for the right opportunity that you think is a fair price to sell your Bitcoin. It wasn't a big amount for now but you could grow your portfolio over time. Relay on the forum member's tips I suppose because youtube influencers are not to be trusted these days.",

Mostly of the kids these days are active online that they could learn Bitcoin by just searching it online, plus their learning method in pandemic was also online so it would be easily for them to handle both education and extra study to make money. Of course in a long term they can't do both at the same and they need to sacrifice one of them. Its up to their decision whether Bitcoin or Education, but let's be honest here, making money at a young age is not actually bad despite the fact that you stopped college. Why? Because education could still be done even if your rich and doesn't need to think of funds for your tuition. Same case to education once you've graduated early there's a possibility you find a well paying job then gain knowledge about Bitcoin. In short, there's no actually wrong decisions here, we're no one to judge people's decisions especially we don't know what they've been through in life.

In making such calls in crypto you'll need to have a emotional stability, good instinct, knowledge and experienced in money. Which I think that kids will lack when they started in crypto and blockchain technology. To be honest, the first time I've tried entering in this industry I find it \"complicated\" like anything has a meaning and connected to this industry. Also the source of your statement could be fake due to there's a lot of clickbaits thumbnails in youtube and makes you believed those kids really earned money, but for sure it was only for the views where maybe they really get those moneys.",

The strategy of gradually increasing an investment by buying more BTC also makes sense to me.Bitcoin currently seems to be on the rise, but of course a temporary setback can happen at any point.Since you're pretty young and new, keep in mind the basic rules:- Invest only what you can afford to lose.- Buy low, sell high (of course, one can just wait long-term and ignore the temporary price dynamics, though).- Not your keys, not your coins (Ensure you're storing your coins safely in a non-custodial wallet like Electrum rather than on an exchange).",

At age fifteen and above most youths in my neighborhood are more interested in drugs and womanizing. You have started we'll OP. You can start small and keep increasing your investment until you get to your benchmark. I also want to advise that you should also balance your academics with your investment. Don't spend all your time on the forum because your main purpose as a student is to study and pass the necessary examination. So you shouldn't abandon your academics because investing in Bitcoin is not a full-time job. You need to be employable so that you can raise more money to invest in Bitcoin.",
