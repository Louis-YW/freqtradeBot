However, BTC ATM's charge very high fees, and while it may be a good option to buy BTC without kyc, some machines require kyc either before you even trade or if you want to make a tx above a certain amount, or if they have any reason to suspect you.[1] https://coinatmradar.com/",

Nowadays every transactions can be done virtually, especially in a city like NY, so there isn't really a good point to use ATMs when you have exchanges and banking apps connected with each other. ATMs must be a good deal only for its owner who is going to profit from transactions, and that is only in case he doesn't have to pay a huge rent price to let his machine somewhere in the city.In every cases, the best alternative is always P2P transactions. The issue is that hardly ever you are going to find someone willing to negotiate. Maybe if there was a shop where P2P traders could meet would be a nice idea to be introduced in a cosmopolitan city like NY.",

I just would like to sell and buy for the current fair market's prices, but through exchanges it's impossible, because there are always spread or order's fees, besides the abusive withdrawal fees many exchanges charge, going beyond costs the blockchain demands. I consider P2P transactions to be important even in countries where Bitcoin isn't banned due to the reason presented above. It's annoying to become an \"hostage\" of exchanges, what means that if you want to deal with BTC, you have to do this through their services or you can't adopt the digital currency at all.ATMs could be a great alternative, if fees weren't abusive as well...",

These fees can vary greatly, influenced by factors like your geographical location, the total value of the transaction, and the specific Bitcoin ATM provider you're dealing with.Source: https://www.cryptodispensers.com/blog/bitcoin-atm-feesWho would be on their right minds that would be paying up with those % if you could be able to have that much lesson doing P2P on exchangers? For sure no one on their right minds would be doing so not unless if you are in a rush or just simply on what you have said.",

Maybe, this is the reason why the spread of Bitcoin ATM has not been too aggressive this time unlike in the past few years because the demand is not that big enough to keep the business alive and probably, it was not really profitable. In fact, we have a lot of options to send Bitcoin to another person.If the developer will take actions to lower transaction cost that possibly encourage people to use this machine.
