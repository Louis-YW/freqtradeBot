  "content": "I created a tiny Bitcoin Core-based online exchange. This programme has the following features:1. A new address with a specified password is generated by Bitcoin Core upon receipt of a request from the user.2. The user's address can be used to receive Bitcoin.3. The user can send Bitcoin from your own address; to do this, I've unlocked my account using wallet Passphrase and utilized send to address.In this such situation, all accounts can be unlocked with a single, complex passphrase. But after studying about the multisig feature, I considered including a scenario in my programme that would address this. However, I have a few queries in mind:1. When sending transactions, I included a set passphrase in my codes. In terms of multisig principles, I can't unlock that account with a passphrase; but, I need to sign data using distinct private keys. Am I correct?2. Since an exchange should operate automatically, I believe the last step of my codes must use all necessary private keys. Given that everything is close to one another in this instance, I don't believe I added any more security measures to my project. Can I get any information on the security that will be of great use to include multisig accounts in my project?I'm hoping you can assist me in mentally resolving these problems.",

If you want your software/website to interact with your Bitcoin node you will need to enable RPC and to secure the data sent/received you need to enable SSL encryption for your RPC API.

      "body": "I did not understand the idea of your project, but creating a CEX type exchange will be completely different from your idea, as you will create the exchange and have an independent data management system with a separate server for all withdrawals. Transactions will be sent in the form of Comma-separated values (CSV), which contains the address, value, and then Bitcoin Core can handle it.Quote from: Cleanshit on November 15, 2023, 09:01:47 PM1. When sending transactions, I included a set passphrase in my codes. In terms of multisig principles, I can't unlock that account with a passphrase; but, I need to sign data using distinct private keys. Am I correct?In this case, multisig principles will not help, but rather BIP39 Passphrases, where the private key is one and each account has a unique password through which it can generate addresses.https://medium.com/@alephium/bip39-passphrase-implementation-f87adecd6f59",
