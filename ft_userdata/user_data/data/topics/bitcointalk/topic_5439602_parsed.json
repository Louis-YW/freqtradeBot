By the way, there is the official website of the ICC women's T20 World Cup 2023, where, it seems to me, everything is presented in a more convenient form to get acquainted with the course of the tournament, so it's worth adding it. https://www.t20worldcup.com/",

Another thing, those teams will have a better experience playing the tournament. India, Australia and England in good position make the final to be between Australia Women and England Women or between Australia Women and India Women team. Good improvement with Sri Lanka team and Pakistan, because Sri Lanka Women were able to win two matches and Pakistan Women able to win against Ireland Women by a great margin.",

And Shamima Sultana of Bangladesh has a very good performance in terms of batting and two batsmen in Bates and Bernadine of New Zealand are very efficient and they play a big role in terms of run rate.",

This is just my opinion, but let's see what will happen in the end of course.I think though they may contribute towards the results but stamina and resistance are not the only things required to become successful in cricket or any sports. South Africa haven't really been on top of the game. They're not even number two in Group B, lost 2 out of their 3 matches played.From what I can see from the Standings, I think Australia is the strongest contender for the finals at this point with 4 in 4 wins and a net run rate of +2.But, I guess it's still too early to decide since there are still a lot of matches remaining from both sides.",
