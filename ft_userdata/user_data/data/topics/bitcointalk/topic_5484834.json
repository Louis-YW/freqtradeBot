  "content": "All the US spot bitcoin ETFs now hold a combined total of 192,000 bitcoin assets under management, recently surpassing Microstrategy's holdings of 190,000.The difference is it took Michael Saylor two to three years to amass that amount. The Spot bitcoin ETFs did it in one month! That is crazy. To say the spot ETF launch has been a success would be an understatement. It may Â be the most successful spot ETF launch in history.How many bitcoin do you think these funds will hold by the end of the year? Over a million? The sky is the limit. https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-hit-10b-milestone-just-month-after-approval",

I think Mt Gox + dramatic interest rate rises are the likely catalysts for a breakdown, wiping longs out before the bull run goes into full swing.Quote from: adaseb on February 11, 2024, 08:37:30 PMAs long as we get positive flows everyday in the 9 fig range then we should keep rallying and the FOMO will start.

And those speculators who have predicted that we might hit $50k prior to that activity, might be actually right after all.So \"moonboys\" be ready now, I do have a feeling that the forces aiming to capitalize most from this market do need to break that FOMO in order for maximum value.

I would say that there are a mixed lot, like ourselves here on the forum, some will selland take profits to buy back at a later stage, others will HODL with a long term viewand others might do a mix of both, sell some and HODL some.Thats maybe not how it works at all.",

For now, I expect to continue seeing more and more buying until the current ATH is exceeded, we could get a new ATH by next year but i expect a fall in the price when these investors want to take profit from their investment through the spot ETF. It is very important to be cautious until the massive sell off from these investors looking to make profit at when due immediately.",

Owning such a large number of bitcoin by a centralized entity signifies a very big impact in the market when they want to move the market in their favor. Some of these bitcoins were probably been bought before the ETF approval example those sold off by Garyscale but still this institutions are gradually buying this bitcoins which to me will definitely stop or drastically reduce as the time goes on because I feel this is just a FOMO period for even them. After they got the approval People thought they could have impact on the bitcoin most likely a huge price surge but it didnât happen because it wouldnât be manipulated.Quote from: GreatArkansas on February 11, 2024, 11:33:03 PMI most admire Michael Saylor as this guy experienced the ups and downs of Bitcoin multiple times but they still keep buying Bitcoin, a real definition of diamond hands.These numbers are not a joke already. Also, this is one of the many reasons I am not afraid to buy and hold Bitcoin. Seriously Microstrategy has been doing well in accumulating bitcoin, last year or year before they borrowed some funds to actually use to buy an later in the middle of last year they sold some partialsÂ  and then settle the loan amount which is a great strategy. This is not an investment advice to borrow money and invest in bitcoin because it is a bad idea but it is to show that if large investors like this can risk it then we should also give it a try and invest for longer time",

And then there were those who thought that the hype of the approval and its accompanying high volume will not stay around for long. They were wrong again. It seems the hype is somehow sustained. It's been a month already and it's been running strong. I think this itself is a huge boost, will encourage those who haven't jumped in yet, those who are observing from the sidelines, to finally join.
