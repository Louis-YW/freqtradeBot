If you remove your signature/avatar before the manager does his weekly duties, he’ll probably skip your payment since there is no way of knowing that you stayed the full term. Remember that different time zones are a thing.Now, why isn’t this a PM?",

If you haven't received your weekly payment then contact the BM. He would give you the answer to your question. Asking here won't help you and in getting paid.

      "body": "To me, this is just an unnecessary issue brought out to the public; this is what you should have asked your campaign manager in private and known what they think first. Just as the above member has pointed out, it's always important to let your manager know that you exist in his or her campaign. It really helps a lot, as you can both iron things out. Removing your signature when the weekly count has not been done yet reduces your chances of getting paid for that week. Your new campaign, which you joined, could also have given you a few bucks until your last campaign post is counted. Although Loycev has made things easier for managers to know when you remove your signature code, that does not mean your campaign manager will go through that just in the name of figuring out when you existed. Sometimes it's just good for you to hold on till the next day after your campaign day ends before you move over to the next campaign, even when the countdown has not yet been done. It's understandable that way.",

It's pretty obvious that if you leave in the middle of the week that you won't get paid. The payment cycle is usually a 7-day one, meaning you need to wear the signature the whole week. Monday until Sunday, and probably even the following Monday because the campaign manager needs time to count all the posts. After you got accepted in a new campaign, you were to quick in changing the signature details. That's what got you in trouble. This is something that you should have discussed with Royse777, and he is the one that must give you the green light if you want to get paid.",

I read the rules carefully and didn't found the rules about what if i lived campaign in the middle of the week.Are you 1 of those users that a manager has to spell out every little thing so that there aren't a billion questions with obvious answers? The point of a signature campaign is for people to post throughout the forum all through the week. If a company hires 20 people to make 25 posts in the week, and all those people posted 25 posts in 1 day and removed their signatures, how much good do you think that did the company? Signatures are only seen while a person has the code on, if a person changes to a different code then the new code is displayed. This is why managers like to implement a max number of posts sometimes to slow the spammers down so the company they represent gets a little more exposure on the forum. It's also a general rule that users wear the sig code the whole week and do not remove it unless the manager says it's ok.",
