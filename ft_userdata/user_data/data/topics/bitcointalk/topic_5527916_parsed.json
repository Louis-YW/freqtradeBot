I have read so many Bitcoin stories of how people threw away their Bitcoin at giveaway prices. I began to wonder if people think and see the future to try to have self-control over how they use their hands to destroy their future.Currently, that amount of bitcoin is worth more than billions of dollars to say and whomever holds such now is made for life.I strongly believe he did not sell that bitcoin since he canceled the auction and from the looks, he was last active on August 04, 2024, at 12:03:31 PMHe is a made billionaire I do not doubt it. SmokeTooMuch10,000 Bitcoin Auction",

Imagine if you are one of those people who bid on that thread and got 10k BTC. I'm sure you are going to sell a portion or the whole $10k BTC at around $1.1k+ after the first block halving year 2013 because if you sold it at that time you already a millionaire, and the remaining amount is to hold your future, and the sold BTC at that is your money for living.  Imagine you sold it all at $1.1k; it's around $11m. You can start using those amounts for business and buying other assets like gold. If I am one of them, I'm sure I already live without financial issues. The only problem is we're not them and we can't even have a single BTC, that's the fact if we can go back at that time or if there's a time machine, we can go back at that time. I'm sure you are going to buy almost one bit of BTC.",

Although people might say that this is waste of opportunity to earn big money but they should think that what's important for that situation is that people is happy that they fulfill their wants and needs at that time when they do that transaction. For now this is another chapter and we or those people could try to earn with Bitcoin again.",

Agreed.This is what happens when money appreciates rather than depreciates. Those who have been with Bitcoin for many years already must have cashed out at some point. Perhaps they needed money to buy a car or a new computer, to renovate a house, to take a vacation, and so on. So the history of Bitcoin must have abundant stories like this.I myself cashed out many times when the price of Bitcoin was below $5,000, even lower. I bought shirts, pants, sneakers, and the like using proceeds from Bitcoin. In hindsight, those decisions seem wrong because the money used would have already grown at least x20 by now and more in the future. But that's what money is all about. It's for spending.",

Because whoever may have bought this Bitcoin and was patient enyro have held this 15years, could probably have made a profit of over hundred million percent of $50.

Comparing that auction price with the current bitcoin price, no way! Bitcoin is indeed an alien tech   who could imagine something of very little value would become this great. Well all thanks to satoshi nakamoto and his team who made this posible for us to experience such an innovative technology and also have the opportunity to use it irrespective of the price worth of the coin.",

Yeah, not such big scale story, but still.certainly, we cannot predict the future and even if some of us held above a thousand bitcoin 10 years ago, just a fraction of us will still keep it till the present because it is practicable impossible to imagine that in ten years time, bitcoin would have attained a staggering $100k value and surpassed that as it stands. these sort of stories like we have read it multiple of times in different narrative gives an insight into the potential of bitcoin both in the past and what it can possibly get to in the future. even if we might not see same thing that happened in the past reflecting yet again in the future, or the next ten years, can we assume that it is not possible? it might be very possible. this is the reason why it is very necessary that we set out a portion of our portfolio for long term use. it might not make much sense at the present but definitely in the future, it will make a lot of sense.",
