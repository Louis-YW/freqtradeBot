So you have been told developers won't let it die? Questions arise, who supports QC development and who supports an open source decentralized application?Who has more money and power?Have you seen any scientifically provable quantum resistant algorithms that could be used with bitcoin?I'm sure governments already have their own quantum solutions, but does a multi-billion dollar open source market have it's own or we need to believe whatever is written on an internet forum?",

And of course the general work that is being done in the world (ie. unrelated to bitcoin) for the post-quantum-computer era for cryptography. But the problem with these algorithms is that they produce larger signatures that would increase transaction size and obviously eat up block space much quicker so it is going to be challenging to find a good replacement. Another problem off the top of my head is for example keys in Lamport signatures can not be reused, which is something a lot of bitcoin users do.The good news is that we are still years (probably decades) away from needing a real replacement.",

There's been plenty of unofficial discussions like others have suggested, but that's not what you asked. Official discussions aren't likely to take place, until Quantum Computers start posing a threat. It'll be before they are a threat, but much closer than we are now.We aren't that close despite what Sci Fi news sources claim. I imagine there will be a thread here on Bitcointalk when that does come around, likely in Development & Technical Discussion or depending on the severity Important Announcements.",

It's just that it's not yet necessary so there is no need to bother with.In short: it is called post-quantum cryptography and various quantum-proof algorithms exist, which would replace the old public key crypto.Interestingly, symmetric crypto is not really affected by quantum computers, so AES remains safe for instance.",

When it was considered weak, slowly everyone started moving away from SHA1 and it took years to switch to new replacement algorithms. The attack itself and the collision became feasible a couple of years after the switch.",

Making the Bitcoin Core blockchain quantum resistant would mean that the BTC blockchain must adapt to the new world of quantum computers. By the way, why is everybody asking about the impact of quantum computers over crypto and nobody is asking about quantum computers impacting the fiat financial system? There's an assumption that Bitcoin/crypto will be severely damaged by quantum computers, while the fiat banking system will be just fine. This seems ignorant to me.QuoteI am starting to feel like a \"Quantum resistant gems (aka new shitcoins)\" will be the new narrative in the upcoming years.

Guess all we can do is just slap them down again and again as they pop up. Would be nice if the mods put a sticky that had some basic QC points and every new user that asked about them got nuked.
