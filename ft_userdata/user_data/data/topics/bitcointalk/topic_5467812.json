Lastly, what about tax and shipping cost? Can you give some estimates. Iâ€™m from Philippines.Regarding the escrow, do you mean forum escrow right? Iâ€™m interested to purchase since this model is not yet available in my country and the price on your store is way lower than local price here.",

Are you willing to accept orders made here in the forum and use local forum escrow on our deal? Iâ€™m not familiar with your website while the amount involved is huge for me to risk in online transaction.I will read on warranty later once you accept orders made here in the forum. We can use @minerjones as escrow since he is the most trusted here on handling deals like this. Letâ€™s PM.",
