That is the cause of the irresponsible gambling.I was not also having gambling budget which was another mistake.One of the worst time is the time of losses, you will continue to deposit into your gambling account and continue to lose. It even happen that some people will not have any money left and start to borrow money which is a very bad idea.Gambling budget solves this. Just 5% of weekly income is enough for gambling.",

Gamblers lose control they start to lose in money because they want to get it back along with thinking earning potential. Having a desire to win more and recover loss at the same time gives the gambler confusion on whatâ€™s the real goal on gambling and that is having fun.The problem is gambling games is designed to be that way. They allow player to win at some point then later on recover it all by continuous loss while player keep increasing bets to intensify more losses.",

They just want to continue gambling because they have found joy in gambling. But they have to be careful because if they have the desire to continue gambling even though they have won, that means greed has come to them, and they have to be able to control themselves so they don't follow their desires. But if they have lost and want to recover their losses, it is also because of their desire not to be able to accept their defeat. Everything can trigger a gambling addiction, and usually, gamblers do not admit this and think that they can still control themselves well while gambling.",

When they are losing, they think that it is time for them to win more due to their greed and wjen they are losing, they will still continue playing to win back what they have lost.Gambling is based on luck and that is why one must accept losses and gamble responsible to avoid becoming an addict. Only gamble with the amount that you can afford to lose and also have a time limit for your gambling activities, to prevent you from much loss.",

But sometimes this works and sometimes this actually makes us experience more losses. But that's only sometimes. Well sometimes I also lose control in this matter. But because it's for fun so sometimes I don't care. Because I only use limited funds. So I can still meet my living needs and can still save and invest. But there are times when I get a big win then I become more greedy and want more so I make a bigger bet. But after I thought about it, it turned out that I always lost control when I was having some problems in my life. So I try to forget it with this.",

Before we use any money for gambling, we should make sure it will not affect us in any way at all especially financially. We can be lucky and win big but if we do not win big, the losses should be bearable in a way we are not going to think about it at all. The reason some people are not able to control their losses and they continue to gamble more and lose more is just because money is involved as you said but it is not only because of that, it is also becuase they do not think about the consequences until they lost so much.",

      "body": "I agree. Both ways actually. It will depend on the gambler. If the person is greedy then he goes back and forth even though he already received a multi-win. Chasing losses though might be a big factor for those who are addicted to gambling. Simply because most gamblers lose more and there's only a little window for one to win. Many of us are in the same boat, we just want that money back that was taken from us. This kind of perspective could lead to more losses which means a gambler will not stop unless he gets that one jackpot that would bring him back to whatever the amount that was taken from him. It's easier to remember the losses than the winnings. We don't even need that spreadsheet to calculate all because it's all in our brain and it's one of the reasons why a gambler cannot just stop.

What do you think about it? oh yeah, it easier for a gambler to quit for the day after a big win to when he's losing in his game. The tendency to chase the losses is triggered by the idea of recovery back to previous financial state, and in that condition anxiety steps in affecting your gambling decisions leading to blunders that originates extra losses.Losing can be very painful and disappointing equally when you claim to play for fun too, it is natural in human as an innate nature to disgust losing, and when we care too more about our losses we are moved to beat the loss and the chances are that we tend to lose more in such circumstance than we do recover. At that stage admittance by accepting the day as your losing day is the better option instead of chasing the losses.",

I'll say both and this is because we have different type of individuals who are gamblers and they have different ways of thinking therefore we can't use one way of thinking to judge everybody and come to a conclusion. Some gamblers gets their biggest dependence moment in gambling when they win big as they want to continue gambling so they can win more while other individual gets theirs when they lose as they keep playing with the hope that they'll win one of their next games.Neither way of thinking is good because both habits can lead to big losses that can make any gambler to lose more. As gamblers we shouldn't be greedy and we shouldn't practice revenge gambling. Picking one I'll say we have more gamblers that believe they can win after losing then those that keep playing after they win. Individually I'll be smart and take a break when I win or lose therefore I'm not dependent on continue gambling.",

He tried to continue making deposits and continue playing so that his losses could be returned. Usually those who chase losses are people who have already had a big win, they keep playing and try to get it back.I think all gamblers have experienced this, they get angry, emotional and lose control. Usually they will realize when the money they have is gone and they can only regret their actions. But unfortunately, even though we have experienced something like this, sometimes we repeat it once or twice. Controlling emotions is difficult",

What do you think about it?I tend to agree more with your first paragraph because if you take a survey among gamblers, you will realise that many people got lured into gambler by winning they had or that of others. People follow results that is why you can easily convince a person to join gambling with evidence of your winning than stories of losses. It is actually stories of loses that discourages people from gambling.Â  I don't know how gambling is designed but many people easily win in their early days in gambling and that is how they got stocked in it.",

Hence, they won't stop easily, even when the wins stop flowing. At the moment of losses, since they've been winning, they'll think of being lucky and that more wins would follow. Until nothing else is left to play. They've never been a time when a gambler kept winning without losing. So, the player will definitely face the both factors in one day. While gambling. Therefore, no need of picking the side that actually makes a player to lose control. Win or lose wash each other's hands in gambling. They appear accordingly, unplanned and unexpected. Their duty is to destabilize the player in ways they can't comprehend. Unless in card games where the winner is expected to continue playing, the right thing to do after winning is to play a little more, then stop. No player has ever gained profits out of losing control in gambling. He would embrace void decisions, because his emotion is not stabilized. That's why players should deposit little amount of money, such that even though they've lost control. The lack of money in their balance would help them get back to their control.

If a gambler is winning most likely he may keep winning and even if he has lost control and start betting higher then it is to his advantage because he keeps making money. Moreover if he later start to lose, he is likely to run off with the remaining profit with him, at this stage he has the control to guide himself but not when he is losing. Losing in gambling makes you take even more wrong decisions because you want to either try other pattern to see if you will be lucky which is significant of the confirmation that you have lost control. So someone who is winning his bet is likely not to change his system indicative of being in control but a losing person continuously changes system, indicative of losing control.",
