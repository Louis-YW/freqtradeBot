Bitcoin is weak.Dollar may be strengthening right now, but we don't know how long it will be in this situation. If it is increasing now, it is possible to decrease tomorrow. So, don't be so happy about the current situation in dollars. Just take advantage of what you can do with dollars now.While for Bitcoin, we all know we are in the bearish season, no surprise if Bitcoin price decreases again. But it doesn't mean Bitcoin is weak, the price drop is something normal to happen, especially during the bearish season. If you expect Bitcoin price to soar, you must wait until we are reaching the bullish season.By the way, please note that weak or not Bitcoin doesn't determine by its price. As long as there are a lot of people continue to use it, and the adoption is getting massive, it means Bitcoin has the potential power to change the world.Quote from: BTCGalaxyA12 on November 08, 2022, 08:23:15 PMFor those who don't like Bitcoin, don't get excited about this situation just yet.

I just want to say that the world is not doing well.\\The world is always not in a good condition. The economic situation will be worse if the recession really happens.People who don't like Bitcoin, don't know the potential of Bitcoin to deal with the worse scenario of the world economic crisis.Several institutions also warned about the impending recession such as Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan who predicted the US would fall into a recession in the next 6-9 months or in 2023. The spike in inflation is also due to the impact of the Russo-Ukrainian war as well as the trend of rising interest rates which will trigger inflation on a large scale. Of course, this will have a serious impact on global economic stability.According to economic theory, this recession or crisis occurs because global conditions are devastated by epidemics and great wars and these conditions cannot be avoided, then the condition will get worse if there is stagflation.Recession and inflation will lead to stagflation, namely recession conditions that occur simultaneously with high inflation rates. This high inflation means the amount of money in circulation is getting higher.So the impact on crypto, if there is a recession and stagflation then high selling pressure will occur, because investors will move their funds to Fiat in order to accommodate the possibility of worsening purchasing power.In this condition, in general, the fiat value will also move up, especially the US Dollar which became the main medium of exchange in the world after the second world war.Seeing the negative correlation or relationship between the US Dollar and crypto, it becomes natural when the crypto crisis moves down.It is worth mentioning that a crypto correction will occur as governments and central banks begin to respond to the crisis. But if it's just heading or there is a crisis, then crypto will move up.This condition is clearly seen in 2022 and 2020 where in 2022 the government and central bank begin to try to restore the economy but in 2020 a new crisis occurs due to a pandemic.and the conclusion is that when it comes to a recession the crypto market will start to rise but when the recession recovery efforts start to occur, then crypto will move down.Source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_recessionhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation",

When we're on the bull run, we tend to think of a much higher price before we sell but what happens is that we miss the top or near to it. And when the bear market comes, that's what we feel and regrets of not selling around 2x-3x of the current that we've got. It is why it's good to remember that if we're in profit, sell.",

Now is a good time to accumulate more bitcoins, as the price is at the bottom. And who knows, the current low price is the lowest price for bitcoin and after this, the bitcoin price will start to rally and can slowly get back up and break through higher prices.

That sounds unacceptable. Or maybe you mean each units of btc will now be equivalent to 1 usd? But that will be a lot. Can you be more specific about this one?",
