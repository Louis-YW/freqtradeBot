You are correct if it means that a lot of other exchanges and online accounts are probably going to go bankrupt and individuals who have used these online acounts as banks will lose their funds, that is what the warning is about, FTX is going to take other centralized crypto establishments down with it, so crypto individuals should store their funds in their own wallets to prevent this 'destruction'Quote from: Zorigi on November 16, 2022, 06:01:13 AMI don't think so because with a price reduction or what is called a bear market, it often happens. from before too. but of course we have to be careful and secure our assets because there have been many cases that have caused many people to suffer losses. so our assets must be secured. but in my opinion crypto will not be destroyed, during there are still many who are interested in investing in crypto.Your crypto assets or funds should be secured in your own custody whatever the market price may be.

And every time this happened (as it happened in 2018/2019 and several times before), bitcoin (and market itself) came out stronger so no, I don't think that crypto market is headed for destruction.

Avoid holding funds on any exchange in particular, as FTX infection can spread to other exchanges at any time.Quote Yesterday the admin of the forum issued a red alert Here, asking those who have cryptocurrencies in online wallets to transfer them to personal decentralized wallets as soon as possible. Theymos didn't say to keep everyone's crypto in decentralized wallets.  He says to use noncustodial wallets where you have a private key to access your wallet and where your funds are fully under your control.  In this case you can think of Myetherwallet as a noncustodial wallet . But you can use wallets like Electrum, Trezor, Ledger which are more secure",

However, as it turns out, it is justified and reasonable, and with the current hype over the FTX story, people might take the advice more seriously. I share the thought of some others here that it has nothing to do with the bearish market or where the market is heading. It's just a sensible reminder that not your keys means not your coins.As for the market, there's no reason to believe it won't recover from the current situation, or even that crypto exchanges will die out.
