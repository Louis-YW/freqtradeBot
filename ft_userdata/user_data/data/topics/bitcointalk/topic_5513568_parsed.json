  "content": "Beware of Phishing: Scammers Target Ledger UsersOwners of Ledger crypto wallets need to be especially careful. Scammers are currently sending out phishing emails in an attempt to drive Ledger users to activate a non-existent security feature they call \"Ledger Clear Signing\" by the end of October.These emails suggest that Ledger users won’t be able to continue using their wallets if they fail to activate the “feature.”  Attackers insist that Ledger Clear Signing protects users’ assets from phishing.Moreover, scammers state that this “security feature” will help see and check all information directly in Ledger before confirming a transaction. They suggest it will enable checking the recipient’s address, as well as the sum and related fees while performing crypto transactions and working with smart contracts and dApps.  Attackers provide an “activation” link for Clear Signing that takes Ledger users to an address unrelated to their wallets. Crypto enthusiasts must exercise caution and never use such links to prevent scammers from stealing their personal information and accessing their assets.I could have posted this at wallet section but feels like dropping it here to alert those that are fan of ledger, maybe after 5-7 days i move this topic or any mod can move it down there if i don't recall to do that myself. please be guided and don't fall victim of any scam activity as bull run is around the corner.",
