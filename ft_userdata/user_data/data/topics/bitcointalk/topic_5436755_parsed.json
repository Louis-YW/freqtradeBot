In several posts, amounts in BTC are mentioned (like \"My bitcoin digital casino only allows deposits of max BTC50).It would be nice to be able to quickly lookup the $/BTC at each post's date, perhaps by hovering over the post date.UpdateI made a quick demo, try it out:https://ztt.se/test:bct_pdq/index.php?topic=92.20Any subpage works, just replace bitcointalk.org with ztt.se/test:bct_pdq in the URL.The <title> html tag (to show hover text) in the forum date div is already used (to show Last edit date), and anyway it's not always clear how to hover on touch devices, so I resorted to explicitly append the dollar quote to the date, in green.Check out topic number five, where Satoshi welcomes users to this forum (1, 2, and 4 exist in the staff forum; 3 was permanently deleted at some point because it contained Satoshi's real name and address):https://ztt.se/test:bct_pdq/index.php?topic=5User profilesThe demo appends historical quotes to any date (if it's alone in its div), so it works on user profiles as well:https://ztt.se/test:bct_pdq/index.php?action=profile;u=897509",

It's fairly easy to search this information up yourself, and while it might seem lightweight, we've already had to disable certain features of the forum to avoid downtime, so adding features like this which has to query from another source, can both be exploited due to relying on that third party, but also does add some overhead to the resources.",

I don't think the forum would be able to handle something like that either - it has to do recounts every few weeks and those change numbers for older members quite a lot - I reckon there'll be a lot of errors with a system like that that just makes it too hard to edit (ie bitcoin is $0 on 1st January 2022 because the api broke).APIs that do fiat conversions in wallets also get broken quite a bit too so I think that'd happen here - it's also a lot easier to get multiple reliable sources to find the value of bitcoin from a search engine (and they'll have native currencies too).",

I'm sure many of you legends know the value of 6000+ BTC in 2013, but remember I'm a newbie.I actually vaguely remember something about the infamous pizzas, from when it happened I mean, but I'll be darned if I can remember exactly which year it was, or how many coins were paid.(I looked it up; I'm sure most of you already know this, but it was May 2010 when Laszlo Hanets bought two Jacksonville pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Two months earlier, user \"SmokeTooMuch\" auctioned 10,000 BTC for $50 but no buyer was found.)Quote from: Welsh on January 26, 2023, 10:25:11 PMQuote from: jackg on January 26, 2023, 12:00:29 AMI was thinking this myself.

Basically, constantly fetching the values, and presenting that. It could even potentially slow down the responsiveness of the page if it's rather resource heavy. Depends on how it would be implemented.You're right of course, it depends on how it'd be implemented.However, assuming a local cache of the historical quotes (some 4500 day entries since 2010-07-17, a couple of KiB; this could be updated once a day or so), even a naive serverside implementation would be very lightweight; a simple SELECT extension in the post loop and a tiny attribute addition to the date HTML (eg title='$23,133').In fact, I could even do it externally by proxy with little effort, even though this would incur several magnitudes of more overhead: for starters, my external proxy server would have to fetch the page from a real bitcointalk server, so I'll always be slower, even without modifications. Since I'm a single end-point, I'm most likely also rate-limited on the transport level. And of course I'd have to decrypt and re-encrypt since it's SSL. Also, instead of a puny addition to an existing post loop using a hopefully optimised DB engine, I'd have to parse and modify end-formated http data (150 KiB for this small topic before I post this).It's absolutely possible though, with only a modest time delay IMHO (hover over any post date to see that date's BTC price in dollars).",
