I don't need to explain how unsecure and dangerous these types of connections are, not to mention the fact that you'll inconvenience people who are hoping to get free internet access when they needed it the most. If you could download the blockchain using your home internet, please do it for the sake of convenience and the sanity of the people who'll connect to that public wifi service.",

      "body": "I've given up living in a bricks and mortar home, so I don't have a cable connection to fall back on.What am I getting out of this? Well, I wantr to help those amongst us who have decided to reject the authoritan control that is being imposed by the Eton/Oxford elite (what some peopole call the deep state). Bitcoin is a valuable financial tool, and it should be available to anyone who wants to use and support it. Bitcoin itself is stable and secure, but there  are problems for many in understanding its operation, and finding safe methods to use it. I'm aware that using a new computer with a Windows operating system is insecure, even more so when linked over public WiFi, but this is an olption that is forced onto many of the new breed of digital nomads.What impact will my activities have on other cafe users? I'm running core in the background, and I see no noticeable degradation in the performance of any foreground jobs. I suspect core may make fewer demands than some of the games and videos that other users may run over the WiFi here. I'm in the Asda cafe at the moment. It's 0730, and I'm the only person here. There might be a couple of salesman arrive later to look at spreadsheets, but other than that, usage is likely to be light. If things do get busy, then of course I will close down core.Update on progress.The Asda WiFi is running at 144/144 mbs. However it is telling me that I have 33 hours left to complettion. It was only 20 when I closed down at Sainsbury's yesterday. I looked at the new core panels, and I'm having problems creating a receiving address for test purposes. I've created two wallets, and I'm not sure of the ramifications of that. Core seems to have been improved dramatically over the last 3 years, so I need to do some serious reading I think I have done enough to prove the viability of running a full node over public WiFi, so I'll stop core shortly due to hard drive limitations. I'm using a Core i5 notebook with 8Gb of ram and a 512Gb hard drive, and that isn't large enough for the full blockchain. I believe that this machine has a second slot for an NVME M.2 drive, so I'll purchase one of those and install it for the blockchain and wallet data. I'm tending towards a Samsung 2Tb, and I'll check to see which is the fastest and most reliable. I'll stay with Windows for the moment, as there is no security risk  with an empty wallet. The next stage is to open the box, and check that there really is a second ssd socket, and discover the type and form factor. It seems the most difficult task is finding a securing screw for it.  Maybe I'll make a couple of videos for you tube.",

Why don't you just copy the folder (which contain Blockchain and other necessary file) from that device to your current device? That way you only need to download more recent blocks.It was a bit longer than 4 years ago I'm afraid.  I used to maintain it whilst drinking coffee in McDonald's, but during all the Covid scammy nonsesnse it became impractical to stay for any length of time in a restaurant/cafe. I inadvertedly turned my main blockchain into a pruned version, so I decided I would start again from scratch, and practice some recovery and chain moving methods. I've got about 5 versions of the blockchain and wallets, but none is up to date. I'm quite pleased that I'm doing this, as I'm learning quite a lot about the current version of core. After an initial temper tantrum, I've decided that I like the latest version.Afternoon update,I'm now in the Morrison's cafe, and it blocks the Bitcoin ports. Obviously they don't want customers to use Bitcoin. They keep turning off cash on the do-it-youself checkouts, so it looks as if they will be big on CBDCs. They let me use cpanel on my Kat1 multi-domain hosting plan, but they block the plan on Kuffy.com. It's probably time I did a supermarket cafe review for digital nomads. Sainsbury's looks best for Bitcoin, Asda is best for web site management, and Morrison's is best for fish and chips.",

Or a lot of times it's the other way, they only allow traffic on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https) and everything else is blocked. They may allow certain mail RECEIVING ports (110,143,993,995) and perhaps 587 for authenticated mail send but that's it. It's free, but they don't want to deal with the hassle of people doing anything other then browsing the web. So it's all blocked. I do that for a lot of my customers who want to offer public Wi-Fi. It really is more of free web browsing, for anything else get your own internet. Depending on the equipment you use and the amount of configuration you want to put into it you can even block TOR to a certain extent. <shrug> Probably does not matter since there are enough places that don't block things. -Dave",

Public wifi networks are typically unsecured and can be easily compromised by hackers who may intercept your connection and steal your private information.Downloading the blockchain isa resource-intensive process that requires a lot of bandwidth and time. Doing so over a public WiFi network increases the chances of the download getting interrupted, resulting in wasted time and bandwidth. and also could potentially violate the network's terms and service, which could lead to legal consequences.",
