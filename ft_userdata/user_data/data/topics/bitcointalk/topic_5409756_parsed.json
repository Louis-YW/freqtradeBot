The difference is that your site offers a fucet for those who do not have a large capital can routinely claim the faucet and use it to buy lottery. For a while I have not visited your site in its entirety. But just asking how to make sure the lottery draw on your site is truly guaranteed to be fair, for example providing live streaming when the draw is opened so that participants can watch the lottery selection process. The point I emphasize is is the process transparent? if so how do you ensure participants that it is guaranteed fair?",

There is a Keno game in development where you will be playing against the casino, but we are still collecting feedback from our players about it.You can withdraw your profits at any time, there is no requirement other than to deposit first to play and make profits, but there are limits (deposits, daily withdrawals, etc.), feel free to check the Helpdesk before playing.

I would say that they didn't survived more than year because there's not much player on the site. My guess is that this won't survived for too long either if the team won't add other games that is not lottery. It would be a good decision if there will be added games later on after the feedback that you will get. Anyway, welcome to Bitcointalk forum.",

      "body": "Quote from: Slow death on August 13, 2022, 10:08:10 PM1 - What is the maximum prize for each winner?For the 1 vs 1 lottery (2 players), each player can buy one ticket for 100 credits (worth $1) and the winner will get 190 credits (worth $1.9) For The 100 lottery, you can buy more than one ticket and the prize depends on the number of sold tickets (100 max). So the winner can get 950 credits (worth $9.5) in case 100 tickets were sold during that round. Note: in this mode a ticket costs only 10 credits. Quote2 - if, for example, nobody wins the prize during a month, for example, will the prize value increase or will it always be the same value?I am not totally sure how their system works but it doesn't look like a progressive raffle. It seems like it's designed in a way that ensure there will be always a winner for each round.",

The OP looks very attractive and filled with all the necessary informations. One doubt is that, you mentioned the withdraws are automatically, but also you mentioned that “or it may take 24 hours” . So what does this mean exactly? Moreover you should also add a rule of multi accounts, else your faucet will be abused soon.Will surely leave a detailed review at a later period of time.",
