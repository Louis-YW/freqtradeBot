  "content": "This thread was created when I stumbled this post, first I think his post is normal and doesn't have anything suspicious since there's nothing different in my eyes e.g. font size, font color, links etc. I wanted to reply his post, so I have to quote his post, then I see there's a hidden hyperlink on his post. A normal link or hyperlink will shown with pastel blue color, but since he's using black color on his link, no one will noticed it except we quoting his post or hovering our pointer to each words of his post. That's hidden hyperlink isn't harm anyone, but I'm thinking in the future there will be scammer might using this method to scam anyone.Since we can change our font color with any color, then I tested out to change the font color with the bitcointalk's background. It worked!Apocollapse <- A word colored with forum's background color (#ecedf3)Code:[color=#ecedf3]Apocollapse[/color]My next experiment is using forum's background color and hyperlink.Apocollapse <- A word colored with forum's background color and hyperlinkCode:[url=https://bitcointalk.org][color=#ecedf3]Apocollapse[/color][/url]In this version, you can still see a difference when you're hovering your pointer to the exact word, there's a black underline.Now what if I'm combining the forum's background color, hyperlink and underline?Apocollapse <- A word colored with forum's background color, hyperlink, and underline.Code:[url=https://bitcointalk.org][color=#ecedf3][u]Apocollapse[/u][/color][/url]In this version, if you didn't really pay attention you wouldn't noticed there's a hidden hyperlink since there's no black underline show up even you've hovering your pointer. This because if you change the font color, both of underline and strikethrough color will follow the exact font color too, it looks invisible.ApocollapseApocollapseIf you're using PC to open this forum, you can still see the link show up on bottom left corner, however if you're using phone you can't (but you can press and hold to see the link). Dragging the whole post or quote is the only way to see the hidden words and hyperlinks.This trick can be worse if someone use it on the blank spot between each paragraph/sentence, anyone wouldn't notice since it looks like a normal text, below is the example:\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I did google and found some old threads of Bitcointalk's forum phishing before:1. [BEWARE!] Bitcointalk Credential Phishing Attack -- Targeting Collectibles 2. ⚠️ BITCOIN-TALK FORUM PHISHING WEBSITE! BE AWARE!! ⚠️I have visited another crypto forum built with SMF and all of the links posted have grey underline color, I guess this forum is possible to add this feature isn't? This what it looks after adding grey underline in every links:Though you're using forum's background colors (#ecedf3 color for odd number post #1,#3,#5 etc and #f6f6f6 color for even number post #2,#4,#6 etc) anyone can still see a grey underline.",

That feature is made to differentiate links and same with your reasons to avoid getting malware, phishing links and even scams. Accessing anything that is NON bitcointalk-related URLs are considered as risky and might steal device data and etc. So its up to the user if he will proceed to access the URL or not since we can hovered it before clicking it.Edit: Heres the thread of theymos im referring to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1432118.0",

If all links were to look a certain way, someone could simply format their post to hide any links in their post.

I think the main reason why someone would want to hide the fact they are posting a link is for black-hat search result reasons (aka backlink spam).

On mobile platforms you can accidentally activate hidden links upon random tapping on blank spaces. That's a lot easier to abuse than on a desktop computer. But this is unfortunately true for all websites as well. I personally support the idea of having a notification or pop-up for all external links on the forum.",

The essence of spreading phishing links is to have victims click on it as many times as possible or as fast as possible.Phishing links I know are not invisible traps set and waiting to catch even if one person in one year. Phishing sites come with some baits to enable it catch many victims within a short possible time.Hiding a Phishing link with the forum background color will yield no much results because I don't see myself clicking every word or blank spaces. This will work unless there is a kind of SEO optimisation the spreader wants through the link.

Maybe. But don't forget that signature space is limited. Chances are that most of that character space is already lost because of the sig you are wearing, so you won't be able to do much with what remains. One way around it is if a Hero/Legendary would wear a sig for a Member/Full Member, which leaves him with enough room to include other things in his signature space. Good campaign managers surely check if there are additional lines and entries in the signature that shouldn't be there. It's against the rules to have that. Here is just one example:Quote from: DarkStar_ on May 26, 2017, 11:45:12 PM7. Adding additional lines into your signatures is not allowed.",

Would not post them, as not to give anyone ideas, but a certain tag should be added so hyperlinks would be distinguished from the rear of the post.Also, would it be possible to have a notification before opening links, sort of \"are you sure you want to b redirected to...\"This would prevent inadvertently clicking on links, especially when you're on mobile.Adhoc links or hyper-text-links is one forum programming that I like. You know, it states the links subject simply and it can be easily used in a way that, it blends with the sentence structure although yeah, as proposed by OP, it could be used to do some damages. Scammers who are phishing for whatever details are fully aware that, one is likely not to click on a suspicious link and as such would just go for an alternative in making a harmful link seem harmless by making it click bate and forum related enough to make users loose therr gaurd. I once saw a user whom reported right here in meta of an attempt by some other user to pish for his login details using adhoc or hyper text links through a pm.Quote from: LoyceV on May 13, 2022, 07:34:43 AMI don't see how this can easily be abused for phishing. That's much easier by using a fake visible link: google.com.I understand the scenario your trying to relate here, in relating to the fact that, the probability of users falling victim by clicking a hyper texted link within a wall of text is less than that of a link being simply stated out and that's true. That's really true but even at that, if we are to take a look at the operation of most ads these days, the 'x' and '>' symbols along with others have been known to skip the ads or pass and somehow, these guys have input that in there programming while the count down is still reading with the skip icon yet to be displayed. Where your attempt to skip ends up being you, clicking the redirecting page itself. Like, a whole page serving as a link. Same guys for the forum too. Some serious user might use his or her whole text as an adhoc link and your little attempt to keep your device brightness on by just clicking or taping your device screen, ends you in a redirecting pathway.",

I don't use the btt often so it's so much hard for me to detect! is there any solution to this? like filtering out the phishing site and ban them from btt? so that no one could use that link in btt forum and get a warning for using them",
