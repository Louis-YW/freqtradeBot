Back then we had decently reputable ones like Wirex and Xapo, but today? I'd be highly skeptical of such services that doesn't require KYC.I agree.I think if we're back to 2016-2018 or even earlier, this is still applicable but these days, it's very unlikely. Just the perfect example are those centralized exchanges that don't bother asking KYC before but now, they do.And the same goes to the casinos that don't mind asking kyc before but many of them have become compliant. So, just as the bitcoin debit cards, if it's non-kyc required today. Then, expect that someday it will as they update their terms and agreement/usage.",

If anyone even wants to try it out make sure you dont do it on your personal device, your privacy and security might be at risk.They barely launched their business at the start of the year and didn't get any traction as it seems from the number of downloads, the apple store page has a few more reviews but I have the feeling those are written by the members of the team themselves, too many at the launch in late March early April and a huge pause after that. Even if it's a good product and not a scam if it has no usage you won't see any real feedback on it, and since they don't really offer anything new as the others mentioned, probably you won't see that many people using it from now on either.",

I'm pretty sure other platforms that are far less monitored by regulators in the past have been forced to require AML/KYC even if they don't want to (e.g. LocalBitcoins, ShapeShift, etc).",
