That is a high expectation for average earning when you factor in that there would be losses accumulated on different days.Start by doing your research on the different trading methods, test the waters with a few of them by demo trading or back testing the strategy.- Jay -",

There is no guarantee that you will win when trading on your own, but at least you will gain experience and knowledge. Better to lose money by copying someone else's and learning nothing for yourself.If I understood ImThour, its statement above did not state that more than 30% profit is always certain, but there is a possibility of making up to 30% profit every month, which is also just an assumption used to give the OP advice, which was also made very clear that the chances are less than 5%. When one says you only have 5% chances of winning something, you can see that there is also a 95% possibility of failing, which is a very bad sign, and you will be depending on luck to win.There is no part taken in making money that's very easy, although I believe and I have seen people making profit from trading and prediction of market price in every market condition. That does not mean they don't lose trades or they always win all their trades, but their amount of positive trade is always greater than their losses.OP, your chances of making up to 1% profit every day are very low unless you are ready to partake in a very high-risk trade that might not end well for you. If you already have a good trader with whom you are coping, all you have to do is try it, adding a little experience you might have acquired yourself. Don't put all your 2,000 dollars into one trade; it's risky. Better yet, slit your funds little by little so that if the trade goes sideways, you won't lose everything completely. You also have to reduce your 1% daily profit estimate. If you have a lesser target, it might as well reduce the risk of entering the wrong trade.",

Some days the market can be unpredictable and I think that taking a break could be necessary to avoid losses. Timely breaks are crucial imo, and they can help you avoid a losing streak.Starting with $20 would be ideal as it would allow the OP to understand how investing works and learn from their mistakes over time until they become an expert. However investing $2000 as a starting point and waiting for a daily revenue of $20 can be risky, but it could be feasible if you have a lot of knowledge and/or following a solid strategy that minimizes risk while making daily profits.",

It seems to be an okay method, but it increases the risk-taking among people because they tend to trust those whose trades they copy.

Apart from wins, there can also be losses, and consistent winning is the hard part, even if it's copying someone who is supposedly good at this.

There are times where the top traders in a particular platform have some bad days as well. As for the OP, 20$ per day might be achievable, but the question is how consistent the trader you will be copying is in terms of profits? There might be times where you can achieve this especially when it's on futures trading, but on a consistent daily basis? I don't think so.Top traders have good times, and bad times as well, so if you will just go on the easy route, and just copy these traders, and you just sitting there watching Netflix, and not watching charts, chances of you losing your money might be high. Better to just learn trading by yourself, and you might get more than 20$ per day if you became a successful one.",

I just read the thread also which simply signifies that OP is looking for a way to earn massively with his $2k. Probably the informations he got from the first thread actually scares him off that gambling it would be a huge risk. The 20$ gain daily is something that is not guaranteed because there are days that there will be loses and days that will result in more profits. If OP seriously wants to learn and earn then it can be realistic to set the percentage gain at 10% monthly. This will help him to make decisions calmly and also learn from those he copy trades from.
