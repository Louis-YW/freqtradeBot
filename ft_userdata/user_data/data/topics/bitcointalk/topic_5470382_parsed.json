This is a common or standard rule in gambling site, as mentioned by stadus above, the main purpose of this rule is that casino do not want to see the casino is being used for mixing money or even a wallet. I do not see it as a BS, any online service has the right to set any rule and you as customer are also having the right to accept it or not. If you find that 1x wagering requirement for your deposit is a BS or maybe other rules as BS, then dont use the casino. Just for your information, there are even some casinos with wagering requirement for deposit higher than 1x.",

Some sites are also able let you to withdrawing your money after you have been doing some bets. The requirements are vary totally depends on the regulations that being implemented into the gambling site. I have no problem with these requirements. Keep in your mind that if it must not equal to the deposited funds. As long as you were playing before you are withdrawing and that's fine. Im not seeing this requirement as a burden for the gamblers since you can also make small bet to fill it up. Just try to gamble it and then you will able to withdraw it. It's not something wrong.",

So I don't see anything big or wrong is having to wager your entire deposits once before being able to withdraw them,  this is to avoid casinos being used as money laundering tools where people just deposits get the coins mixed and withdrawn without traces",

I guess this requirement is in every casino and some may even ask to wager the deposit twice or thrice before you can withdraw. There are two main purposes of it. First, when people wager, they will most probably lose money and hence it is a profit for the casino. Secondly, the other reason that the gambling sites will give publicly is that this helps prevent money laundering and other illegal activities.Why would you deposit on a casino site when you do not want to wager and gamble with it? If this wagering requirement is lifted, some people may use these platforms for money laundering, that is depositing on the gambling sites and withdrawing at the other end without gambling.",

If casinos allow users to just deposit and instantly make withdrawals without having to complete any requirements then you’d have seen different people using casino for other nefarious purposes like laundering money. If I can just deposit money into my gambling account and withdraw it into a different wallet address why would I need service like mixers to prevent other from being able to track my transactions? The only time it becomes a nuisance is when the wagering requirement becomes almost impossible to complete for example those asking you to wager x60 before you can withdraw.",

We should gamble with everything we've deposited and only withdraw when the winnings are substantial. Personally, I wouldn't even withdraw my funds when I've won 100% of my initial deposit because I'm certain I'd continue to gamble. So, it's only a waste of time for me if I have to deposit funds again. We aim to win big, unless you're a high roller who's content with 100%. But for gamblers who deposit, let's say, $100, I think it's more satisfying if we can cash out with $1,000 in our wallet.",

Well, I wouldn't say it's BS, some people are really using casinos as mixers, and there is that AML policy as well. I doubt that this wagering requirement will stop people from doing anything illegal, but at least it's some protection.I guess it's more about keeping players on the site... when we decide to deposit and we win after a few bets this is a nice way of saying \"play a bit more\" to players, and when we play a bit more there's always a chance that we will get busted.",

I don't think so, you are only thinking for yourself and it's fine but what about you been the casino owner? You would have love this rules before withdrawing, or won't you? It is the same claim by gamblers who wants to rob casinos by taking their offers and bonuses and withdrawing instantly, if this is allowed why won't other gamblers abuse it? You will see loads of multiple accounts making deposits on the casino to get bonuses and click on the withdraw in an instant.The only time where this should be normal is after you win for real, deposit money on the casino and do some gambling and if you get lucky and win some money you will be able to withdraw normally, if you running a casino you will know why some things are necessary, for the business to flourish and for the business to also not turn into a illegal platform.",

I'm talking about this restricting on initial deposit only, I understand and agree with such restrictions on bonuses. Previous comments cite AML, I'd argue you can do same thing on cexes, deposit and withdraw instantly, they don't force you to trade. Now again, if someone argues you are kyc'ed on cexes, I reply only recently most cexes are making kyc mandatory, it wasn't the case before.",

Those individuals can just deposit their tainted bitcoin then they can just withdraw it right away, so this casinos wanted to make sure that at least you play some money, just percentage of your deposit before you can withdraw it. Unlike in traditional based though, if you put some money on a game let's say a slot machine and you don't want to continue, then you can withdraw your money and encash it, or just continue to play with other games. But this is offline, so this casinos will have to protect themselves from people who find loopholes, not just in casinos, even in exchange platforms as well because there are certain individuals who might do it.",
