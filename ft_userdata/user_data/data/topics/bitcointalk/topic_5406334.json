It can be a he, she, a group of people like Cyperpunk, a company, a governmental agency, whatever.I think we don't have to find real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto because after 13 years and Bitcoin has grown good enough without the engagement of Satoshi since 2010. It will grow more very well without any engagement of Satoshi because it was designed to be decentralized from protocol design to network hashrate.",

The word \"we\" has almost become a standard word as a pronoun for \"I\" because it is used in writing official letters or proposals which is considered more polite, even though it does not mean representing a group or company. Maybe satoshi is from a country that is also used to using this pronoun or maybe he's actually from Indonesia. LOL",

We can refer to the community that he was expecting to get attached with Cryptocurrencies or we could be nothing but a sort of self but an adjective being used for self majesty. It's hard too guess the meaning of this we. Definitely one possibility could be that it's referring to set of people involved in the project. But to be honest I am in the set of group which think that it was definitely more than one person because this isn't really a task for one single person.",

Even in the introduction itself, Satoshi preferred to write, \"In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using...\" even if what followed is an idea coming from himself.",

The use of \"we\" is a redirection to hide the fact that he might truly be just one person. I actually believe Satoshi was Hal Finney, who posted back and forth in the forum with himself using two accounts, Satoshi and Hal, just to hide that he was actually Hal Finney.",

As well as the use of language so as to avoid taking all the credit for such a technological advance. It's similar to the use of the \"royal we\" in English to some respect.

My reasoning is that, I don't believe, even if you were one of the brightest persons on earth, that you could alone create the system he/they created knowing that you needed to be an expert and excel in quite a few areas of knowledge! And those areas are themselves quite extent in the sense that they cover too many aspects for someone alone to be able to excel at them all. I 'm referring for example to finance, economics, computer science, math, cryptography, computer programming and I'm sure those are only a few of them!

In addition, considering that Satoshi was a man who was aware that he could not do it alone, I believe that in this way he wanted to repay those with whom he cooperated after Bitcoin came to life. Therefore, he never wanted that project to be something that would be associated exclusively with one name, he knew that Bitcoin would never succeed and be what it is today.",
