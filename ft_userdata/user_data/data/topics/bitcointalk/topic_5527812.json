  "content": "I’m starting a thread here with the goal of creating tons of content to help you learn Bitcoin from scratch. My aim is to condense as much knowledge as possible into a clear and organized manner, so anyone interested in understanding how Bitcoin works and how to interact with it can follow along.I’ve already created a few threads, but I was advised to consolidate all the information into one place, making it easier for people to bookmark and check updates.Throughout this thread, I’ll be doing periodic updates to add new content, clarify questions, and expand on various topics. The goal is to provide an accessible, free resource that anyone can use, no matter their level of experience.If you’re interested, feel free to follow along and don't hesitate to share your questions or comments. I’d love to hear your feedback on the videos and content.Here’s the first video (I made a separate thread for it, but I won’t be updating that one. Everything will be kept here):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH35Ri9Bi34(This video was even retweeted by Bitcoin News: https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1875921242567680403 )Here’s the second video I made:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9nSiR2cbYQIt’s about Bitcoin wallets, self-custody options, security, and the main ways to obtain Bitcoin. It’s designed with beginners in mind.Here’s the third video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnmTlJ_7lBgI still have many videos planned! Could you give me some advice on which topics would be most interesting to you?    - Advanced self-custody, metal backups, passphrases, multisig setups, steganography...    - Other Bitcoin layers like Lightning and Liquid...I’d really appreciate your feedback on the current videos and if you find these topics interesting. I’ve also created some other content, but I think it needs a bit more refinement. Here’s a beginner-friendly flowchart:And I also have a couple of illustrated PDFs (and maybe more):    The Pleb Guide to Store Your Bitcoin    How to Understand Bitcoin in Less Than 1 HourThey’re available for free at the downloads section of hideyourkeys.io.I’ll do my best to keep the post tidy and would love to hear any feedback!",

I think this is more appropriate for the beginners and help but in this section, this could get more views and attention not just from the oldies but also to the newbies.",

I can say it's not boring to learn with this type of video but it's even more interesting to keep on reading and gain productive insights. Good luck, keep your videos as amazing and interesting as they are.",

The lessons are simple to learn that even someone who knows nothing about Bitcoin would be able to comprehend them easily. I wouldn't hesitate to share the link on some platforms, Maybe that will be my contribution to Bitcoin awareness and adoption. More power to your elbow.",

And I admire these creatives that put in the 100 of hours work to get this out there. It is good work and the flow chart is good but if you can break it into two parts so as not to get the beginner overwhelmed with information and they run away scared because they think the process is too long. That is just my observation.",

There are many things that beginners don't know, but if they can master them properly, the fear they had towards Bitcoin will definitely go away. However, I hope that you will post more creative videos here in the future.",

It looks good although the web loads a bit slowly (I'm using a VPN with a server from Singapore, which accesses most websites with no issues at all). Why don't you add a preview section of the guide, or make it possible to read the document online instead of downloading them? Some people don't feel comfortable with downloading PDFs files, especially after how many malwares spread through them in the last few months or so.I haven't read the full guides but in your \"Making Sense of Bitcoin\", I think the common faqs can be misleading since I don't think a statement like \"Bitcoin isn't backed by anything\" is what people ask if they're a newbie. It's usually about \"How do I buy Bitcoin\", \"Which wallet to use\", etc when I read about faqs. Maybe you can rename it to something else like \"debunking common Bitcoin myths/criticism\", just my 2 cents.",
