Both functions go enable you access to the balance of your Bitcoin address with electrum. E dey possible to import any wallet for there, but you need to own private key to take run am. This go dey very helpful if you still get old paperwallet wey you wan transfer the Bitcoin, or you get address wey you dey use for another client and go like use am for electrum or you go like use your own self-created vanity address.ImportThe Import function dey useful to import Bitcoin address as a new wallet to Electrum. The Bitcoin go dey for the wallet and you go fit access the wallet after you don import am to Electrum. E dey important say the imported wallet no go get a seed phrase and you no go fit restore am from a seed because e no get any. If you no lose the private key, you no go need the seed either. SweepIn comparison, the sweep function go transfer your Bitcoin from your original wallet to a new wallet for Electrum. Since Bitcoin transaction (from the old to the new wallet) go take place, sweep go require internet connection and transaction costs.For you to dey able to use vanity address wey you don create before for Electrum, the function wey you go use na import.Na like this you go take do am:1. Open Electrum Open Electrum and go to File => New/Restore2. Choose a name Choose a name for your wallet wey you wan use take import and click on Next3.
