One thing you need to understand about Bitcoin is that it is not a get rich quick scheme, and to be frankly speaking, Bitcoin is a good investment for long term, but to be sincere I don't think Bitcoin will go 5x or 10x before middle of next year, but it will definitely. So if you are looking for coins profit pumps up 10x within few months, try Altcoins, because as for Bitcoin, it is a gradual process.. And as for NFTs, I am not a fan of NFT, so I actually don't know much about it",

How can some that understand bitcoin would say, he has a feeling about bitcoin that bitcoin will not grow more than $26k. Do you know where the bear market stopped before bitcoin comes back this 23 or 24k? That your strange feeling that you have, it has not tell you the real stopping price of bitcoin, I will advise you to enter  speculation  board and read the threads there so that you will be well equipped in the bitcoin space. And also you don't have to know my opinion and read opinions on speculation board. Is your country's inflation stable? No. So please one thing you have to understand about bitcoin is that, it is not a stable currency. And it is not a centralized currency. It is a decentralized digital currency that is used to buy and sell things (assets) through peer to peer (p2p). Example. You have a electronic shop and I want to buy a TV and you have a wallet. What I will do is to transfer the amount worth the TV from my bitcoin wallet to your wallet directly not to third party bank. And as for NFT. Investment is a personal decision so if you know that you are interested on NFT then go ahead. All legit platforms are good to invest and also all legit platforms have risk. Therefore, the choice is yours",

Even though am less concerned about what may be your reason, let you shock you with this, go through the record history of bitcoin past thirteen years and get some taughts out of it, moreover if you have had an ugly past experience with shitcoins before then i think it's time you know the difference bitcoin stand for among other cryptocurrencies.Quote from: marthabat on August 16, 2022, 06:08:46 PMI want to know your opinion, and where is it better to invest your bitcoins now?Even though your question isn't straight forward but let me assume what i thought you're asking, invest on bitcoin using hardware wallet, you can secure one by purchase, and if you're investing a very huge amount of money on bitcoin then it is better to run a full node on the blockchain, always avoid centralized exchanges for an investment.Quote from: marthabat on August 16, 2022, 06:08:46 PM I heard that the NFT market is going up very well now, which NFT is better to invest in?If you think you've developed a more thicker skin in taking risk then your can stake your coins but advisably invest on bitcoin, NFT has alot of scam in it",

What are the reasons you consider why you are having that strange feeling that bitcoin will not grow more than $26,000? Let's say your speculations are true then you will still be on profit if you try to jump in at the current price. Then from there, just take advantage of the price swing.Quote from: marthabat on August 16, 2022, 06:08:46 PMI heard that the NFT market is going up very well now, which NFT is better to invest in?

Even in the bear market we might likely the price pump beyond 26k then after the halving we see the bull take over the market beyond 100k. Don't use emotions with bitcoin, use your analysis and cross-check with history to see how the price movements could look like. On the time bitcoin do move out sideways then people do tend to look for another place for them to put their attention and with the current hype and interest in the market which it isnt something new and even myselfwould be having considerations when bitcoin isnt really moving that much but of course i would still put up some priority on accumulating bitcoin as much you i can and this is how should people be thinking up this way.Tend to go in sideways but dont forget out priorities when it comes to investment.Dont just put yourself go all in with the hype in the market.",
