If you are sending to your own address, you should see the BTC being counted back to your wallet after getting confirmation from the blockchain. Typically, its just the same thing as \"transferring\" funds to any given BTC address.",

If you authorize a Bitcoin transaction to the same address, the transaction will likely succeed. However, depending on the network conditions, you may need to include a transaction fee in order for your transaction to be processed. If the fee is too low, your transaction may not be prioritized by miners and may take longer to be included in the blockchain. It's worth mentioning that some Bitcoin owners will occasionally engage in this type of transaction during periods of low network activity in order to consolidate multiple small inputs into a single unspent transaction output (UTXO). This can help to reduce future transaction fees.",

It must be confirmed by miners so you will lose a bit satoshi as transaction fee for miners who confirm a block which proceeds your transaction.It is not a matter where you send your bitcoins to. To an address in a different wallet or to a ln address in a same wallet or to a same address in a same wallet, you will always have to pay bitcoin transaction fee in satoshi unit.You will have wait at least 1 confirmation for that transaction then you can move your bitcoins again to another address or another wallet.If it is an exchange wallet, they usually require 2 or 3 confirmations, before you can withdraw youra bitcoins.",

It's just that as long as the parent transaction in unconfirmed, the child can't be confirmed.",
