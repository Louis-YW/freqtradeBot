  "content": "There is a scam currently ongoing from WhatsApp to Telegram. You will be contacted by a random person with a foreign number offering an online digital marketing job or tasks that claim to make you money per day. They will ask you to do a test task and then send you money upon completion. However, the scamming process begins thereafter. They assign illogical tasks, such as visiting random YouTube pages without clear indications of how they generate income, all while recording amounts for each task. Following this, they may ask you to complete a task involving an investment with a promised refund after 10 minutes.I checked my WhatsApp and saw that I received this type of message. Note that by this point, you will have been invited to join their 'workgroup' on Telegram, where the main scam continues. WhatsApp serves as their contact and hunting spot. Another red flag indicating a scam is being in the Telegram group as a new worker but unable to comment due to being under investigation and verification. Meanwhile, you'll see supposed members and 'investors' posting about receiving their commissions while being advised to make your own postings with the 'Receptionist,' who was the first person they directed you to from the WhatsApp contact.From this stage onward, it's crucial to recognize that you're about to be scammed. These scammers often use the names of international digital marketing companies, such as Intero Digital, Primal, and other reputable agency names. This scam was widespread in India, Malaysia, and now Nigeria. Please be wary of anyone offering you a job opportunity out of the blue on WhatsApp. Share this information to help vulnerable individuals avoid falling victim during these challenging times. The current ongoing scam involves using BrodaShaggi's YouTube content as a 'Test Task.' Beware.Credit: https://twitter.com/ChukyUnfazed/status/1717951932562575414Suggestion: To have just one thread where new scams are reported so that our brothers and sisters here would be aware and take note. Instead of creating a new topic for new scams.  How una see am?",

Everyone has to be very careful with whatever they are investing in. These scammers come with different formats, so it is wise to trade with caution in what one is doing.",

All hands on deck for anyone with safety measures because it seems like any social platform these days is suseptible to hacking.I have gotten quite a few messages from unknown numbers offering good rewards for me to perform some simple tasks. Of course I have refused and have asked good questions to determine their credibility but they refused to respond till date because they are legit scammers. I know quite well that in this time, anyone could be anyone trying to reap off from unsuspecting networkers. For those who have accounts on WhatsApp and Telegram, please read carefully and understand the message in between lines before giving a candid response.",

Whenever I receive such messages on WhatsApp, I just tell them I’m not interested. They will try to convince you but don’t give into their persuasion and stand on your words. Many will leave you and not disturb again but some will continue and the best thing to do at that point is to block them.QuoteSuggestion: To have just one thread where new scams are reported so that our brothers and sisters here would be aware and take note.

I talk about how they were from a company I dropped my CV for or they got my contact information from where I might have dropped my CV, as their message claims I was accepted to work with them as per my application and I should click on the link below to get more information, which directed me to WhatsApp that day, and I realise it was this set of jobless people looking for someone to waste their time.Quote from: Charles-Tim on October 29, 2023, 09:45:12 PMWhat I just always do with any new number that want to introduce me to a business or investment or a job on WhatsApp or Telegram is that I will 'block and report' the number immediately, then it leaves my home page and got deleted.This is exactly what I always do: once they approach me with a welcome message like hi or hello, I respond back to be sure of who is on my DM. Once they start with that rubbish talk, I go straight ahead and report them. The only reason I don't block any unknown contact, especially a foreign number, immediately is because it might be a genuine message from someone who is away.",

Where as anything wey dey bring money people no dey reveal am just like that.

Just yesterday my neighbor would have been scammed on Facebook, they ask her few questions to answer in other to receive a certain amount and she did answer the question, and the next thing they did was to ask her to pay a certain amount of money before they could credit her the 100k she won and she wanted to pay the money if not that I was around, funny enough one of there convincing method they use was to upload some videos of people claiming to have received there money so that people will believe that is real. So in as much as we may feel that people are not supposed to fall for scammers, there are also people who are very gullible and doesn't no anything like scam so those kind of people could easily be a victim of scammers.",

They could know about the official username or social handle the legit and existing organization then to convince the public and its victims, they would create similar usernames or official handles with either a different of just an alphabet or a characters differences which is likely to make the public and its victims believe they are on the right track with the real (legit) organization. E.g.  Assuming \"bitcoin.org.ng\" is a username or any form of social handle from a  legitimate (real) organization and these scammers wants to impersonate, they would have something similar like \"bitcoin_.org.ng\" or the other ways.These are basically internet fraud systems.",

You should know that for someone to promise to pay you 10k, he should be making say least 100k from that venture to be able to balance process costs and have some gains for themselves, yes you should be making at least 10 times what you pay your workers to still be in business. This is when you should be honest with yourself, check how much you're promised and the possibility of them getting their money back from the tasks you're assigned.2. You need to check online with their company  Url on one of the scam detection sites e.ghttps://webparanoid.com/en/check-websitehttps://www.scamadviser.com/There are lots of them that helps you detect the trust  rating of a website. 3. Another one is any website telling you to invest in it before you're paid is possibly a scam cos you don't pay before you're employed in any remote job. Lastly, as the Christmas season is drawing near, we need to be wiser and not be scape goats and fall prey to online scammers.",

Funny enough most people who send these messages are the people who know you but who wants to scam you by using a different number, My reason for saying this is because someone who doesn't have your number can't reach you on WhatsApp so it's either they get your number from people who knows you or they are people who knows what you are into or things that you will be interested to do.",
