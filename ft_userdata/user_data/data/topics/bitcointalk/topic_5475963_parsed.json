  "content": "The wey people dey drive car this days, na why e dey very good to go driving school first, But everybody go dey form. How person go dey drive car with speed and go still dey use double pointer?(Double Trafficator or Emergency light). This na y I reason am say make I  tell una wen to use  double Pointer.something happen one day wey I dey drive jejeli, I con see one red car dey come With speed with  double Pointer, I con give am space make e pass  thinking say na person life they wan safe. The car pass with speed but I con still meet this same car park for front of one shop wey Dem dey sell provision. Na  for that same shop I dey go buy some drinks for myself, I con use style check if person dey inside the car but e shock me say  nobody dey the car, na  just boys way dy catch cruise. This one show say some people never still no when to use double Pointer, the thing vex me  because if to say I no give dem space those guys go hit me the speed too much . This double pointer wey people dey use  fit bring confusion and e fit lead to accident.     Watin be double pointer (Emergency Light)? Na very important safety feature wey dey for cars. The double trafficator na to make other drivers know say you get problem with your car or emergencies. Na why most officials cars or ambulance dey on am when dem dey rush.A driver fit use Double pointer :   1. When car Breakdown:When your car break down for road, you fit on the double pointer so that other driver go known say car dey road and something dey wrong.  2. Emergencies: This one dey very important.the double pointer na emergency signal already But some other road users no really dey respect this, when you see car wey dey speed and e dey  use double pointer, e mean say  na emergency even tho some fit no be  serious  emergencies but it still show say that  motor need space.So, my people e dy very important to know say, emergency lights na for only when e dey too important like  caution or  for emergency.  so, make we no dey use emergency lights  anyhow, because e fit confuse other drivers and fit lead to accidents.",

      "body": "The thing be to say,  the way we Dey Drive for Naija dey different from the way we the drive for the abroad,  simply because for Naija we believe say na our land and at the same time we know to say law no too dey effective for this country and for that,  many time some Nigerians drive in a way that you can't imagine even if they attend driving school so that is just the Nigeria mentality in them and reason why you as a road user need to be an expert in your driving skills. Let me tell you what I do while driving, I try as much as possible to drive rightly and also will not give way to just anybody who is just behind me for whatever reason,  as long as I am driving within the speed limit for that lane because some Nigerians can be funny at times.",

It dey happen well well for Naija and mostly na simply because law no dey upholded for the country, thus many people buying cars and plying the road without properly learning how to drive as well as knowing the road basics as a motorist.",
