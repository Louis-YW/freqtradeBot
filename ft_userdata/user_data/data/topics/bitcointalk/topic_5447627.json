  "content": "Who would have thought Chipmixer was going to have such faith? But shutting down chipmixer opened a wide door for many others.In short time we witnessed mixers started to show off their BTC and trying to attract clients. They are coming with huge marketing budgets. Some are even relaunching their old campaigns, while it looks they are struggling with their marketing budget. Unijoin, MixTum are some examples. At least looking at their signature budget it's not clear that they have enough. May be they have in reserve but they are not going aggressive and quickly discover running out of reserve.On the other hand the newest one whirlwind is trying to spread an idea that they have huge and they wants to fill the gap as quick as they can. At least their weekly budget for signature campaign, $40K escrow for review campaign shows some money.And there are these others who already made a decent name even when Chipmixer existed. Sinbad, Coinomize, Yo!Mix falls into the category. The new relaunch of Mixero shows some new promise too. They have budgets which is not aggressive nor something to ignore too. At least Sinbad seems ahead of the game than everyone else. But it became obvious the next chipmixer will be the one who will be able to stay in the race for longer time. Question remains, who is going to win it?A. The ones who seems to have struggling with marketing budget.B. The ones who seem balancing but have good reserve.C. The ones who is showing off their wealth and may be they have a good reserve too.It would be nice to know who have how much btc in reserve. At least Foxpup can do a math if he wants his own mixer",

The ones who is showing off their wealth and may be they have a good reserve too.If people see a mixer that shows its reserve of many bitcoin, like 100 or more bitcoins, this will make people to trust the mixer more as they know the mixer have the money it can use for mixing. Mixers showing big reserve is a good strategy to gain people's trust. Also the ones with a better campaign is a good strategy to this forum members and visitors to be enticed to use the mixer.",

At this point it's not that difficult to make or advertise a mixing service if you have any idea of how to approach it but the problem is keeping it running without problems. Some torrent sites were raided and shut down but others like 1337.to keep running for years and they just switch domains when one gets blocked. If the mixing service manages to stay alive for a year or two it's going to be popular and profitable. That's the way I see it. It's no different with crypto exchanges. You don't scam and you don't get yourself arrested for a few years and you're going to have a popular business worth a lot of money.

Really hard to say about which of them will fill the gap on Chipmixers absence while there are so many new pop up and introduce their new mixers launched. Maybe for now we can't say which of them are best to use since they are earning their reputation and do some cool marketing but for sure in span of years if one of them exist for long time then it indicates that they are the best option to use by people who frequently use mixers services.",

Give it a few weeksIf I had to guess it'd be the newer campaigns that would be the most likely to dry up. So in that sense Sinbad, Yo!Mix and Coinomize are probably safe bets to continue long-term, maybe even Mixero, but this one is probably more dependant on how successful the signature campaign is since the fall of ChipMixer. As for Whirlwind, MixTum and UniJoin that are all new, we will have to see how it plays in long-term.

I never trusted the quasi-monopoly that ChipMixer had on this forum to be honest, it always seemed like a single/centralised point of failure, even if that statement isn't entirely accurate.Now there is a handful of different options it seems a lot healthier at least. More effort for LE to target them as it'd require more investigations, and they only have so many investigators/cases, so more likely they'd target only 1 or 2 - the ones that are considered to have some weak link or thread of intelligence to tug on - which means there will already be enough competition to continue without much negative effect.",
