If all companies and people associated with crypto take such steps, world will become a better place. It will cost them in millions but I believe that in long run it will give much higher returns to them financially also because of two reasons. The people getting this airdrop in this hard times will become regular and loyal users for Binance. A lot of other users will also use Binance now because this news will create branding for the exchange. What is your reaction to this news ?",

But I think it’s more appropriate to donate the funds on the NGO (like @Neuroticfish mention above) that helps victim rather than airdrop them to the victim itself since probably most of lost their home including their devices for them to claim this airdrop. I know that CZ do this kind of publicity for the sake of his business and crypto but he can do better by giving the reward to the user to the form which they can access it immediately. There’s a lot of death toll on this tragic event and maybe there’s a chance that some airdrop recipients is already dead.",

While the POA method has its limitations and inaccuracies, it is the best method we have available for us to locate potentially impacted users.

While Binance take this as an opportunity to promote in the country, the people who are also in Turkey I think will be grateful for this. They could withdraw if they want. To be honest, this is way better than sending it to a donation address that we don't know if it goes to the earthquake victims.",

I agree that centralized exchanges are an issue the community still needs to solve, but as you said in this case it seems to be a positive thing.  Hopefully the funds aren't being sent in BNB, as that would be in poor taste and something that FTX would have done.  As you stated though, in the end the people get $100 which will probably not be life changing for anyone, but may help them get through this tough time until some real help can be sent their way.  Having funds sent directly to the people is a bit of a unique angle on a disaster that you don't see much and it's good that Binance is using their information to try and do good for people.  Hopefully those using fake regions for trading via VPNs aren't going to dip into this fund.",
