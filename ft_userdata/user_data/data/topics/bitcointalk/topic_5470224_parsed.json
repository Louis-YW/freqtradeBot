      "body": "To sum it all up, a key strategy for safeguarding oneself from scams involves acquiring sound knowledge and adopting effective preventive measures. Often, alot of people become victims not due to a lack of awareness but rather because of their choice to disregard potential threats, believing that they are immune to fraud or phishing attempts. The escalating prevalence of cybercrime in our society today, brings about the urgency of this concern for anyone who intends to preserving the safety and security of their financial assets.",

No offense, all the information you provided is 100% true. The only problem was is you are just stating the obvious here which is already discussed many times in multiple occasions.",

It doesn't mean that have difficulty with someone, but in the world that we live in crypto, you have to think that anyone is here to scam you, so it's better to be safe than sorry. Not sure if he have been scam before, because the feeling is not pleasant. And just stay up to date, your anti-virus, anti-phishing toolbar and check every website that you visit. And yes, be very vigilant of your online credentials as well and not just to give it out easily as scammers can used your personal data without you knowing it.",

Learning is a non technical approach to getting technical knowledge. People who own bitcoins should not allow the fear of learning make them not try to learn technical ways and security measures against scammers. Another one is learning to control your greed, because greed can make you easily be victims of scams.",

A few days ago I received a message on my number where a scammer send me a bank transaction message with an amount 5000 in my local currency. After a few minutes I received a call from an unknown number and it was no one else but the scammer. He said that he has sent the money unintentionally on my account and asked me to resend the money on his account.He said that he was trying to send the money to his family members in order to support them but it was mistakenly sent to my account. But fortunately I was aware about such scammers and I logged into my bank account to see that if I had received any amount on my account but I didn't received anything and I told him that I didn't received any amount from you and also said to him that I know scammers like you who use such tactics to scam others. The guy cut the call and turned off his number. Those scammers are everywhere and if we aren't aware about them then they can cause huge harm to us. The strange thing I noticed about that scammer is that he know how much money I had in my account and he send an amount that I had in my account.",

Firstly we should avoid centralized wallets or platforms because this can easily lead to loss of funds. Use open-sourced decentralized wallets and your seed phrase and password are sensitive,  it should be handled secretly and carefully. We should also learn not to click on unusual links, every piece of information should be verified. Let's always watch out for phishing scams through social media and emails. It is also important to avoid greed because scammers promise tempting rewards that are difficult to refuse. Don't invest in a project that promises huge profit, this is a sign of a scam project.",

This in itself would help you stay up-to-date with the latest scam projects or new techniques and strategies used by hackers. In one of the crypto WhatsApp group which I am involved in , we were told that one of the crypto websites had been hacked and these hackers were sending emails to users of that platform. We were warned not to open or interact with my email from that website. If I had not been a part of this community, maybe I would have fallen a victim but  being a part of the group made me learn of the hack earlier and did my best to adhere to the instructions.

I don't think that a bank's customer support would provide such data to scammers but anything can happen these days. What came into my mind is that the scammer might be someone who works at that bank and has data of the customers. The banks hire anyone these days and they don't really care much about the customers. Ah, once again we got another reason to love Bitcoin. You're right, I have been dealing with such scammers for a long time and that's why I know their tactics but those who don't have proper knowledge and awareness about such scams can fall into the trap of those scammers. The scammers mostly targeted educationally weak people because they such people are easy targets for them. Well, I agree with you the ones who offer you high returns are mostly scammers. In fact these days scammers are so smart that it would be really difficult to know who's a scammer and who isn't one. But, if we have knowledge and awareness then they won't be able to get success in their negative intentions.",
