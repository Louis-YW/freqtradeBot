But many are against the use of POW Consensus on the Bitcoin blockchain, they say that the use of POW energy is greater and more wasteful, and also has an impact on the environment. But in fact, currently, the use of large renewable energy has begun to be implemented. And also some issues about triggering Global warming have also been broken with the use of more environmentally friendly energy. Pros and cons will still exist, Bitcoin still maintains the POW consensus because it becomes Bitcoin's identity, is decentralized, and cannot be changed. The POW Consensus mechanism was introduced by Hal Finney in 2004 and first used by Satoshi Nakamoto on Bitcoin in 2009.But the OP also forgot to include the Proof Of History (PoH) Consensus used by Blockchain Solana, this consensus system was created to solve the time problem on the blockchain by encoding each passing time into the blockchain technology. After that, the system will provide historical data of every activity that occurs on the blockchain within a certain time. This process uses an algorithm called Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF).https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-history-and-how-does-it-work/",

Also a private business might be this central authority in this \"centralised consensus\". Central authority often has an opportunity to build a monopoly and squeeze more revenue out of the market.",

That said, it only really makes sense to have one proof of work blockchain cuz only one is going to be highly secure.PoS is fine for companies making centralized projects where they do their fundraising by selling the tokens. And that is where the rest of the crypto world has gone.Both have their uses and are useful for very different things.The rest are rather rare.",

Proof Of Capacity works in a way that if Youtube wanted, they would conquer the the POC coins in a single day because of their massive storages. I don't know much about the rest of consensus types you've listed.Overall, the most popular and widely used ones are Proof Of Work and Proof Of Stake. I don't like the idea of Proof Of Stake because it's very capitalistic, like, the one who holds the most, benefits the most and remains the top almost forever, untill his stakes are high. Proof of Work, on another hand, is more competitive and the more you put in, the more you get out, like Rich Piana said once.",

Perhaps some of them are really useful for a very specific type of task, and therefore no one uses them, but rather, they simply did not show their convenience or other important qualities.So let's just look at what types of consensus have succeeded.PoW perfectly proves its success in that Bitcoin is powered by it and still remains the main decentralized digital currency.PoS is the easiest to use and most common among altcoins, we see it because the vast majority of new projects choose it, despite all its shortcomings.",

In every choice of consensus that you make, you have to forfeit one thing in order to enjoy the other. The reason I love the PoW is it's total decentralized nature, while other concensus types have tried to prove that they are decentralized, there has always been some form of decentralization in one way or the other.I have sometimes wished that bitcoin migrates to prove of stake because of the energy consumption concern, but the most important thing (decentralization) would be lost.I am in with these two, no matter there number of recent consensus QuoteNowadays we have so many different consensus types, like:- PROOF OF WORK- PROOF OF STAKE",
