  "content": "What would cause this to happen?Chips state is \"normal\" yet the board wont hash.https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0699/5971/3078/files/error.jpgI tried to reset to factory defaults, updated the firmware, physically unplugged it to reboot. Still no improvement.I took it apart yesterday to blow out all the dust. The board started woking for about 10hours before it dropped again.This miner is only a few months old. It was purchased from a Bitmain dealer and the box was sealed. It only had a few months left of warranty.",

Post it here but make sure to put them all inside the insert code tag before you post. So that we can troubleshoot the issue.",

Post it here but make sure to put them all inside the insert code tag before you post. So that we can troubleshoot the issue.How do my logs look? I can't make sense of it. lol",

Load/reload the latest firmware update from bitmain's website.Number one worked for me last week when I had a similar seemingly fine log that simply didn't want to hadh but that machine was new to me, yours was running fine.",
