  "content": "Last weekend I was playing with my daughter at home. She has been interested in playing jigsaw puzzles so she asked me to play with her. Of course I'd love to. To be honest, I am not really a jigsaw puzzle player and always nervous about assembling the irregular shaped pieces, although usually there is a complete picture like a guide aside. Unfortunately that complete picture of my daughter's jigsaw puzzle was gone so I had to figure out all the pieces together all by myself. In the beginning, I had no clue at all. I thought a while and decided to take one puzzle with the corner first and then tried to find some clue according to the small picture to get the next piece match. To my surprise, after struggling for a bit of time, I did it ! I managed to get the whole picture of the puzzles and my daughter was thrilled.  That night I suddenly realized that managing finances and assembling jigsaw puzzles are very much similiar. At start, we have/set a goal. The first step is not easy to make and usually you have to figure out on you own. There is nothing wrong with taking whatever as your first step but you have to find a clue to continue the next step to lead to the whole picuture/goal. In the process of assembling/working, you will be lost most of time but stay focused and patient, you just need to find that useful clue to the closest picture and then you'll be good. As you progress, the complete picture is getting clearer and bigger, you feel excited and more certain about the decisions you made. All you have to do now is follow the lead and contiue, when the last puzzle piece is perfectly matched, success is yours. See finance in my explanation ? Replace all pieces with finances, it'll be great as well. I hope each of us will figure out all clues to the complete picture. Make your finance puzzles complete !",

It is common for humans to draw analogies between some activities and others, but the way you see it is far from being the only one. For me, more than a puzzle, it is a straight path, a list of 7 easy-to-follow points (https://www.ramseysolutions.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps):Step 1: Start an Emergency Fund ($1K).Step 2: Get rid of consumer debt.Step 3: Complete Your Emergency Fund (3-6 months of expenses)Step 4: Save for Retirement (15% of your household income).Step 5: Save for College Funds.Step 6: Pay Off Your House.Step 7: Build Wealth.See how easy it is.",

      "body": "Depends on how you view finance, but certainly is you will have to learn that everything is connected. All thoss little puzzles are big enough to impact the larger picture of things. In terms of finance, once you accumulated enough money, it is no longer enough for you to save, earn more and invest, it is because along those lines you will certainly find your self slowly learning the mechanics on how money is generated and ciculated. This is one thing I have learned in a hard way. I may not be intelligent in terms of handling my finances but I've realized that I literally needed to learn these things for me move forward. Mostly, for people like us who didn't have a coach and have to start from scratches, we are sure to find this hard and have to handle these things on our own. It is also the time where the transition of your principle begins from learning to earning and goes back to learning.",

      "body": "Your analogy is interesting and I can see the picture you are painting. But I want to relate it to investing and building a business. Starting a business is very difficult because one have to engage in so many activities like planning, seeking funds, choosing a location, employing staff, advertising, and seeking customers. But as you strive to settle these issues one after another, the business becomes easy to manage or run. That is why every investor must be patient and persistent at the beginning of the business without that the business will underperform or even collapse.Quote from: Marcellin9 on April 11, 2023, 03:21:25 AMThanks a lot, both for your comment and the reminder,haha.

And that is the very definition of life itself, we really don't know what the future holds, what we have right now is just one piece of the puzzle. And we have to find out how each and everyone will fit into our life.Just like in financials, hard to manage our wealth and money and those who can, are just a small percentage and they become very successful in life.While the rest of us struggles to even earn a decent money, be it in job, or businesses and then we have a lot of debts to settle. So that's life and it takes a lot to be able to fit each and every jigsaw puzzle.",

Make your finance puzzles complete !You will realize that the game will sharpen your mind to think more logically, I get this moment in a chess game, where we always rely on the pawn for the king's deadly Staregi. The pawn movement is indeed slower and can only move one step, but at certain times the king's position will be pinched only because of one step we move. Likewise the way we manage finances, when we do not have a long -term strategy and preparation, the amount of money we have will actually be used up in conditions that are not needed.The small pieces that you mean will be collected in increased amounts, when you put in some places of money and most of us think to place on one concept without thinking about some of the posts another place for far greater and more stable opportunities, so that one failure will be destroy everything even though there are some places worth trying?1.
