What the article tries to narrate is Saudi Arabia’s attempt to sell part of the oil in Chinese yuan, because the volume of oil exchange (the largest buyer of oil) is China, but this risk has It affects the global economy because the dollar is its currency because of the term petrodollar.In general, I do not expect it to develop into more than buying some bonds.",

Naturally, if crypto appears to carry a potential for post oil prosperity, they will also be likely to embrace it. It is possible that the FTX scandal opened a lot of eyes to the wealth and prosperity crypto can produce. Considering what crypto did for SBF. Imagine what it could do in the hands of others. Having millions of spare cash to throw at ape NFTs, clothing lines, and whatever other random projects FTX funded. It has to attract ambitious and wealthy personalities looking for the next big thing.There could be another motive for saudi embracing crypto. As inflation hits many global economies, many are seeking assets which could serve as stablecoins for large transactions involving things like energy and oil. We have seen this with ghana seeking to denominate oil transactions in gold to insulate itself from inflation decimating FOREX exchange rates. It is possible that saudi arabia will explore the potential to denominate oil transactions in gold or perhaps even crypto, if it appears to be a worthwhile pursuit. Who can say what their motives or plans are.",

But this does not necessarily mean that they're keen in using crypto. These oil states can honestly last for a couple more decades hoarding a lot of wealth in exchange for their oil, and they could shift into other source of wealth before then, and I don't see bitcoin or any other crypto fulfilling that goal for them honestly.",

I won't be surprised if crypto as an alternative is actively being discussed. But it's highly unlikely to become a reality. The simple reason is it's volatility. For a country who are solely dependent of the sales of oil and natural gas, won't gamble on such highly volatile asset. Most probably the OPEC plus countries will go ahead with a multi currency setup in future where major economies will be granted allowance to use their own currency to purchase oil and gas from Saudi Arabia. Let's hope it happens and let's hope US doesn't wage another war on this issue!",

This has zero to do with crypto and more to do with diversifying their currency holdings away from the US dollar as others have said. It can be hard to comprehend the figures involved, but cryptocurrencies simply cannot cope with the volumes of trade that are taking place at a global level. It needs to be comfortable with carving out a niche in something like the exchange or remuneration market, i.e. avoiding large bank fees to transport funds across borders and allowing overseas workers to send money back to their family while paying minimal commission to middlemen. Saudi is also definitely not a pioneer of freedoms so you should be more concerned than happy if they decide to follow the crypto route.",

This has made different nations devise various means of outsmarting competitors. Bitcoin and others are viable alternative sources of payment that give a nation an edge over others. One of the beauties of bitcoin is that it is stateless which means that it is not issued or controlled by any government. This attribute makes it a neutral universal currency that can be used in international trade. Russia or Iran might not want to trade with the dollar because of the face-off they have with the US but they can comfortably trade with bitcoin. The Saudi-US relationship has not been cordial because of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and some other misrule by Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the crown Prince. The Saudi government is gradually withdrawing its alliance with the US because they feel they are not getting the right attention.  The government of Saudi Arabia is not unfriendly to bitcoin because the currency is not facing any ban in that nation. There are bitcoin ATMs and some exchanges operate freely in that country. Saudi Arabia is the leading force in the Arab World. Other Arab nations are directly or indirectly influenced by the policies of Saudi Arabia. Choosing bitcoin as a payment option in trade would have a positive effect on the bitcoin market.",
