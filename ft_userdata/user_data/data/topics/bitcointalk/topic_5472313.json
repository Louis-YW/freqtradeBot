      "body": "If your question is about the speed of how transactions are getting confirmed with the corresponding low or empty mempool then it is base on the fact that the ordinal inscriptions that were congesting the mempool are been dropped or we can also say people are not making more transactions as low transactions can also cause it. Concerning the speed, the default time to get a transaction to be confirmed is 10 minutes although it varies. And as you have rightly said the minerâ€™s prioritizes transactions base on fee rate so the f you wish to get your transaction into the next block then use the higher fees estimated my those links shared above. Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on October 31, 2023, 11:08:29 AM it takes nothing more than 5 minutes to get confirmed, despite you might have received 25 blocks before confirmation, This is not actually a standard, the default is 10 minutes which is adjusted by the difficulty every 2016 blocks base on the average time takes to get the target value by miners in the 2015 blocks",

Mempool is not empty at the moment but it's not full either. I don't now if there is a website where you can see how empty or full mempool is but you can view a good statistics on Blockchair.com.At the moment you can see that you need to pay 6 satoshi/byte to get your transaction confirmed in next black. This indicates that mempool is not full and you can relax. When transaction fee is 1 satoshi/byte, it's a clear indicator that mempool is really empty. When fee is 20 satoshi or 100-200 satoshi, this indicates that mempool is full.",

You can see a block that is mined just less than 2, 3, 4...9 minutes after the last block mined and it might surpass 10 minutes at times. Another thing is that if the next block is mined 8 minutes ago, and you make transaction with higher fee that can make the transaction to be confirmed in the next block, if another block will be mined in the next 1 or 2 minutes, that means your transaction does not take more than 1 or 2 minutes to have 1 confirmation as it is included in the next block.",

Currently, you can get fast confirmation with the fee rate of only 2-3 sat/vbyte, but the mempool of any node with default setting is full and that's why they purge any transaction with the fee rate of less than 1.36 sat/vbyte. mempool.space",

And if I remember correctly, a few months back we were caught by the big hype of BRC-20 inscriptions, causing the fees to spike. But we all know that this kind of hype won't do damage to Bitcoin's network in the long run. We give them some time and when finally the hype goes down, the fees are back to normal and we can all send at least from 1 - sat/vByte being confirmed without any delays.But as I have said, it could be different when the bull run arrives as there could be a lot of transactions and everyone wanted to go first in the line and might increased their fees to get confirmations.",

I have personally talked about Trezor team about their software to estimate the best fee to be paid by their users and how I was being suggested a 14 sat/b fee but thanks to Joe hoe I could get my transacciÃ³n through for 2-3 sat/b. It seems what most developers do is to get an average maximum, medium and minimum transaction for a fixed period of time and offer it as a reference to their users.",
