The loan was collateral and that's why you gave the repayment. But there is no proof and I cat believe that you may give the repayment of a loan collateral loan. If you really need the loan then you could ask for collateral again and again or you could sell the collateral.Quote from: bitbollo on January 30, 2023, 08:24:34 PMThere is no track of this loan repaidOp repaid a loan to me but that loan was given by taking collateral.",
