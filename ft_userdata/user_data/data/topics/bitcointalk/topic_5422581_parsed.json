People have said they wanted to stop betting and gambling many times than they can count, but they are still betting today, something keeps bringing them back. As you lost today, some other people won from that same game and will happily tell people about how they bet on this game and won. That kind of story can be tempting and can make someone who doesn't bet to want to bet, or someone who wants to stop gambling to want to continue.",

Well, this is life and gambling. I feel bad about what happened to you. 2-1 in favor of Saudi Arabia. When you've been winning with your former bets, make sure that you're securing a part of those profits so that even if you lost the next bets you make, you've taken a part of it.This may be another worst day for you but just let the day pass and you'll eventually forget about this day as you need to move on so that you'll set your emotion and mind again properly.",

You said this yesterday but you have to understand that football is a game luck, there is no best team in the game of football. If you see what Saudi Arabia played today you would understand that football is not by profession. Messi could not played anything. Saudi Arabia team was very strong in physical attacks and was good in the defense. The first goal that scored by Messi made Saudi Arabia team to be very strong and attacked . Argentina was playing offside match and the trap was set by Saudi Arabia defense. Argentina was not wise enough to notice that plan. They were just playing to score while they were in a very serious trap. I believed they have learn their lesson. Let see their next match.",

Is the bet that you have made big enough for Argentina? It is truly unbelievable that the national team that we are championing has suffered such a crushing defeat. I also bet on Argentina but for a small amount, so I'm not too disappointed, the only thing that disappointed me was the team's performance. This is football, the Saudi Arabia national team was able to show that they can compete. if the not disallowed destination was official your story might be different. It's okay if you're going to take a break to cool off from the bet. Because psychologically you must be quite depressed. In big stakes, especially the world cup, there are still many people who lose more than you have. Back to the initial setup, the bet doesn't force you, you come with your own awareness of the agreed risk.",

You've made two mistakes; betting all in and depending too much on gambling. No matter how obvioud the advantage is, on your bet, it will always be better to bet an amount that you can endure losing. It might be at the edge but this is gambling man; anything can happen, such as the unexpected. Also, I think you are hoping that much to win big time (well not to be a hypocrite, for sure many gamblers as well but to be that upset is something). It is okay to hope for a better outcome, we all do. But always have a plan B. Bet only without expectations that it will make you rich. Bet because you just want to win. The higher your expectations are, the bigger its impact on your end. Much better to just play it safely. Rest if you need it, come back if you still want to.",

I know what you mean. Nobody expected Saudi Arabia to gain the upper hand over Argentina. But moments like these do happen, rarely, but they do happen. Just like when Germany scored 7 goals against Brasil. You would have thought that there was no way Brasil would have been such an easy win, but it was one. Whenever one of these \"miracles\" happen, I usually think to myself: Perhaps these matches are fixed? But in the end we have to accept our losses over these freak events and move on with our lives.Better luck next time!",

Ohh that is really to bad to hear, OP. I guess this is the sign where you should take a break from gambling. Well, even if sportsbetting has a lower chance of losing compared to other kinds of gambling method (e.g. cards, slots, etc.), I guess the odds are not in your favour today.You deserve to take the break and rest. The system is slowly eating your insanity. I do commend you OP for deciding to stop since most gamblers tend to gamble again whenever they experience a loss in hopes of recovering it. Take a break and explore other options of entertainment for the meantime!",
