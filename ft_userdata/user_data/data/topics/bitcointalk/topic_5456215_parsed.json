  "content": "Let’s consider some scenarios where the price of BTCitcoin is $100The BTC² Perpetual Index is calculated based on the squared price of BTC.To calculate the value of the BTC² Perpetual Index imagine BTC is trading at $ 100, we simply square the BTC price:BTC² Index Value = (BTC Price)²BTC² Index Value = ($ 100)²BTC² Index Value = $ 10,000So, when BTC is trading at $ 100, the BTC² Perpetual Index will be valued at $ 10,000.The BTC² Perpetual Index is designed to provide exposure to the second-order market movements of Bitcoin (BTC) without directly trading the underlying asset. It offers advantages over traditional leverage products in terms of both risk and returns.Let’s explore the two scenarios provided to understand how the BTC² Perpetual Index outperforms 2x leverage.Scenario one: BTC² Perpetual Index vs. 2x Leverage PositionIn this scenario, a trader opens a 2x leverage position on Bitcoin when its price is $100. This means the trader effectively controls $200 worth of BTC. On the other hand, another trader takes a position on the BTC² Perpetual Index when BTC is at $100 without using any leverage. The BTC² Index Value, reflecting the squared price of BTC, would be $10,000.If the BTC price increases by 10% to $110, the 2x leverage position would result in holdings of $220, reflecting a 20% increase. However, the BTC² Index Value would be $12,100, reflecting a 21% increase.Thus, the trader who took a long position on the BTC² Perpetual Index would enjoy a higher return compared to the 2x leverage position without having any liquidation price.Similarly, if the BTC price triples to $300, the 2x leverage position would triple to $600, while the BTC² Index Value would be $90,000, representing a ninefold increase.Once again, the BTC² Perpetual Index outperforms the 2x leverage position in terms of returns.By directly tracking the squared price of BTC, the BTC² Perpetual Index eliminates the risks associated with liquidation and the costs of borrowing associated with leveraged positions. It provides a more straightforward and transparent way to gain exposure to the second-order price movements, offering traders a more stable and secure trading experience.Scenario two: BTC² Perpetual Index vs. Conventional Leverage Product during Market DropIn this scenario, the focus is on risk management during a market drop of 50%. With a conventional leverage product such as 2x leverage, losses are too magnified by 2x. If the BTC price drops by 50%, the 2x leverage position would lose 100% of its value, resulting in a complete loss for the trader.However, with the BTC² Perpetual Index, the index value would also experience decline 75% as the BTC price drops to $ 50 the Perpetual Index is now worth $ 50² that is $2,500 . The important thing to note here is there is no extra money in the trade moreover the Value of BTC² only goes to Zero when BTC goes to Zero.The funding mechanism of the BTC² Perpetual Index plays a crucial role in managing risk during market drops. The funding payments exchanged between long and short positions help stabilize the index price and mitigate the impact of extreme price movements.Unlike conventional leverage products that can expose traders to liquidation and complete loss during a market drop, the BTC² Perpetual Index offers a more robust risk management approach. Traders can maintain their positions, manage their risk exposure, and have a better chance of recovering from market downturns.In summary, the BTC² Perpetual Index provides a more straightforward and transparent way to gain exposure to the second-order market movements of Bitcoin (BTC). It outperforms traditional leverage products by eliminating liquidation risks, reducing borrowing costs, and offering better risk management during volatile market conditions.Website: http://betterbarter.io/ ( test-net is live, Claim free gETH and WBTC on the website to try the test-net )Join the Community,Twitter: https://twitter.com/0xBetterBarterDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/aD8Wtk4fNs",

Arbitrage opportunity can exist with exchanges order book, not directly connected to do with the protocol, under the protocol we will have market makers who will help settle trades if there is less liquidity available, ofcourse when arbitrage opportunity/risk is too high market makers will make sure it is a close to actual value so there is no uncertain premium/discount to traders.",

      "body": "So the current Bitcoin Perpetual Index price would be 25,960 USD multiplied by 25,960 USD which is 673 921 600 USD.From what I understand here, you want to create(and probably sell) a financial derivative, that is correlated to the price of Bitcoin.Who is going to buy such BTC perpetual index shares at 673 million USD.Can't the traders just use 100x leverage instead of this Perpetual Index(I know that this is extremely risky and not many exchanges offer 100x leverage)? I also don't understand how this index would reduce the risks.I have the feeling that you want to create some kind of magical financial instrument, which offers gigantic profits and reduced loses. This would never happen in the real world.",

So its not a problem.Quote from: davis196 on June 14, 2023, 10:32:38 AMCan't the traders just use 100x leverage instead of this.x100 leverage is going to rect you after 1% dump. ^2 will not even after 50% dump. So its a complete different type of deal.Quote from: davis196 on June 14, 2023, 10:32:38 AMI have the feeling that you want to create some kind of magical financial instrument, which offers gigantic profits and reduced loses.

How are you going to charge those fees from token hodlers? I guess funding gonna be high to compensate wird type of arbitrage. Not many will do that.How the initial distribution is going to look like?",

BTC² can be a great instrument for hedging and creating advanced trading strategies if used correctly. The Implied volatility data set for BTC² can be a completely new approach against derivates.

But there is a big concern on my side about the liquidity of the btc you have whether it's enough to cover all the trades if suddenly everyone does.It is not 2 time to price of BTC, it is multiple price by itself, for e.g. if the price of btc is $ 25,000 ; the Squared price would be $ 625,000,000. Mark price is calculated using this formula to create a lower denomination of the, e.g. $ 625M ( live price ) price so that it is accessible to trade with as little as $ 1 : BBBTC price = Mark price * Norm factor /10000We will be having Market Makers to cover the Liquidity gaps, but liquidity is obviously very important and that is an issue that can occur for any consolidated liquidity derivate, We're aware of it and in the future when we launch Mainnet we will also provide self liquidity ( Not to profit from fee but to keep buy/sell prices close, this will help LPs to have more predictable trades which will help attract more LPs ) with Market Making so any unpredictable event can be reduced as much as possible.",
