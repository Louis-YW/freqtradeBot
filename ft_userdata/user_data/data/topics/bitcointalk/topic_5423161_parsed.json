  "content": "It seems that we will see this fight happening in 2023, no date yet, but according to Plant, he has signed the contract already.https://twitter.com/SweetHandsPlant/status/1588279180281532417Plant is riding on a momentum of his great knockout against Anthony Dirrell last month,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxF5cu7fG3UBenavidez, on the other hand is a two-time former WBC super middleweight champion, never lost the belt to any fighter though. It was all his wrong doing, first he lost the title when he was tested positive for cocaine. And then after getting back the title, he lost it again this time to Roamer Alexis Angulo as he can't make the weight.Benavidez wanted to go and fight Canelo Alvarez, but the camp of Canelo says no, as they want him to proved himself. So maybe if he beat Plant worst than Canelo beat him, he might gain some respect and could potentially face Alvarez in the future.What are your thoughts on this fight?",

It was all his wrong doing, first he lost the title when he was tested positive for cocaine. What are your thoughts on this fight?Cocaine can damage the heart. Causing it to pump less blood. Resulting in reduced oxygenation. Causing athletes to fatigue faster than normal.I think Canelo fought Caleb Plant thinking he would be an easy payday. While avoiding David Benavidez for him being too dangerous. Benavidez should be the clear favorite to win this fight assuming that he hasn't damaged his body too much with a cocaine addiction. If Benavidez did a lot of cocaine his cardio could be bad. I think cocaine can also negatively affect an athlete's timing. As it is known to have an effect on that part of the brain. If Benavidez did a lot of coke I would bet on Caleb Plant if he was a clean athlete.Other athletes whose cocaine addictions negatively affected their fighting careers are names like Melvin Guillard. Its much more common than people think.",

Going back to when Caleb Plant faces Canelo Alvarez, he lose in an 11th Round TKO and the majority of those rounds turned Plant into a punching bag. I don't know if this guy know each other personally, but the hatred that David has against Caleb.Probably it goes down when they are still starting and most likely has crossed path and then sooner or later this two has to fight. Although Plant has lost to Alvarez, Benavidez was being denied by Alvarez.QuoteOn whether David Benavidez “counts” as a Mexican fighter he wouldn’t want to face“I don’t know. Anything can happen. ... When I say I don’t want to fight Mexicans, it’s because I represent Mexico. That’s why. But I don’t care. I’ll fight anybody. All my entire life — anybody. ... I hear (Benavidez’s) dad talking a lot of shit, but what has he accomplished? Nothing. (He’s beaten) one single champion, Anthony Dirrell. Please. ... Don’t lack respect when you talk about me. I’ve faced the best out there and never ducked anyone.”https://www.badlefthook.com/2022/9/18/23358966/canelo-discusses-win-golovkin-takes-shots-david-benavidez-boxing-news-2022So yes, I do agree that if he put a beating on Caleb Plant, he should get the respect from Alvarez and better if they will step up for another mega fight in this division.",

Well, that's easier said than done because Caleb Plant was also a solid fighter, he was able to last in the fight against Canelo who is a superstar.  David Benavidez maybe undefeated with 23 KOs from 26 fights but Caleb was also undefeated when he fought Canelo, I think both of these fighters are not yet on the level of Canelo.",

Yes, nevertheless if I were Benavidez, I will still talking about Canelo, he should get past Caleb Plant as this is not that easy. Although Benavidez has the power, Caleb looks look against Dirrell, there are times that he was hit by Anthony with 5 or 6 combo, but he was able to dodge this shots.So I also don't see how he will beat Plant here or as he says even worst than Canelo.But age is on his age, and probably that's why he is going to used here, he will be very busy with volume punching and hopefully, one or two punches will get Plant.",

There’s really a chance that he is dodging this fight due to personal reason but I think that’s because he want to fight a boxer with a clean career and serious on boxing. Benavidez show many unprofessional characteristics that made him lose his belt. There’s no glory for Canelo to defeat a man like this since he has nothing to lose while Canelo will be put on a lot of shame if he will beaten by a problematic boxer like this.He knew that Benavidez has the potential to become a good contender that’s why Canelo is giving him a chance to prove his worth and face Canelo win professional way. I agree on this because challenge should be earned by good track record including ethics on the sports. Selling tickets for a match that includes boxer that is known caught for using a cocaine and forfeiting the match will give some negative effect to the fight image.",

I am referring to his PBC stablemates Caleb Plant and Jermall Charlo who's been calling Canelo over the years but are scared to fight each other and to Benavidez. Benavidez is not a technical fighter like Plant and Charlo, but he is gifted with heavy hands, an iron chin and he is huge in his division. At 25 years old, this kid will have the strength and stamina to brawl for 12 rounds until its opponents cannot take it anymore. I am starting to like Plant but I believe Benavidez will stop him. Only the referee can make Plant survives the full 12 rounds if it allows him to grab, clinch and hug too much.",

Although we cannot really say and confirm that Canelo is ducking on him because the latter is quite busy climbing the light-heavyweight but if David will pull an upset this time, I bet his next foe will be Canelo.",
