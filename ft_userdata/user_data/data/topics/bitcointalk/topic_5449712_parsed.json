  "content": "Family should be put first in whatever engagement that we are involved in. Putting work or business (money) first before one's family should be discouraged. Some persons see riches as rest of mind and happiness, as long as they can provide for their needs. On the other hand some people see riches as properties and investment, this is what makes people who fall in this category see money as everything. So many homes are broken and so many marriages crashed out because the husband and wife give more time to their source of income rather than their spouse. Instead of creating little time to spend with their families to build a stronger bond, they devote all their time to their work or business. Many fathers hardly have time for their children,even when the child has as presentation in school or has a role to play in school or church occasions, they hardly show up,all in the name of work. This shows that most fathers pay more attention on their own selfish interest not putting their family interest first.    At weekends, instead of staying at home with their families, there is always an excuse to go out and chill with friends or to have fun. Before you know it,the family value will be lacking because the head is not always around to play his role. Providing for your family is not enough as a man to show that you care for them. Sometimes their kids might end up missing the value of a father's care and advice. This attitude can also lead to the woman not comfortable with the man behavior and might file for a divorce,due to the fact that the family's love is decreasing and not increasing. When a child is raised up by a single parent his/her life wouldn't be the same if a child that was raised up with both parent.    My neighbour is so much dedicated to her work and gives less time to her husband. Her husband is very rich and has so many servants in his house,this shows that she lacks nothing and can be properly taken care of. She goes to work very early and comes home in the evening, and she wouldn't even do anything but working with her laptop. He complained to her but she didn't picture his feelings,and continued with this for long. His love for his wife started depreciating and he was tempted by his wife's friend who knows that he lacks his wife's attention and took advantage of him. Finally, he got her pregnant and had no choice but to bring her into his matrimonial home and it was then that his wife realized the shit that she caused in her home. It was too late for her to fix things, so he divorced her and got married to her friend.My little advice is that we should try and give the required time to our love ones so that the family lover will grow deeper and the family bond will be stronger. A happy man is a healthy man,and a healthy man is a productive man. There is time for everything.Gracias.",

Unfortunately, this is not the case for everyone and some may find themselves living in a fatal loneliness (I am one of them) given that my relations with the family were severed for a long time. It is not possible to determine an order of priorities that applies to all people, since our ideas differ according to our circumstances.Well, family first. But have you ever thought about what it would be like if that family did not consider you as valuable as you are? Do you think it would be useful to spend time and effort betting on a horse that most likely will fail? I don't like the idea of what is more important, family or money. Each has its merits and shortcomings, and they cannot be arranged in order of priority if they represent two vital elements in an individual's life. Personally, I do not see any of them fit to be a priority, and if I wanted one of them badly, I would accept the other despite its disadvantages.",

      "body": "To have a loving and caring family is the best thing that one needs. Being there for each other in every good and bad moments to give advice and console each other will help a lot. Another thing is that what if they don't make you happy,every time that you are with them? Will you force yourself to endure and build the love ?. No,it will be difficult to stay in such place or to be with such person. Whatever it is that you know will make you happy,either your family,or your work, you should go for it because life is short. From your story maybe your neighbour and his wife weren't made for each other,that was why the marriage didn't work.   In marriage,understanding and love play a major role in the family. Love can tolerate, endure,understand,sacrifice and so many good virtues that comes from love.",

We all have individual personal peculiarity because not everyone actually has a family and for some, the word family is just a compound word that carries no relevance or intimate relationships between the individuals involved, just like you have rightly pointed out that family should not be one-sided and it supposes to be the foundation for support of each member and care for one another that is the ideal family setting.Unlike some who do not even have a family to relate with so to them money could become the best companion and since there could get some level of happiness from what their money can aff afford become simpoimportant we set our order of priorities based on our individual differences.",

But then, it's a matter of personal choice and he should have talked again to his wife before committing cheating. Going with the family, it's true that we should value our family, we do work hard for them but also need to remember that work isn't everything but family is. As long as you get to survive and have your basic needs with your salary or from your business, don't forget to give the attention that your children and your spouse need. It wouldn't make you late to work if you spend a couple of minutes cuddling your with your spouse, talking about the weekend and places that you want to visit during your rest days.",

But always try to create a balance between both two.In some cases, the economic condition of a particular country affects the family negatively. Due to inflation, unemployment, and other economic problems, most parents are forced to work very hard to be able to pay the bills of the family. In my country jobs are difficult to get, so most employers take advantage of their employees making them overwork while they receive meager pay. My neighbor is security in fast food and he works for 14 hours but he earns less than 50 dollars a month. His wife have to turn to petty trading to enable her to support the husband to fend for their children. So most time both of them are not at home. The area I am not comfortable with is when parents prefer to spend time with friends or on phones instead of spending quality time with their children. I feel sad when parents are not giving their children quality time because they want to earn more money they can spend on luxuries. Others feel that keeping huge sums or investments for their children is better than raising them properly, so they focus on making more money instead of preparing thier children for the future.",

They promotes education of family members, you can see a colourful life together weather wealthy or otherwise. But dear, there is more to it than what you see and heard, many families are living in broken homes, nobody is relating with each other because they're many circumstances behind it. Like you mention a man impregnated the wife's friend, this things happens always, marriage is another heaven and hell to learn that's why some do not last while others do.But I also encourage love in the families, we should experience this unusual strength for each other, add a colourful and blissful time together for social events, shares ideas, worries and help each other.

There were jobs everywhere and our local currency had value. My salary used to be enough to take care of my family because of the strong purchasing power of our currency. But years after, things began to fall apart and life started becoming difficult. My salary has not been increased for many years in an economy that is going through hyperinflation. I never though that my country's economy will be as bad as this that's why I had more than two children. The economy of an individual or nation is unpredictable so marrying because you are financially stable is good but don't forget that you can lose the money. If you feel that you can live a fulfilled life without marriage and children, then you can decide not to marry and enjoy your life. This is because marriage and childraising are expensive.",

This may seem strange to you, but it is the truth, believe me. Through this experience, I came to the conclusion that family relationships may be the best way for people who are unable to solve their problems on their own or in constant need of various types of assistance (such as those with organic disabilities, for example).",
