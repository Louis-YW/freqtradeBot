If it's just an ordinary address, then you can try to see if it belongs to an exchange (using walletexplorer.com) and If it does, seek help from your local law enforcement.",

      "body": "I also suggest you contact the police. Hopefully you're in a country where there are laws that criminalize scammers, but if you are lucky, law enforcement has a chain analysis firm they can cooperate with to track your funds and possibly order an exchange to freeze them if that's where they end up, since exchanges are a common destination for stolen funds.",

      "body": "It depends on what you consider a \"Bitcoin Wallet ID\". Maybe you are talking about a transaction ID and the hash of the outgoing transaction from your wallet. You can track where the coins went yourself using the above mentioned walletexplorer.com or some other services, like https://www.breadcrumbs.app/, for example. Aside from that, there isn't much you can do yourself. Even if the coins went to a centralized exchange, that site isn't going to freeze the money or return it to you. You need to get law enforcement involved and prove the crypto was stolen from you. The exchange can help you by telling you what documentation you need to provide them. That's not an overnight thing. But if you are lucky, you might be able to prove the fraud and have the exchange cooperate with law enforcement and reveal the name of the person behind the address. If they have the correct name, that is, and if stolen identities weren't used. There is a lot of 'ifs' and 'maybe's' in the whole process, but if it's a lot of money, it's worth a try.",

While the chance that they use a mixer or something similar is not small, it is better than nothing. Who knows, if he makes a mistake in the future there will be more data to link him.",

As mentioned elsewhere, walletexplorer.com may be able to help, but it is not likely.If the address in question is owned by a custodial wallet (an exchange, for example), then law enforcement may be able to get information from the custodian about the person that is associated with that address.You can try a google search for the address.",
