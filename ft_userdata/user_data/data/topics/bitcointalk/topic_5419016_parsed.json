You should put a little bit more effort and analyze his activity before asking others to check it out.I got a message few days ago when signing up in a website(\"A Data Breach on a Site or App Exposed Your Password\"). So i have decided to changes my primary email address and password to every site i registered for. I left BTT a long time ago so after changing password i thought why not make some post again. I know a lot better than 2018 so may be i can make something for myself and others. It's been a long time so it's not unusual that i can write in more matured way than before as my knowledge expands a lot. Haven't thought that this will caught some peoples attention. I can send a message from my old registered email address(\"I do not want to share my old email address publicly\") to any moderator if i really needs to prove my account ownership. I do not know what more to say and i think it is not any violation of rules to be active after a long time.",

I can build an account, stake an address with it on this forum, sell the account, give the wallet to the person I sold it, tell him how I have helped him to sign a message in the past and how he can reuse the address to sign another message, old account can be sold too like that. Best way sometimes is to check if the account change hands.",

I have to agree with you, it doesn't seem that the same person who initially created the account is the one who is posting now.

Much bigger problem than your account waking and suddenly writing in language never used before is the difference in English level before and after that break. What could have happened in two years that your English got so much worse?Quote from: cozytrade on February 17, 2015, 10:35:39 PMCaVirtex strictly limited Canadian residents as the clients. That was one of the reason their customer base has not grown.Vault of Satoshi used to be good long time ago but not that much in the last months. Cointrader does not have competitive price both for bid and ask. QuadrigaCX has issues in their API access control (at least from outside Canada). However QuadrigaCX would be the best CAD exchange at this moment..   By the way, confusing Virtex.com is also in trouble, which is EgoPay related firm  Quote from: cozytrade on August 12, 2017, 09:37:57 AMRipple is my favourite coin in month of april hehehe. I've make a wonderfull high profit amoun in this coin. Suffered a lot of time of waiting to pump this coin now hehehe and still holdingQuote from: cozytrade on August 12, 2017, 09:14:44 AMWe doesn't know what is the reason why ETH didn't pump if bitcoin goes down. As what as i've now in  trading even if bitcoin is rising also altcoin have been rising too, it's so nice to see that their rising too because many peoples saying that if BITCLIN goes up then ALTCOINS goes down right?

This is an experience that I can share with you for the purpose of avoiding mistake.There are a lot of people changing email and password for security purposes and that's not a really accurate reason to say an account has changed hand. Even if that is considered an early indication, but you need other evidence to accuse him.But how do you suspect someone so quickly on this forum when you have only 5 posts including this one since registering your account October 29, 2022, 06:29:41 PM?

This must be strange from you because I actually saw your announcement a few days ago. LOLLet me join the Bitcoin ForumAbout 2 months before I registered for an account, I often visited the bitcointalk.org site using a laptop and I continued to use Android. That's what I do when I'm getting bored with work reports and when I'm bored with games.Almost every day for 2 months I did that to make me find out more about crypto because along with I found crypto ads while I was browsing and it was very annoying. When I opened the bitcointalk.org site, I clicked on all the spaces and it turned out that life was very active here.Actually I'm planning to register an account not October 29, 2022, 06:29:41 PM but October 31, 2022 to make it easier for me to remember the anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper. So don't be surprised my first post is about my thanks to Satoshi.Can my answer be used as a new topic?",

In this case account woke up 4 and a half years later so I doubt that real owner would notice something happening.

Sure, it makes sense to change those things if you bought an account so the previous owner can't retake control of it, but accounts are not always sold and instead they are just given (like friend giving a friend his account) and in order to raise any red flags, the new owner decided to keep the old password.By the way, have you compared the posts made in 2015 with those from 2017?
