      "body": "I don't know if this Meta trading project is different from the Meta trading app I was using. I was using that app to learn trading but I don't understand anything so left it and use online trading site to do the trading. In the online trading site, I don't know for others I noticed that there is no broker guiding you and all the things you do it by yourself but in the Meta trading, you must have a broker to guide you in the trading. Though I used it for the demo account in most times. As I clicked invest now, it took me to google play store with Meta mask. And I believed I have tested Meta mask before.",
