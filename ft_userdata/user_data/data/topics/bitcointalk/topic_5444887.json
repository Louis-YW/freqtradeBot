  "content": "I would like to try my luck at catching a block for 6.25btc. I pay $0.07cents /kw so its better odds than playing the lottery.How exactly do I setup this ASIC miner to solo mine with ck pool?Is it really as simple as pointing the address to stratum+tcp://solo.ckpool.org:3333 and using your btc address as the username and x as the password?Also, what does this mean exactly?Note that solo.ckpool.org supports both IPV4 and IPV6 transparently.You may wish to find which is lower latency for you and specify one or the other directly.IPV4 is solo4.ckpool.orgIPV6 is solo6.ckpool.org",

      "body": "Yes the stratum URL should be the address where you point your miner and the BTC address is your username you can rename it like mybtcaddres.s19j or mybtcaddress and about the password, you can put any or just x it doesn't matter.About using ipv4 and ipv6 you can also use this pool if your internet supports it and the only purpose is that it is for latency purposes low latency is a must.",

Looks like I am setup for ipv4 and ipv6 is not available.I pinged both solo.ckpool.org and solo4.ckpool.org and I had a faster ping to solo4.ckpool.org so I will use that one.",
