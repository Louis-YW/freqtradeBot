  "content": "\"Hello Bitcointalk community!I am doing research on/involving crypto and memecoin investors/ethusiasts and their experience with different forms of marketing.You need less than a minute to complete the survey!Among those who correctly complete the survey, I will draw one winner who receive 50 BUSD BEP20.Survey - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlTJStwgrdPBFqUaGf9Oqgjr9npVkYXmigW-zWBo87qsf5IQ/viewform?usp=sf_linkSpreadsheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w928CyH2LvjXF0EXezRpBYKkAlpWcddQIy8XqO3N_oA/edit?usp=sharingDRAW RULES After obtaining 500 answers (the current number of answers can be seen in the spreedsheet above), a random number will be selected based on the last 3 characters of the hash number of the nearest mined Bitcoin block. For example, if the 500 answers would appear at December 14, 2022 10:30:00 CET Time we choose block 767 365 whose hash number ends with 246, it means that person 246 in spreedsheet wins 50 BUSD. If the number is not correct (because is too high - max is 500) as in the case of block 767 361 (Hash 00000-c0941) we are waiting for the next one and based on it we choose a winner.Letters are not taken into account during the draw. for example in block 767 371 (Hash 00000-28c19) wins number 19If the block will not contain any numbers (in the last three characters), or it will be number 1 (headline) we take the next closest block. We will also select the next block if the participant whose number was drawn did not provide the wallet address or the address is incorrect.\".I am posting this survey on behalf of a colleague who is doing marketing research. He tried to announce that survey in other places, but as you can see in the spreadsheet, he got just few answers. I believe that the Bitcointalk community will help in achieving the goal and collecting 500 answers!",
