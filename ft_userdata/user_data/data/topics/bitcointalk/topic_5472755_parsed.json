      "body": "There is no way to check whether it is a scam. Think for yourself. a random person releases a token (5 minutes of work to create a smart-contract) and creates a website (probably rebuilding a website from a previous scam, which takes him 1-4 hours). This is all the work done by the person who issues the new token. And are you supposed to trust him not to cheat on you? that he will deliver the product at all even though it is paid in advance and has no formal obligations?everything can be cheated. Traffic on Twitter, Telegram, Medium can be bought (probably with money from previous scams). Everything on the website may be a lie.some scammers have entire teams that allow them to launch 10 projects a day only to escape with the money on the same day. Stop falling for this kind of thing. instead, look for something that already works, something that you want to use yourself, something that has a large user base and generates profits, and yet is priced inappropriately.This is how I made 30x that way. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5208144.msg53299809#msg53299809",

Specifically, social network or page links, so people here can better understand what you are saying. You think it's worth it, but what is the basis for your thinking so?The market really has more and more poor quality things with unclear origins, so vigilance should always be a priority. And don't just let the story about profits that can be earned be interpreted by anyone, simplify the story in this crypto market towards the core things of BTC, ETH,... to See if what appears helps you become victorious.",
