Downgrade to the version prior to the newest one (22.12.19) and see if the QR feature works as it should. It it does, there are clearly some issues with the newest version. Alternatively, speak with their support. It seems like they are offering live chat on their website.There is no reason to be worried about the address poisoning scam. It doesn't affect you one bit if you send and receive coins the normal way. The normal way isn't coping addresses from transaction histories or blockchain explorers. I don't use Exodus, but it surely has a send/receive window or tab where the wallet will display your receiving addresses. That's the place where you should copy them from. If you are sending coins to someone else, take the address they sent you in whatever method you use to communicate.",

I am going to try it on my Linux just to and be sure it's not a hardware problem and will keep you postedI stopped using my Linux a few months back as it would just freeze out of nowhere until I had to restart. I read somewhere that it could be due to my GPU, and it's sort of a newish bug, so I abandoned Linux for a while, but it's my preferred operating system.",

People are wondering why I used the wallet. It's one of the few desktop multicurrency wallets that came into my mind. Yes, it not open source and has a lot of vulnerabilities, but I am not using it to keep my long term stash.

Good idea, however Windows is weird with these app permissions. By default, they should be on for everything that requires camera access to work properly. There is an on/off switch to allow Microsoft Store apps to access the camera, and there is a second on/off switch to allow 3rd-party desktop apps. The weird part is you get a list of 3rd-party desktop apps that can access the camera, but you can't manually allow or disallow the permissions. I am looking at my system right now, and Telegram and Zoom are two apps that have access to the camera. I can't remove these permissions from the systems settings menu.

It's a live-streaming app which was installed on my Windows OS. I discovered this thanks to @nc50lc's suggestionI uninstalled the app and everything works just fine right now. The App manages the webcam by default, and it ends up not being compatible to other less used apps like crypto wallets.Thanks everyone  I will leave this thread open in case anyone else gets the same issue as mine and wants to comment.",
