So far, it seems regulators are contented with how these centralized platforms are doing their nutty job. They didn't order exchanges to stop freezing funds with a mere we've detected suspicious activity in your account as a reason. They didn't reprimand exchanges when they lock accounts for being under investigation. Â And so the stealing continues. Easy money keeps flowing in. When their arbitrary actions are exposed publicly, they could easily just respond like Volet.https://x.com/VoletCom/status/1811428392161386977Thanks to regulators, stealing couldn't be any smoother for exchanges.",

A massive misplay on Volet's end. You can't just add it to the pool of your customer's coins. Even binance doesn't do that lol. Best course of action here is to freeze such assets until investigation is completed determining whether Zucco is guilty of dabbling with dirty crypto or not, till then they can't and shouldn't do shit with it no matter what.

But a matter of simply removing the need for this criteria by completely de-risking. Traditional finance does this too, but fintech and now crypto firms are simply derisking, rather than managing risk, at the cost of overcompliance. Not sure comparable to Binance -- who knowingly aided or facilitated criminal activity, rather than being negligent (itself having degrees leading up to criminality).",

However, MSBs cannot be expected and are not required to investigate orconfirm the underlying crime (e.g., terrorist financing, money laundering, tax evasion,identity theft, or fraud). Investigation is the responsibility of law enforcement. Whenevaluating suspicious activity and completing the SAR-MSB, MSBs should, to the best oftheir ability, identify the characteristics of the suspicious activity.(page 97 of 159)Quoteprohibition of sar-Msb disclosureNo MSB that reports a suspicious transaction, or any director, officer, employee or agentof the MSB, may notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction hasbeen reported. Additionally, no officer or employee of the Federal Government or ofany state, local, tribal, or territorial government within the United States, who has anyknowledge that such report was made, may disclose to any person involved in thetransaction that the transaction has been reported, other than as necessary to fulfillthe official duties of such officer or employeea msb is not suppose to inform their customer they are under investigation nor prevent the customers activity until they have been ordered by a court. the most a MSB can do is without explaining reason, inform the customer the business no longer wants the customer to be a customer and allow them to withdraw funds to then ban the customer(its really worth reading MSB manuals and procedures to learn how laws actually work)by volet also considering the funds return as being a \"refund\" instead of a withdrawal.. it appears that volet is pretending that funds received are purchases where funds become volets on receipt. rather than volet being a custodian of users owned funds on depositvolet is not actually following regulations to the fullest nor having a adequate policy of servicing its users. so i doubt they are compliant if they are regulated. too many fishy rotten processes that volet has mentioned in its tweetsalso. there is actual supreme court case law that has been tested that suspicion/curiosity alone is not a crime. the authorities need to articulate suspicion of a crime for it to be suspicious when doing a SAR, so there are thresholds for reporting and investigating. they cant just dislike a customer and treat them as a suspect 'coz suspect', they have to meet certain standards(identify the characteristics of suspicious activity)this is why even blockchain analysis companies cant just tag any address as suspicious without actually articulating its linkage to WHY its suspicious. again they cant just tag \"suspicious\" and think that is good enough to trigger investigations via authorities and MSB's(identify the characteristics of suspicious activity).. there are many manuals and guidelines from FATF, SEC, Fincen about procedures regulated MSB's have to follow. and it appears volet is not following them or lying about its own processes if its regulated",
