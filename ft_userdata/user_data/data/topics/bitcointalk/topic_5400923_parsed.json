We can only speculate. We need wait at least a few years to see the market will be recovered again but this time may a bit different compared with the last years. This time crypto is always following the stock market. It has similar pattern. In my opinion if you shall see the chart and make a comparison between both. We didn't even know whether the market already reached the bottom price or not. buying in the various price may become the best answer for that.",

Buying is very simple to do but the question is can you really hold 1 to 2 years if the bear market become more critical than what we just saw it today. How many tokens lost thier 90% value during year 2018 to 2019 bear season and you will badly need to hold with no hope at all. we will end up losing if we cant hold and sell at loss because of fear. Invest an amount that you can afford to loss so that you will never feel the fear, sometimes investing also depend on your luck look at LUNA it is such a trusted token but it still failed and fall many investors loss crypto is risky but you are ahead in points if you know more than others keep on going and continue learning for good.",

The 4 year cycle is always happening now. IMO if the good time for altcoins may not this year, bitcoin is still overperforming the majority of altcoins. These days people aware if the risk investing in the altcoin was so big just like when some people are getting scammed caused by they were investing into the garbage project. You can gamble it by yourself to buy the altcoins right now and used these altcuins for long term",

If bitcoin can return to a price of $50k or more, then the possibility for altcoins to increase is possible, and we will see another altcoin season. For now, I think it's a good time to buy some potential coins that could increase but before buying, make sure we have analyzed the coin's movement so that we can really buy at a low price.",

Altcoins are such an investment that requires your attention and it may not always be a good idea to hold them for a long period. You also need to take into account that the market falls in periods, this does not happen so that the price falls constantly, the market is periodically replaced by growth, and in this case you can benefit from short-term trading, or simply use these moments for purchases at low prices.",

Buy at each dip.Hope this helps you OP to understand the concept better.",

I personally think that we will be in a bear market for a couple more months at least, which would mean that especially small cap altcoins would probably will be going down even more from this point on because in a bear market altcoins and especially small and new ones are falling way harder than Bitcoin and the big altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, BNB and so on. So i personally wait a little longer until i invest.",
