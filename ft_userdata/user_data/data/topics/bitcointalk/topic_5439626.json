  "content": "It will be very important as usual to make good selections of our coins and while Bitcoin is looking very bullish right now, holding some Altcoins is very important because in a bull run, Altcoins are frequently outperforming Bitcoin because of new technology and innovation. Here are my selections: 1# AVALACHEAvalanche had many great news recently as AMAZON selecting Avalanche because of Subnets and Avalanche has seen numberous new applications launching on Avalanche. In general, Subnets are a huge game changer on Avalanche: https://medium.com/@demirelo/the-era-of-avalanche-subnets-9e94f377cb65Subnets are a collection of validators participating in Avalanche consensus. A subnet can have costomized Blockchain characteristics but it's based on Avalanche Blockchain. So, a Subnet can be a customized Blochkchain, validated by Avalanche validators who are also required to validate Avalanche's mainnet. Every Subnet can have different levels of inclusiveness (for example: permissioned, public or private), Such an unique design opens up many possibilities to implement numberous enterprise applications on Avalanche's Blockchain. AMAZON has detected Avalanche's potential already, when Amazon selected Avalanche: https://medium.com/avalancheavax/ava-labs-and-aws-bring-scalable-blockchain-solutions-to-enterprises-and-governments-295040a34263In addition, Avalanche is a capped coin, making it scare and people can buy it as a store of value. Avalanche can really have huge potential and increase in price massively. 2# ETHEREUMEthereum has achieved PoS in 2022, making it a top contender against Bitcoin's PoW when combatting climate change. PoS will make Ethereum less wasteful because PoS requires less energy consumption. In addition, Ethereum is now more scarce as well even if Ethereum's supply has no hard cap but inflation of Ethereum is reduced since PoS. Ethereum is still strong in DeFi applications, such like Uniswap. More demand of DeFi applications could drive demand for Ethereum.Only issue is scalability of Ethereum: while Blockchains such as Avalanche have solved scalability, scalability on Ethereum still needs to be coded, which could take lots of time. 3# DOGECOINDogecoin is an original coin and has been around for a very long time. Dogecoin is very famous because of Doge and it will always attract some people to buy it. Compared to copies, like Shiba Inu or Elon Doge, Dogecoin will always be an original coin, not a cheap copy. Dogecoin can be promoted easily because it's a timeless coin. 4# CHAINLINKChainlink is a relatively new Coin and it gained interest quickly. Because Chainlink is very essential in an environment of a large number of Blockchains, which need to be linked, we can expect positive investments if we are long on Chainlink. It is likely to increase interoperability as an important factor between Blockchains and Chainlink is well positioned to be a leading Link coin. Chainlink is also supported by Avalanche core developers. Finally, Chainlink has a massive support among NATO members advertising for it on various soccial media channels. After all, coins are always speculative but my examples mentioned above are in my opinion a good selection. We don't know about profits but in a bull market, Avalanche, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Chainlink could perform very well. What's your Altcoin to look at in 2023?",

I hope this becomes a strong enough trend. But unfortunately some fud scattered. Paxos (BUSD) seems to be being attacked by fud at the moment. so don't be surprised if the market is currently red.",

Anyway, those 4 coins that you've shared are at the top of the list in terms of market cap and as an investor focusing on large market cap coins, I'm always looking for some of the altcoins to invest my money with.Avalanche isn't on my radar for some reasons, but it is very popular. Chainlink is the one that I just bought recently (just a few weeks ago). DOGE has been there for a very long time and yet, I didn't have the courage to buy it for an unknown reasons (I feel embarrassed because of it). Ethereum is for me what I consider as a \"blue chip altcoin\" because it has been there for a very long time and until now, upgrades are still being implemented. Among the 4, LINK and ETH are the ones that I'm holding right now aside from ADA.",

So simply embrace it. I have more than 4 altcoins in my portfolio but priority is ETH, ADA, THETA, POlygon .In addition, I am quite interested in new but potential and interesting coins such as: 1. Arbitrum - a layer 2 brings an incomplete, pure ecosystem but has many great development opportunities.  Hoping as the information 6/2022 Arbitrum has been selected by the Norwegian government to build a financial product, August 31 Arbitrum successfully deployed the Nitro upgrade - simplifying the communication process between ETH, reducing transaction fees  .  2. ADA: in addition to expecting Djed, there is also a solution to extend layer 2 - its hydra, in tune with defi that can continue to grow bigger when ADA has reached maturity.  It will be bigger.",

Butthe downside of meme tokens is being dependent with demand and hype alone. So if these coins won't be having interest from investors even if there is an uptrend, then nothing will happen. Unlike with utility tokens wherein even if the market is neutral or in downfall, there'd still be a chance for an instant recovery since the token itself circulates on a certain platform. Ethereum on the other hand has a large chain, meaning it is being used to most of the projects and transactions in this industry which means it would always be promising to invest.",

I'm not so hooked with doge knowing how it's mechanism work. I don't see it good for a long term holding. It can easily be controlled by doing FUDS since it's a community driven token just like any other meme coins. I would certainly settle to a more sustainable token rather than putting my money here. Imagine if Elon Musk decided to abandon Doge for some time now, Doge will certainly have a very big dump given that there are many holders who are hooked up because Elon did fomo doge 2 years ago.",

The two coins have a large community, so there is a possibility that the price could skyrocket again.",
