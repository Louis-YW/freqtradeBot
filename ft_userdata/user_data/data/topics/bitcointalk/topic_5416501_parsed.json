  "content": "Recently, Paypal announced that they will be charging $2,500 if you're caught to spread \"false, inaccurate or misleading information\" as they say[1]. It'd be planned to be effective by November 3rd, but they must have realized it does some harm to vaguely and subjectively suspend accounts and confiscate people's money, so they've reversed it according to Dailywire[2]. However, some users do have had their accounts canceled. Specifically, accounts linked to Toby Young[3]. This[4] is the updated list of prohibited activities, taken from web archive. They have removed it from paypal.com, as I said because they must have withdrawn it. This isn't much different from the this year's GoFundMe case, wherein millions of dollars from truckers were seized due to protesting. It might be a common phenomenon from now on, especially with the existence of such ambiguous and subjectively-taken legislation[5]. Let me highlight some:QuoteAct in a manner that is defamatory, trade libelous, threatening or harassingQuoteProvide false, inaccurate or misleading informationQuoteSend or receive what we reasonably believe to be potentially fraudulent fundsQuoteControl an account that is linked to another account that has engaged in any of these restricted activitiesLeaving savings to your Paypal account means you're fully agreed with having them confiscated if you're caught to do something that might be considered shady or inappropriate, not according to you, but according to Paypal.Friendly suggestion: Don't. Move to bitcoin. I can't assure you that it will rise or stabilize in value over the long term, but I can tell you this: It doesn't have Terms & Conditions. You're censorship protected.

Yes.If they do so, can they (PayPal) be sued or challenged for it? No, you agreed to the term.",

How many people in the traditional banking world still think that promoting bitcoin is spreading misinformation? And you can't say anything that might hurt someone's feelings? Lol. Glad I've never had a PayPal account. What a scam.Note, of course, that PayPal won't be implementing these kinds of draconian rules for fun. (I know they have reversed course for now due to the backlash, but these rules will absolutely return either when no one is paying attention, or in small increments over time so people don't notice.) It is governments and regulators which are forcing PayPal to implement these kinds of rules. And if they are forcing fiat institutions to do it, you can rest assured they will soon be forcing crypto institutions to do it too.Bitcoin is censorship resistant, but centralized exchanges absolutely aren't. Bitcoin is the solution to this if and only if you hold your own bitcoin in your wallets.",

Are they going to boycott them as well if they found that there website is publishing some bad advertisements or may be there was a survey which was connected with the company which PayPal does not like? That's funny because it is too restrictive and is not worth it because PayPal will surely loose big user data base after this. PayPal is already on the negative list of users because there had been lot of chargebacks for the subscriptions of simple play store apps and iOS apps. All you need is one complaint and they will just chargeback without further confirmation. It's really sad to see more stringent rules being enacted by them.",

I took a good look through their User Agreement here: https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full. I've pulled out all the relevant parts below:QuoteYou acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S. dollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal’s actual damages.QuotePayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.QuoteIf the balance in your Balance Account or business account doesn’t cover the payment amount due plus the fees, we may use any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to cover the amount due. If the payment methods linked to your PayPal account don’t cover the amount due, this will result in a negative balance. A negative balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your balance to resolve it. If you don’t, PayPal may engage in collection efforts to recover the amount due from you.So if PayPal decide you've said something they don't like, they'll charge $2,500 from your PayPal account. If they can't do that, they'll pull $2,500 from any linked banked account or credit card. If they can't do that, they'll send debt collectors after you.What about this post? This post is harmful to PayPal. Would they charge me $2,500 for it if I had a PayPal account? Who knows. It's within their terms to do so if they wanted, and it's at their sole discretion.",

There's no justification to the staying of the current feudalistic monetary system other than inadequate education. The existence of an alternate needs to be spread around. This can shift existing users of PayPal towards bitcoin. In PayPal users have their bank accounts connected to PayPal. The fund received in any currency gets withdrawn to the respective bank account linked. Same as this bitcoin can be used without much complications. For now the market volatility, trust and the awareness keeps bitcoin away from PayPal users who are much oriented on business purposes. These corporate networks make use of it and overruling its userbase.",
