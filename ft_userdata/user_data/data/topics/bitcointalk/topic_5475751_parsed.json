  "content": "The alleged victim, @83_5BTC, revealed that after transferring 139 BTC to a new cold wallet, the funds were immediately swept to another wallet by the attackers. The transaction split the sum, sending 55.77 BTC to the hackers’ wallet, while the rest, a staggering 83.65 BTC, was paid as a transaction fee. This incident surpasses the previous high-fee record of 19.8 BTC.Mononaut, the anonymous operator behind the mempool.space bitcoin explorer, weighed in on the incident. He suggested that “the most likely explanation is that the wallet was generated from bad entropy.” In layman’s terms, this means the wallet’s security was compromised due to weak randomization in its creation process. Mononaut’s insight provides a crucial understanding of the technical flaw that may have led to this unfortunate event. source",

Sites like Ian Coleman’s use this JavaScript and that is why it is always best to use wallets like electrum or even bitcoin core to generate one’s seed. Antpool In my opinion shouldn’t return the fee because that signing of message from that address doesn’t prove anything, it could be the hacker still playing his tricks. Bottom line is  one should stay from generating their own seed and also from using online tools for that. There is no reason to try and complicate things, keep it simple.",

Good advice but I have to say that this kind of thing shouldn't happen again not because of unpreparedness but because the vulnerability has been resolved already, I don't think that's the only thing that we have to continue reasoning that we should be careful, there should be some level of competency on the developer side that's going to make us comfortable even if we aren't that careful with our stuff, I think that it's the best that people aren't worried about this in the future and at the same time prepared about their security. That's a sad reason as to why there's a new record for tx fee, and it's to speed up the transaction of the stolen bitcoins.",

A developer might be prioritizing something that makes his work easier just like this online tools using JavaScript maybe because it is faster on browser than python who knows. Same thing apply to bugs, once a wallet doesn’t fixes if you can move else where.

I lost some Bitcoin and ETH to scammers through iancoleman, I was till new and learning at the time and I did import my recovery seed into iancoleman because I need to get my hands on my private keys since the wallet I imported is a multi wallet.I have gotten tired of all these hacks that I just give up on every crypto wallets out there except hardware wallets only, I like the part where to send any asset out you need your hardware wallet to confirm the transaction, so why should I keep using a software wallet especially the wallets that functions using the internet. If you can keep your private keys offline then you are good but the chances of making mistakes is big, creating your crypto wallets offline and keeping it offline is the safest idea ever.",
