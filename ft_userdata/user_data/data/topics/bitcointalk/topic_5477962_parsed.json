  "content": "I noticed Binance has a Christmas event with $150k BNB. Just gotta retweet, but only 6 winners, and there are already 20k retweets. I know it’s hard to be the winner, but I’m in. Also, TaskOn Christmas with $60k. Looks like you can participate in dozens of projects with a higher chance of winning. I noticed the first project offers $7,000, and it’s going to 300 winners. Tasks are chill, just like the Binance retweet one. Deadline is the 25th. Check it out if you interested: https://taskon.xyz/epic/1?eid=25940Any other Christmas events? especially ones with easy tasks. I don’t want to waste too much time on it.",
