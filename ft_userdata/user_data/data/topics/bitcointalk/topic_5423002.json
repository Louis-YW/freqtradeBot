And later after Bitcoin is recognized?Satoshi was intelligent enough to realize that revealing his identity would not only be dangerous for his security, but also have serious implications for how Bitcoin would be perceived by the public. I cannot say whether he had a plan to disappear at some point, but what we know is that some of his associates at that time began to be very critical of Satoshi making too many decisions independently, which may have been the trigger for his withdrawal from the public.We cannot know what Bitcoin would be like today if Satoshi was still around, but his identity is less important, unless he was directly or indirectly connected to some institutions that are not popular with the public. The fact that Bitcoin has the highest trust and that it did not disappear as some predicted it may best speak in favor of the fact that Satoshi did a good job - and that is the most important thing.",

And later after Bitcoin is recognized?Bitcoin is a threat to the monetary system and the government itself. If from the beginning he just shows himself up, Bitcoin wouldn't grow. BTC will die just like the previous projects before Bitcoin such as the Digital Cash of David Chaum in the 90s. It will be shut down by powerful individuals collaborating with the government or will have no supporters as BTC will not be recognized.Satoshi leaving and making it opensource I think was the key but also allows developers to create altcoins. If BTC is recognized by the community while Satoshi is around, he'd face serious threats. He wouldn't last a year.",

Satoshi Nakamoto knew that the  government would have celebrate him well, assume he made his identity public in the beginning, and by now the government would have make him to regret in this season of high inflation that is affecting the whole world. I celebrate Satoshi Nakamoto for the potential knowledge he used to break down many protocols to made Bitcoin available for the world.",

He would have been richest guy and most probably well above Mr. Elon Musk right now, so definitely government would have been keenly involved with  him on the other matters such as government campaigns, donations and under the table and what not. I think I am imagining him as role model for every youth, and follow the leadership of him. I mean people literally follow Elon and his small band of few coins now and then. Now imagine, what a tweet from Mr. Satoshi Nakomoto could have done? Definitely he would have embraced with ultimate powers and ideology.",

And later after Bitcoin is recognized?Well, you can take Vitalik Buterin as an example since ETH is the next popular cryptocurrency in the Industry.  So what happens to Vitalik Buterin?  Is he endangered?  Got kidnapped?  Got criticized by the government?  Or is he well-acknowledged? Respected? And has authority over the Ethereum network?   I bet if Satoshi Nakamoto made himself known from the beginning, he would have experienced the same thing that Vitalik Buterin has experienced. There are lots of crypto developers that are already known to the public, I believe Satoshi Nakamoto will also face the same thing as the developer of Bitcoin.  Quote from: jossiel on November 24, 2022, 09:30:38 PMHe'll be taken quickly by the FBI or any syndicate that see his worth about his creation and the wealth, money that he has made.But since he's a genius, he doesn't want to compromise his safety and identity in the public because he probably have foreseen these bad things might happen to him.He can be abducted, kidnapped or anything that he can imagine of being done to him just for those bad people to take advantage of him.And why is another cryptocurrency developer such as Buterin isn't taken by the FBI or syndicate?  I think we exaggerated things, thinking too many nefarious things will happen to Satoshi if ever he revealed himself from the beginning.On a negative note, I think Satoshi is already dead, silenced by the authority thinking that Bitcoin will somehow stop propagating once Satoshi is killed.  That was just my assumption and does not bear any concrete evidence. Though I hope he is still alive somewhere enjoying his riches from selling BTC.  The one that is saved on an address that is not public.",

Apart from his personal safety which might have made him died before his time, the safety of this bitcoin would also have been jeopardized. What would have triggered the much conflict is knowing that he is not from the United States.But his anonymity has solved the whole problems that would have arose. That is a really good and genuine Legacy that is left by the wise discoverer for us to maintain.",

Satoshi probably did right in disassociating himself from Bitcoin, because it further enhanced the decentralised feel. It wasn't connected to an identity that you could nitpick. Any dirt on Satoshi, would've automatically transferred to Bitcoin, and potentially tainting its reputation forever. Without that association; you effectively have nothing. Everything can only be speculation, and that's not solid enough to effect the reputation of Bitcoin. Something which currently Bitcoin requires to build any sort of momentum. I don't think that'll always be the case to a certain extent, but at the moment any positive news usually gets users excited, and any negative news causes a little bit of a panic.",

This some kind of Satoshi hunting that is happening now is primarily because of curiosity. And this curiosity stems from Satoshi being completely anonymous and his/her/their decision to vanish. We badly want to unravel this mystery that is Satoshi Nakamoto. Another probable reason why Satoshi could be hunted down is his/her/their huge Bitcoin stash.If we look at Bitcoin's predecessors like David Chaum's eCash, Adam Back's Hashcash, Nick Szabo's Bit Gold, Wei Dai's B-Money, they're simply being treated as modern technological innovations and their inventors or developers, although trying to disrupt the system, are not really hunted down by whatever government agency. However, it is also a big factor that these early attempts are not as successful as Bitcoin. But I think a significant part of Bitcoin's success is owed to Satoshi Nakamoto deciding to leave.",

It isn't something big (I think, but we'll never know) but I feel like Satoshi would've liked the start to have really started from 0, and spread from there slowly instead of using influence to market it out as something big. It may have brought about the likes of Craig in the picture, but it's still ultimately for the better that Satoshi let his name stay unknown. In the end, the only thing we can do right now is speculating but there's no hard evidence after all, which is imo best suits what he envisioned for Bitcoin. I suppose there'd also be some negative aspects of it, such as threats with how Bitcoin grew, but I don't think he stayed anonymous with that in mind really, I think that mindset would've only appeared when Bitcoin grew to how big it was today (or even a few years ago).",
