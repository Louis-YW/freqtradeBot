For example, I’ve got some (untrusted feedback) negative Trust from 2019. If I recall correctly, both cases a retaliation feedback instances for giving out negative Trust beforehand to hoaxers. Those that are more prominent in using the Trust system to signal potential or factual scammers are often reciprocally tagged with some pretend pretext, which normally doesn’t really amount to anything. There are also a bunch of ratings that are not commerce/scam related, and that therefore don’t really follow the intended use, being yet another reason for people to read the comments on the ratings.Note: Strange first topic to choose, in Reputation of all places, from a Newbie account. Obviously not really a Newbie in terms of Bitcointalk.",
