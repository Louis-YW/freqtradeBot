  "content": "This coming Monday, October 9th, is a National Bank Holiday in observance of Columbus Day.It seems like Â the USA has too many bank holidays. No one wants to work anymore. No wonder the us dollar is becoming more and more worthless. You can't even withdraw it on alot of mondays anymore. Why does Christopher Columbus mean that banks need to be closed 1 day per year in the USA? I don't get it. Actually i think i do get it. People want to get paid but not work. So that's why they keep it going...that's a sure sign a country is going downhill when they keep making new bank holidays.",
