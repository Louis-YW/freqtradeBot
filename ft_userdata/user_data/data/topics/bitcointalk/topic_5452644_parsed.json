  "content": "Hi guys,In this matter, I would like to share some points that can make the airdrop hunters and newbies in the crypto arena as safe as possible. Everyone knows that scammers have increased in abundance until this year, and they are making every effort to unjustly steal innocent people's money. They can steal anyone's money with just one mistake he makes.One common mistake some airdrop hunters make is their belief that disconnecting their wallet (MetaMask, Trust wallet.. etc.) from the airdrop site or platform makes it safer and cuts off scammers’ access to their wallet, and this is wrong. Interaction with smart contracts takes place through a signature from the wallet (Approval Transaction), and this signature is not canceled unless the person performs a Revocation Permission transaction.To protect your wallet and revoke these Permissions, you must go to Revoke.cash - Through it, you can view the Permissions of smart contracts from all networks and all wallet signatures in one place, and you can revoke any contract or signature that you deem suspicious, and the site takes some fees for each transaction.Or through:BSC: https://bscscan.com/tokenapprovalcheckerEthereum: https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalcheckerOptimism: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tokenapprovalcheckerArbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/tokenapprovalcheckerPolygon: https://polygonscan.com/tokenapprovalcheckerFantom: https://ftmscan.com/tokenapprovalcheckerAvax: https://snowtrace.io/tokenapprovalcheckerToken Approval:QuoteWhat is token approval?In short: permission for a dapp to access and move a specific type of token from your wallet. Well, this feature is on the Metamask wallet, and through it, you can put a specific number of the coins that you want to make the transaction with; I do not recommend that you put the entire amount of your coins in the (Custom Spending cap) you can lose some small fees each time if you want to increase the amount of the coins that you want to make the transaction with, but this protects you from losing all the amount of your coins.Use extensions and wallets that help you detect transactions and changes that will occur to your wallet:[1] Rabby Wallet: For Ethereum and all EVM chains.  ((Official site))QuoteRabby is an open-source crypto wallet in your browser for Ethereum.

      "body": "These are great tips OP because one of the easiest way people get scammed on the crypto space is through airdrops. Although most of them are just for engagement and they end up not paying which is why I advise people not to engage in them. But regardless there are those that are worth the time. The last one was that of Arbitrium and the Pepe token. But the risk is sometimes bigger than the gain. The easiest security tip to people engaging in airdrops is to create a new wallet for almost each airdrop since there are no limitations to the number of wallet one can create on MetaMask or Trust wallet. Once the airdrops pays off you can swap them and probably move them to exchanges or your personal wallet. At least this save one from exposing his coins to the scammers when they are all stored on same wallet",

Revoke is very easy (just clicking on Revoke button which will request for small fee) which give you full security for any big loss. The most important is to revoke Usdc, Usdt, Matic, Bnb and Eth because we used these tokens for swapping in dex. The best features of this site is that many Chains (Arbitrum, Optimism, polygon, bnb, Ethereum and many more) available and don't need to check explorer for this purpose.Other tipsy are also helpful and OP did a well job for sharing these tips because 80% of users trying for free airdrop which can sometimes lose of own fund and by caring these tips joining airdrop will be risk free.",

      "body": "This tips is new to me and very helpful if I’m an airdrop hunter. The only issue I’m thinking right now is isn’t the best tips is to avoid shady airdrop at all. The chances of being hack the moment you connect your wallet on scam web3 website is very high because you gave them already permission to access your wallet or whatever code they setup to hack your wallet. Either you disconnect or revoke access then it’s still useless if the hacker already got your seed phrase during your initial wallet connect.A legit project that launch an airdrop through their engagement usually doesn’t have any hacking issue. I think this guide is suitable when you connect your wallet on legit website that later on got hacked and not against scammy website since there’s a big difference on coding on how they access web3 wallet.-Additional safety precautions is to use separate airdrop wallet. Move all your assets away from your airdrop wallet once you already do the airdrop requirements. This way, hacker can’t hack anymore your asset even without this revoke.Still thanks for this tips.",

The new wallet that the person will create will contain the currency and fees to complete the transaction with, but if the fees are large or the currencies have a big value, their theft will also be inevitable.Quote from: holydarkness on May 14, 2023, 09:46:15 AMHi, this is a very informative thread.

However, what I see is that most of these airdrop hunters don't take this seriously. Honestly, we can't change their behavior as these people certainly don't see the potential risk but what they see is the potential to earn money. Not to wonder why scammers keep increasing as they still notice that many innocent people are still in the market as well.",

Those whoch are being advertised are ones which are risky to be involved with. On my end, I am checking for some airdrops in this forum and if it has the potential, I am making a follow up reading on their site and check reviews of that particular project through social media platforms. However it does not guarantee that a project would be paying. Problem here is that, you'd only know an airdrop is non-paying or a scam once they show it or once they have done it. And such thing would be hard to determine along the process. But some things to consider I guess is general project's activity and engagement to the community. If they aren't as responsive as they should be, then I guess that would be suspiscious.",

One thing I am curious about though is if it would be possible to re-use old wallets that have been scammed by such ways or would it be safe to use them again if the revoking of the smart contracts that scammed the wallet has been done by the owner of the wallet. This is because I have an old wallet that has been scammed back then with this method which made me scrap it (but I still kept the private keys for sentimental value). Although I can always make a new wallet, I would still want to be able to use my very first altcoin wallet even if not as a main wallet since it still holds a significant amount of sentimental value for me.",
