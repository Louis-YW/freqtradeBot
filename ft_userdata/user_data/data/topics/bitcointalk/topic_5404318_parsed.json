Prepare yourself to understand the advantage or disadvantage.Taking other people's betting recommendations works sometimes. I've followed some bets discussed in the NBA betting thread and won. I had some losses as well but the point is not to discard information from other bettors completely especially if they have a better understanding of the game than you do. There are also times that they are more updated than you are. I used sportsbetting as an example but this can be applied in casino games as well.Quote from: GigaBit on June 28, 2022, 07:05:15 AMI think your success in gambling will definitely visible if you follow the these instructions.

Even if a gambler will follow all these tips it does not mean that he will become more professional or he will be able to beat the gambling platform. In gambling, a lot depends on luck, which cannot be obtained with the help of any tips and recommendations. Many of us stick to these tips as they are the most common, but there are not many professional gamblers among us.",

And perhaps if you gained that experience maybe that's the time when you started to have your own strategy. You could have this plan in the beginning, but if you don't have the control then everything will go out of the window. So for me it's better to just play and entertain yourself at the start and then see how it goes.",

Gambling is better done with right senses and proper calculation and purposes, being in control of the game makes you smarter to think ahead.Self-control is the key here. You might as well accept your losses in that day, quit and then sleep it over. Because if you keep on chasing them, the odds will not be in your favor. I think most of us experience that already. And it doesn't feel good after 2 days of straight losses. So the better approach is not to pursue and keep your judgement 100% so that you won't fall for this emotion to comeback and play again.",

I agree gambling games are so enticing to the point that a person is more likely to lose himself while enjoying his gambling session.  Many advice said to not chase the losses but once we press the spin button or bet button, we have the possibility to forget about it.  It really needs strong self-control when dealing with gambling.  If we are serious about avoiding addiction we should be more than serious about our self-discipline.",

It should be changed to management or something similar as it helps most gamblers except for those who'd like to pursue gambling at a professional level. The same goes for the second thing that he mentioned because when you're relying on your professional skills then it's most likely that your expenses will be coming from it. It's inevitable when you choose gambling as your profession given that you have to increase the stakes in order to sustain yourself.",

You can play in a serious way (avoiding wasting money or be an expert about the rules of the game) but it is really difficult (perhaps impossible) to talk about a professionalism in this type of activity, given that it is largely based on luck and in any case the house / bookmakers always have an advantage in any game you will play .",

A gambler should gambling as an entertainment, not as a way to make money or the earning source of money.The first point contradict your topic title. To build your professionalism you have to consider gambling as a serious business. You have to be able to be making money from it and not be some regular individual online that's just gambling for entertainment. Been a professional gambler could require you gambling everyday just to perfect your craft and earn a living, so you could take that out of the point as well. Provided you do your professional works daily and if gambling was to be your professional source of income there should not be any exception. Been a professional Gamblers isn't that easy to achieve, which is why we don't have many around. To be profitable as a gambler, you don't have to be a professional but can partake in it as a means of entertainment and not get carried away or seek for revenge if the gamble was to go against you.",

It's dangerous to go into gambling for the wrong and be need to be aware that things can go wrong and we lose money. For your 5. point I would also add listening to friends. Following YouTube reviews or betting strategies is most of the times an advertising video where they only show the part in which they make money. All the losses are edited out to make them look much more profitable than they really are. The same can happen among friends too. Maybe a friend or colleague wants to look cool and tells about the big money he won on gambling. We need to ask if he also tells us about his losses, if he doesn't than it's not an accurate picture again. People tend to want to look more successful than they really are. And if we believe everything we see online we will feel bad when not reaching the same profits. Managing expectations and emotions is the hardest thing in gambling in my opinion.",
