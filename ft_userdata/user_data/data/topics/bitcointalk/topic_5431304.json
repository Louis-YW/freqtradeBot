  "content": "Let's start with the story on how this came to my mind. Yesterday, while looking through the forum, I came across this post about how police body cam leaks suspect's seed phrase during vehicle inspection. This post was made by @Oshosondy How to properly store seed phrase during inspection?I have seen many people sharing their unique method on how they can store their seep phrase securely.I am also one of them. Here's what I replied : click hereAfter giving it some thought, I came up with this idea to create an encrypting method to store my seed phrase. And I will share a random word list, from which you guys have to decrypt the seed phrase. Remember this is different from what I already shared to make this more interesting.[Note: It's a new wallet, and whoever finds the seed phrase he will have to share the seed here, and I will match it to the original]There's a winning prize of $20 in BTC.Here's the link to the word list : Word ListAnd also the image : It will be live till 25th January. I think it will be interesting to see who cracks this first. Everyone can join.Also, sorry for the low budget on the prize. I don't have much   [If anyone wants to host this with a bigger prize, you can copy this and share, or wants to donate for the competition then I will share a public address. - I am not asking for any though]It's a first come, first served based competition, so no 2nd or 3rd place. Be the first and grab your reward. Merry ChristmasEdit : Here's the address from this wallet : bc1q------------------------------------------kwhtzI am sharing some of the first and last part. If this is against the rules then let me know and if I'm in the wrong board please correct me and move this to the proper board.",

      "body": "Do you know what you have asked to be done?How many words will be there in the seed phrase? I assume it's 12 word seed phrase. There are 228 words in the above image you shared. If we take 12 words from the 228 words, there will be 30,689,926,618,143,230,000 combinations. I don't know how much time would it take for a high configuration PC to find all these combination as I'm not expert but I can imagine, it's going to take ages. I don't think you are going to get a contestant unless I'm missing some info.",

      "body": "This should not be that hard to break considering there is only 228 words and assuming the seed phrase has 12 words only and if you only know the address and/or derivation path. The hard part is writing the code to break it which is only time consuming to get the Fibonacci logic right on this table, then you can check about 300k to 400k permutations per second easily on CPU.Although you didn't publish neither the address nor the encrypted jumbled words.Quote from: Little Mouse on December 25, 2022, 04:11:40 AMIf we take 12 words from the 228 words, there will be 30,689,926,618,143,230,000 combinations. I think your calculation may be wrong. The options are a lot more limited than that. If you select the first word the next 11 are selected automatically (the Fibonacci sequence meaning  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144). So you only have 1 selection from 228 words and you can't select (228-144)th word assuming the table is not cyclical which I don't think it is, meaning you select from 84 words only.Now you have to multiply that in different directions (rows, columns and diagonal).",

If it's a puzzle piece, then you need to put them together to solve it. It's much easier than you think. And if you find the right pattern, then you can do it in one day. So this will be the first hint. And second one is, it's all math. So if you use an average computer, you will be able to find it too. And then coming to the point of encryption. I also wanted to see how much secure this is going to be for storing your seed phrase.Quote from: pooya87 on December 25, 2022, 04:13:32 AMAlthough you didn't publish neither the address nor the encrypted jumbled words.Edited and added",

      "body": "I'm not very good at technical things, so I don't know if it's technically possible to crack it or not (I mean, I don't know how long such calculations will take a contemporary PC), but I hope someone tries, that'll be interesting to learn.I'm wondering about a couple of things here. Firstly, if the idea is to test how safe the method is against public exposure, why isn't it done in one of those ways that when a person cracks it, they retrieve the money themselves. After all, it's not like an owner would share a matching original with a police officer, someone who sees a spreadsheet leaked online etc.Another thing is this: how safe is the money from locking oneself out of the wallet with this method? Is the seed safely retrieved by some script based on how it was encrypted in case a person forgets the words from the seed?",

Just for a little bit more hint. It's mixed with Fibonacci sequence. Now the rest is up to you guys!",

It's only on Gmail I would not dare such as one thing might lead to others for those using chrome and android.Offline keeping is the best approach for me though, as I have my private things, and I did duplicate the seed phase in different locations in case of unforeseen.",

However, I am still unsure of what I need to do, nor am I interested in earning money from this thread. I wrote my seed phrase on a couple of pieces of paper and ended up saving it in several places. As a result, even if one is lost, others will assist in recovery. Of course, it must be secured so that everyone can't easily find it. Otherwise, writing on paper is pointless.
