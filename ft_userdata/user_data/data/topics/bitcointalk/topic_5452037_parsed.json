  "content": "Hello,many of you have seen these notes - he has sold BTC ones along with many altcoin versions on ebay, etsy and from his site directly - https://thecryptobill.com/They are not on the level of polymerbit or some of the higher quality notes but they are well made and on thick card stock and very affordable. I had him make me some custom ones with my name and logo on them - he added the state of FL and an ASIC miner to the back design as well. There are places to list the USD value, BTC value and funding date.There were 100 total made.50 as DIY Serial Numbers 000001 thru 000050 (these have no addresses or keys on them and will come with a scratch off for you to use to cover the private key once you apply it) and 50 that are assembled Serial Numbers 000051 thru 000100 - The keys were generated by me and applied to the wallets by me - The maker did print the addresses on the notes but he never had the private keys. PRICE:The note are $10 ea PAYMENT:payment can be sent in any of the following methods:BTC:  bc1qn37ly2yjla0thlnfsverzezrvxtxdsyvecp4es or 1FGTHoXtr6X9PVm5qJpa9DbdZFpAGLAa8GStrike:  strike.me/moparminingllcand if you want a LN invoice just shoot me a DM.SHIPPING:1. I can ship direct - Shipping is free within the US - international shipping at cost.2. I can hand off to minerjones for consolidation/reshipping. (no cost from me)3. I can hold it for consolidation and reship it at a later date of your choosing. as a note: I have packaged a couple already for shipping in the US and the average is $4.81 to $5.13 so $5 for shipping will be the charge.note comes in a currency sleeve and protector then placed between two layers of cardboard and packaged in a bubble envelope so they should be safe and not get damaged.SELECTIONS:list your name and the serial number you prefer. Stating \"random\" is fine as well.",

For example I sent a magazine to Ireland it was $45 via uspsI really dont know until I package it and run the address.Also willing to ship to one address if receiver is willing to reship - can also be given to minerjones for consolidation.",
