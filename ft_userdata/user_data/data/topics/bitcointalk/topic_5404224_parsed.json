  "content": "Hi all, I am new to this forum and posting to get your feedback on my app that we launched a few days ago, Zen.Land.So the idea is to provide a simple and safe way to buy and sell anything (digital goods and services in particular) online using escrow smart contracts. You know all existing escrow services charge big fees and the whole paperwork process is time consuming so we thought this app could be a thing.We are currently in the testing phase, so any feedback or idea would help us improve the platform's usability, fix bugs, and find early adopters. Please DM me or reply to this post if you are interested in testing the application or have any questions to ask. We also made a thread on another sub forum that is in a more formal tone, you can reach out to us there too. Thank you for your time and interest in advance.",

Nice job!Are you aware that your terms of service (https://zen.land/terms-of-service) and privacy policy (https://zen.land/privacy-policy) both lead to a 404 (page not found) error?For me, your offering is a little unfocused. I'm not sure if you're an escrow agent, a no-code platform or a marketplace trying to connect buyers & sellers.I'm also struggling to identify with the example about buying apples and can't see what (realistic) value smart contracts would add. Small businesses have been buying apples from suppliers without the help of blockchains for a long time, no? Do apple buyers frequently find themselves with the wrong kind of apple and no recourse?Anyway, those are my thoughts, don't take them too seriously, I'm just a random person on the Internet",

Thank you for your post.We have got the terms of service and privacy policy pages up, they were temporarily taken down.Basically, what we offer is a solution to real-world issues using smart contracts, and the escrow app is the first product. But I definitely see your point.The how it works presentation wasn't meant to show any specific product trading. We wanted to picture the overall process of how the tool works. Now I see that picking something that is more realistically traded using crypto through a peer-to-peer deal might have been a better idea.I will have these discussed with my team. Appreciate you taking time to review the website. And have you had a chance to look into the app by any chance?  What do you think about it?",
