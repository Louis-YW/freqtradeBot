  "content": "It's a shame that people are still living their lives, saying, if the government says that something is bad then it is bad, government decides what's good and what's bad for it's people.This is what I get from a lecturer of a university in my country, I was trying to teach some students about Bitcoin and crypto, I was forced to even do it because I have been busy with my business for the past one month now, a good year this 2023 has been for my business, but these students have been calling me to come and give them some lectures about Bitcoin so I did this yesterday.One of the students have a father that's a lecturer and after I got home this student told me that his father said that the government is the only thing that can decide if a currency is fit to be people's currency or not, if the government says no then it's a no, coming from a lecturer this is so sad. His son have an interest in Bitcoin and now it's left for him to make a choice, I am only surprised how a lecturer can be this dense, something that should be coming from an illiterate. I don't know if this will impact the other students too because they are all from the same school but I do hope I've not wasted my energy, I spent 2 hours talking about Bitcoin and the Blockchain. If something is not clear or doesn't make sense, we should look for answers and not make a blind determination on it, your action can have an impact on someone's else. The lecturer have called Bitcoin a scam and his son is lost, I still told him to do research on his own but I myself have lose interest trying to explain anything to him anymore. UPDATEI've read some comments and people don't get why I believe it's a shame that this is coming from a lecturer. My father was old skool too, yet he never think that paper money is not replaceable, he was so opened to new ideas and he believe that anything is possible.As a lecturer he should believe in whatever he believes in, but stopping his son from learning about Bitcoin is wrong, as a lecturer what makes him believe that he will always be right? We were taught in school that knowledge is power and this one is stopping people from achieving knowledge. People believe so much in their government that's why many poor people are so powerless, some countries are in a mess today because all the people believe in are those corrupt politicians leading their countries. I read some comments and I am disappointed, many people are just buying Bitcoin but they don't understand that Bitcoin gives power to the people through decentralization, for the first time in history the government is unable to be in total control of something, that's Bitcoin.",

      "body": "You were never expecting such hatchet words and discouragement from a lecturer, right?the same way people want to see every man of God be righteous in all his doings.Professions don't define someone. As you know, in my field of study (Social Science), you are always entitled to your own decision and have the right to quote and prove whatever someone says wrong, provided that you have enough claims to prove your own point.This lecturer who says Bitcoin is wrong is viewing it in a very employment-friendly direction. He is a government worker who thinks everything that his employer says stands and remains the best because the employer puts food on their table. Those kinds of people are not people you go into an argument with.You don't have to feel discouraged or disappointed; you have done your part; you have passed out knowledge regarding Bitcoin; few will learn; few will agree with you; some will also disagree; it is what it is; the son to be in the university is old enough to take his own decisions; if he wants to invest in Bitcoin today, he will; unless all his money is coming from his dad's pocket, he has to obey the instructions coming from the hands that feed him in order not to start answering the name of a disobedient child.We Bitcoiners know what's best for us; we don't need the government to decide for us. They always think staying at the top means they know everything and that all their decisions are best for the people. I don't actually believe in the word \"illiterate.\" Saying someone is illiterate sounds mean to me. People are all educated in different aspects of life, and there are those who are enlightened based on their findings within their surroundings and locality. But their only lack is exposure to western education; I don't regard them as illiterates.",

If BTC is banned in a country, it is very difficult to use it and you may get yourself arrested if you do so, but i don't think there is ever going to be a massive ban of BTC around the world. BTC is a censorship resistant and permissionless currency, but you would not want your government to turn against it completely, it would be a problem for people that use BTC in your country.",

It's government that decides that who will get good thing and who won't. And, people who oppose the decisions of the government will either be jailed or defamed badly. That's a bitter realty of the system and we must have to swallow it either willingly or unwillingly. QuoteThis is what I get from a lecturer of a university in my country, I was trying to teach some students about Bitcoin and crypto, I was forced to even do it because I have been busy with my business for the past one month now, a good year this 2023 has been for my business, but these students have been calling me to come and give them some lectures about Bitcoin so I did this yesterday.One of the students have a father that's a lecturer and after I got home this student told me that his father said that the government is the only thing that can decide if a currency is fit to be people's currency or not, if the government says no then it's a no, coming from a lecturer this is so sad. You did very well in educating them about Bitcoin and crypto-currencies as all the students have the right to learn about Bitcoin and its potential in this busy world. However, I must say that the lecturer is also right in his place because it's government that decides to make a currency legal or illegal tender. It a government puts strong regulations on a crypto-currency then it would be impossible to trade that crypto in their jurisdiction.QuoteHis son have an interest in Bitcoin and now it's left for him to make a choice, I am only surprised how a lecturer can be this dense, something that should be coming from an illiterate. I don't know if this will impact the other students too because they are all from the same school but I do hope I've not wasted my energy, I spent 2 hours talking about Bitcoin and the Blockchain. If his son has interest in Bitcoin then he will find a way to learn about it no matter what his father or someone else told him about it. The discouragement can't stop someone from learning about a new thing but in most cases it works in the opposite direction. You haven't wasted your energy because those 2 hours of yours will change the life of many of those students. The eager ones will surely come to you to learn more about the currency and the technology behind it. You should also guide those students about this forum if you found them interested in Bitcoin.",

The government must have a reason why they ban something because it is their function as a government, to manage and ban things in their territory. However, if you live in a country based on democracy, you can determine what is best for you. Even when the government says they are banning Bitcoin, you can still choose to use it and there is nothing wrong with that. But of course there are consequences for this and you have to be prepared for that. But as far as I know people who use Bitcoin in countries where Bitcoin is banned have not been arrested, only those who use Bitcoin for criminal acts have been arrested.QuoteOne of the students have a father that's a lecturer and after I got home this student told me that his father said that the government is the only thing that can decide if a currency is fit to be people's currency or not, if the government says no then it's a no, coming from a lecturer this is so sad. If we talk about the conditions in today's society, it is true that it is the government that regulates what currency is best for their citizens and maybe this teacher is referring to this. But like I said, you can still use Bitcoin even when the government says it's not good. It all comes back to each of us, whether we agree or not with the government. You can give a deeper explanation in this matter to your students.QuoteHis son have an interest in Bitcoin and now it's left for him to make a choice, I am only surprised how a lecturer can be this dense, something that should be coming from an illiterate. This child is not always small, one day he will grow up and be able to determine for himself what is best for him without being influenced by other people's words. Maybe in the future he will become a Bitcoin enthusiast like us, who knows. But for now maybe he will still listen to what his father said. And you should stick with your stance on teaching about Bitcoin and Blockchain and how these benefit in everyday life. I'm sure that someday out of all the students you teach, some will jump into the world of cryptocurrencies and become one like us who believe in Bitcoin and Altcoins.",

Their was a certain time which the central bank of my country gave directives to all banks to ban accounts that have been linked to cryptocurrency, everyone was scared so that their account won’t be affected, but people were still making use of bitcoin then, i was even surprised because bitcoin got more popular in my country then.Quote from: Outhue on May 07, 2023, 08:36:00 AMOne of the students have a father that's a lecturer and after I got home this student told me that his father said that the government is the only thing that can decide if a currency is fit to be people's currency or not, if the government says no then it's a no, coming from a lecturer this is so sad.

Guess what happened, the crisis came and it became increasingly difficult to access to USD and other centralized assets, people turn to exchanges and Bitcoin and now it is embraced as part of the economy, in an informal way. In the end, people that talk like that other lecturer do not know the merits of Bitcoin because he never gave it a try or because in his eyes he does not need to.

Of course, we can use bitcoin without government permission, just like investors living in some countries, bitcoin is banned, but they can still invest.

You are wrong in this concept of yours, and the boy's father (lecturer) was correct because only the government of a nation has the right to decide what can be accepted as a general currency, of which though Bitcoin is a digital currency it's not of any nation. However, Bitcoin came as an independent global currency that could be used as a store of value and transaction, of which Although lecturers or professors still don't believe in it doesn't mean it's not legit, and used as a store and transactions from people all around the world.

The authority of the government in each of these countries absolutely must be carried out by every community, but even though these rules are absolute, it does not mean that people cannot invest in Bitcoin. If you only invest in bitcoin, that's fine, as long as there are no rules that absolutely prohibit bitcoin. I think most governments have made currency from scratch and made the currency legal to be used as a transaction tool. So the conclusion is clear, that indeed the government has the authority for this matter, and this authority is absolute. And don't let it become an obstacle for your students to start investing in bitcoin, because these rules have no effect on bitcoin, because bitcoin is universal and is a very valuable asset.",
