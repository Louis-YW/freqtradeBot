  "content": "cttoIt is just announced a few hours ago that Casimero will be back in the ring against another Japanese fighter in Oguni on October 12 at Ariake Arena in Japan.The good thing about this card is that many Filipino fighters will be fighting in the undercard.Will update the OP once there are available odds and updates about the subject.",

Instead, I would just anticipate Casimero having an impressive victory to further fuel people's excitement about a potential match between him and Inoue.You can check the rankings here: https://www.boxingscene.com/rankings.

Though some stakeholders of that company might be Koreans but sure there are Japanese owners in that company so biased judging won't be an issue here and besides we all know how Casimero fights in the ring, he is an aggressive fighter that i think a 50-50 round would favor him because of his activity.I like Casimero to be called the Japanese Slayer to somehow lure Inoue to fight him in the future to avenge the loss of his compatriot.",

Aside from that, Oguni had not fought for over a year and might have ring rust from inactivity.  So I think Casimero had all the advantage in this fight.",

As a result, I don't believe he has faced quality fighters like Casimero has. Furthermore, he is no longer undefeated, having experienced two losses – one via RTD and another via TKO. Considering these factors, I wouldn't be surprised if Casimero wins by KO in this match.I had hoped that Casimero would face a more formidable opponent, but this one seems to be more of a tune-up fight.I've been trying to find the betting odds, but it appears that they are currently unavailable.",

At present, Oguni has been inactive for over a year now and he is fighting an active 3-division champion so this should be an easy win for Casimero.Some are bashing Casimero's level of opponent but I'm just happy that he is making himself active. I am confident he will get his title shot next year so he better stay active and fit.",

Hopefully, there's another one in store before the year concludes. While I wasn't aware that his opponent is a former champion, a glance at his record doesn't make it seem as impressive as Casimero's. Let's wait and see. I'm hoping Casimero will persist in calling out Inoue during post-fight interviews. Of course, this assumes he emerges victorious in this contest; otherwise, challenging Inoue would seem premature if he can't defeat Oguni.",
