  "content": "We made https://btc.usespiral.com, which lets you look up the balance and recent transactions of any Bitcoin address, without revealing to the server which addresses you look up. We use homomorphic encryption to process your query without being able to learn anything about it. The point is to let you keep your identity (IP address) isolated from your money. We are scaling up this website into a production API, and adding support for more detailed transaction info and other blockchains.An academic paper about the scheme underlying our site is available here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/368.pdf. We're working on a whitepaper about our Bitcoin address lookup system in particular.If you have feedback or ideas on what we should work on next, let us know! We are thinking of trying to generalize this into a \"private RPC\" protocol, but we're not sure how valuable that is.",

We use homomorphic encryption to process your query without being able to learn anything about it.This is nice for a change... I had a quick glance at your website and noticed it appears to have a minor bug that doesn't fetch recent tx data for addresses that currently have a zero balance.- Since the address field shows \"bc1...\", am I correct in assuming it also supports taproot addresses [I couldn't find one with a balance to check for myself]?",

Hi blintz.Can you tell me and maybe prove if you are the owner, developer or part of the team that created usespiral explorer?I already created a topic about this explorer few days ago, and I will lock the topic if you somehow prove the ownership.This is topic I created before:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5413459.0Quote from: blintz on September 13, 2022, 01:45:04 AMIf you have feedback or ideas on what we should work on next, let us know!
