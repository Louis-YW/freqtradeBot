As for trading, this forum can be enough too, but some people like to refer people to where they have much control because they want to later introduce a paid service which some newbies that join at that time will see to be good until they try paid signals and see it failing for them as they lose.Quote from: Jayminat on March 20, 2023, 05:41:49 AMEverything is free here !! We don't have a premium group and will never have one . Everything is shared with everyoneThat is good, but I do not always recommend telegram group except newbies have known how it can lead to scam by impersonation and also knowing the introducing paying services, which are only scam. There are many of the telegram groups that start as free but later become a paid one that are collecting money from newbies and later the newbies see it as scam as they lose. It is actually a scam though.As for me, this forum is enough for investing and trading discussion, but some people may find other places good too if they can avoid scam, but I highly will not recommend telegram groups.Quote from: GreenStox on March 20, 2023, 08:06:44 AMbut people will doubt you, because you saying you have less/small experience in crypto, you not say that when you promote your channel.Small experience with dealing with what is related to money, I think that should be avoided.",

In order for someone to listen to your signals and join the group, you need to tell about your professional knowledge and confirm with statistics of your successful trading, if any. Otherwise, anyone who joins your group has a high chance of losing their money.",

You are right, we need a plan, but we don't need a mentor or a signal channel, thanks for providing it, but I don't think everyone on the forum will need it. All of us here are used to doing everything ourselves and don't need any help by providing a signal because we believe that no good meal comes for free. It's good if you can build the team by sharing knowledge and experience rather than signals.",

Since most of us like to stay in the forum and don't want to visit channels that we're not yet familiar with. It's best to give those predictions and signals that you've got on that stay in this thread. And from there, you'll get to show what you're up to, and everyone we'll see if you've got good accuracy and you're proving us wrong with what we're saying about trading signals. Because in reality, most of them are truly the same and do have one goal and aim from their community and members. If you know what I mean, you'll understand why everyone is thinking that it's just a useless thing to be part of any trading group if no informative posts are there and just mere predictions and shills.",

From some of the comments I've seen, the channel doesn't have many members so it's safe to say that the channel was just founded by you. I'm not trying to be negative about you, but from my experience some channels are established free for everyone. But as they get bigger, they'll try to charge, and I've seen a lot of them. I hope you don't if one day your channel gets big. Hopefully you can also provide education there, not just share trading signals.",

I would suggest to increase the frequency of your calls if you it's actually about trading, i mean updating atleast daily status of Bitcoin would be something bare minimum. Even if it's a fundamental analysis long term investing group it's always a good idea to share current scenarios of old trades on daily or alternative day basis because these days market is slightly dynamic.",

I find this super annoying.We cant blame out some people on this forum about having doubts out of these groups which we do know that there are really groups who do really ask out for some sub fees on which its not really something that worth or recommendable and this is why people are really that allergic whenever there's someone who do really convince out to use up their TG groups.Based up on what OP had been said that its free and you could really have your own DYOR which is good because there are informations and learnings which you could getfrom someones advises and analysis but of course it do always falls out according into your own analysis too.",
