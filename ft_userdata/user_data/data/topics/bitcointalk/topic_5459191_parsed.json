  "content": "Binance is offering their own debit card, with which you're given a cashback ranging from 0.10% to 8% per successful transaction, no matter where this transaction has been conducted. 8% is absurd because it requires you to hold over 600 BNB, which is impossible for the average investor. However, you can receive up to 2% to 3% cashback for 1 and 10 BNB, respectively, which is a reasonable amount of BNB to own, provided that you're interested in the BNB coin itself.Cashback is usually a feature of credit cards; I've got no clue what percentages and what kind of incentives are offered abroad, but using my credit card, I'm getting 1% of all purchases in commercial stores in Greece and abroad and 3% at a specific gas station franchise. Thus, Binance's debit card is able to offer as much as 2% to 3% only by holding 1 to 10 BNB; the latter is a decent amount of money indeed, but my point is that the average credit card out there doesn't give out such a large cashback. You can even receive cashback for paying taxes and, generally, any random purchase.Is Binance's cashback enough incentive to hold and stake your BNB coins on their exchange, or do you prefer decentralized methods, such as the Metamask wallet, Beefy, or other similar platforms?",

Not very different from staking the BNB but it's got to incentivize someone. While they see people not already interested to hold coins inside the exchanges, this can be a solution. Institutions like these kinds of investments and you can see how interested they are with ETH which is the same L1 as BNB.",

Why, because the value of exchange coins depends on the existence of exchange itself. If exchange suddenly disappear, their coins will also lose valu and even your holding them on your own wallet will not cover you from the loss. By this logic, holding bnb on Binance for getting cashbacks is not a bad idea.",

      "body": "Well, I guess they are trying to copy what credit card platforms do by doing promos such as cashback and the rewards thst the user gets is depending on the tier list that the user is in. To be honest for me it's a pretty small offering given that it is on crypto, I think it's on the same level on some credit card offerings. You can also increase your credit score by using credit card but if you support the idea of BNB, maybe use it rather than creditcard. Both creditcard and BNB knows your identity anyways.",

If the market turns on BNB then Binance will be called for countless margin calls and it would instantly destroy their business. It seems they’re now playing games to try and stop that from happening. I’d be hesitant to hold BNB. Interest won’t matter if your capital disappears.",

Cashback incentives might not be attractive but who cares? Because this is a good exchange that offers a cashback and even if its a small money only, that can still be consider as a cashback or a big discount for your spending. I’m holding BNB for different purpose anyway, so far its good.",

For people who are already holding BNB in their personal wallets, they can take advatage of this cashback, after considering the risks of course, but the thing is holding BNB anywhere is a risk on its own, so if they can earn cashbacks from the risk they are already taking, then it's a no-brainer. Having said that, what makes no sense is if one is going to convert a good coin they own (like Bitcoin) to BNB in order to earn from this cashback, that's a pretty bad decision.",

Perhaps if they could up the cashback percentage to the smaller holders, it might push them to use the debit card.I'm not sure where you're from and what kind of incentives credit cards provide there, but 3% cashback isn't that insignificant, it's the most I'm able to get from my credit card and only applies to petrol, and as someone who's regularly using my car, the cashback quickly adds up. It's not necessary to use your cryptocurrency to make purchases through Binance's debit card, you can even use fiat currencies or even stablecoins.Quote from: Wapinter on July 09, 2023, 08:38:18 PMHolding any coin on any exchange is not advised but I believe exchange tokens are exception to this rule.

Thus, I don't see why it's a bad idea to hold BNB and take advantage of the debit card if it's useful for yourself.Quote from: shinratensei_ on July 10, 2023, 12:13:31 AMI see this as some kind of gesture that they are trying hard to make BNB retain its value in the middle of lawsuit.moreover the fact that the requirements for getting such cashback is to hold BNB and as you said to get the most cashback it wouldn't viable for average BNB holders kinda speaks for itselfthe binance very purpose of gaining and increase holders of BNB.I'd say they are trying to make BNB stronger with all these programs and event coming from binance, but then again the lawsuit involving them should really be of concern first.The cashback incentives isn't something new, it's an old feature and I remember it from the first day I signed up on Binance, which is quite a few years ago.
