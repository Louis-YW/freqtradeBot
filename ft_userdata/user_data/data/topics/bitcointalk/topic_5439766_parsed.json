      "body": "Well, for me, I would choose that gambling is more safer now than it was in the old days, the reason for this is very simple, like the op referenced something that happened in his area where someone was murdered in cold blood, issues like this have been from the very old days, many have lost their lives through gambling offline because smart phones with internet connection was not common back then, also, online casinos were very limited if there was any one at all in the first place.Back in those days, our fathers had no options, but today, we have lots of options that would help us not to get into troubles while gambling, and that to gamble online, gambling online have even become more interesting than going to a live casino, this is for me though.",

We are not sure, perhaps we haven't heard or no one has reported a gambling related crimes in the past that's why we say or have the impression that gambling is safe in the old days as compare to today.But with the advent of internet and casinos started to go online, crypto based of fiat, so I guess we gamblers are safe at home playing and there are no threat if we win big money. On the other hand, KYC is asked, casino's might not pay you your winnings if they suspect that something is not right and other reasons that online casino might pull off. So there are trade offs as well.",

Online gambling has its pros and cons and I'd say that it's more addictive than gambling at a physical casino but your physical safety is as high as it can be and if you decide to play at a licensed casino you at least won't get scammed. The only problem you're facing nowadays is the game itself.",

I count what happened in that case as the days before Internet and online casinos are invented, Knowing that gambling back in time has been linked to various criminal activities throughout history as i read before about the famous Charles Ponzi who invented Ponzi Scheme started his scheme in part by his desire to pay off gambling debts ended up with worse results.For online casinos that are still scamming people obviously they never cared about their reputation, they still have customers and advertising to get more victims every time and we have examples in our forum",

So im just wrong believing that the word \"SAFE\" was pertaining about on the risk level but its not since this do talk about security on ones self literally.If we do speak about winning huge amounts whether on online or offline then there's always the risk but we cant really deny that winning big on a physical casino would be imposing up that risk which might result on abducting or killing you due to having tons of money.Somehow there are ways which you could really be able to avoid yourself on such scenario on where you could always have the option to be with somebody that would be securing you out on getting away on the vicinity without any problems.As for online casinos then sticking to most reputable and known platforms would be the best bet to make.",

Just remember that being \"SAFE\" in gambling can't be applied most of the time as we don't have any control over any situation. We should just need to adjust and try our best to be safe or if really too worried about safety, then minimize gambling outside and just focus on online gambling. In short, being a lowkey gambler.",

Incidents like the one mentioned used to happen in localities where people play within themselves placing bets.You are right though, like I said in my comment earlier, the act of fighting or killing a person or even people in the course of gambling is not a thing of today, infact, such crimes have reduced greatly due to the kind of technology that have come to the gambling industry, in the old days, when online gambling was still in our dreams, crimes as this as well as stealing was very common, even, the perpetrators can carry out such crimes activities in broad day light and end up not being caught.So indeed, technology have brought a good level of security to gambling, gambling have become a business for so many not so strong people, in the past, a weak person dare not try to make gambling their hobby, they will be killed in no time.",

But these crimes will do really come when someone is known to have bunch of money and those suspects are really pursuing to make a crime, so when an online gambler comes out and he bragged it online on how much he have won. There's a tendency that some robbers might attack him for being showy on how much money he've got when he gambled.
