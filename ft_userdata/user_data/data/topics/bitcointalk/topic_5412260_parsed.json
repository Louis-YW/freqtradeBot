You can still order the \"Final Edition\" limited edition.Quote from: jerry0 on September 03, 2022, 07:51:05 PMDoes this also mean anyone that has a nano ledger s would eventually need to get a nano ledger s plus or x in the future?  I know lot of people from years back bought the nano ledger s and store their coins there.  But is there any concern now that because this product is discontinued, it won't work later on in the future such as there won't be any firmware updates for it anymore? Ledger might stop providing software updates at some point in the future. No one knows when that's going to happen. You will always be able to use your device with older versions of Ledger Live and Electrum.Quote from: jerry0 on September 03, 2022, 07:51:05 PMDo you recommend everyone with just a nano ledger s now buy another hardware wallet such as the nano s plus or the x and just input their seed phrase into the new hardware wallet and no longer use the nano ledger s anymore or there is absolutely no need for that now?  Why would you replace it if it's still functional? By the time the Nano S becomes unsupported, there might be a ton of new hardware wallets to choose from.",

You could have been reading that first, really...Quote from: jerry0 on September 03, 2022, 07:51:05 PMSo apparently I do not see this available in ledger website anymore.  So this has been discontinued?  How long ago did they stop selling it on ledger website?Afaik it's not discontinued yet, meaning that for a while (at least the EU legal 2 years) they should still offer support for it.Quote from: jerry0 on September 03, 2022, 07:51:05 PMDoes this also mean anyone that has a nano ledger s would eventually need to get a nano ledger s plus or x in the future?  I know lot of people from years back bought the nano ledger s and store their coins there.  But is there any concern now that because this product is discontinued, it won't work later on in the future such as there won't be any firmware updates for it anymore?Yes, sooner or later it will most probably get discontinued and if vulnerabilities are found, then using the old device will become unsafe.At that point it will be recommended to buy another HW (from Ledger or not).Quote from: jerry0 on September 03, 2022, 07:51:05 PMDo you recommend everyone with just a nano ledger s now buy another hardware wallet such as the nano s plus or the x and just input their seed phrase into the new hardware wallet and no longer use the nano ledger s anymore or there is absolutely no need for that now?  Now? No. Not yet, by far.",
