The first rule is that every scam announcement looks so shady that even its creator doesn't really believe in it, so \"girl/guy\" has to say, \"We don't cheat\" or \"We are not scammers.\"",

      "body": "You sound like a cult leader tbh. What exactly are you offering here? A pump and dump group? An insider trading group? A group that helps exchanges manipulate their trading activity? Crypto bankers and financial teams are so ambiguous you might as well call them crypto scammers.You mention margin call, but do you actually understand it? What do you mean by that? Why would anyone deposit money to you when you have no background, no company in the business, and no profile at all? At best, you'd just attract another scammer to participate in your activity. Hopefully no one is dumb enough to give money and allow some random dude on the internet manage their trading activities.",
