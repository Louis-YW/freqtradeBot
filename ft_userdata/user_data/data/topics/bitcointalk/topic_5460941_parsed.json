I think it contains a lot of history and bitcoin culture in it. Even if the full game never gets completed. The demo serves as an important collectable as the first bitcoin game. Gkad i was able to grab one of the demos and ill be watching for the full game. Now i just need a game boy although i probably wouldnt play it just watch the you tube version..lol",
