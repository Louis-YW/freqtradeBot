Even with an Antivirus installed on your computer your funds stored in your online wallet can still be hacked and stolen, use a PC that is disconnected completely from the internet and will never be connected to the internet, that is a safer way to go about things.",

Do you have some recommendations?There is not guarantee that an antivirus can stop that because on cases like keylogger your connect wallet can be compromised too. So the best thing is to use a Linux OS like mint or debian because most of this malware’s are associated with Windows OS. Make sure this PC remains offline but if you have just one and you want to use it for general purposes then you can’t create a two user interface having one for general purposes and then the remaining one for crypto related purposes which will not be used when the PC is online. Edited, go through the link provided by Charles-Tim",

Visiting legit and correct URLs, do not download torrent files, block ads. If your computer is on auto-download, change it to manual. Malware comes from what you are downloading. Best to protect yourself from malware and you can use ublock origin extension for ads blocking.

Not that he wants airgapped device. If you mean he should use airgapped computer, it is not wrong, but he has a hardware wallet.Quote from: Zaguru12 on June 30, 2023, 09:06:21 PMThere is not guarantee that an antivirus can stop that because on cases like keylogger your connect wallet can be compromised too.

      "body": "Antivirus software is not essential for a hardware wallet. This is because transactions are initiated from the device itself, not the wallet software. The software is merely used to send commands to the device, and transaction approval is done directly on the device. Therefore, you can verify all the transaction details from the device itself. When it comes to wallet software, relying solely on antivirus protection may not be very effective. Hackers employ various methods to compromise wallets, often bypassing antivirus measures. It is advisable to use a hardware wallet for enhanced security and to safeguard your funds.",

Their presence even makes my gadgets more prone to hackers and other malware so I do not bother using any but there are some that are being mentioned here like Avast and the Norton antivirus can be fine but that does not guarantee the safety of your personal computer or laptop as the case may be. I try my possible best to keep the system that I use for storing my assets away from too much internet connection and also avoiding clicking and excess downloading of unknown links into my system.",
