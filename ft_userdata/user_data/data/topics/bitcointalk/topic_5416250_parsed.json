Maybe a hard wallet where you can have the control over it?I'm not familiar with that thing called bank wallet, but if it's more about a centralized bank then I think it's still not advisable. Hard wallet seems to be the most effective way to secure your cryptos, you just need to protect your private keys and you can be good. Connecting it online though is still fine, hard wallet are more secured since it needs the approval of the physical wallet itself, and it will be hard to get hacked.",
