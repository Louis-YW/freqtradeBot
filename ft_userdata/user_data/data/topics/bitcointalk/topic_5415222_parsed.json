Which coin is more closer to BTC in all form? LTC or Doge coin? Also is any of these project have something in common with BTC? Litecoin is very close to the bitcoin rather than doge coin. I think that ethereum was also very close to the bitcoin. I meant in term of marketcap but almost any crypto has same usecase like bitcoin these days to be a payment system in the crypto. Litecoin has something common with bitcoin. I think that litecoin is very very close to the bitcoin caused by this coin already called as silver in crypto.",

I think Dogecoin, because the Dogecoin community is also very large, even as big as Bitcoin, and Bitcoin also doesn't have the same founder characteristics as Dogecoin, so I choose Doge if Bitcoin will die in the future, but talk about my next Bitcoin I don't think it's possible, because dead Bitcoin is just bullshit.",

Why would we compare apples and oranges guys. Obviously for every other coin the principle of working is similar, using blockchain while some work with PoS and other work with PoW they have nothing much in common with bitcoin. We have been comparing various coins and before this ETH dominated all the child coins out there. Nothing similar except they formed as an alternate to bitcoin, thatâ€™s what they are called as Altcoins.",

But there are some things that have in common, between Litcoin and Dogecoin can be mined, just as Bitcoin can also be mined. However, Dogecoin does not have a limited supply, maybe in this case Litecoin is the same as Bitcoin which has a limited supply. The PoW protocols of Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin are of course different, even though they are both PoW.",

So you can say Bitcoin is their ancestors, in a sense of the codebase. A little bit deeper their mining algorithm is differ, Bitcoin uses SHA-256 and the two coins use Scrypt. If you compare communities, surely bitcoin has the leads, and people perceive Doge as a meme coin a Litecoin as a more smaller form of Bitcoin, in sense of BTC as gold and LTC as silver.Looking at the backbone of their networks, there is no one that beats bitcoin decentralization, how much the hash power, the community grit to protect what essentials, and how many nodes that is operated. From the underlying technological aspect, I believe LTC and Bitcoin are continuously improved, one major difference is that LTC has more privacy-preserving technology of MimbleWimble, while Bitcoin does not. Many more could be compared, so if you meant something, you might want specifically address it.",

While Dogecoin isn't even compared or called near to bitcoin.By that means, if that's the comparison that you wanna hear then it's LTC that's more closer to bitcoin. Although in general, if it's about realizing and analyzing them, they're totally different from bitcoin.",

Are we talking about supply? Technology? Use cases? This is a very strange question and there is no such thing as a \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer. Well, with that said, Litecoin and Dogecoin are both cryptocurrencies. Litecoin emerged in 2011 as a fork of Bitcoin, whereas the Dogecoin was launched in 2013 and is based on the Shiba Inu dog meme. Both coins were created to build upon Bitcoin's foundations, so they're definitely similar.",

Litecoin is the first one to test it out and see how it is feasible and if there is no problem. And then they are going to roll in out with Bitcoin later. Doge nah? it's just a meme coin.",
