But recently some of the BTC holders gave it a meaning like \"hold on for dear life\". I'm not sure when it started but that's now what they mean.HODL is associated with Bitcoin as part of the lingo to use. GameKyuubi seems to be here still, the last time he logged in was July 20, 202. He must be Hodling tight still.",

It's mad also how many things have came from the forum, and have basically caught on outside of it. This term has been used my several major news sources, and I'm pretty sure the BBC did a article explaining what it meant. I'll have to see if I can find it or if I'm just misremembering that. This forum is covered in history like this though, which reaches well beyond just the forum.",

In any case, it became a word of its own with its special context and meaning. Thanks, op, for noticing that it's the anniversary. Hodling is still a good strategy, especially if a person knows that they are a bad trader. And the author of the original 2013 post is right that if the price is low, it's a good time to buy and hodl. As we're still in the times of the bear market, perhaps this reminder will motivate some to grab this opportunity.",

If we only knew how insignificant the 2013 crash will be in the big picture none of us would ever panic in 2014 or 2015 and those were some really painful years with Chinese bans and people preaching death of bitcoin.
