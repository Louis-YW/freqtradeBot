  "content": "How do you feel when you are told that someone is a school dropout, or divorced? Or that the person had a child at a very young age (say 14,16 years) or worst of it he/she had a leaked seks video? It's always common to judge such people and even if you feel sorry for them, the moment you see them again, the first thing that comes to mind is that he/she is a dropout and you might even start looking down on them.The truth is, these are not situations people will normally want to find themselves in but the reality is that it does happen, and most times when it happens the stigmatization from people around can cause serious depression that if not properly managed can lead the victim to make a bad decision.Because of these,1.  people remain in failed marriages because they don't want to be called \"divorced\" and face serious trauma all by themselves 2. Young girls see abortion as the only option to cover up from being seen as a bad person for becoming pregnant at an early age. This has led to so many deaths in the process3. Young students become seriously depressed in school because they know that society will look down on them if they drop out and so they endure the abuse and pains inflicted by lecturers and a faulty educational system that isn't even working.People are very quick to judge and I think we as a society need to embrace the certainty of circumstances. That you got married before becoming pregnant doesn't make you a better person, that you are lucky to have a good partner doesn't make the other who ran out of his marriage for his life's sake a bad person.Life is very unpredictable, the least we can do is give our support and a helping hand to people in facing these life realities.",

You drop a mind blowing opinion. accepted but i don't like the idea of doing what makes you happy.  i prefer to say. people should be honest to themselves. As you choose to do things that make you happy, don't inflect others with pain. Don't make decisions solely because it suits you and not the other person.  if things are not working out between you and someone. point it out. Learn to know when life conditions are learning process and when stupid ideas clouds your mind. it is difficult. Life is difficult.",

Seeing the education system in Nigeria amazes me because if you no longer have money or your parents are not wealthy it is very hard for you to make it through, 4 years course has turn to 6 years course.

Dropping out of school sometimes is not actually that they people don't have the finance to continue their education it might be that there mentality is on something else and continuing their education might make it difficult for them to meet up their goals on time.Whichever way it is, it is important that we have a primary knowledge of education as the world is a global village and obtaining a higher education can possibly enhance your exposure to a better future.Unwanted pregnancy are caused by indulging in immoral sex before and I advise that people should continue to have sex before marriage it should be done with protection as sometimes because of the nature of man and woman it is difficult of staying together without having a canal knowledge of each other.Divorce cases have been on the increase over the years because of lack of contentment by couples. Like instead of couples to plan together on making a better future for themselves they start seeing flaws in each other and blaming themselves for minor misunderstanding. And one of the causes of divorce is also being in a relationship for too long before marriage. As soon as they get married they are already tired of each other during courtship as they don't see anything new in each other again which may make there love for each other to diminish. In the old days most of our parents doesn't have canal knowledge of who they're gonna be married to their marriages were mainly determined by there parents so after they get married they start building there love towards each other and there love becomes stronger as times goes on making it difficult for them to disintegrate irrespective of challenges they might encounter during their marriages. And again people should stop getting married because of the benefits that the marriage can offer them rather they should get married because of their love for each other and building there future together as husband and wife.",

No be dropout for school to end up creating nuisance for streets or joining bad gangs wey go d thief or dupe people of their money. If you check the number of people wey dropout from school, majority of them don commit themselves for one bad business to the other in search of money. We know sae our country itself don fail us. As per person go spend years for university finish, come graduate and em no get work join after all the years, money and stress wey em pass to get a degree, still yet no available job waiting am. Upon all that we still get millions of Nigerians wey d graduate, year in, year out with hope of available job waiting for them(wey be sae millions of people wey graduate years back never get). On top that, them go still go meet those dropout for labor market controlling and working under them. That's the funniest part of it. Since a graduate go now turn out to serve a dropout. As this thing the continue d go so, people are beginning to find school as a waste of time and resources, since peso go kukuma end up serving under peso well em d educated pass.

Yes I agree with especially with your last sentence, loving one another should be unconditional, such that we should be able to extend help when we have the opportunity to help others, there is also this saying that someone you help today can as well help you tomorrow.

      "body": "School drop out: is not a bad idea if the student drop to get a skill or on a financial ground. When the resources are not longer available or one lost his parents and no means to generate funds to continue the school it's advisable to drop for and get busy with other skills then later you cab continue the school. But if its in the ground of poor academic performance then its a shame to the person.Unwanted pregnancy: just as the name  implies its unwanted and should be kept for any reason. Except you are ready to have a child. Even marriage couples do abort when they really don't want to have a child. So there is no shame in it, just get a good doctor to do it so you won't cause a harm to the girl.Divorce: Is most talk about in the country right now, my lawyer friend told me there are more Divorce case in court than criminal case. Yet people are getting married every Saturday, it's quite unfortunate people just marry just for wedding ceremony there after they will file for divorce. Our young ladies no longer have patience in marriage every disagreement they will seek for divorce. One must be careful and know the person you about to marriage to. Because people just meet and marry without knowing each other well.",
