(for those who are using cold-storage set-up)Those mentioned are not an issue with the current bundled Electrum in the latest release.Quote from: canudinho on November 02, 2023, 11:56:03 PM-> There is also 1 especial point that I am confuse yet: Some people say they faced problems trying to recover the coins from a really old electrum wallet... why is that? what do I have to do for not having this problem in 10 years from now?Those was the wallets before a critical bug in the wallet's key derivation function.The fix made those very old seed incompatible with the later versions, it'll work but will derive a different set of keys.But that was, as you said \"really old\", in v0.31 (Dec 6, 2011) and another upgrade in v0.34 almost on its early stage.In the mature versions or even after 0.34, all seed phrases have been compatible with the latest versions.I don't expect any incompatibility patches with the seed unless there's actually a critical bug with the current Electrum seed.",

Hardware wallets are (in general) safer, unless you never go online with your Tails Electrum that holds your seed phrase. You can use a separate version of Tails that goes online, and has a watch-only wallet. But that's much more work.So before doing this, you should decide what you want: Privacy? Safety? Both? Or a combination of both, depending on how much is in each wallet (a small hot wallet is convenient, a large cold wallet is safe).",

A temporarily disconnected machine is a distant second. Ideally you would run this on a permanently airgapped machine, paired with a watch-only Electrum wallet on your main computer.Secondly, be aware that Tails has no persistent storage unless you configure it as such. With no persistent storage you are completely reliant on your back up to access your coins. Make at least two, and store them separately.And lastly, the version of Electrum which is bundled with Tails is not frequently updated. Tails is currently bundled with Electrum 4.0.2. If you want to use the most recent version for any reason, you'll need to download and verify the standalone appimage.",
