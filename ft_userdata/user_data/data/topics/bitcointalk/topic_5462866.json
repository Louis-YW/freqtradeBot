But definitely spend enough time on forums and learn a lot about Bitcoin. If there should be knowledgeable and quality posts and proper suggestions then it is possible to get merit.I entered your profile and you only made 25 posts. Out of 25 posts I don't think one post merits. So you learn first then try to reach higher level. So I think OP you should acquire a lot of education it is not possible to earn merit by creating all these topics. Therefore your topic may become offtopic.",

I began to feel whether some members are afraid to give merits to others but since I learnt that smerit expires I was like why not give to encourage a post that hase brought so many people together bringing opinions than just hoarding it ... it's of no use if you're doing so. ...(message to higher ranked members)OP keep posting relevant stuff I'm sure you'll get merit so much as to take you to the highest rank soon.",

Just try and read all the post links you have been directed to and you will see from months to come, when you start improving you post quality and making good contributions merits surely will be given.
