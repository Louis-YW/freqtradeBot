It belongs to the people and is a medium of exchange and store of value for the people. What the traditional financial world thinks of it is irrelevant. The same is true for the government. It was and still is P2P electronic cash. So, use it as such.Good luck!",

Actually that is the million dollar question and every one of us would like to know the answer to that questionÂ  No one can give you an absolutely correct answer to this question, and it is actually part of your responsibility to analyze the market in detail before making any investment and find the best investment option for yourself.I advise you not to rely too much on the advice of others, because everyone has a different situation and experience, and different investment plans.There is enough information on the internet so I suggest that you first learn to do market analysis and based on that and your personal goals and financial capabilities make an investment decision, and it is also important to have a clear exit strategy.",

Yeah, the OP's second post makes it seem like he is curious about the current state of the crypto market and if it is a good time to invest. But, after reading his first post and the title, my first thought was that he is more concerned with the regulation of cryptocurrencies around the world. I totally agree with you on being careful when talking about investment stuff like this. No one wants to be accused of convincing others to invest or miss out on a potential gain. The crypto market can be a wild ride, so anyone thinking about investing should do their own research first.",
