  "content": "I've noticed the loyalty programs of online casinos ranging from withdrawal limits to bonuses, but they're not as enticing as the local casino's slot clubs in places like Las Vegas Casino and Caesar's casino in Atlantic city for instance, that offer comps to active players; free hotel rooms, food, shows and events etc. We play online and how can such a club be useful or achievable? shipping comps to players for time spent and money lost playing online isn't it a strong marketing technique for an online casino that wish to boost its customer base and attract more players? Was wondering and even researched to see online casino slot clubs, but didn't find any. Do you belong to a slot club offline or online? Maybe the free playing bonus represents that for online casino, yet players complain how difficult it is to win playing with bonus. Do you think online casinos should step up and offer items to consistent low rollers in their platform?",

But, it seems such VIP programs would take a high roller to get to such level on the club. However it's impressive.",

Being on online platform is their way to promote convenience for the players. Also, they are already paying for the overall maintenance of their gambling platform alrwady as well as offering discounts and bonuses in order to retain and attract new players in this industry. They cannot give that much such as hotel room accommodation as an additional, because it would be loss on their end to happen. There are many gambling sites which do exist at the present and their edge over one another are bonuses unlike with landbased which are battling over compensating their big players thru services. So maybe, since online and landbased casinos are two different platform, there is a different market competition as well.",

Sending out some comps? It is really truly opposing anonymity and privacy considering that people here on crypto space doesnt really want for their identity to be exposed which means that it would really be just that be on this way on where people do just simply accept it out.If ever there would be new promotions and bonuses then it is good but applying out with those offline-like compensations then it isnt something thatcould be easily integrated.",

I think online gambling casinos should somehow incentivize its users in consistently playing on their platform. But remember that this is one of the features that online players suffer when playing on this kind of platform. They suffer the consequences of NOT experiencing the complementaries being offered if you visit a physical casino, but the drawback is the convenience of playing anytime online.I think I remembered someone posting on a Reddit Watch board where the gambling company sent him one (1) credit where he would be able choose a watch for free (e.g. Rolex, IWC, Omega, and other luxury brands) as a way of saying gratitude. Though he did disclose that he spent like $100,000 on a monthly basis. Personally, I do think that online casinos should at least give more on this kinds of offers, not just withdrawal bonuses and deposits.",

When it comes to offers and events, I think they are trying so hard that it's difficult to find a new offer for their players. Stake.com have a nonstop event for their players in either casino games or sports gambling. Events like \"first to hit a multiplied amount\" for slots, and double winnings for sports gambling as long it's under the terms and conditions. Let's give them more time, perhaps they are also thinking about what else they can offer their loyal players. For now, I am satisfied with whatever bonuses I can receive.",

Most likely it will not give the return that the casino deserves.I support the fact that they need to recognize the players who really invest their money and time in the casino, in order to keep the already loyal players always interested in staying on the site, because if there are no such rewards, then it is very likely that it will to another website.As for occasional players, I believe that even if he receives some reward, he will still be an occasional player, who has low activity and will hardly generate a return to the casino.",

Yes, they have to step up if they want to keep their players because eventually there would be other online casinos that are willing to take that risk first if it means gaining more players.It might just be my preference but I honestly think the bonus money that some online casinos are offering is the way to go for the low rollers because it gives flexibility on what they could get than receiving a specific item or prize. I don't mind if they provide a different prize because you might as well take it when other casinos barely give out any rewards regardless if you play regularly or not.",

It's a marketing ploy to retain a wealthy customer and nothing more.Its certain slot clubs are for marketing purposes, but it wasn't made for only high rollers. Low rollers also make it to the point where they're allowed to sleep 2 nights free and eat good foods. It depends on consistency and how many hits the player makes in 24hours. Even some casinos offer lots of coupons to people that rarely visit the casino, but belong to their slot club. The slot club card work in different ways to keep players in the casino and to attract them to visit again in future. In a nutshell, a low roller can get comps too, the problem casinos owners face sometimes with low rollers is that they may not play games after being given free nights, free show tickets, and food, which is a bad practice. Though some players claim that they won't play if the casino replaced their machines with low payback machines.",

I think that free rooms and food, tickets for various events are given to those who are members of the club and wager a lot of money. In the end, it's all about the wagering. And in some crypto casinos, top VIP levels get tickets for cruises, hotels, various trips, and events. But we need to wager millions to get there... maybe that's why it's good to stick to one casino, over time we can get high even with some smaller bankrolls and some decent bankroll management skills.",

Besides, said bonuses are actually planned out, with the casino themselves receiving partnerships of sorts with said hotels, restaurants, shows, you name it. So they profit in both ways, online, I doubt people would be willing to redeem said bonuses even if they were made available simply because that's just how \"online\" casinos work. And even if said bonuses were described as \"hard to win\", well, that's just how slots go. I doubt they'd add a modifier that lets people win more with bonuses. As for adding more, I fully agree with how they need more variety of sorts.  But unless one casino steps up to do so, I doubt anyone would actually follow suit.",

No need for free hotel nights as someone pointed out, if not I would have also recommended some hotel like Marriot that enable worldwide bookings. Well, they're no comparisons, its just like comparing the bank to bitcoin in terms of existence and money made from people. Yet the online casino is not as strong as the offline casino regarding age and government connections. Though nobody knows if the market would change in future, nothing beats giving back, no matter how little, to players these are practices that can boost the online casino's audience.",

In the end, casinos keep themselves in business thanks to the high wager people can accumulate, and thus it is good to reward high rollers.Besides, one cannot ignore that there are differences, between an online casino and a resort casino, some resort could easily afford to offer some low wager gamblers a free meal or a room for a night (specially out of holidays seasons, when vacancy is high), since the price of the reward to the resort is very small.On the other hand, for an online casino, those physical resources are not so accessible and it would require them to actually invest some money in logistics, deliveries and related expenses. I am not against the idea of some small rewards, though, but the profitability of the business cannot be ignored, after all, who would not like an online casino to send you an burger to your home as reward for your activity?",

They could be run from a single small office on the opposite side of the world. Somebody is paying for all those freebies and it's almost always the player that has lost a substantial amount of money, enough to cover all these supposedly complimentary things. If you lose $200 and they can throw a $100 hotel room your way to let you lose another $500, that makes good business sense. Online casinos and sportbooks offer all sorts of better value promotions, plus you are more in control of your spending, if you choose to be. You have the odds presented to you in a much clearer way as well, allowing you to gauge how badly you're being screwed on certain games.",

I see a lot of online casinos offer stuff that aren't really loyalty programs per se, but almost always acts like one if you'll ask me. For instance, VIP programs on some online casinos offer the same benefits as one would receive had they been added to a live casino's loyalty program. So as of now I do think there's no need for casinos to include some loyalty programs, although soon as the market calls for it, because as we all know, seasons change especially in the gambling industry, I'm pretty sure they'd keep up with it and would include said feature wholeheartedly, but as it stands today, they don't see the need to do so, and would not do it as a result.",
