      "body": "You will need to do a lot of reading in other for you to learn about bitcoin, it’s simple if you dedicate little of your time.  [General] How to earn Bitcoins   [General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why? One thing you need to know is that bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick kind of thing, and there's no time that's too late for you to join. Now that you have made up your mind to start owning bitcoin, you need to start wherever you can. You can start by getting yourself a wallet in which you can save your bitcoins, and you can start DCA in order to accumulate what you can before your desired time.Read and learn about how to protect your wallet, as you are your own bank. If you mess with it, there is no means of recovery, and if you are careless with it and your key gets in the wrong hands, your holdings will be gone.Buying and holding bitcoin is safer when you hold it in a wallet that you have control over; saving in exchange is highly advised against. Below are a few bitcoin wallets that are also recommended for use in this forum, as well as many other ones.Electrum official link: https://electrum.org/#homeDownload link: https://electrum.org/#downloadBlue wallet: https://bluewallet.io/",

I want to know about Bitcoin and how to benefit from it.With the way people talk about Bitcoin, it shows that Bitcoin will turn to a major project in the future. I just want to have a place now. Even if I am late, I know in few years time, I will be earlier than many people.Please I need help on how to learn Bitcoin and grow here. Thanks.You're welcome to the forum, I'm also very new to the business, but still a bit older than you so that puts me in a position to give you some pieces of advice. My few weeks on the platform has really changed my vision and thoughts about things, I've learned a lot, although still have more to learn because we learn evryday and learning never stops. I can't teach you everything about Bitcoin because I myself don't know everything but from the little I know, I believe I can give some good tips as a newbie in the Bitcoin adventure.1. LEARN ABOUT BITCOINyou need to learn as much as you can about Bitcoin, you'll not be told everything here so you can't rely on one source to learn about Bitcoin, read books, watch videos, look for helpful articles and PDFs that'll give you more insight about Bitcoin.2. START LITTLEIf you ever feel that with the knowledge you've gathered, you're ready to start investing in Bitcoin, as a newbie I'll advice to start with little amount until you've really understood the market then you can put in more money.3. KNOW THE NATURE OF BITCOINYou need to be familiar with the fact that Bitcoin is a very volatile asset so before you start investing you need to be ready for the ups and the downs. Sometimes you'll experience a DIP, in times like that you should remember that there has been times in the past that Bitcoin has experienced even greater DIPS to help you overcome the fear and anxieties of a DIP and to also help you make the right decisions of never selling during a DIP, and also when you experience a Bullish Trend in Bitcoin, you shouldn't always expect the market to always be like that, else you might end up being disappointed.4. STORE YOUR BITCOIN SAFELYI'll also advise that you look for a very safe wallet to store your Bitcoin, such as a Hardware Wallet. ( Highly recommend). Because that's the primary thing, if you're jeopardize the safety of your Bitcoin then you jeopardize everything as well, including the safety of your investment.5. WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMERSScammers are working tooth and nail everyday, coming up with new strategies and innovative technologies just to swindle people's hard earned money so you need to equip yourself with enough knowledge regarding how to avoid being scammed because if you're not careful you can loose your funds to a scammer in a twinkle of an eye.6. LEARN HOW TO DCADCA simply means Dolar-Cost Average. As a Newbie, you might feel Bitcoin is very expensive now and hard to invest in, if you're thinking that then DCA method is for you, with DCA you can store up enough Bitcoin without breaking a sweat. It's process where you simply a bit of your income, be it on daily, weekly or monthly basis, you can choose a percentage of your earnings and use it to buy Bitcoin, just like putting money in a piggybank and before you realize it, you must've saved up enough Bitcoin for yourself, rather than waiting to have the money in bulk before you can invest.And it's never too late to invest in Bitcoin, everytime is the right time, so if you have plans to invest, don't let anything stop you from joining the moving train. There goes, I hope these tips would be of help to you.",

I am saying this because, in today's world, friends with a good mindset are so rare they will come up with ideas to waste life and time but never will lead you toward anything good. Bitcoin is not going to be a major project in the future but it is already a major project, in simple words, BTC is the king and the first coin made ever. All other currencies are known as ALTs and that's for a reason. I will suggest, if you want to have a place in BTC bull run then buy some, but don't spend money by borrowing money or spend only what you don't care to lose. This line might be confusing for you, but believe me, it does not mean we BTC investors don't care for money. We do but I meant to say only invest that money that if lost, will not affect your life.",

The fastest advice I can give you goes as follow.. 1. Have a job that's bringing you some money, there is no mercy for jobless people in crypto space, with money things will be a bit easier than not having at all.2. You need a lot of patience, zero your mind from desire to make money for now, focus on learning, and if you want to hold anything as a beginner I suggest you should buy Bitcoin.3. Before you start buying anything, you need to choose a crypto wallet, so research on open source wallet, non- custodial means you are in control of your recovery seed or private key, if you don't know what these are it's part of the reason why I said you need a lot to do research on.4. From the money you are making from your job, you should use some percentage to dollar cost average into Bitcoin, maybe per week or month, which ever is convenient for you.Do more research on how to keep your crypto wallet safe from hackers and scammers and also make use of the search engine on the top right corner of this forum, many questions you have might already be answered, type in anything and read through them to gain more knowledge..",
