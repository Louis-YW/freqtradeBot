First of all, I have to talk about Binance as it is one of the world's best exchanges user can also store their fund even with having so many risks in centralized exchanges but they also hold their fund in Binance. And Kucoin Exchange is also used by different traders to get some good trades there because it also has a good trading volume. If the number comes about the Bitget then no one can say that bitget is not good, because it has even a strong security as compared to many exchanges.",

You know, highlighting the importance of building users confidence in the crypto industry is of paramount importance most especially with the recent happenings of hacks, shut downs etc. So if there are exchanges such as Bitget and maybe others who are committed to this course through increasing their protection funds, then it's okay to point it out. Some Investors are on the lookout for a lifeboat and as you've mentioned, not all exchanges has this feature.",

If they are still the ones who had been holding or in control with those funds then its not really that totally a user protection on which we know that it is really just that a BS thing on what they are trying to claim here. We've seen that this cant really be just that possible if we do speak about security. There's no guarantee that those funds wont really be that used or would really be able to experience those kind of possible unauthorized transactions. As long it does have  that central authority, there's no way that it could really be totally secure.This is why we should really be that attentive on whatever things that we do able to read up online such as this one.If you are curious then it would really be just that wise that you should really be making out further research and trying to find out if there are current existing and dont easily believe on whatever claims that these platforms been saying or making. Using up your own common sense would suffice on trying out to see whether it is really that possible or really just that simply bullshit thing that they are claiming.",

Few years back there was nothing like PoR and user protection fund but FTX collapse opened a new portal for exchanges to be more transparent in their dealings. Moreso some exchanges are now compliant with different country regulators but we still a couple evading it. If Binance didn't have protection fund, perhaps many users will have quickly removed their money from the exchange after the allegation of money laundering against CZ so Bitget also growing their own protection fund is a welcome idea but of course still need to do better. I think their security is also good because I haven't heard about any hack on the CEX.",
