Any other difference between them?Bestchange is that an exchange monitor which displays rates from different exchangers, and you will be able to pick up the rate which is most favorable for you.For example, today, there are even more exchangers on the listAnd the rates are also equally more competitiveMost of the exchanges on the list will definitely require KYC verification if the transaction is suspicious. Please, you can check out each of them if you don't mind. The warnings are usually on the home page or under the Terms of Service.",
