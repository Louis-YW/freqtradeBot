How to know the real potential of these new projects?This is a common question but many failed to look for the right answer because it is not really 100% when you got the answer it concludes everything rather it came from speculations and some sort of real-life experience but might not gonna work for you. In other words, you to spend some little time reading the history of successful projects and some failed projects to conclude your decisions in making investments and also read some preventions on how to spot fake projects that are creating pump and dump coins.",

How to know the real potential of these new projects?At first glance, you'll have the basic information that can help you determine if they're good with what they're working it. I agree about looking at the team and the whitepaper. If you have those information of what they're planning together with the roadmap and the team. You can analyze if the people behind the work are really good people and has a history of working with good projects. Usually, they've got linkedin profiles and other social media accounts where you can check with their way of sharing and posting through their accounts you'll have the idea of their interests.",

How to know the real potential of these new projects?Several factors to consider when choosing them,  - team behind  - support/exchanges - purpose/applicationHowever, even if the said project has all of these things not in certain to think that it will succeed. Investors are also wise and they somewhat need to see the project first to show some significant rally before investing making a new project is really hard to grow.",

How to know the real potential of these new projects?Well i would say that at the moment it is relatively quiet and slow with the launches of new crypto projects, which is not really a surprise because we are in a bear market and there in general small and new project are doing way worse than big and established projects. And new projects that have not even launched yet are having an even harder time at the moment because the interest of people into investing in such projects is just extremely low usually.If you still want to invest into a new project then you should check the whitepaper, the team, the roadmap if it makes sense and of course also the tokenomics. How many token does the team get how long is the vesting and so on. Even the best project can fail if the tokenomics suck.",

How to know the real potential of these new projects?Right now the crypto market is slow, with lots of new projects launched at the moment. Unfortunately, this makes it hard for projects to attract attention and interest from investors. You can help make a difference by doing your own research into a project before investing.",

How to know the real potential of these new projects? Truely speaking at the onset nobody can predict correctly about the outcome of a project. Most of the projects start with very high hopes and they eventually turn to a failure or scam, the reality of this sector. It is better to be pessimistic here since 99.9% of projects will be like that only. Dont expect a newly launched project to be in the top 10 coins list in the next 2years.What you should check is an intrinsic market making capability - the ability to spend their coins for services which are actually useful and in demand. This creates the scarcity for that token and hence the price will rise in the long term just like bitcoin. This is lacking in most projects that have been launched till date.",

We could actually see hints if a project has a good potential from the beginning especially if they're showing a good road map, is being handled by a trusted team and they have active platforms where we could reach out to them and see updates regarding their project. Sometimes even if a project team is reputable, the project still tends to fail so we have to see the capability of their project and how it could all the market tests that it could face.",

My same answer to the question that was repeatedly asked here in the Altcoin Discussions. Let's not waste time about forcing to know who the team behind a project when they say they are trying to be anonymous. If they don't want to be recognize then leave it with a red mark and move on. Look for a new project that are not shy about exposing their faces and profiles. Your chances of having a successful investment is partially relying on that. The roadmap should be checked meticulously too. This is where scammers could go wrong by making an error on their roadmap. Somehow you will save some time if you find that mistake. Partnerships. Do check the reliability of it. Many put names of companies that looks good in the name but there's nothing behind it.",

I see many of the reasons you listed very appropriate but team doesn't really matter for me if they have highly reputable and technical personality but are unable to show it in lifting the project , that is why number 2,3 and 4 are very necessary to look at. If a project is not developing, not achieving different mile stone it means the team is not committed to the project. So if the project has lasted for a longtime without doing well, you need toreconsider these factors before investing.",

A good roadmap can't be the main reference, sometimes some scam projects take another project's roadmap and turn it into a convincing new roadmap. All can be manipulated well. The crucial thing is that the development team posted is of course all fake if it is a scammer's project. Detailed research needs to be done, scammers are now getting smarter to manipulate anything, so we also have to be smarter.",

Go deeper and check things like the website, the team, the tokenomics and how they are going to be distributed and if there is going to be locked up system so that they would not dump them on you and other investors later, check on the validity of the teams and their background, some of there display sometimes it usually fake that result to scam sometimes if you are not vigilant.",
