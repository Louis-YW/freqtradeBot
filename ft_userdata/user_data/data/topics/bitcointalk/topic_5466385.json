      "body": "Thanks for your reponse Loyce!QuoteIt sounds like you're planning to create a custodial wallet. That goes against everything Bitcoin stands for, and handing over private keys to someone else is the opposite of \"security\".No private keys ever touch our servers. While we do enable you to make different types of encrypted backups, such as on your keychain or using social recovery. But these are opt in.QuoteWhatever you're sending, it's not Bitcoin. Unless you're sending funded private keys, but that would be terribly insecure.It's Bitcoin. Though you're right: when you send to someone not on the app yet, you're sending a payment link with a pre-funded private key. It's swept immediately upon onboarding.QuoteThere are no \"single-use addresses\" in Bitcoin. You can choose to use each address only once though. And transactions can still be linked on-chain, even if you use each address only once.It's an implementation of Stealth addresses. It derives a single-use private key based on the shared secret, recipient's diffie-hellman public key, and recipient's root public key. And a single-use private key based on the shared secret, recipient's diffie-hellman private key, and recipient's root private key.Quote\"Social recovery\" is terribly risky. Backup your private key or seed phrase, and be your own bank. That's how you backup Bitcoin. You're right it's not a silver bullet, but it could be a good option for some people. We'll offer different recovery methods, both \"single player\" and \"multiplayer\" like social recovery.QuoteWhy didn't you start with this? I have a really hard time believing you can do non-custodial social recoveries, so please start by explaining the technical details.This is not live, but our latest design is: Encrypt private key with recovery contact's public key. Store on your Keychain (using iOS in this example). To recover, you need access to your Keychain and the approval of your recovery contact in the app. We also have a version using email, where the key is split among your recovery contacts and encrypted with a code emailed to you.Let me know if you want to give it a try!",

If I don't have any trusted persons, won't this be useless? Sure I can make and manage e-mails on my own, but it would be troublesome and the risk would be high. CMIIW.",

And a single-use private key based on the shared secret, recipient's diffie-hellman private key, and recipient's root private key.This sounds exciting, but in this case the meta-address must be shared between the two parties after the first one derives a single-use private key, so how will it be shared? Will it be through the application or will an additional encryption layer be provided to exchange meta-address/secret?It's true that this will enhance privacy but other data like transaction fees and transaction broadcasts are shared publicly so without solutions like Ring Signatures, and RingCT I don't think you'll get good privacy.But AFAIK, I do not think that there is a wallet that applies the concept of Stealth addresses.Quote from: jjopus on September 11, 2023, 08:46:30 AM- Sending, easy as a text: Make instant payments straight to your phone contacts, whether they use the app or notIf you were to use Stealth addresses here, this would add additional complexity, as the user would need to download your application. Otherwise, anyone can receive Bitcoin, they just need to generate a Bitcoin address in any way.Quote from: jjopus on September 11, 2023, 08:46:30 AMYou're right it's not a silver bullet, but it could be a good option for some people. We'll offer different recovery methods, both \"single player\" and \"multiplayer\" like social recovery.I see that you are trying to apply Vitalik Ethereum concepts to Bitcoin wallet. Social recovery is one of the solutions proposed by Vitalik Buterin[1], although I am not convinced that it is implemented well.Perhaps developing an open source Android app might help us a little in trying it out.[1] https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html",

It seems the transaction will associate phone contacts to phone contacts which means the privacy is exposed. I don't want my BTC transactions associated with even email address but you are asking me to associate it with my phone number?",
