That feature protects users from leaking their seeds to third party keyboard, some of which might be malicious, and I 100% support it. Better safe than sorry.

AFAIK, it basically means you don't have any more output to spend to increase the fee. It is not a new change at all. CMIIW.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2651778.0",

      "body": "You have chosen \"Preserve payment\". This means Electrum will not change the amount(s) you are sending to the output(s) of your transaction, so any additional fee has to come from another input, but your wallet does not currently contain a suitable output which can be used as another input in to your transaction to contribute additional fees.You have three options if you still want to bump this transaction using RBF:1 - Send some more coins to this wallet in order to create a suitable output which can be included to bump the fee.2 - Swap from \"Preserve payment\" to \"Decrease payment\". This will reduce the amount(s) being sent to the output(s) of your transaction, and use this money instead to pay a higher fee.3 - If you want to \"Preserve payment\" and not have to make an additional transaction as in Option 1, then manually create a transaction including an additional input from elsewhere to pay a higher fee and sign it separately. (You could also do this option by importing all the necessary private keys together in to the same wallet, but this carries the additional risk which comes with handling and importing raw private keys.)",
