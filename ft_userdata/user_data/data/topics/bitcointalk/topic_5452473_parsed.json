  "content": "Hello all, We are launching a new memecoin on ETH. I am looking for social media manager and someone who can run the marketing campaign for the proposed memecoin. I had previously acquired services of someone from this forum for social media handling and it turned out great. I'm looking for a re-run of that. Looking for media managers for a new memcoin. If you are interested and have a portfolio of a previous coin you have marketed, please get in touch. Regards.",

      "body": "What meme coin will you be launching? I think right now meme coins are really hard to market. Because the competition in it is very high. At least you have to prepare capital to create prize and airdrop campaigns. And because this is a coin meme there are currently a lot of coin memes in the market. This is like throwing a needle into a haystack. It also needs luck for your coin meme to be found and attract people's attention.",

But you have to be careful with all the meme coins that have been scattered so far.",

      "body": "Launching a new memecoin requires a well-thought-out marketing strategy and a strong social media presence to create awareness and generate interest among potential investors. A good social media manager should be able to create engaging content, interact with the community and effectively manage multiple social media platforms to promote your memecoin.Then, running a successful marketing campaign involves targeting the right audience, leveraging multiple marketing channels, and monitoring the results to further optimize the campaign. It is important to have a team with experience managing social media accounts and running marketing campaigns for cryptocurrencies or other projects in the blockchain industry (bounties).To find the right person for the job, you can try doing bounty programs like the one on this forum. Job boards like crew3 or now zealy, or even on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter and Reddit.",

Yesterday I found maybe 50 or so meme coins like Shrek, Ladys2, Mario, etc and many were pump and Dumps which ended up rugging most investors.The proof is how the fees are much lower and PePe crashing from its peak at the listing. I don’t think you can make any money anymore with meme coins. You are just too late. Crypto Moves fast.",
