  "content": "Hello everyone. I've got a problem that I haven't been able to solve for a whole month and I was advised to write to this forum since there are really knowledgeable people here who can help or advise me on what to do.On July 6th I won 7148 DOGE at scammer BitcoinPenguin Casino https://www.bitcoinpenguin.com. I never got the money.The casino didn't require verification, and before that, I withdrew money without documents. But when I put this amount on withdrawal, my account was just blocked! I wrote to the chat, but the reason for blocking was never explained. I wrote a review on LCB.org, and the case was opened there. Representatives of the site contacted the casino, and they claimed that my account was closed for anti-fraud purposes. Can you believe that? What a stupid reason! They are the fraudsters because they won't let me withdraw money! I don't want to mess with these scammers anymore, but I want to get my money! My account was completely clean, I played transparently and just for fun. And not only did they block it, but they also accused me of fraud!   People here have probably faced similar problems. What should I do? How can I get justice from this scammer casino?",

      "body": "Lots of casinos are becoming bullsh*t nowadays, blocking/banning accounts without giving reasons become more common to them. Unreasonable if they provided too. Well, cannot say totally since people can't do about it (particularly complaints without proofs) and when they already decided to close or what they want to the account. To those with the hostaged funds in the account, i say it's robbed and should be charge to experience then move on. Use only casino that is reputed and trusted by many.",

Yes, it's my mistake to play in a casino that has a bad rating, I admit it and will never repeat it again. But the situation remains the same - my account was blocked due to some completely ridiculous reason and I can't withdraw my winnings. I understand that I have to be more careful about choosing a casino, but I need help and I hope that one of you'll be able to give me valuable and effective advice! In turn, I will tell everyone who does not know yet - DO NOT PLAY AT BitcoinPenguin, THEY WILL SCAM YOU AND TAKE YOUR MONEY!!! THEY WILL ACCUSE YOU OF FRAUD AND IGNORE YOU. NEVER PLAY THERE AND DO NOT PLACE BETS!!!I attach a screen linkhttps://freeimage.host/i/Utq4st",

Well sorry to sayNo one can be able to help you here since the website is not rated from here and coupled with them not having a Ann thread where we could lodge your complaint for their representative to respond on the thread.  I believe most casino site here, some managers have direct contact to the CEO which might likely take immediate action to restore the issues at hand.",
