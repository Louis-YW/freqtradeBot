Because whitepaper link on your page leads to telegram channel. In fact most of the links in there lead to telegram channel, even the uniswap buy link. Docs lead to medium blog .But if this is going to be an announcement you should move this to here and make this a proper announcement. If you are looking for opinions of your web page/project, you need to provide more information.",

And as said by o48o, almost every hyperlink on the website takes you to the Telegram chat. I understand that the project is still under development but I believe if that was the case, you should have published it when everything was set.There are no docs, no whitepaper, limited information about the roadmap no dates, etc. Also, do you have any link to prove the partnerships mentioned on the website?",

No one will fallow a startup that looks to be 10 days old. Web is not ready, product is not ready, product is not even tested ... There is only a concept of how it could look like and a promise of almost printed tokens. Way to soon.

But, when you do that, no one knows you are at the top. So, the bot is telling you that you are using an AI for trading. It doesn't need any data to prove it, it doesn't need a lot of data. So, the bot will just give you an idea as to how to do that. And we will be working to make that bot",

The market does not need new projects, but rather real ideas and serious development.",

I personally believe that AI projects will still have it's spotlight on the bull market. Actually I that AI project had launched on a good time where they can still make development about their product. But there are projects that took advantage of the trend and launched their project to gain funds and further scam their investors. We will see next bull market what AI project will be on top of their game. Just be careful on investing as scam projects are increasing nowadays just like this one that shows inactivity which is a big red flag.",
