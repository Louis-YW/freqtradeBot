  "content": "Hi,i have a L3+ Hashboard (v1.413) which is not detected. I measured some casual points with a strange behavior.i got 2.8v at the 14v circuit aswell as 2.9v at the 10v circuit. i also checked some ldo's - in is mostly about 0.7 to 0.8 but the out is less than 0.3..i had a few hashboards before with broken circuits but all of them had 0 or 10-11v at those circuits. I never had such appearance so some help is much appreciated  https://s20.directupload.net/images/220816/nmbp424l.jpgcould anyone gove me some hints on how to proceed measuring and understanding what could cause the error? i am good in soldering but not that good in electronics Â best regards and thank you =)Edit: i already checked the control board aswell as all cables.",
