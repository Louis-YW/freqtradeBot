  "content": "i came across the new citadel node the last few days, which can be operated under the same hardware requirements as the umbrel node. also the web-if looks very similar to the umbrel version and one of the differences is that citadel is much more open source...citadel was started by an ex. dev of umbrel...if someone here already has the citadel node in use and also maybe has or had an umbrel node, feel free to post your experiences here https://runcitadel.space/https://github.com/runcitadel",

Was going to post about it but got busy and forgot till I saw your post.To tell the truth I was also slightly annoyed at their attitude.Also at least some of the 1st lines of text in the umbrel github tell you that it's not secure and give a link to why.QuoteUmbrel is currently in beta and not considered secure. Please see SECURITY.md for more details.In several places unbrel mentions it's beta and you can lose you funds and so on.If it does exist in citadel I missed it. But, once it would not run I didn't look that hard.Will give it another shot when I get a RPi freed up for use.-Dave",

The guide for x86 is still rough.Yes, I was trying in a test VM and bare build. To be fair I also could not get umbrel to run with any form of stability either.I am fairly good with linux, but these 'nodes in a box' really seem (or in the case of umbrel seemed, the just did a lot of work with the x86 have not tested) to be built around the RPi world and x86 is a afterthought. Even mynode which has a PREBUILT VM image that you can download seems to have more issues with that version then their SBC based ones.

It's at the bottom instead of the top. And it's saying that things may break. NOT that it's insecure which umbrel fully admits to.Could just be it's still early on and they are tweaking things including code comments and so on.-Dave",
