      "body": "From what I understand there is no pattern it’s random but it’s in increasing difficulty because each iteration is becoming larger and larger.The first few were easy to solve, later they started to use GPUs to find the numbers towards the end. Now it’s extremely difficult.You can do some airdrops if you want to earn some crypto. Many testnets out there which have free tokens and if you test the Protocol you might get rewarded with an airdrop.This is a much easier way than solving that puzzle.",
