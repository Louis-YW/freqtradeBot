  "content": "From the TAU blockchain lab in Cambridge, UK, we build an open-source energy-efficient Phone Mined Coin (PMC). PMC technology enables your phone to mine crypto assets free from linking commercial servers.For example, any phone can mine “London PMC”, which is exclusive to London in the PMC world. Londoners will see the coin natively living in the app and use them for payment, chat and advertisement. The global phones network will secure and grow the city blockchain collectively.TAU's open-source Web3 app brings you the Proof of Transaction mining technology based on groundbreaking server-less communication. PMC, unlike BTC, is a light power option to build crypto assets. It is estimated that each phone can mine 100 crypto cities at the same time!Project info:  taucoin.ioFirst Crypto City OfferLondon PMC- Initial Volume: 1,000,000 coins- Airdrop: 60% for the early adopters.- TAU company reserves: 40%- Mining success reward: 10 coins each 5 minutes, annually about 1 million new coins are added as always.Contact us to receive 50 PMC as income to play the phone mining.  Project Info -  https://taucoin.io (https://taucoin.io/)There is a BOUNTY reward of 500 PMC by taking one action - post this ENTIRE message on your Twitter or Facebook.

      "body": "Quote from: Digitolife on October 06, 2022, 08:01:42 PMMining on phones? Wont this affect performance? Heating, excessive battery drainageWhat is PMC mining? - PMC uses Proof of Transaction consensus. It is the more block reward transaction, aka mining, the more power your phone obtains. Block reward happens when your phone wins a block slot. It is an open competing process based on Log(2, 2 + Current Power) as weight. This gives some advantage to beginners. What is top 1000 accounts as miner? - Version 1 PMC only accept top 1000 balance accounts to be miners. If a chain exceed 1000 users, your balance has to be high enough to be in top 1000 to mine and keep the coins. This does not affect chatting qualification. Therefore, for each city’s PMC, there are only 1000 miners with unlimited followers. - In version 2, this will increase to 10,000 accounts (1000 x 10 shards with 100 replicas), based on IP2 protocol. - In version 3, this will be 1m (10,000 x 100 shards with 100 replicas). Why is forking and unstable balance or power? - Mining competition causes this. Each state need more future blocks to confirm it to be final. We can use TX Confirmation Rate( Current time - TX time)/3Hours as an estimation of state robustness.",
