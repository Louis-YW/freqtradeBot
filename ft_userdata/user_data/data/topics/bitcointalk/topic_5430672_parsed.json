  "content": "I have a Trezor wallet model T . Sometimes I suffer from a problem with pressing the PIN numbers. When I want to connect the wallet to the site, it asks me to enter the PIN on the hard wallet. I press the number, but it does not respond sometimes, or another number is pressed instead, and thus I get an error. This problem occurs sometimes but not always.I thought of the following possibilities:1 - The problem is with the touch screen of the wallet.2 - Because of the large size of the finger that I use to press the numbers (as you know, the Trezor screen is rather small).3 - There is a problem with the firmware.4 - A connection problem between the hard wallet and the laptop.Note: This problem occurs only some times and not always, most of the time I press the correct keys without problems but other times there is no response or the wrong number is pressed.So what could be the cause of the problem?Also, is there a tool to press numbers similar to the stick that was used for touch screens in some types of mobiles?",

If I use my phone when it's raining sometimes random buttons get pressed, I don't know how the Model T works but if it's like the old (either cheaper or more robust) touchscreens that can only take in one input at a time then it might put the touch at the midpoint of the two presses instead of where you actually pressed.1 and 2 are likely, 3 is a maybe and 4 is a definite no. There can't be communication issues between your laptop and trezor causing this imo as all of the decoding is likely done on the trezor if that's where you're inputting.",

This is what I thought about the stylus. I have to check first that the problem is not humidity, and then I think about buying the stylus.

In general, it seems to me that a color and touch screen was used in this device to show that this HW is a premium level and is the flagship of the Trezor. But this only increased the cost of the device, which repels potential buyers and creates problems for those who have already bought, like OP. Why was it impossible to create a device that would be transitional between model One and model T, which would be a simplified version of model T (physical buttons and not a touch screen), but with the functionality of an older model and would have an affordable price. The question is rhetorical.",

I tried that but got almost the same result, there was some improvement but errors kept happening sometimes.Returning to talking about humidity, today I took the wallet out of the box and noticed that there was a cloud on the touch screen, I dried it well and then pressed the numbers to test, the results were good.I repeated the experiment more than once to make sure using the same finger(index finger), the result was good.I need to test it multiple times at different times to ensure that humidity is the essential cause of the problem.",

Do you live in a region where there is generally a lot of humidity or is there another reason for it? How does that humidity affect other electronic devices and gadgets in your home and surroundings? Have you ever experienced similar issues with your phone's touchscreen, for example? What about metal objects, do they corrode a lot/faster than normal. Maybe there is a different (slightly humid) place where you could keep your Trezor T. You mentioned there was a cloud on the screen even if it is kept in a box. Where do you keep the box? Is it lying on an open surface somewhere like a table or a cabinet. Some things I could think of are dehumidifiers, storing the device in hermetic boxes and airtight containers.",

Some things I could think of are dehumidifiers, storing the device in hermetic boxes and airtight containers.   The area in which I live, the humidity is rather high during this period of the year, we are close to the Mediterranean Sea and at this time (December) our winter season begins and the humidity is about 83% while it decreases during other seasons to less than 50%.I keep my wallet in its own box and put it in my own drawer however when I opened it there was a clouds on it, the box is closed but not airtight (humidity can easily seep in).As for the rest of the electronic devices, they are not greatly affected by humidity. For example, I have a Samsung J4+ mobile that works normally without being affected by humidity.Now while I am writing, I took the wallet out of the box and found some clouds on it, I tried wallet without cleaning or drying it, it gave all the numbers correct without error.I'm honestly confused, I thought it was the humidity but now I'm 90% sure it's not the cause.The best way is to contact support, explain the problem to them, and wait for an answer.",
