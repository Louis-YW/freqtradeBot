  "content": "Hi everyone, new to mining. I am preparing to start my little adventure, know about btc but not much about electronics and calculationsI have 1.5/2k Â usd to invest in a btc asic miner, new or used. I was thinking about a used antminer s19 or 2 new L3+, suggest me please considering energy efficiencythen i have a limited amount of free electricity (up to a certain level) given to me by a family person, i estimate 100 kwh per monthI am in just to accumulate satoshis, so not to sell it in order to repay the hardware or billsdo all this make sense? thanks",

      "body": "The Antminer S19 is a good option for your budget and is relatively energy efficient for its mining capabilities. However, purchasing a used miner carries a higher risk as it may have been damaged or may not perform as well, or as long, as a new one, so it is also important to consider that when making your decision. It may be a better idea to invest in a new miner to ensure optimal performance and longevity.",

Validate said escrow among your peers.Do your due diligence and research your potential seller so you dont get scammed. For example, if an eBay seller has a deal that's too good to be true, it probably is.Want to save a lot of time? Just Buy BTC.",
