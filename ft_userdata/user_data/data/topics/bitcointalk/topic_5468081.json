It is safe to therefore conclude the only remaining option would be neutral feedback.Quote from: unibitcoinist on September 25, 2023, 04:46:48 PMHey JollyGood if you have 2 balls (not 1), make this a negative tag or remove the feedback completely. I am sorry to announce I will not open a discussion on the number of balls I have  May I ask, according to your very deep statistical analysis regarding balls, are you stating as a matter of fact that every member of the forum (females included) must have two balls as a prerequisite to leaving a negative tag? Furthermore, are you stating as a matter of fact based on your very deep statistical analysis regarding balls, that every member of the forum (females included) must have one ball as a prerequisite to leaving a neutral tag?Also, are you stating as a matter of fact based on your very deep statistical analysis regarding balls, that every member of the forum (females included) must have zero balls as a prerequisite to leaving a positive tag?Finally, would you be ever so kind as to define whether the balls you refer to are tennis balls, footballs, rubgy balls, soccer balls, US footballs, snooker balls, pool balls, swimming pool balls, beach balls, crystal balls, golf balls, baseballs or some other type of ball.In the unlikely event you are referring to the human body, was it eyeballs, balls and joints or (ahem) testicles perhaps?",

Consider reading: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=you%27ve%20got%20no%20ballsQuoteYou have no self-respect, you are a coward, you can't face your problems like a man, etc.Quote from: JollyGood on September 25, 2023, 07:47:25 PMIt most certainly is not positive or negative feedback. It is safe to therefore conclude the only remaining option would be neutral feedback.It is another example of unnecessary use of Feedback system. These types of unnecessary practices are the root of all problems everyone is experiencing because of you. You don't get it, do you?To be honest it's not your fault, your mental state is questionable. The problem is many members who have you in their trust list do not see it unfortunately. They are still are appreciating the past works you did to bring you today [it could be a part of your plan from the beginning] but unfortunately they do not realize that their trust for you are now is in misuse and causing the forum a great problem. You are causing problem by constantly offending everyone except some very close circle members those are offering their trust.A person can have an alternative account. It's even encouraged by Theymos. There were no necessary for this feedback but to offend the OP:QuoteBEWARE: \"unibitcoinist\" cannot be trusted...",

It's even encouraged by Theymos. Yeah but this guy made an alt account and then entered a contest with it, which is a bit slimy. Looking back at it, figmentofmyass entered 5 alt accounts into that same contest, lol.People make these types of alt accounts because they don't want the chance of retaliation on their main account, so in that way it has indeed served its purpose. However, 99% of the time the \"retaliation\" is due to them being an asshole, not because they are \"speaking their mind\" or \"fighting injustice.\"Quote from: unibitcoinist on May 27, 2019, 05:22:02 PMThis would make sense if you stopped licking ass.Quote from: unibitcoinist on April 22, 2019, 05:34:32 AMI got your fucking stupid intention of merit hunting.

Point is we are seeing more and more such feedback from a very specific person and is doing it carelessly which is causing all sorts of reputation attack.

Looking back at it, figmentofmyass entered 5 alt accounts into that same contest, lol.I was not questioning your feedback although this reference was not on the feedback but from years of seeing you, I believed you had a good reason for that. Now you left no question of-course.QuoteHowever, 99% of the time the \"retaliation\" is due to them being an asshole, not because they are \"speaking their mind\" or \"fighting injustice.\"Unfortunately, that's exactly what JollyGood became for the last few years. You will realize it when you will give some time and read the replies he left for others. There are some common words which he offers to people he wants to offend with of course leaving either a neutral or a negative.",
