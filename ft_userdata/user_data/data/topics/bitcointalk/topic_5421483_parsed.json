As a result, users of the site or those who might be interested in the reviews might be scammed/losers. If the site is a scam still they will receive a 5* review from this user. This should be avoided at any cost.",

Even if a website has top level positive reviews nowadays, you should think twice before using any service from them. This kind of service is definitely illegal. And according to the policy of all other companies including Google, such fake reviews are also illegal. Such service providers are considered scammers and it is safe to stay away from them.",
