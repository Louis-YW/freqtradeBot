  "content": "On April 21st Blockchain Exchange blocked my access to my account and support emailed me the following: QuoteDue to your recent trading activity, we require some further information. Could you please provide the following:Â Confirm your occupationPurpose of use of serviceExplanation and proof of source of funds (for the last 3 months) in the form of a bank statements (PDF format) including the BTC transaction of 0.76077644 BTC into Blockchain.com services on 27-March-2023, in the form of crypto exchange statements or similar. Please explain where you originally purchased or received the funds relating to this transaction and provide supporting evidence.Please explain and provide supporting evidence for crypto funds deposited to your account regarding where (third party platforms) you originally purchased or received these (full transaction reports reflecting deposits, purchases/winnings, and withdrawals for the months of March and April 2023. If gambling platforms were also used then also share full transaction reports from them showing deposits, winnings, and withdrawals together with the betting histories.Proof of source of wealth, in the form of payslips, bank statements showing your salary, bank/saving account statements etcSince I had only been using my Exchange for about a month, never mady any trades and only used it for transferring and receiving some BTC (only about 5 or 6 transaction in total), I felt this was way too much work. So I answered their questions, gave them screenshots of the transfers and told them where the funds originated from.I said I didn't want to provide a source of wealth because I thought it was irrelevant since I never deposited any Fiat onto my account and never bought or sold or traded any crypto.So they said, okay fine, we will review your account and get back to you. And this \"review\" has already been taking 45 days now.....every week I email them for an update and they keep on saying it's in process and I need to wait. I feel like this is having no end.....how on earth can a \"review\" (whatever that may be) take so long when an account has no trades and only 5 or 6 transactions? And the weirdest of this all is that they started their email with \"due to your recent trading activity\".....well, there is NO trading activity at all on my account!Does anybody have any experience with such a review? How long did it take for you? And do you have any advice for me who to contact to speed this up?",

You have to comply.As for the future, make sure to use non-custodial wallets especially if you're not planning to do any trading... there's no point in using an exchange in that case.",

You are not exchanging to any coin, why did you transfer your coins to the exchange part which is different from the wallet?Use a noncustodial wallet for saving your coins. You can use Electrum for that, or a hardware wallet for large amount.",

And do you have any advice for me who to contact to speed this up?0.76077644 BTC is a lot of money. In today's price it's $20,370 for a custodial service it's a lot of money for that the authority ask questions to them. My best guess is the BTC you received has something to do with gambling or mixers. Whoever sent you those funds they used a mixer or send from a gambling site. I am not entirely sure but I read somewhere they have the terms that you can not deposit from gambling or mixers.Try to contact with the person who sent you the BTC, use AML tools to check AML score. These days they are making it difficult so that regular people do not get encouraged to use crypto. Whatever is your case, I am sorry that it seems you are in trouble. Hopefully you will be able to access your coin soon.",

My guess is they will probably release your money eventually long as you comply but who knows what kind of nightmare do you have to go through for it.About your last sentence, I can only suggest making noise in popular crypto spaces such as crypto subreddits and twitter.
