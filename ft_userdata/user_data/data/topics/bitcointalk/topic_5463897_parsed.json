Doctors recommend that if the infection is not treated quickly, it can be seriously fatal, and although it is a rare infection it still causes serve skin, muscle, fat tissue, and nerve damage. These rare flesh-eating bacteria can enter the human body in various ways. Like having a surgical wound, puncture wound, injury, insect bites, minor cuts, burns, or abrasions. The symptoms to know if your body has caught the infection will be feeling nauseated, high fever, serious pain, dizziness, dehydration, and inflammation. However, there are numerous ways of preventing the infection which will be something simple as cleaning your cut or wound with soap and clean water. Do not go swimming at a pool, lake, or beach if you have a skin infection or open cut or wound. By following these steps, you are much safer and prevent a deadly skin infection.",
