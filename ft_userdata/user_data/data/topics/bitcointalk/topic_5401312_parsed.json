  "content": "Hello All How Are you? Let us all know about Bitcointalk Bounty Campaign Manager today. Today I will only talk about those who have been working with honesty and dedication till now. Each of them has a lot of work experience and a High-Rank account.They are all the best which is why I am not doing anything in the form of rank so as not to insult each other. I just shared one profile and work experience after another. Please forgive me for any mistakes.I hope these managers play a very important role for those who own new projects and want to advertise their projects. Below is a brief description of them.ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡Manager name: CryptopreneurBrainbossYou can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!Description: He is a highly accomplished person. So far he has worked on many projects and the projects are very popular with Bounty Hunters. He is a citizen of Nigeria and is extremely hardworking and skilled. He has changed his style of work a lot compared to the past which has resulted in much better results. He manages both social media and signature camping. And his work style is different from other managers.Manager name: HhampuzYou can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!Description: He has conducted many project camping so far and the type of work is very nice. He basically does all kinds of work alone and has a lot of reputation in signature camping. You can take something good from him if you want.Manager name: yahoo62278You can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!Description: He has worked on many projects in the past and for camping in his signature. He is not currently conducting bounty camping but he can give you good output if you want. He has a lot of experience and work ethic in managing bounty camping. He is a very old and skilled bounty and signature camping manager.Manager name: Royse777You can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!Description: If you look at the profile you will understand that it has played a very important role for bounty and signature camping. He has always kept the total budget of the camping in his hands while conducting the camping. The main reason for this is that most campaigns do not pay after the end. So its importance and contribution is enough.Manager name: julerz12You can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!Description: He is now working on many more projects than he used to do. Now he is working on one project after another. The best part about him is that he manages the camping with a total budget in hand. In the last few months he has done a lot of such camping work and distributed all the camping. He is very hardworking and works well.Manager name: MuratYou can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!Description: He hasn't done much of a camping job so far, but he has a good member and a good job. He works most of the time without keeping the total camping budget in hand. Even after that he has a lot of reputation and fame. Of course he can be a good manager for your project.Please Noted: There are many more bounty managers I did not mention here because they have Red Trust and Low Rank account. I only mention those who have High Rank profiles and a lot of work experience. And I have not said anything in a small way to anyone. And I did not mention who is the best, they are all the best.Image Source: Copied from everyone's announcement Thread.",

All the members mentioned have a good reputation and they really do a good job in managing signature and bounty campaigns, but that does not mean that others are not able to do and there are members who belong to the projects that are being promoted and they do a great job without having any previous experience. Unfortunately, they are not ready to run campaigns for other projects.",

A member who did not have a negative history on the forum, and many of us were surprised that he joined a distorted campaign like this one.What happened is that he acted with integrity for two consecutive weeks, only to end up collecting as much money as possible and suddenly disappearing.I don't know how some projects choose a supervisor responsible for covering and sponsoring the necessary campaigns.",

In the past, there have been some scams done by much more trusted users. This only proves that we cannot trust anyone and always protect ourselves, even if the manager has a very good opinion.",

This guy is good but sometime he doesn't need to fully believe with the project that used his service but didn't wanna to escrow the funds. Mostly of scam projects happened caused by he was being fooled by the developers. He shall only accept to manage the project that agreed to escrow the funds.",
