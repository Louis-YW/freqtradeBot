Do yiu have other funds that can sustain you outside you so called Capital? If yes then, I will continue by saying that are you prepared for the two effect of investment? Because we are approaching the bull run and price is raising and falling everyday, it might fall to a level that your $50 dollar may be gone. If you can stand both the positive and the negative results of Bitcoin then you should consider buying Bitcoin but it best to invest when you have a regular income that can help you practice the three strategies of buying which is buying the dip, lump sum and DCA.",

As you know, only high risk brings high profit. Investing $50 in altcoins could bring you a x5 in the next 4 years, but the long wait isn't worth it.Although you have a good suggestion, I think let's not give him an idea about gambling. Yes,  maybe he will get lucky, but the thing is, he only has $50, and I think he is a beginner in this field, so strategizing to gamble will be a bad idea for him. Anyway, OP, listen up. I don't belittle what you have and what you want to invest, but the thing is, or the reality is, that your $50 as a capital will be very hard and limited for you. For example, if you bring a fraction of bitcoin and hold it, I don't think your equity could handle the decrease in price, and if we suggest you trade, it will be very hard for you to earn as you have limited equity to trade and low leverage, so you can earn but a little. But from the looks of you, you are new in this field, so instead, I will suggest that you save up more, maybe a $100 will do, and you can do DCA, where you can bring a fraction of bitcoin every month or two weeks, and also build your knowledge and experience first in this field as this is too risky. I don't discourage you; in fact, I want to encourage you to continue your desire, but first you need to be prepared.",

And I think the people who recommend investing in Bitcoin are people who have experienced the many benefits of investing in Bitcoin so you just need to consider it yourself after you find out about things related to Bitcoin as your starting point for investing at the end of the year.",

You start with an investment of $50 in bitcoins. Since these types of investments are purely personal, many start investing with small amounts in the initial stages to gain courage and trial how to do the investment process.  However you can start with any amount no problem. You can follow the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) method, which can help reduce the risk of investing at the wrong time, as Bitcoin prices can be quite volatile. The DAC method will  you can to gradually build your investment over time. Good luck with your investment.",

And the most important thing is that you use money that you can afford to lose and not using important money is already a good decision.You can start with a small amount and with this you can learn and understand the beauty of Bitcoin, especially in the long term. And when you make a profit, it will motivate you to look for more money to invest in Bitcoin and still not use important or very important money.Since you evaluate and know about Bitcoin from social networks, you should also do your own research because for now maybe the news is true because the price of Bitcoin continues to increase.So, you should do your research and look for good news to convince you, and if you are convinced, it's best to do it now before the price of Bitcoin rises even further, and you end up getting less Bitcoin for the money you have.",

It is good to start small, but don't forget that $50 will not help you to make a good profits that will sweet you like the way those that used $500k $600k in their BTC investment will not get the same result.I know you want to use that $50 to test BTC investment which is a good step that will bring a good results, if you have other work you are doing to earn weekly or monthly and invest half of the money in BTC and, I believe it will motivate you to increase your capital in the future.",

Or do you want us to repeat same thing you have been told before? If so then, I will suggest you invest in Bitcoin, reason been, it's a coin whose value likely to have a gradual steady increase over long period of them, unlike altcoins that has a very high volatility, and likely to fall in value as the years goes by. So invest in Bitcoin, and try as much not to leave your fund on an exchange wallet over long period of time.",

It would be better if you have included about what is your expectations, what are your goal, and how long do you expect for your desired profit to be achieved? That way, people around here could give a detailed answer and walk you through going forward on the $50 as your starting investment. Anyway, if you're asking if $50 investment in bitcoin could get you somewhere, the answer to that is no. Yes, you can get profit but it's not gonna be a game changing one. What I mean is that, you need to consistently buy $50 worth of bitcoin in a weekly or monthly basis until you accumulate enough to maximize your profit in the next 5-10 years.",
