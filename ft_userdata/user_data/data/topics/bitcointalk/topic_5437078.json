RamNode for instance.Quoteand also if there are any free cloud storage devices which offer more data storage ?They don't.What are you looking for? \"Free\" usually requires a credit cards so they can bill you for anything you go over the free limit. Without credit card verification, it would get abused.The \"cloud\" part usually means you want/need scalability, while a \"normal\" VPS is cheaper (but less flexible) if you just pay it for a year. I was recently testing a cloud provider that you can use after depositing $1 in Bitcoin, but there are more reliable (and more expensive) options out there for Bitcoin users too.",

Without credit card verification, it would get abused.Actually I do have 2 free accounts, on two platforms, both over 10 GB. One I was lucky to find out in their early days and they were giving huge space.The other is well known, it's Dropbox. If one starts using Dropbox from a referral, he already gets more than the default 2 GB (gets 2.5 GB?). When I've made my Dropbox account, if one has made certain \"learning\" steps, has got more storage, I don't know if it still happens. But: by getting others make Dropbox account under your referral, you'll get 512 MB (I think) for each new person (I don't know under what limits). Yes, it can be abused if one has too much time (it needs to actually install and run Dropbox for those accounts) . But it doesn't need credit card.So I expect that one, especially if he's knowledgeable and determined, can get over 5 GB at Dropbox without paying and without giving out card info. How safe is Dropbox privacy wise? Well.. I don't have too big expectations.",

How safe is Dropbox privacy wise? Well.. I don't have too big expectations.I do believe that all cloud storages are not safe as they can leak your data or information stored there. Specially we should show no faith for data privacy in free cloud based solutions.But still we have lot of data which we can store on their servers which is not confidential and sharing anywhere does not matter much to us. So that's why i am looking for some free online space for data storage.",

Most free cloud storage solutions will offer you mostly 5GB free space.I found https://mega.nz/ to be the best one as it offers you 20 GB free space (biggest so far) and also, they have a desktop app for easily synchronization. I wonder if it this can serve your purpose and you do not have to spend any money too.",

Can you tell me any cloud storage spaces which accept bitcoin payment and also if there are any free cloud storage devices which offer more data storage ?I’m using mediafire to upload some of my files in cloud storage. It has 15gb free storage and you earn up to 39gb free for every sign up that you can get for sharing your referral link. This platform has a decent speed for both upload and download. Also this cloud storage has been active for so long and I’m using it since my collage days to store my personal files that time. Until now I have those file save on my mediafire account.You can upgrade to 1TB for 3.75$ per month but it only support support bank or card payment. This is the best offer that I knew for a cloud storage with that capacity. https://www.mediafire.com",

That might be helpful for me.As I said, one is Dropbox (after the newbie steps and referrals). Also I said that the other had an early days offer; afaik is no longer for free, although I've found it very reliable over years and I have over 50 GB there: it's called Tresorit.So unless you want to abuse Dropbox to get to at least 7.5-8 GB, you will have to look for new cloud services emerging and offering promotions.Edit: a quick google search gave me this list, maybe it's not a bad idea to try out some of those (just make sure you read the minuses first).Somewhat on this same topic I was eyeing the option for long term backups done on AWS Glacier systems (backups I hope I will never have to retrieve), but I didn't manage to fully understand what are the complete costs, so I didn't try that for now.",

I misunderstood this as \"cloud hosting\" (let's call it professional deformation), instead of \"just\" cloud storage.Quote from: virasog on January 28, 2023, 12:37:55 PMI found https://mega.nz/ to be the best one as it offers you 20 GB free space (biggest so far) and also, they have a desktop app for easily synchronization. I wonder if it this can serve your purpose and you do not have to spend any money too.I've installed their software in the past (because I had to download a large file), but I really disliked it. I just wiped the laptop afterwards for security.How about Your own cloud storage? I haven't tried it, but there are several options out there. Get a cheap VPS and only upload encrypted files.",

There are lot of best cloud storage platform which offer best rate with maximum storage but they only accept Paypal or Visa card. Dropbox is one of them but hence you mentioned that you want to pay via BTC so I think Sync will be best for you.It's package plan is also not Worth and there is two options for you,Team and solo. Solo package start from 8$/month with 2 TB storage and your are free to check and cancel any time. More packages and storage plans can be found in official site.",
