Man isn‚Äôt an outsider of the government and he didn‚Äôt speak against the treatment of bitcoin and cryptocurrency but all of a sudden he is doing so now in almost all this campaign rallies, this looks more like a political campaign strategy to me. In as far US leaning towards bitcoin will surely aid the faster growth of bitcoin adoption because they are the current super house, I still think their decision can‚Äôt crumble bitcoin. Bitcoin isn‚Äôt a dollar thing that they have total control over but a global currency that is adopted without force by its users. Both the Chinese and US governments have been hostile to bitcoin since and still it grows in number mostly in this two countries more, this shows that a national policy against bitcoin or cryptocurrency will only make its adoption slow but will not crumble it.

But the same issues happen on bitcoin they cannot successfully kill it since for sure after those actions they made people will just forget the fud about the possible action made by US government and they continue to invest and make bitcoin grow. To bad old people is not open on financial system improvement and they want people to stick around with old system. If all bitcoin users will protest against those people who want to take out bitcoin on their country for sure on next election they will be eliminated on their seats.",
