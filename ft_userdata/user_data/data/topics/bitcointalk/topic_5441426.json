  "content": "Hi, long time ago I was banned from the forum with the account \"borgobio\".To be honest I don't know why but I didn't care a lot since I wasn't using the forum anyway.After some recent happenings, I wanted to use my account but of course, it's still banned. The banner says:QuoteSorry borgobio, you are banned from posting or sending personal messages on this forum.You have been permanently banned by a forum moderator, probably due to spam or plagiarism. You may appeal here, but your chances are not good: banappeals...@bitcointalk.orgI tried to contact the email address just now but I wanted to know what to expect. Also:Is the \"2020\" on the email address related to the year?In 2021 someone deleted my post and I received a PM but it said nothing regarding a ban: https://i.imgur.com/ZmNhANl.jpg",

      "body": "Judging by the screenshot you posted, it is possible that the ban is the result of the fact that the post contains links to something that someone has reported as malware. That's just my guess considering that the deleted post shares the same date as your ban.Regarding the question about the year in the e-mail address, what I know is that the e-mail addresses for hacked accounts were changed in terms of the number of years in the e-mail, but I am not sure that this is the case for banned accounts as well. QuoteIf you are bannedYour ban message may have an email address which you can email. If not, then appeals are unlikely to be accepted.Recovering hacked/lost accountsYou didn't post a link to your account ->https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=324791https://bpip.org/Profile?id=324791",

There is a chance that your case is similar to that of users getting their accounts hacked and the hacker uses the accounts to post malware in the forum.This cases usually lead to bans.

I also saw some members getting their accounts back after they got banned in a similar way (account hacked then shared malware) but usually they had some trace of their account getting hacked like changed email or password, while in your case I don't see neither of those things. Unless you shared that post and in that case good luck proving that it wasn't malware.",

Expect to be patient and await a response.Also, you have been told the most probable reason for your ban, and that action violates the forum rules and deserves a ban.• If you did share the malware, then do not bother appealing the ban,• If you didn't and your account was backed prior to that, gather evidence of this and submit to the address.Quote from: ishrazza on February 27, 2023, 03:14:36 PMIs the \"2020\" on the email address related to the year?In 2021 someone deleted my post and I received a PM but it said nothing regarding a ban: https://i.imgur.com/ZmNhANl.jpg• I don't see any '2020' in the address.• Deleted PMs carry the same generic message and does not sugges if it resulted in a ban.",

Maybe find a way to show that you have unauthorized access or what not to your device. This is valid if you are really certain that you didn't post it at all. Try to find some unusual activity, unfamiliar emails, browser settings, etc. Maybe you could find something but not hopeful since it was years ago",

Not saying that you did it btw. Quote from: ishrazza on February 27, 2023, 05:04:53 PMI don't have any proof that my account was hacked, neither I have any email regarding changing email address/passwordI just went through Report Malware and Suspicious Links here so Mods can take Action !  thread (that's where malware links and accounts spreading them are shared) a little bit and I found more examples of accounts waking up, not changing pass/email, spreading malware and getting banned so maybe those behind it don't actually bother with changing those because they know that account will get banned anyway so what's the point. Anyway, you might wanna look into that thread more thoroughly and look for some arguments if you decide to appeal via email.",
