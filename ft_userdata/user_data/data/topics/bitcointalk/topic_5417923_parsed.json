As we all know Europe is a very big factor in terms of its global Crypto-currency activities, so a ban to mining mining in Europe would really cause a very noticeable reduction in mining and may also affect the transactions confirmation timing.Although realistically I don't this it's possible to completely ban mining in Europe, it just an informal way to make mining even more expensive and cut out some miners. But this topic would raise eyebrows to the importance of having more energy efficient way of mining",

And enough other places that don't care where you can have mining farms. And lets face it, no matter what you are never going to stop home mining and small operators. If you force the big players out of an area out it just means more and cheaper equipment for others.-Dave",

Keep in mind that in that article they count all crypto mining and not just bitcoin so the actual percentage of bitcoin mining is even lower, meaning it would be even less of an impact.",

So far as the miners are making a profit and they can't just close their businesses, they will just have to move their businesses to areas and places where they will be accepted with open arms. And I don't even think it reduces BTC price in any way it will only slow down the amount of time it takes to complete a BTC transaction a little, which will make not much difference.",

In the term of price fluctuation i think it won't be much aggressive as i think maximum of the captulation is done on JULy and then in September so i can feel that it won't effect any much.Lets watch as i was expecting some good News but here it is one more bad news..

Which means that they could get away with whatever they want without a problem. Normally you would expect them to face this energy spending miners with open arms, because they are great customers right? But they have done nothing for them at all, absolutely nothing. Which shows that we are also a threat to energy sector, why? Well because miners could kickstart the \"self energy sufficient people\" movement, where if you are a miner, you could get solar panels and cover your expenses, people seeing that at work could do that at their home, and their friends who learn more about it could do that too and it could grow super big. This is why miners are a big risk to energy companies.",

In the coming winter season, it is important for governments and citizens there to fight (should be successful) against the energy crisis and energy war from the Russia.The war and the exploitation of Russian government on gas, fuel as their most powerful and effective tool to create pressure on Western governments, together they make the societies in Western countries become worse and more chaotic.With all of sudden arising pressure, I can understand when Western governments have to enforce more stricter regulations on energy usages as well Bitcoin or cryptocurrency mining. It is one of their temporary solutions to reduce impacts from the war and Russia to prevent worse energy shortages in the Winter.The war won't last forever, the energy crisis and dependence on Russian energy resources won't last forever. Mining industry will see sun-lights at the end of tunnel, at the end of the war. I believe in 2023 Winter season, things won't be bad like this year.",

Winter is close and most countries are not sure of their power source. But these nations are also facing economic challenges, hence they also need an increase in revenue through tax. I don't think this ban would be very effective because there are other ways to sort out these power challenges like load shedding and rationing. Most of these nations also depend heavily on the revenue they can get from the mining tax in their locality. Sometimes I keep wondering why the target is always bitcoin when it comes to power issues, while other sectors like gaming and banking also consume more energy. But currently, most bitcoin mining firms have developed new technologies that have made their power source clean, green, and independent. It is also important to state that other nations outside the European Union would be very willing to welcome bitcoin miners. I am sure Africa would be a very good destination for them. ¬†Even if it affects the price of bitcoin, the impact would be short-lived and minimal.",

Currently, many companies and businesses in Europe are on the verge of bankruptcy because of energy shortages as well as too expensive costs. This ban is likely to be temporary and it will be reinstated when the European economy recovers and things return to normal. This will definitely affect the bitcoin price but won't be too severe as we all know the root cause of this ban, IMO.",
