  "content": "Hello good morning,This is my first post but have posted also in this forum's bitcoin miners and am not sure I get a reply there so I thought it's better to post over here in the section bitcoin support.I am in need of help with an unconfirmed transaction which has been stuck since 14th November. My problem is because my web wallet(blockchain.com) automatically set my fee too low and has been unconfirmed since. Usually the fee is adjusted automatically, depending on the amount of transaction and has always worked. Took a couple of hours and everything was fine. This time however, the fee was way too low and unfortunately noticed it after sending the funds.Please understand that I am not an expert on bitcoin. Although I like the simplicity of the wallet, I am not familiar with certain procedures and terminologiesWas looking through this forum and came across the bitcoin support sticky. Tried contacting quickseller  and macbook-air but considering I am a newbie, I am not sure that I 'd get any reply.Any help from you guys would be greatly appreciated. I will send the link for better clarification.https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qcx2lqm9su3pmgfkv7sq4cfq92w8y55zpmr9qq6Thanks a lot.",

      "body": "Be using a good wallet like Electrum that support replace-by-fee by default, only what you should have just done is to pump the fee if you do not mark/check the transaction as final.If you can wait, do not panic if you are sending to yourself, the coin is safe and it will later be confirmed. The mempool is congested for now but you can wait. If you can not wait, you can use child-pay-for-parent for it. Assuming you are the owner of the coin, import the seed phrase on Electrum, you will see an unconfirmed transaction, you can spend the unconfirmed transaction, move part of the unconfirmed coin or the unconfirmed coin to a new address that you own on the wallet, which means you used part of the UTXO of the unconfirmed transaction. Read further.The mempool is 25 sat/vbyte now. You used 3.965 sat/vByte for your transaction. In CPFP, it is like you are paying for two transactions, use 46 sat/vbyte for the second transaction. Both transaction would be confirmed early.If you are not the owner of the coin (the coin you sent), you can advice the person that owns it to do it like that, or if the transaction has unspent UTXO as change on your wallet, use it for the second transaction with high fee, sending it to another address that you own.How Replace-By-Fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) can speed up confirmation[TUTORIAL]getting a low-fee transaction unstuck by creating a CPFP with electrum",

      "body": "Unfortunately, with a 4sat/vB tx fee, it's highly unlikely that it'll get confirmed within the next hour or so.And no one can predict the future so it's hard to give an ETA to when it'll get mined, the good news is, mempools have been steadily decreasing in size these past few days.It'll eventually get mined; if it's not a rush transaction, just wait it out.One way to accelerate it is to perform a CPFP transaction with high fee.But since Blockchain online wallet doesn't have such feature, you'll have to manually create a transaction that'll spend the change of that unconfirmed transaction.Sadly, it doesn't have a coin-control feature so it might select a different input if you have other than that change.",

This is wrong.The amount of fee required to be paid for a transaction has nothing to do with the amount of bitcoin you send.The transaction fee depends on number of inputs and outputs, your address(es) type, the network state and how fast you want your transaction to be confirmed. It's impossible to say when your transaction will be confirmed, but I expect it to be confirmed in the weekends.",

But if it is from someone, do not accept unconfirmed transaction, especially when the mempool is congested like this because the transaction can be dropped and be spent again to another address.",

Will the funds be lost?No, you'll be able to spend it again after getting dropped.Note: it depends on the mempool of the node where your client is connected to; in case of Blockchain wallet, it depends if it's dropped from their nodes.Also, the process depends on the client, some keep a local copy of the dropped transaction that requires manual deletion of the local copy but some are automatic.But the key point is, you'll be able to spend it once it's dropped (approx 14days after it got received by the node), be it with intervention or none.It rarely happens anyways.",

Of course, the wallet may or may not know how to handle that, but you can always go for a smarter wallet if it's needed.Again, stop worrying for no good reason.",

You are right. But I still expect OP's transaction to be confirmed in the coming weekends. Of course as you truly said, not because the network is usually less congested in the weekends, but because all binance consolidation transaction will be probably confirmed in the next 2 or 3 days and the network state will be normal again.",
