  "content": "Investment funds, insitutional investment firms and whales located in Asia will have their own chance on speculating in a spot bitcoin ETF without the need for an American financial institution if spot ETFs are approved.However, there is something mentioned in the article that implies that spot ETFs might not be as bullish as we might expect. It is mentioned that the take up on futures ETF in Hong Kong has only been modest. I assume the take up on futures ETF in America has also only been modest? Can the data on bitcoin futures ETF be used as a precedent on how strong or weak spot ETFs might be?The city is weighing retail-investor access to such spot ETFs providing regulatory concerns are met, Securities and Futures Commission Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung said.The crypto sector sees ETFs as a way of making digital assets more mainstream since the funds are readily available to a variety of investors. Bitcoin has surged 110% this year partly on expectations that the likes of BlackRock Inc. will soon win permission to start the first US spot ETFs for the token.Both Hong Kong and the US currently allow futures-based crypto ETFs, but the take-up has been modest compared to the overall size of the fund industry. The Asian city current lists the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active, CSOP Bitcoin Futures and CSOP Ether Futures ETFs. They have combined assets of about $65 million.Read in full https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hong-kong-mulls-allowing-spot-231014425.html",

How many and what are these countries? I am quite certain that there are not many countries offering spot ETFs for bitcoin or other cryptocoins. Also, if it is a spot ETF in a developing country with a small market, we can also be quite certain that it will not have effect on the whole market.On Bed Bath and Beyond, you cannot compare hehehe. I do not know the story but the stock goes to 0 because the company behind the stock went bankrupt and if a company goes bankrupt, they are ordered to delist their stock from the stock market.In an case, back on topic, can the data on the take up on futures ETF be used as precedent for how much the take might be for the spot ETF?",

Can the data on bitcoin futures ETF be used as a precedent on how strong or weak spot ETFs might be?I am of the opinion that the moment of official acceptance of the ETF will be the perfect place to close short-term longs on bitcoin, because in my opinion the whole thing is highly overhyped. I can't imagine anyone who would like to have exposure to bitcoin price change and doesn't have it due to the lack of an ETF. Seriously, even if you dont trust crypto exchanges or don't know how to store your crypto, my regulated broker that I use to buy stocks and bonds from around the world has 140 crypto pairs available in the form of CFDs.people are so hyped that they expect that spot etf will do to the price of bitcoin what it did to the price of gold, except:Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on July 11, 2023, 06:43:35 AMTo tell you the truth, I personally am more skeptical that this ETF will give as much to Bitcoin as it did to gold. Gold is hard to buy, hard to sell, each transaction carries the risk of fraud (fake gold), requires a physical transfer to the mint/store and has a huge spread. Gold ETF solved all these problems and made it possible for you to buy physical gold in 2 clicks from home. The same cannot be said for bitcoin, because bitcoin is like gold with build in ETF. It's easy to buy, easy to sell, divisible to cents. And it's not like the ETF will open doors to big institutions either. Microstrategy didn't need an ETF to buy nearly 1% of all bitcoins.I will also add that hardly anyone adds to this comparison the fact that gold has been in consolidation for 20 years and sooner or later it would explode. This was done 2 years after the introduction of the ETF. There is no evidence that there is any causality here. The price did not explode on the listing day.",

Agreed, however, the question I am presenting is whether the only modest take up of the futures ETF in America and in Hong Kong could be taken as a precedent for the spot ETF's performance. I reckon if thr answer is yes or maybe then similar to @Tytanowy Janusz's speculation, the effect of the spot ETFs on bitcoin might be overhyped.",

Thus once they get in, BTC price will skyrocket while BTC on exchanges are getting low for people are also withdrawing their coins. But we have seen the price action when iBTC was listed on dtcc even when it's uncertain yet.I think BTC will be just like gold and the difference is that because it's digital it's easy to buy and easy to sell.",

One thing will be when it is effectively confirmed that the first spot ETF is approved in the USA, which is the one that will influence the market the most, which I think is priced in and that can provoke as you say premeditated sales to fleece retail investors who buy with the news instead of selling.

Can the data on bitcoin futures ETF be used as a precedent on how strong or weak spot ETFs might be?It doesn't make much sense to compare futures and spot ETFs when it comes to Bitcoin, because they are completely different trading methods that naturally have a different impact on the BTC price. It's no secret that futures BTC ETFs have not caused too much excitement on the market, not only because of the way of trading, but also, as far as I know, because of the costs that clients pay for such a way of trading.It is true that spot BTC ETFs in various countries are not very successful, so it is logical to ask whether one such in the US can be an exception? I personally think it can, because other countries do not have such giants as BlackRock, Fidelity or Grayscale, and here we are talking about more than $15 trillion under management, noting that there are at least a dozen smaller companies that are interested in the same thing.HK may be an interesting story, but everything that happens there is several magnitudes smaller than in the US. However, I must admit that they have a good environment at their ATMs - for those who need professional help, of course",

No matter how you look at it, the US is definitely not even close to being the first in this, but that does not mean that maybe they did not make the right moves when they decided to wait and draw some conclusions from the experiences of other countries. If such an ETF is finally approved in the next few months (or maybe even days), it could very easily result in the accumulation of much larger funds than all other similar ETFs around the world have.",
