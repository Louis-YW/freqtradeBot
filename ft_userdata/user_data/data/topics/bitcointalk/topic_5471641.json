  "content": "In some analyses, I need to know the TX fee for each block from the previous period. Of course, expressed in sat/vB.Is there a tracking tool like this? Manually can be tiringEverything I've found is in US dollars, which isn't very helpful to me, especially when there's huge volatility in the value of Bitcoin like the last few days. Plus, all known charts (at least to me) only have an average value for a specific day, and that's not very helpful to me.",

You may need to add some spreadsheet magic.Yes, I need a lot of magic there. I was thinking something like this https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3mBut as I said, the value expressed in satoshi, and not only the average daily value but all the changes during the day.",

Blockchain explorer mempool.space can be considered the best tool to check all fees data within any block. It's my default browser in my Electrum wallet.Besides, i always use blockchair.com which is a good alternative as well. It shows the best fee rate to get your transaction confirmed and updates instantly. I prefer blockchair because it offers a navigator addon which can be easily installed and friendly-used.In general, most open-source wallets provide a feature of knowing the average fees before sending, which can be trusted without resorting to an external site.",
