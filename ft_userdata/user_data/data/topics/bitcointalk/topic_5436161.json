  "content": "[1-12-2024]  I've reopened this thread because my local Humane Society is accepting Bitcoin again.  The board had me pull it down at first, but now they are on board: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436161.msg63489305#msg63489305https://www.hsicshelter.org/donateI've been around Bitcoin for a while now +10 years(?)  Back in the day when you asked people to accept Bitcoin... it felt like you just asked them to accept blood diamonds they watched a 7-year-old with one arm mine.  That has TOTALLY changed these days though, thank god.I was absolutely blown away by the positive response at my last night's board meeting when I mentioned Bitcoin and cryptocurrency!People were on board basically instantly and interested too.  One of the older gentlemen even asked if I knew SBF... lulz... I guess it goes to show that robbing Tom Brady is probably the strongest marketing tool this space has ever seen marketing-wise!   That being said, I'm proud to announce that our little Humane Society now accepts cryptocurrency donations. I made the Bitcoin address static so that other shelters and people can see how much has been donated. (as opposed to changing the BTC address automatically after every donation.)Supporting Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Monero.I really want to see this be a success.  I made the first donations to practice what I preach last night.Thanks <3https://www.hsicshelter.org/donate",

I don't expect they'll get a fortune from crypto donations, but still, it doesn't cost them anything to have such option.Thank you very much, honestly, I was a bit nervous bringing it up, but I had the same thought as you... \"It doesn't cost anything\".  Why not try?Quote from: pawel7777 on January 20, 2023, 06:06:33 PMAnd also now they're the only business in the world accepting clams     (excluding JustDice that is)Hey hey hey, my exchange & faucet supports CLAM!!! So does FreiExchange (woo).   I got a giggle out of your post though.For some reason, the Reddit Monero crowd is eating my ass over CLAM. \"Why do you have a dead shitcoin listed as #2?!\"  I then do my best to explain I listed the coins in alphabetical order and C comes before M... sigh.  Quote from: DaveF on January 20, 2023, 06:09:44 PMPeaches (Yes I know it's a strippers name and to make it worse it's a male cat) approves your postLOL, poor misgendered cat!!  I'd just nickname him \"peachers\".  It sounds more masculine . Quote from: DaveF on January 20, 2023, 06:09:44 PMAre they converting to fiat / what are they doing with the donations to convert them to things they need?My plan is to use the cryptocurrency donated as a \"nest egg\" for the future.  This shelter has a Board that is really high quality, so fiat isn't a huge deal at the moment.  Also, all of the fundraisings for the shelter are done in fiat, so that stuff is already accounted for over the past 20 years of their existence.  If shit absolutely hit the fan... I'm sure the cryptocurrency could be traded for gift cards (likely for a discount too) for supplies and fiat for employee wages, but right now it's a nest egg for the future.  The Shelter could really use a new building and they are wanting to build a \"Spay/Neuter Clinic\" as well, I'd love to see these donations mature into something awesome like that.My thought is... if you can figure out a complicated problem in Arkansas (AR is a *tough* state).  Then that solution can be implemented almost anywhere.  Arkansas is a great state to learn tough lessons, that's probably why the largest company in the world is from here.  Walmart.Quote from: DaveF on January 20, 2023, 06:09:44 PMWho has / controls the private keys do they understand the security implications or are you now executive VP in charge of Crypto handling. Been there, done that on my end and finally had to show someone else the ropes so to speak.Yes, I'm handling it all.  I don't have a fancy title though, I'm just a piss ant volunteer board member on a few committees that and I'm trying to learn & help.   It's pretty easy for me, seeing that I already handle all of the AltQuick.com accounts and accounting.I just created a separate account for the shelter on AltQuick.  The CLAMS are being held on Just-Dice, so that the Shelter earns the stakes. (Altquick doesn't pay customers stakes because I'm worried that could be viewed as \"paying interest\", which would put us in a category I don't want to be in seeing that we are a USA based company.  At the same time, I want the Shelter to do as best they can with as little technical effort in regards to Cryptocurrency as possible.)I also am helping maintain their website, so adding the cryptocurrency options was a breeze... as compared to trying to teach someone with their eyes glazed over (a common theme I've noticed when I try to explain this stuff).Quote from: DaveF on January 20, 2023, 06:09:44 PM-Dave Always an honor to have you comment on one of my posts.  I hope your family, your kitty, and yourself are all doing good these days!Quote from: pawel7777 on January 21, 2023, 11:48:45 AMOK, I guess I'll do the honours of making the first BTC donation for a good start:a4cb736986a61940814055faa1a435563545d93e4fbdad46208a19cc3fcfc337I saw that this morning while auditing deposits.  Thank you very much!  At least my efforts weren't in vain.  \"Hey at least this idea got one donation!!\"  That is infinitely more than no donations!Quote from: pawel7777 on January 21, 2023, 11:48:45 AMNot much, because Europoor, but hopefully the inevitable Bitcoin pump will multiply the value I cheaped out on the tx fee but will boost it up if not confirmed.Pennies add up and they can add up quickly in this industry.  If Bitcoin hits a million bucks or more, that's a fair bit of dog/cat food!Send those tx's with 1vsat and let them sit IMO.  No reason to rush a little Humane Society donation for the next block... that seems silly to me.Plus your tx has long since confirmed at this point... long live the 1vsat sends.Thank you very much pawel7777.  I shall do my best. <3",

Either is fine though.It's just a hold right now.  There isn't much stance because there hasn't been much.  I just got them plugged into the altcoin exchange I operate.  Honestly, they have a few building upgrades that are pressing that would likely be a good thing (new floor paint for $15k).  But I'd really love to see this be considered an emergency savings fund while it builds.  I do have limited say because there are like 12 other board members.Quote from: mk4 on February 21, 2023, 06:14:04 AMProbably set aside our personal opinions for now.

What the heck is Clamcoin thoIt's a proof of stake coin based on proof of work. The distribution was to all BTC, DOGE, and LTC holders in May 2014.  People with qualifying addresses can still redeem them for free CLAMS.  Just-Dice.com went from Bitcoin to CLAM.  CLAM was used to rekt Poloniex and drive their shitty customer service out of the USA.  I just kinda like CLAM and my partner created CLAM.",
