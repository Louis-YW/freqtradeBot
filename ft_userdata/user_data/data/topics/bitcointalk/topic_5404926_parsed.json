      "body": "It is a good time for rural residents to grow more and boost production of food. To bring prices down.With food market prices on the rise. Growing (food mining) becomes more profitable. As we have seen more crypto miners focus on bitcoin during peaks. Rising prices should naturally compel farmers to expand operations and grow in higher volumes.When I had COVID. I lost senses of taste and smell. Sense of hunger was also lost. I went 4 or 5 days without feeling the hungry and felt no need to eat anything. It ended up being a 4 to 5 day water fast where I only drank and barely ate anything. This was good for my health. And I looked and felt better afterward. Image link: Â https://i.ibb.co/cwYWX8j/unitedstatesofobesity.jpgWhile rising food prices may not be ideal. Hopefully others can find some health benefit to it.",

      "body": "Personally, I see that food is linked to economic and environmental changes, and oil is linked to political changes. Therefore, when economic and environmental crises come, it is an opportunity for individuals to try to be self-sufficient, especially in the countryside, and to save on expenses for individuals in cities.Even in our region, where it is impossible to farm with economic feasibility, governments have begun to support agricultural projects and go to buy lands in countries that have agricultural capabilities.",

Regarding to food too, planting and harvesting are not done overnight, it takes time for crops to mature, so the earlier the better.Quote from: hugeblack on July 08, 2022, 09:25:10 AMEven in our region, where it is impossible to farm with economic feasibility, governments have begun to support agricultural projects and go to buy lands in countries that have agricultural capabilities.This only what to do before the economic or food crises come. It is only a wise government that plans ahead of time to avoid some common disaster which are termed as human disaster that could have been savaged with proper planning .",
