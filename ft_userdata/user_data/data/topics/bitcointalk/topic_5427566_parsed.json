That is FEDs psychology and method of working. But anyways we have already seen the consequences of such high money printing which comes out of thin air but it does not fulfil the vacates present in the ecosystem. You would be devaluing the currency and once the demand is over it’s gonna crush. What @stompix stated about crypto is similar to that. Only in this case we have pre minted coins, we have the number but we are unsure of the demand. On fine day it could be heavy on the other day it could be zero.",

It is happening because the forecast for businesses are becoming realistic because of inflation and reduced purchasing power of the customers. So it's at per the mainstream market. There's nothing drastically different happening in crypto market. Crypto is a volatile asset unlike any other assets in the market. Every single person and businesses involved in this market, knows this for a fact. So no surprises there as well. People who understands the market, are buying heavily at this price point.",

I've read Walmart and Cosco is also struggling just like many companies that are laying off so it's not the normal winter we experience after halving in the past. The news every day is all about inflation and war still. The longer they tend to continue the lower the price may be because of the media about FTX. One of the most respected influencers like Mark Moss said that 2021 bull run could be the last bull run in BTC, is it possible?This topic by the way is similar to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5425782",

If it is for money, I guess the process of being an expert and making profts is not short either, only if you meet the right mentor to learn from. To be honest, I see crypto industry very muck like financial or relative industries because all they do is deal with trading and numbers, they or we don't produce anything or value. It's just a game of numbers. What is productive or can be seen as productive is purely about making food or machines that enable people to see as tangibles. To make great money out of financial and crypto industries alike ? Don't have to be many times, just once is enough. Always live within our means and focus on what we do.
