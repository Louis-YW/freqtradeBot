  "content": "I have a transaction with a chunk of money I need from 8 days ago just sitting on Bitify. Seller is an honest guy, I've dealt with him many times, he couldn't fulfill the transaction so he accepted the refund request quickly. Bitify hasn't canceled the transaction and refunded me this entire time, and support won't reply to either of us. They are marked a \"Super Seller\" meaning escrow is going to auto-release to them in a day or so even with the dispute active as the system is setup so support should have stepped in by days ago the latest, and even though the sellers been honest until now, I'm guessing when the coin is in their hands I'm going to not hear from them again.Anyone here use Bitify and heard from support recently? I'm taking a wild guess that when Bitify realizes they were supposed to authorize the refund a week back, that Bitify isn't going to refund me out of their own pocket once this has auto-released and the seller has withdrawn the funds.I've used the site since it was called Cryptothrift back in 2014, but this experience is new.",

I have seen some complaints of members trying to seek help, and they totally go unanswered. I bet that's one of the reasons their customers may have reduced over time.",

Hell, this same seller successfully refunded me for a different transaction a day before this one. It's on neither of us. When he clicks refund, it just says processing. Going on 10 days now and all Bitify will say is \"bear with us,\" which is what support sent me right after I posted here, and radio silence since. The support staff appears to be gone other than maybe 1 person who doesn't have the power to manage trade disputes. Either Bitify is having some problem they won't say publicly, or the entire staff are on an extended vacation.",

Looking at how many of their communication channels are pretty dead recently, it paints a picture that the customer support has also deteriorated over time.My suggestion is you start exploring better alternatives before it's too late.",
