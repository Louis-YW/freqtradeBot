This could also help less experienced users to use proper quote tags.",

Besides, multiple quotes require multiple closing quote tags. What am I missing here? I didn't see the example LoyceV linked to, to be honest. I just got what he meant by reading the OP.When you quote someone and need to split the quote to address each part separately, you just place the cursor where you need to insert the split quote tags.Example:Code:[quote author=s0m30n3]...[/quote][quote]...[/quote][quote]...[/quote][quote]...[/quote]it will look like this:Quote from: s0m30n3...Quote...Quote...Quote...",

I will not advice you to try all those mobile browsers like Chrome, Brave and also privacy browsers like Firefox on mobile, Firefox is only better for this site on computer, I mean for typing on this forum, aside that, Firefox is very good. I can only recommend you two browsers which will help your typing experience and also checking merit history to be enjoyable, they are Via if you do not much care about privacy. I will strongly recommend Duckduckgo for privacy. Typing on mobile is so frustrating but using any of those two browsers will give you a better experience. I will say I recommend Duckduckgo because it is a privacy browser but Via has more convenience, but privacy is good.To quote on mobile is not hard and can be very fast, maybe I am getting you wrongly.

So if, for example, someone makes two separate points in a post, he wants to be able to write something below each point separately, and have a new quote tag opened to signify that he is quoting what you said.",

When I type in English with my phone, I like to use the swype feature and just slide my finger from letter to letter. I find it to be quicker and with less errors than with normal typing of letter by letter. So in terms of typing, I don't mind either option.
