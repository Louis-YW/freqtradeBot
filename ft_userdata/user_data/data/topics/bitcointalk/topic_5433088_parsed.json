      "body": "Today, if talking about the most successful projects, it must be the Binance launchpads, besides Binance, there is no other platform that can guarantee profits for investors. But in this bear season, even Binance has lost that reputation, their 2 recent projects, HOOk and HFT, have not been as successful as previous projects. At this time, it may be a bad idea to invest in new projects, and you should attempt to avoid making such a decision.",

But, the good days for launchpads were already gone and if there are still that makes a lot of money from it then that's good for them.You know what, it's not a good way to introduce a project and you'll make it interesting by saying that they'll make tons of money out of it. People are too wise these days because of the past experiences with the market, just saying.",

      "body": "Depending on the launchpad and the type of projects the launch, and also your tier matters alot when it comes to allocation. So don't expect to be in tier 1 with a $10 allocation for instance and hope to make millions out of it.Anyways, your post is more shilling AdLunam than bringing facts on how launchpad can make someone millions. Many launchpad who came into the market during this past bull circle are almost dead because of the bear market and no significant projects to launch.Â  Apply caution to avoid losses.",

      "body": "As much as launchpads help investors to fine projects to invest into from scratch, conducting a successful launchpad doesn't guarantee the success of the launched projects. That is why the general caution in the cryptocurrency investments are always attached. Do Your Own Research. Your research should include the launchpad platform itself. How many project's launchpad has it conducted; the state of the projects launched on it; the percentage of success and failure and so on.Ensure the project's aims and objectives are attainable. And invest only what you can afford to lose.",

      "body": "I do not argue that launchpads are not a bad place to find new promising crypto projects and crypto activations, however, new and not yet known launchpads are not always the place to pay attention to. For this, there are already proven and reliable launchpads of other platforms. However, in order to obtain more information, it is still worth sometimes turning to other linechpads. I am sure that someone will definitely be interested in your proposal, especially since there may be something interesting there.",

I understand it is a very boring thing to just hold bitcoin, but I rather do something that is boring than lose money.I think the only way to tell if the launchpad is good is by checking out the projects that they support. If the projects that they support are great and seems legit then you are on the right place. It can be rare for a reputable launchpad to risk or trade their reputation for a good amount of money but the ones that can do that the most are those launchpads who are already shady or those who are still new in the market. People invest in new projects, not because they are bored but because they think they can find a hidden gem there. Not all new projects are a scam and in fact there are also old projects who still can go bad or can turn in to a scam later on.",
