  "content": "It appears that this storyline being created by the new mayor of bitcoin Larry Fink will certainly make the heads of the people from traditional finance who will listen to him shake very vigorously once they witness and experience bitcoin's big volatile dumps on their faces hehehehe. This will certainly cause them to feel that they were scammed by Larry Fink.Bitcoin has long been pitched as a digital gold, an alternative reserve asset, and a flight to safety for investors during major geopolitical events.Now, the $10 trillion investment bank BlackRock is again singing the same tune.“Bitcoin has been seen by some investors as a ‘flight to safety’ in times of fear amid some of the most disruptive global events over the last five years,” the report reads.To that effect, say authors including BlackRock’s head of digital assets Robert Mitchnick, a “modest allocation” can diversify — making multiple bets in the market instead of investing in just one asset — a portfolio.BlackRock has lured a broad swathe of new investors to Bitcoin.Read in full https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/blackrock-bitcoin-report-outlines-flight-to-safety-and-risk/",

He only says what people want to hear, but that doesn't mean that people who will invest in BTC through ETFs are stupid, quite the opposite - just look at the inflows and outflows from spot BTC ETFs and everything will be clear to you. I have no doubt at all that those who invest through ETFs will be the first to dump their shares/BTC when the time comes.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on September 20, 2024, 07:44:08 AM~snip~People can change when their knowledge changed and businessmen are more easily to change because of opportunities for their business. If Larry Fink can change, many other people, from businessmen to non businessmen can change, and contribute to Bitcoin adoption and make the curve more parabolic.He has only changed his business relationship with BTC, I have no doubt at all that he still has an equally bad opinion about the same, which of course he keeps from himself and some narrow circle of people around him. All those people who supposedly changed and should contribute to BTC becoming \"something\" do not have good intentions in the long term - because everyone should ask themselves, why do people who are pillars of the centralized system suddenly change their minds?",

In such situations, it significantly outperforms assets such as real estate, gold, stocks, cash, bonds, etc. When crossing some state borders, border guards and customs officers actively check people's devices (smartphones, laptops). Hardware cryptocurrency wallets will also not go unnoticed. However, in order to move across the border with Bitcoins, you do not need laptops, smartphones, or hardware wallets. It is enough to learn 12 English words by heart and you can move a virtually unlimited amount of money from one continent to another. Such an opportunity is mind-boggling.",

He seems as crazy about Bitcoin as Saylor pretty much.Who knows why? Maybe its because there hasnt been any outflows in his ETF. Once someone buys his BTC ETF they hold it there long term. The longer they hold it the more money they make in the fees. So he is catering to those who investment timeline is 10 years and after 10 years, Blackrocks revenue from this one ETF will be massive.",

It's not too late to adoption, whoever the conglomerate in this world, they never late to invest bitcoin today. But, Warren Buffet is different from Larry Fink. He look visioner than Buffet when we compare about mind. As we know Buffet old-fashioned person or very old school than Fink. His house and car haven't changed since long ago, he just use an iphone a while ago, so it is difficult for him to adopt the new era of technology which made from blockchain. Buffet realize can't invest bitcoin because his knowledge about the new technology blockchain is limited so that situation he won't speculation to invest something he didn't know how it work.",

China and Russia exclude assets denominated in US dollars from their gold and foreign exchange reserves. Also, these two countries no longer buy US government bonds. All this calls into question the role of the US dollar as a world reserve currency. All this makes the US government think about one or another form of devaluation of the US dollar in order to reduce the US national debt. At the same time, Bitcoin is denominated in US dollars, accordingly, the weakening of the US dollar leads to the strengthening of Bitcoin (and vice versa). Understanding all this, BlackRock begins to accumulate Bitcoins, rightly considering such savings as insurance against the current situation with the US national debt.Perhaps BlackRock is simply more prudent and forward-looking than other financial institutions?",
