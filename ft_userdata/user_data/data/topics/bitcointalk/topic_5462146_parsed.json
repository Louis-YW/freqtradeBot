This give it the unique smell that make people notice their gas is leaking. Secondly, the author have failed to explain if there is additional risk posed by this conversion other than those we see in cooking arrangement.Nevertheless, I feel more work still need to be done to ensure the safety and reliability of LPG for generators and vehicle because there will always be but not as posted by this article.",

Also if we apply this same carefulness when using gas in our generator,it shouldn't be a problem. Continuous practice will make one find various ways to prevent any explosion or fire outbreak. For me I buy this gas idea for generator because it is more cheaper and affordable by PMS. As long as there is no leakage anywhere it is safe.",

D only thing wey I know be say if u dey convert ur generation to gas, make sure say d generator and d gas cylinder no dey close to each other, make sure say na open place u go put d cylinder incase if leakage dey breeze go dey blow am commot, and make sure say children no dey play go d place.",

It was not condemned. The topic title is just not accurate and misleading to what is on that news content. It is just like saying people should not use phone in the kitchen and to be careful that the gas is not leaking. The warning in that news is just about leakages.

The reason why most people find it expensive is because they want Cells that can power the entire house but once you reduce the number of gadgets to be used during its period of usage then 2 cells is ok. But that also is expensive, a cell is 2.5KV to 3KV battery is around 200k Naira and that’s a huge cell to power a house",

The generator I bought 5 months ago, 2.9 KVA maximum capacity was ₦250000 in price. How about the cost of petrol that I will be buying which is another cost. If a solar cost you ₦350000 and you used it for three years, it will supply you more light than ₦350000 generator if the fuel or gas cost is calculated with it. Although, fuel generators have more lifespan.",

No, but they can add the Generator money and the gas carburetor money together so they can buy a new solar for them selfs, but this solar has an issue, we are on a raining season and sometimes rain fall throughout the day and these solar don't charge and we know that if they are not well charged they can't power any of this thing except lights, so this solar energy has a disadvantage, hope I am correct?",

      "body": "@rachael9385You are right. In fact, I have not seen the sun today and everything looks like evening but it is just 2.30 pm. That would be the disadvantage of the solar. August is the worst not to see the sun. But the sunny days will come again. Among all, NEPA/PHCN light is the cheapest. All other means to have access to electricity are costly. But among all, I still see solar to be the next cheapest if comparing it to fuel generators. The cost to setup solar is the reason that discourage many people which Zaguru12 pointed to and I think he is correct, but also that the lifespan may discourage people.",
