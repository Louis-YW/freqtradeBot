It is the first PoW Blockchain to have Liquidity Mining and Staking, a greater alternative to PoW Ethereum. Pinkchain is Scalable, Sustainable, High-performance Blockchain Platform and fully compatible with EVM enabling developers to build scalable user-friendly dApps at nearly zero cost. Pinkchain ensures real decentralization using Proof of Work (PoW).PinkChain Features‚úÖ 10 seconds Block Time‚úÖ PoW Mining ‚úÖ Cold Staking ‚úÖ Farming ‚úÖ EVM Compatibility ‚úÖ High Performance ‚úÖ Cross-chain Support ‚úÖ Near Zero Fees ‚úÖ Native Stablecoin ‚úÖ PinkDAO Official Linksüü¢ Website: https://pinkchain.net/üü¢ Whitepaper: https://pinkchain.net/docs/whitepaper.pdfüü¢ Github: https://github.com/PinkChainüü¢ Docs: https://pinkchain.gitbook.io/üü¢ Mining: https://pinkchain.gitbook.io/mining/üü¢ Mainnet: https://pinkscan.org/üü¢ Telegram Ann: https://t.me/PinkSmartChainüü¢ Telegram Chat: https://t.me/Pinkchain_chatüü¢ Discord: https://discord.gg/jzxrn5H4eQüü¢ Twitter: https://twitter.com/PinkChainNet",

      "body": "Dear community, we are pleased to announce update regarding our chain and its rewards. Our chain is going to be a completely POW chain. Block time to generate each block will be of 5 sec. Each block will be having 1 coin as reward. 50% of the total supply has be allocated towards mining. This will generate 50M coins as rewards for almost 8 years or upto 50M Blocks. After that PoA / PoS will take over from that point of time or will require hard fork to continue mining. For investors, early buyers and stakers they can use our coin to get more rewards through farming or staking. We have named this concept as liquidity mining. As they will be rewarded with our chain coin same as miners. This will allow both investors and traders to earn main chain coins as rewards. Rewards rates will be variable based on market value and market conditions. More details will be published soon. Also team is planning to start invitation bounty program till our chain is live. This will help us get spread among crypto community and PoW supporters who are still looking for alternatives to PoW Ethereum to forward their hashrate.Thank you and have a great day!",

Ethash algorithm is very good, because old video cards mine it perfectly. You are talking about premine, but I don't understand about parallel POS mining.Will it be like Ethereum with 2 networks with POW and POS mining?I hope that mining at the initial stage will be profitable until many miners come here",

Within next 48hrs we will provide the steps for the miners to join our network and test their mining rigs and configuration for testing our network. This will help you to prepare for mainnet mining and also allow us to test our network efficiency. For developers and other users/investors we will open faucet and they can collect testnet coins to deploy smart contracts and make transactions to test our network. If any user finds any bug then feel free to report it to the team and in return we will reward them a suitable amount with mainnet coins under bug bounty program. I request all our miners and investors to promote us and spread the word PinkChain. Pinkchain team is working day and night to make this project a great success and an alternative to the lost Ethereum PoW mining world.Thank you and have a great day ahead!‚úÖ Explore the Testnet: https://testnet.pinkscan.org/‚úÖ Metamask Configuration (Add Network):Network name: PinkChain TestnetNew RPC URL: https://testrpc.pinkscan.org/Chain ID: 10101Currency symbol: PINKBlock explorer URL: https://testnet.pinkscan.org/",

Top 5 pools will be distributed 10,000 $PINK coins based on hash ratio (Not equally). To participate please fill the form below and list us as upcoming coin so that your miners will be aware of this and they will be ready to direct their hashes to mine this coin.

      "body": "Dear community, This is an important announcement regarding our BSC TOKEN CONTRACT and PINK Tokens. We have generated 100 Million PINK token supply on BSC same as the max supply on our mainnet. This is done to bridge our chain with BSC at initial stage. Our token contract does not have any mintable function or tax function. This is done to ensure peace of mind by the pink chain holders that team will not have any access to mint more coins unnecessarily.From 100 Million tokens which has been generated in BSC, excessive tokens (95%) has been already locked in PinkSale Token Locker by team and will be released periodically based on the calculations of POW mining rewards on our chain every year. Our 1st release will be on January 1st, 2023. It will take approx 10 years to unlock the last token on BSC. This brings a peace of mind to the PinkChain investors as team doesn‚Äôt hold the unwanted supply. Below are the contract details and amount which has been locked.Currently BSC has 5M PINK or 5% available supply, among which 1% will be used for seed sale, 1% for LGE, 1% for liquidity on DEX and remaining 2% for initial bridge liquidity and bounty.Token Contract: https://bscscan.com/token/0x473bbaa846f7de4a8fe357a68f434d472cd92f7aLocked on PinkSale: https://www.pinksale.finance/pinklock/detail/0x473bbaa846f7De4A8fe357A68f434d472cd92F7a?chain=BSC",
