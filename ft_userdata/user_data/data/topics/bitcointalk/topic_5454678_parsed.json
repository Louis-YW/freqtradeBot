I'm surprised it's somehow extended 4+ years. Limiting use according to certain areas is perhaps the least harmful way, which gives hope to privacy coins that they can survive until some more favourable regulation for them.From Oct. 22, 2019https://cointelegraph.com/news/fatfs-regulations-to-push-criminals-to-privacy-coins-ciphertrace-ceo",

Well, it's not new that these authorities want these exchanges to remove Monero and probably other privacy coins because they've got some the same reasons for privacy concerns and the use that it's being made through illegal transactions and being untraceable. So, this is like a wave that's not going to stop and if these big exchanges like Binance is being forced to do it in order for themselves to protect their business, the others will do the same once they're asked or required to do.",

According to an analysis by HollandFintech, Bitcoin is accepted by 91% darknet marketplaces (accepting at least 1 cryptocurrencies), 79% accept Monero, 21% accept Litecoin and there are few more coins too. 69% of the darknet marketplaces accept 2 or more cryptocurrencies. Though Bitcoin acceptance is quite high, Monero is widely accepted in dark market. Of course, because people are still using them. QuoteI did notice that Kucoin no longer lists PIVX, though I'm not sure about any of the others.XMR is still there in Kucoin. ZEC is also there. But it's jsut matter of time I think, Kucoin will also follow the same. Kucoin is more open to work with regulation but good thing is they aren't as shady as Binance.",

By the way, the privacy coins are just like every other cryptocurrency running on the blockchain, just that they provide additional layer of privacy. As the government go against them, they device means to remain in circulation. This could be because they have shady industries and persons willing to use them at all cost just like the case of mixers.Concerning the use case of these privacy coins, as you rightly mentioned, these coins aren't used to buy the early morning coffee or everyday groceries. They are mostly used for shady deals such as the ones that happen in the darknet, money laundry, and the most scary to the government is arms deals relating to espionage.

Decentralized exchanges could be their safe haven. Once a country bans the use of a particular privacy coin and exchanges in such country delist the coin, the price of such coin is  always impacted negatively and that is the smoothest means for a privacy coin project to fail.",

In this case, people will need a new coin with a PoW consensus algorithm (a coin that will be able to successfully function in the face of persecution by government regulators).Monero (with its high standards of anonymity and privacy) is likely to be such a coin.  This is one of the reasons why many governments avoid direct aggressive attack on Bitcoin (the XMR alternative is much worse for them).",

Every decentralized cryptocurrency in the true sense of the word is actually a target, and if you just remove it from all CEXs, all that will remain is some trivial thing that will be used by a very small number of people.The so-called privacy coins are something that will gradually disappear in all countries where there is strict crypto regulation. In my country, an official ban was not even needed, because all local CEXs just received a recommendation to remove these coins from their offer, and they simply did that a few years ago.",

Some countries that are keen to monitor the financial activities of their citizens will not hesitate to formally request this from the Binance administration, which will not refuse in order not to lose an important user base. All this is a possible result of US policies towards trading platforms after what happened last year with the collapse of the FTX platform.What caught my attention in the list of currencies is that there are no other currencies among them that have a high degree of privacy, such as the Grin currency, which was developed according to the famous mimblewimble protocol, like which we find the BEAM currency that uses the same protocol, but the BEAM currency has been canceled while Grin is still listed .
