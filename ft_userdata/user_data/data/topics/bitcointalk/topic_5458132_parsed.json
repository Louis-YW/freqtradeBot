A bitcoin spot ETF is so people and institutions can buy bitcoin without the need to use a cryptocurrency broker(like Coinbase) and worry on how to store their funds securely themselves.

Bitcoin ETF is not the same as bitcoin, so your point of view is closer to me. The more centralized corporations issue ersatz bitcoins, the less people will understand what real bitcoin is. And the real bitcoin is only on the bitcoin blockchain, only the one to which you have complete and undivided control of the keys.The further we go, the more centralized corporations are releasing their versions of bitcoin, but all these numbers on the screens in the personal accounts of these corporations are fiat promises of bitcoins, not bitcoins themselves. And the difference is huge.",

Why they can buy it, while other institutional investors waiting for ETF?Mk4 nailed it, probably a bitcoin etf may be more helpful to some of the institutions who are having some difficulty to understand bitcoin on different aspect. The recent news, about Gensler commented that bitcoin etf is not needed. Well they may have a lot of wrong idea about it and dont understand the situations.",

But then how come MicroStrategy is already heavily invested in BTC? Why they can buy it, while other institutional investors waiting for ETF?Many members had already answered the query but here is what I have to say, I didn't actually aware of the basic functionality of ETF but due to the current trend, I have to learn it. So, I learned that they are not good for the value and purpose of BTC. I know the answer is not related to your query but give it a second.As there are two types of people who like and dislike ETF, (an example can get from Z390's reply as some of his friends do like it but he doesn't). Those who are traditional and do not like the ideas of new technologies like blockchain and decentralization will always prefer to buy BTC from middlemen who can assure them full security. But there are others who do not need middlemen because they knew that's what decentralization means.Coming to answer, Microstrategy knew the hype in the market so they didn't wait for ETF because they knew people will buy shares from their company. It's like you have a company and are invested in BTC and people who like to buy shares from your company, are meant to be buying shares in BTC but indirectly. Like if BTC goes up, your company will make a profit so does the shareholders too. And other companies are targeting the traditional people because modern people had already made their choice of MS, so new institutes can also buy BTC and do the same as MS but their target audience is traditonal people. That's why these ETFs thing made so much hype into the market.",

Many institutional investors in the list and they spent different capital at different times to buy bitcoin. Micro Strategy is mentioned most commonly on media because they are a biggest institutional investor.Micro Strategy accept bigger risk and they went ahead of many institutional investors. They don't wait for Bitcoin Spot ETFs to invest in Bitcoin. But late comers are making their mistakes because Micro Strategy actually buy bitcoin. Those guys wait for Bitcoin Spot ETFs to invest will have more risk, they can lose their capital with Bitcoin Spot ETFs.Micro Strategy's Investment history",

We have  the Cathie Wood the CEO of Ark Invest, I think is also in the game with the company. However, MicroStrategy is ahead of them on the institutional side because the company has a good knowledge/understanding of Bitcoin and how it works and has been seriously investing regardless of ETF approval.",

But then how come MicroStrategy is already heavily invested in BTC? Why they can buy it, while other institutional investors waiting for ETF?MicroStrategy currently work as ETF proxy it is a good option for those who want to invest in Bitcoin indirectly and do not want to be directly exposed to Bitcoin and keep it in his portfolio, as he holds MicroStrategy shares aka MSTR, which do not invest in anything other than Bitcoin, and therefore it is as if he is investing in Bitcoin through a third party.If the ETF is approved, this is a problem for MicroStrategy as it has lost its only advantage and they may stop buying.this apply to GBTCQuote from: fillippone on June 28, 2023, 09:13:00 PMBe warned about the risky situation of Microstrategy. Everyone is looking at Microstrategy as an \"ETF proxy\". They are buying a lot of BTC, and investors have flocked to MSTR because of that. In case of an ETF approval, Microstrategy would lose all those investors, as the ETF is such a more efficient way of holding BTC. In case you want to bet on ETF approval: Long GBTC, short MSTR!If you have any MicroStrategy ask it here MicroStrategy Buys $250M in Bitcoin, Calling the Crypto ‘Superior to Cash’",
