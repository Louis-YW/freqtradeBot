Perhaps you were saying that there should be more discussing in increasing the mining time? I don't see how that would impact the fees in any meaningful way.[1]https://rodarmor.com/blog/runes/",

Without hitting the block to the dead end they could start buying BTC. A $100 from each could make huge pressure in buy orders and price could hit $100K easily ðŸ˜‚",

Perhaps you were saying that there should be more discussing in increasing the mining time? I don't see how that would impact the fees in any meaningful way.The difficulty will be adjusted in ~3 days, which always tries to be an average of 10 minutes. If the average is less than 10 minutes, this means that the difficulty will increase to maintain 10 minutes, and since the difficulty will increase, a longer time to find blocks and if the number of unconfirmed transactions continues to increase, it means that we will not see lower fees soon.",
