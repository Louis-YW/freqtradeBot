Everything can be supported by screens of conversation, tx ids on blockchain and others. I have nothing to hide and everything to show.Even when i am not a fan of lawsuits or sharing \"Business\" information publicly, attitude of 1xbit gave me no other choices than to share this with everyone who could also get affected and scammed just like I got.On 3rd of June, 11:00pm UTC i created an account and got my id (several numbers as usual) and created my passport. Shortly after that I deposited 4000 USDT as TRC20 The transaction was credited shortly after i did the deposit.I decided to bet on WNBA match with odds approximately 1.65 with total amount of 4000 USDT. Important to say that the max amount to bet was around 16,000 USDT so I did bet way lower than max limit.The match went well and my match was successful and i won the bet. Shortly after I received my winnings (total 6592 USDT) i decided to withdraw whole amount to my TRC20 USDT address. You can see from the screenshots that whole winning amount was credited to my account without any problem. However, shortly after that my withdrawal was declined (no reason specified).I woke up in the morning (i submitted a withdrawal and went to sleep while the withdrawal was supposed to arrive to my provided address) and realized i dont have the money in my address. Therefore i tried to log into my account only to find out the username and password doesnt work. My account was simply disabled and no reason given. I then tried to reach out to live support to check what the problem is and how to access my account. I was told to send a message to security department (email) which i did.After i explained my problem i was told that the company DECIDED TO STOP ANY COLLABORATION WITH ME DUE TO VOLATIONG T&C. No other specifics were given. I was also told (check screens) that i can withdraw deposited amount only (thank god, really appreciate you @1xbit just stole my 2650 usd and not even the 4000 usd deposited).I tried to find out how i violated the T&C, however no other answers were provided by the 1xbit company. I am sure i havent violated anything. Therefore i consider the match that was in the end voided as a pure robbery by 1xbit and i am ready to take a legal action.If you want to provide some kind of service you must play by rules and fair. Everyone is your friend (in gambling) when youre losing money. Once you start winning, hidden T&C are being shown to you to excuse any unfair play by the casinos and gambling sites.I am a witness and victim of this pure steal and robbery and can not this let go without any action. Even if this saves one person from not using 1xbit i will be glad.Feel free to switch on notifications as i will provide updates whenever 1Xbit answers or about the legal action that will take place.Same text will be shared on Twitter, Review servers and also will be switched on as Twitter ads to reach relevant audience so more people can stop using this scam service called 1xbit.If 1xbit decides to reward me and pays what they owe i will update this thread and state that everything has been sorted. Until then, the ads will run infinitely.Best regards,https://i.imgur.com/7rkzGU3.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/ix8NYbG.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/vrQRkgO.png",

Also, you don't need to open two identical threads about the same case, so you can lock one of them.",

Everyone should be aware of this modus operandi, casinos use their bullshit ToS to scam winners without saying anything until they try to withdraw their winings.Then casino shillers should stop to try to silence complainants by claiming they have not been scammed because something is written somewhere in the ToS of the casino. When I transact with someone else I don't default to pay him by saying it was written in my underwear that I wont pay you if the sky become cloudy.It's just a common way from casinos to cheat their winning customers.",
