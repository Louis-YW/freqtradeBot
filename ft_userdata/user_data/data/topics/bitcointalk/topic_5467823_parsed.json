  "content": "Considering the recurrence of security issues in the Cryptocurrency sphere, Bitget have thought it wise to forge a formidable partnership with COBO Superloop, an off exchange settlement network.The integration by the two companies look to shift paradigms and enhance security on Bitget by utilising cutting edge security mechanics which will in turn influence the entire Cryptocurrency ecosystem.Furthermore, the collaboration seeks to instill more confidence in the minds of Cryptocurrency investors, the most amazing part of this partnership is that, Bitget users can now trade on the CEX while securely holding their assets off the exchange with protection by COBO's wallet technologies.Interestingly, this innovative solution seeks to aid Crypto investing for Bitget's institutional clients who are given latitude to save their assets via the COBO self custodial wallet. By so doing the platform will increasingly bring in more upper echelon investors who often prioritise tier one security mechanisms.Through my lens, the partnership possesses a long term vision with the aim to make Cryptocurrency trading immensely secure. Retrospectively, one would notice the series of security breaches that plagued the crypto ecosystem in 2022, Bitget have taken initiative from this to forestall further occurrences of any breaches that may or may not affect its customers.",

      "body": "As an expert in security consulting, I can assure you that cooperating for the sake of security is far from novel, but it is undoubtedly the smartest approach. To the real and credible crypto exchanges out there, nothing is more vital than having a fortified offline vault reserved for cold storage. Granted, while a mere fraction of every customer's crypto riches are within reach in an online wallet, the major part of their assets are bundled in a storage device that's detached from computers and kept in a separate edifice, disconnected from the internet. It's high time that all these exchanges sign collaborative agreements just like this, which should be put in place to safeguard user funds on their platforms.",
