      "body": "Judging by the situation we found ourselves in Nigeria, I will like to limit my reply to the professionalism of doctors and other healthcare practitioners in the country and shy away from the availability of resources needed to dispense their services because it's not their fault.I'm particular about the experts in the field because their actions say many of them are just there for the money and job security, not for professionalism and care for life. I say this based on experience, there is too much lackadaisical attitude of our doctors especially, yet a few are passionate about the job and will do anything to save lives.A lot of lives are being lost daily due to the negligence of doctors, and many view life as worthless to them. But you will see them protesting only on little matters since they have lost the core value of the profession.",

      "body": "You are absolutely correct mate. I wonder if these set of medical practitioners do have conscience at all, if truly  they have passion for the job they are doing or they are just there for the money and job security just as OP has said. I wonder if they really do have sober reflection of their ill act everyday after their activities at all. I am beginning to see them as heartless and careless about human life because their approach to victims upon admitting them to their various hospital is something else. You can imagine a doctor telling you to make deposit of money before they touch a patient in the hospital and meanwhile the patient is at the point of death and needs utmost medical attention. People have lost their loved ones  as a result of this nonchalant attitude of medical doctors and it is very bad that  our nation is in such a state where the health sector no longer cares about life and this has made the health workers too not to care about their patient anymore only those who give them extra tip that they show concern. It has gotten so bad now that the health system is deteriorating. No wonder our Political class and the power that be are all flying abroad for their medicals. The worst of it all is that allowance due, salary increment, promotion and recognition due the health workers are not accorded them so hence their actions and inaction's. It is a pity that our health sector has gotten to this point of medical criticality and callousness.",

I dey see situation when people abandoned their family members for hospital and now imagine in a situation when dey never pay doctors, who go come take care of those bills and how the doctors go take feed their family. We no get a better health insurance wey be say the government fit dey pay for every sick person and dey collect the money small small from their salary.Something make we no dey too look outside dey think say foreigners own better because even dem no dey treat people if dem no get health insurance. I understand say some doctor own bad as na pure wickedness dem dey do. If dey see person for critical condition, atleast dem fir try stabilized the person before dem begin dey ask for bills to continue and no be dis one wey dem no go touch the person at all. And another thing wey dey worry me na when gun wound come and dem dey request police report abi wetin I no understand before dem fit operate the person. Na dat particular one dey vex me die.",

Unlike the public hospitals where there are no spaces, care and comfort.  As you have said private and as their name implies, they are commercial hospital built for business purposes and profit making so they must be at their very best and professionally engaging their clients and patients on satisfactory service delivery.

Make una chuk mouth...Who no get money for this life, especially for Africa, and particularly for Nigeria, I believe say bad thing do am. Because to get quality healthcare, dey very expensive anywhere in the world. So i believe say na em make  governments all over the world dey build them own hospitals. I de reason say for developed countries, people fit to go for government hospital and get better healthcare treatment. But for naija, no be so, dem go tell you the medicine wey go buy, so if you no fit to afford to buy am, dem go abandon the patent. If em die, e no concern dem. And the attendants for our government hospitals dey de very rude. Coming to private hospitals, dem no send you, na business dem open, just like other businesses anywhere. Before dem go admit any sick person you must make deposit first, even if the person dey die, e no concern dem. As the treatment dey progress, dem go dey demand for more money, so the moment money stop to enter, treatment go also stop.I believe say our doctors and our hospitals in general, dem no dey too try, because to save life na I'm suppose be their main priority. I know say e dey important to pay for their services, because dem get family to feed too. But the profession wey dem choose demand say make dem go put human life first before money.",
