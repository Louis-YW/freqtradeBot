  "content": "I've been paid out the full amount after having to show much proof of my transaction not being made incorrectly and sent to the correct address.After seeing their post on the gambling forum here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422931.0 I decided to try out their site and see what they have to offer. I sent $503.9 to the wallet they made for me, using USDT on the ERC20 network.The proof of this transaction is here: https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7?a=0x5ce24b5b182cc6afa973940883292b953a93d9b2to verify that this was sent to the correct address, I've attached 2 screenshots of the address they gave me, plus another from the link above showing the addresses are the same.https://i.gyazo.com/c02ebeca5e3b6a5f427494656adf860d.pnghttps://i.gyazo.com/c1196e6f2d54d66731319075df77352e.pngAfter about an hour of my deposit not arriving, I contacted support and was told it could take up to 24 hours, so I waited.24 hours passed and still no deposit, so I contacted support again and they told me my deposit has still not arrived but not to worry.48 hours passed and I started to worry, they emailed me regarding the issue and asked for verification of the transaction on my end, which I was able to provide, along with the information above proving that the transaction had been sent.https://i.gyazo.com/c02c7aba691c82c7b3042e60ee8dbcbf.pngI contacted support again and was told that once approved the funds would be added to my account shortly.https://i.gyazo.com/1f627eea58e80104b786438a18bacd1a.png4 days after my deposit, I was sent this:https://i.gyazo.com/0b1f409fb4c0718909b567a1cd2ad4ca.pngI believe this to be a false claim as the wallets are identical and the money was transferred from the wallet I sent to another wallet within a matter of minutes. I presume their crypto handling provider.'1. Making a transfer to an incorrect wallet address.': I've shown proof that I've not made a transfer to the wrong address by providing screenshots.'2. Making a cross-currency transfer (For example: Making BTC transfer to an Ether address.)': And also proof that I've not made incorrect transactions between cross-currencies, as it's been transferred on the blockchain in the link above.I have sent all this proof to them regarding this and I'm waiting for a response. If credited my funds, I will withdraw the accusation and believe it to be an error within their system.Until then, my advice is to stay away from this site.",

You're now sharing some screenshots publicly, how do we know they're authentic? or basically you get the pictures from someone (real user) who asks for your help personally then you claim it with a new account. Not accusing you back, this is just a common scenario fake \"support\" uses.So no need to hurry, your turn has been used. Let them come here to clear things up.",

I do not feel that he is an honest person who can return your USDT to you @pale_cutie, But if he does not, this topic will be conclusive evidence that he is a scammer and the reputation of his casino will be lost.",

It will be nice if you can also inform Ole777Official of this open scam accusation case against them so they can come here and give their side of story.To let anyone reading this thread catching up with the situation, Ole777 is recently[you pretty much can start from this point] flooded with cases after cases of account suspension --which, on their defense, roughly is due to unfair actions--, fake team ID--which, according to their defense, are not their site--, and this one where the user's fund were missing due to technical reason. Sadly, only few of these people escalated their case to this board and from these few, Ole777Official never replied on the designated threads, instead addressed the situations on a tangled-mess-with-a-snail-pace kinda way on their official ANN thread.",

Some that are counter-accused for prohibited action --multi acc, arbitrage, etc-- are no longer present to give their defense of OLE's findings, while some that still actively attending to their case are... well, that's what we're doing here, looking for the truth behind one of the case.We are not raising or supporting flags against anyone based on inconclusive and non-concrete --yet-- foundation. And as their officials are still showing good gestures by attending to the cases --although at snail pace-- we would wait for any conclusive result before tagging them with anything too.You can rest assured that DT on this forum are very much concerned on protecting the community and wouldn't hesitate to support flags or give negative feedbacks to every wrongdoings, but it needs to be proven and on a good basis first.Quote from: aioc on February 02, 2023, 02:57:24 PM[...]He should post the update on this issue here since this is already escalated to a scam accusation, things are not looking good for this new casino, if they want to build their brand here they should satisfy the community by giving satisfactory explanations.There's a very good chance that their CM are not aware of this thread's existence yet, as OP of this thread didn't give them any notice about their accusation.

Don't they know that people can use personal wallets too?Then saying you could have sent btc to an eth address! Just give me a wallet which will let you do that!",

While we can't identify the root cause of this, although I'm leaning it's a system error they somehow can't reflect the incoming txid to the user's account (whether it's related to an account exception the OP may have had in the past so the restore wasn't done properly). What I saw on txid, it was OP's 1st deposit, which was then swept to a hot wallet 1 hour later.But I'm also not going to discount impersonation scenarios (as I described earlier).",
