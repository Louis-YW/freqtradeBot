Maybe try to ask as a gambler there and not as a person who will start own casino. Maybe that's the reason why they did not answer as they see you as a potential rival and they may lose gamblers on their own site. I think there is a thread in Bitcointalk about prividers or a list of providers.",

If they do not respond to the e-mail, try (as someone already mentioned earlier) as a player, ask the support directly. Normally it shouldn't be a problem to find out who is the games provider. In principle, such information should be generally available to players.I found one Tivit telegram group about affiliate program, so maybe you can try there: https://t.me/+delI7QlpE5djYWJi",

Sorry but players will think this was suspicious. They will think it's a phishing or a scam site.What is allowed is I think having the same games such as dice because many casinos did that but your designs must be unique. Some functions can be copied like deposits, withdrawals and similar. Obviously because that is how a gambling site works. And what provider do you mean. Game provider? There's plenty of them online but if you mean provider to make a clone site, you can try the service section of the forum. Saw someone offered the same service before.",

Hire a bunch of professionals who can make your idea happen. With that, you could mold your creativity to life and be unique against all of your competitors. You don't need a huge company to help you create things you want to bring life on, just look for those who can create pavements for your idea and the rest would be a hugee huge history.",
