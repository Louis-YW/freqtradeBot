Exodus does not send unsolicited emails requesting to verify accounts. Exodus is a self-custodial wallet that does not have accounts. Exodus has no control over your funds or your access to them. You are in full control.Quote from: https://www.exodus.com/support/article/638-i-received-an-email-from-exodus-asking-me-to-provide-my-12-word-phrase-password#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20received%20an,trying%20to%20steal%20your%20cryptocurrency.What should I do if I receive a phishing email?If you receive a phishing email in your inbox, here are a few actions you can take:1. Do not open it. In some cases, the act of opening the phishing email may cause you to compromise your security.2. Do not send any funds. Transactions confirmed on the blockchain are irreversible, so if you send funds to a scammer, you wouldn’t be able to retrieve your funds.3. Delete it immediately to prevent yourself from accidentally opening the message in the future.4. Do not download any attachments accompanying the message. Attachments may contain malware such as viruses, worms or spyware.5. Never click links that appear in the message. Links embedded within phishing messages direct you to fraudulent websites.6. Do not reply to the sender. Ignore any requests the sender may solicit, and do not call phone numbers provided in the message.7. Report it. Let us know if you have been sent a phishing email by writing to us at support@exodus.com.8. Send us the .eml or .txt file. This might help us put a stop to the scammers.

Don't worry nothing will happen as long as you don't click.In this phishing message, they claim that they have updated the terms of service and they need a mandatory requirement and know your customer (KYC). Exodus Wallet does not require KYC from customers, but third parties of exchanges and some functions require KYC, and this is definitive proof that the message sent is 100% fake. And the other thing at the end of this message is that they say that they can block the account of users who avoided doing what they sent them and seize all their funds. Exodus cannot, and nobody can't do this because Exodus Wallet does not store personal information, and any user has full control over his wallet and its security. \"Your keys, your crypto\"Quote from: exodus.com link=topic=https://www.exodus.com/support/article/37-how-do-i-get-started-with-exodusAs a non-custodial wallet, Exodus gives you the power to control your digital wealth.
