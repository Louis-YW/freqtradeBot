I have created two or three accounts in the same wallet.When i check Secret Recovery Phrase, i found that all the three accounts have the same Secret Recovery Phrase.I have bought a new laptop and I imported this Secret Recovery Phrase in my new wallet. Now only one account appears in my laptop and the other two accounts do not appear.Now my question is how we import metamask, so that all the accounts in the wallet are visible on the other computer also?",

So if you want to have three accounts in your wallet, it's either you leave a token in your other account or just create a new account in your new computer.Yes, I do not have any balance or token in those accounts. So if i had the balance would it have been imported automatically? Interesting learning  Anyways, just a general question why do all these accounts have a similar Recovery phase? Are they linked together? For example, if I connect my one account with any airdrop site, will the balance at my other account be at risk if I somehow connected one account to a phishing site or scam site ?",

Now how do I delete this account?Is it possible?No, it's not possible to delete accounts[1]. You will probably have to reset everything and go through the recovery process again if you don't want the other account to show.Are you sure that the two other accounts you had were derived from the recovery phrase, and not from an imported private key?You also said you had one account showing when you recovered the wallet, was that in your previous wallet?

Seeing your account history, it shows that you are not a new member, it is odd that you still ask such a question. For further information, I suggest try to learn from this resource: https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107-User-Guide-Secret-Recovery-Phrase-password-and-private-keys.",

TLDRI just write down here  \"When you restore a wallet using your Secret Recovery Phrase, MetaMask will automatically re-add any additional accounts you had previously created — but only under certain conditions.MetaMask will attempt to add your additional accounts where possible (assuming they were not imported) by checking your previous accounts in ascending order (i.e. Account 2, then Account 3, etc.). Accounts are automatically re-added if they have a non-zero ETH balance. However, this process ends when MetaMask encounters an account with 0 ETH — so the first account with 0 ETH (and any beyond it) will not be added.\"So basically if you need to re-add your wallet if you have previously had an address with zero ETH on it. and metamask only detect on money on ETH chain so it not going to automatically re-add if you don't have ETH or you have money in other chain",

Its impossible because after all the years ive beenusing MM, it does really work all the time  or maybe trying to switch up the Network because you might be on other networkon which you cant be able to see your amount balance.",
