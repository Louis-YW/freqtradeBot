      "body": "It seems that Stevenson is about to hit his prime and we have seen how he clearly dominated a tougher opponent in Oscar Valdez. Initially we thought that Oscar has a good chance against Shakur because of his left hook and power. But Shakur uses his boxing skills and very technical in dismantling Valdez and even score a knock down during their fight. For me, Stevenson will win this by a large margin if it goes to the judges scorecard and there will be no controversies , clear victory. A poll might be good though.",

Hard to outclass Shakur will his skills he is like semi-Loma back in his prime days. Neither Robson or Cordina will win against him which I believe is his next fight too.",

I agree, Robson might have given Oscar Valdez all he can handle, but against this version of Shakur we might be looking for a knockout or unanimous decision as you have said. Could be a wide margin and then we will see brilliance of Shakur just like in the Valdez fight.Maybe after this fight, Shakur might go with unification fight with maybe Cordina IBF champion or Gutierrez at WBA.",

Stevenson got a long way for his career and this is just giving Conceicao another chance for a title. Its a hard battle for him though. Conceicao doesn't have a KO power, I'd just give that to Shakur. What he have is the height and reach advantage which will give a hard time for Shakur for every round. Its just how they could outbox each other.",

He uses his ring IQ, attack the body more in the latter round to soften up Herring.I think that will be the same strategy that he will do in this fight to offset Robson height and length against him and win by out boxing Conceicao.",

This match is not interesting at all for me even if this a title fight because Stevenson is dominant on this game not because he is the current title holder but rather he defeat Oscar Valdez in dominant way which is the previous holder of one of his belt while Conceicao was beaten by Valdez. I under that each boxer has different style so there might be some changes but Stevenson previous matches are all resulted on convincing way so I will not be surprised that odds is terrible.",

But I somewhat agree with Bob's observation, Shakur style as we all known is very frown by casual fans except for those hardcore and his fans. So maybe him making the fight in Shakur hometown will draw some fans into the gate and then later Bob Arum can spin it around down the line saying Shakur is the A-side because he bring fans to buy tickets for his fight. Clever move and a win-win for Shakur image and Top Rank.",

And I would say that he has one of the most powerful body shots in the lower division. But this fight is again another best test for him, we've seen how his defense is, so I'm expecting of him to somewhat show his prowess just like what he did on taking apart Oscar Valdez. Dela Hoya even twitter that he is a combination of Floyd and Canelo.",

There were rounds that Valdez is the aggressor and pushing the fight, even pinning him in the ropes. But Shakur is too intelligent to be trap and that jab is really superb. And then he combine it with body shots and then going to the head. I doubt know how Robson Conceicao will counter that.",
