  "content": "Interesting. Looks like they both started accumulating a couple of months after the US launch of spot bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11, 2024. They may have a lot more bitcoin ETFs by now.QuoteYahoo FinanceAugust 15, 2024Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley invested more than $600 million in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the second quarter of 2024, according to regulatory filings released on Wednesday. The filings, known as 13-Fs, provide insights into positions held by institutional investors at the end of each quarter.Goldman Sachs reported that it acquired roughly $418 million in various bitcoin ETFs. The bulk of this investment was in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT), with nearly 7 million shares valued at around $238 million as of June 30.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-morgan-stanley-buy-101717417.html",

But let’s see if it’s still the same now that institutional investors are joining the game. I’m expecting the market to be more stable this time around. Those classic pump-and-dump schemes might not work as easily anymore because the more serious money flows in, the harder it gets to manipulate. Honestly, the only reason I see for the market to collapse now would be some unexpected bad news, but I can’t even think of anything major at the moment. So I guess, my confidence in the market has definitely gone up too.",

      "body": "technically goldman sachs/morgan did buy bitcoin... BUT.. they gave it to blackrock. so now its technically blackrocks. because the deal was that goldman/morgan then get given baskets of shares branded as IBIT which goldman can then trade..so as the yahoo article says that goldman/morgan now hold shares of IBIT valued at X, they are rightmore technically blackrock dont have the bitcoin, they dont own the keys. blackrock put the bitcoin into coinbase custody. so the coins are in coinbases possession.. so goldman and morgan dont own/hold bitcoin. they just hold IBIT shares, and so goldman/morgan have no voting rights or ownership rights of actual bitcoin when holding the shares or managing shares held by their customers/retail investors",

It would be interesting to see if there are any updates on their holdings in future filings.",

SEC should formulate a rule to limit the Bitcoin holdings of Big pocket corporates. the majority of the coin held by blackrock is not new coin fresh from the mines or coins pilfered from naive independent traders who sold at the wrong time.. most of blackrocks holdings is coins that were already locked into a corporation (grayscale) for years prioras for limiting institutions exposure to crypto. well the BIS is already saying that central banks can only have a medium limit of 2% exposure that can extend to 5% due to volatile cost risk(fast moving price changes) whereby they would need to sell coin if the price exceeded the 5% of their fiat reservesright now the US central bank could only hold 100k coin and that number would get lower as the market price goes over $100k.. so the higher the price, the less coin US central bank get to hold",

I think the biggest driver was the belief that regulatory measures under his administration would favor Bitcoin.The ETFs were already in place, helping drive adoption, but the hype around those potential policies was what lit the fire for the pump. Sometimes it’s not just the fundamentals but the good news and optimism that fuel the market. So let's see where bitcoin will take us this bull run.",
