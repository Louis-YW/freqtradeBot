  "content": "Does anyone here by any chance use Revolut for trading bitcoin? I sent BTC to someone's (I know) Revolut generated address but the funds have not been credited yet. Any thoughts on why? The transaction does show as \"Pending\" but has received multiple confirmations (17 so far), and the overall balance still shows as zero for some reason. This is all I managed to find[1] but it's pretty vague.

It's funny that their system status shows that all systems are operational. I have seen several complaints about pending deposits and withdrawals, mostly with other payment methods, but then would get resolved after some hours or days.I suggest you can try to use their community to make them aware of the issue. I see some support staff in that forum try to help members get the issues resolved.",

I even found this thread[1] on the forum, and it is also about Revolut's bad services, hopefully your own situation is different and the funds you sent gets credited soon.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5239859.0",

Also after sent, about like 4-5mins I have POP-UP notification from Revolut so my BTC soon arrived. - Screen from Revolut.Until this post, my answer would have been that the Revolut bitcoin node is probably out of syn. Though if marbet85 successfully deposited before your deposit was credited, so that theory might be invalid (unless they use multiple nodes and the one you used was on the out of sync node).I would not be surprised if Revolut was doing some \"checks\". They are a very regulated firm and are probably taking cryptocurrency deposits with a large amount of stringency to prevent regulatory issues. Your deposit was probably a lot larger than marbet85's, so this is the next valid theory after node being out of sync/falling behind.",

Once you deposit funds into an address they control, they can do 'anything' with it and all you can do is wait.

The account's owner received an email asking him to 'verify the payment' by uploading one of the documents: Proof of investment, transaction history, or something else (\"Other\"). Not sure if this is supposed to be a normal check or not (since I know a few exchanges do that on your 1st transaction). I know that @marbet85 managed to do what I assume to be his first-ever Bitcoin deposit without issues, but I don't exclude the possibility that these checks might be done depending on the user's location. But regardless, this is just too much for such a small amount (~10 EUR).",

So I think I will wait a bit more. Transaction fees on Bitcoin are rather high unfortunately, so people usually send amounts above dozens of USD, so if deposits are not smooth and safe, it's a serious issue. What is AMLBot please?

You know how sometimes, an exchange claims that they have detected suspicious activity when you make a deposit? and wants to confirm the source of funds. It's usually because they use something like this[1]. AMLBot does a similar thing, but unlike ChainAnalysis, it's available for public use. Now, I'm not sure how good it is but I would imagine it's good enough if they are indeed used by 500+ companies as they claim. It's paid though, but you can try it if you'd like, they offer a free trial (one address) through their Telegram bot. [1] https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-kyt/",

However, I am not familiar with Revolution, though it sounds familiar to me. I've never used it or don't know what its purpose is. It's funny, took one month to credit deposit amounts.",
