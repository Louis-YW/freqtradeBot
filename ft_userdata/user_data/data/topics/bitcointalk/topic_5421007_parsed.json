Definitely not the point of this section.But argument is valid that those topics are somehow irrelevant. As I remember it correctly, Gambling section before contains ANN threads of projects wherein players could check new gambling platforms they may try as well as to check for feedbacks of that platform. General topics about gambling, would be for gambling discussion as also mentioned by other users in this topic, as the word discussion also suggest. But at the end of the day we have moderators in this forum. They',d be the one who will move and seggregate topics from one another if it is reall inappropriate or irrelevant. So let them be for now.Never make a standard for yourself. This could be an insult to the moderators such as teaching them what to do;they definitely know their jobs for years.",

If you don't know what is (and what should be) a real gambling forum, just look at the Wizard of Vegas Forum for example. The 10% worst posts there are better than the 10% best posts here.Everyone knows that people are posting here just because their signature campaign requires to do it or because they know their shitposts won't be spotted into the piles of spam. Most of real gamblers from Bitcointalk don't even try to post here anymore. And at least 2 topics on the matter have already been opened in the Meta section, even moderators are complaining about the amount of spam. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5419987https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403475Several members advise to always open threads in self-moderate mode here to prevent spam.",

On the topic, I think it's wrong to say that this board is for people who are \"gambling experts\". Rather this board is for threads that center around official discussions instead of \"What do you think\" topics, which I do agree with (I'm only disagreeing with the way OP said it). It's like separating the discussions between official and non-official ones. With the number of threads made though it might just be for the best to report the thread to bring attention to it, or personally PM the OP as others has said to move the topics. I also saw some of the topics were already moved to gambling discussion btw. Quote from: Desmong on November 14, 2022, 10:54:55 PMYou wanna sanitize the gambling board and how do you think you can achieve this when we have moderators who are always ready to do their work without us intruding. Even without reporting the moderators can vividly clean up the gambling section especially when they notice some group of unethical posts. The gambling section is made up of different calibres of people both strong and weak gamblers It's not about the mods doing their work but rather people can do it by themselves without the mod's intervention in the first place, so why don't they?",

You have a point in what you said here dude, I just have a question about what else you said here that \"Non-gamblers can't post on this board\" I think you are a bit wrong on this matter. I have been posting here in the forum for a long time but I have not seen or read anything here in this forum with such rules.Because before I learned to gamble here in crypto gambling on this platform I was already posting in the gambling discussion and on this board.
