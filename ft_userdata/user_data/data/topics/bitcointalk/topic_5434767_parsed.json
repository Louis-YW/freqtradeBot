      "body": "If you can't decide which coin to buy, bitcoin will come with the least regrets imo. Enough newbies have been scammed by coins that claim to be coins and enough older members have probabky invested in altcoins too and made a loss at some point - bitcoin remains the safest.It's hard to tell when we're bullish or bearish unless we've been there a while. One of the best ways to notice is by doing things such as dollar cost averaging or dip buying (where you buy the calm atter the storm - the relaxation point of the markets as most upwards trends are met with some downwards ones too).Investing requires quite a lot of patience though so don't invest more than you can afford to lose (especially in your first few attempts) they might just make you want to cut your losses if you're in the red at any point.",

With that wrong thought, you should not take risk. Market has a dead cat bounce days and it will revert to bearish soon.I see signals that capital started to dump the market again.QuoteI will appreciate any advice from fellow community members concerning this current situation because I'm considering to buy some coins but finding it difficult to decide on which coin to give a trail.If you were fearful and did not buy altcoins two weeks ago, now they rose 50%, 100% or 25% than 2 weeks ago, buying them now is not safe and somewhat I can say stupid.Altcoin movements will depend on Bitcoin movement in next 3 to 7 days. If Bitcoin is pulled back, I am sure with you altcoins will lose 25% to 50% very easily.",

Though in BTC's case right now, I reckon any buy would be good if you're looking in the long term since we're still technically in the red compared to that, if you were in the short term then you bought too late and could've profited a bit when you bought at 16,17k. Now imo the price wouldn't increase continuously like this, a drop off to maybe 19 could happen and it's just gonna move up and down from then. We might see it increase a bit more after a few months only.",

Totally depends on the situation, sometimes you got to buy green coz it gets more greener before any dip. We've already witnessed this a lot of times especially with bitcoin. Just think, few months ago 20k was considered as bloodbath but today it looks green with the same price. So you decide what you want to believe in.Quote from: Wexnident on January 15, 2023, 04:29:53 AMNow imo the price wouldn't increase continuously like this, a drop off to maybe 19 could happen and it's just gonna move up and down from then.Now thats just your opinion but dropping to 19k will kill the whole run up. It should pump once more to 22k then sustain between 21.3k-21.6k for a few days and the indicators will show like they are cooling off magically. And again, 1st feb will be important for us (major fomc meeting regarding rate hikes). Expect btc to 30k if 25bps is announced.",

Just a kind advice, the risk is mine.I will tell you a secret, it never becomes easy to tell the current state of the market, just as this could be an important correction which could take us to the mid 20k or maybe we could even reach 30k during the next weeks, this could also be a trap and the price could go below 20k again.But even then if you are planning to hold your coins for the long term this is a good entry point, it is not as good as the one you could have gotten a week ago, but the more you postpone this the more you will second-guess yourself, so if you like bitcoin for what it is as a technology then buying now is a good move.",

Just a kind advice, the risk is mine.Of course the best time to buy is when the price is <$20k, around $16k-$18k maybe. But since the market has risen in the last couple of days, you might fine it bullish though. On the other hand, this is just a recovery, if you will have to look at the prior movement, the price is around this range before the FTX collapse and it's subsequent negative effect on the market. So this is just about normal price range in my opinion, so my best advise is to just buy at this price, and look at the long term, maybe in the next bull run, we will see a new all time high that is in the 6 digit range. So still very good to buy today and hold as long as you can, or at least in the bull run 2024-2025.",

As for my suggestion, don't entry without conviction and knowledge in the market. If you don't know when to entry then it is better to invest in knowledge when it comes to TA or technical analysis first. Because if you just invest in market without knowing it first, then your investment is not \"safe\" because you do not have enough plan when the market reacts again in your bias.

Just a kind advice, the risk is mine.I would not consider the current slight rise in price as a bullish trend, because there are no serious prerequisites for this yet. It looks more like a short-term jump, which can return to the previous indicators. Buy or not buy now depends on your goals. If you take it for a long period, then what is holding you back? Also, you don't say anything about the coins you are considering buying. So, in this case it is impossible to advise you anything. If we take old and proven projects, like bitcoin, then of course, the purchase now can be successful. If you buy some shitcoins, you can burn out.It has never been safer to buy crypto currencies on this market. This market is very unpredictable and always fraught with risks.Everyone likes to give advice, but few risk their hard-earned money.
