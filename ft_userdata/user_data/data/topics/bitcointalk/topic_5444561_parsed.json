  "content": "The reason behind putting such a harsh title is the reality behind the current financial crisis. In the news today I read an article stating how Silicone Valley Bank which is the 18th most highly popular and strong bank in the country the US has gotten its finances collapsed like crazy. The bank is most involved in tech start-up bank accounts and big to small IT companies. It is also one of the popular banks that lend loans to start-ups in the stated domain. The problem started when the bank was trying to gain capital funding of around 2.25 billion USD for the recovery of loss but failed to do it. There was a cascade of a chain reaction after this leading to the closure of various bank accounts and the pulling of the money into other bank accounts. What it has got to do with the Crypto pace anyways?The notable economist Nouriel Roubini, who rightly predicted the 2008 crisis, has now predicted that if banks like SVB are not foolproof for losses then how one could trust crypto exchanges? He says, banks are far more secure with backups such as bonds, deposit insurance, lender of last resort, and much more. However, crypto exchanges do not have all of this. He also added that we can actually relate to the situation of FTX here and how it failed everyone.I can imagine how bad it is to keep our funds on a crypto exchanger from this incident as well considering this man has stated a few facts about the fund's security. The news covers the whole story of how this collapse happened and what lies before us. QuoteThe bank, the key lender for tech startups, had run out of liquidity. Its clients (start-ups) had started withdrawing money as funding had stopped from Venture Capitals due to fears of recession. The bank had to sell the government securities at a loss as their value had declined due to high-interest rates.If Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) can go bust in one day, any exchange or financial scheme in the crypto space can go bust faster, noted economist Nouriel Roubini warned on Saturday. SVB, the 16th largest bank in the US, collapsed in just 48 hours after it tried to raise $2.25 billion to plug a loss caused by the sale of assets, mainly government bonds.The bank, the key lender for tech startups, had run out of liquidity. Its clients (start-ups) had started withdrawing money as funding had stopped from Venture Capitals due to fears of recession. The bank had to sell the government securities at a loss as their value had declined due to high-interest rates.Roubini, who had predicted the Great Financial Crisis in 2008, said the crypto exchanges were like banks with massive maturity mismatches and shoddy assets. The crypto exchanges, he added, don't have the liquidity, capital, deposit insurance, and LOLR (Lender of Last Resort) option of real banks. \"So cryptosystem in on its way to systemic meltdown,\" he warned.Roubini, also known as 'Dr Doom', has been warning investors against buying into crypto which he calls a 'scam'. In January this year, he said literally 99 per cent of crypto is a scam. \"A criminal activity. A total real-bubble Ponzi scheme that is going bust,\" he said while speaking to Yahoo Finance.He had also said that crypto exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) were not an exception — \"they're a rule\". Founded in 2019, FTX west bust in November last year.  However, some experts say SVB is not a fraud case like FTX and that startups should not panic. There is obvious panic around the sudden collapse of the bank but several startups, which had huge exposure to the bank, could successfully migrate their funds to other banks or neo-banks in time.Vivek Khandelwal, Founder of iZooto, told Business Today that most companies in the B2B SaaS space have SVB accounts and a lot of them could move a chunk of our funds after Thursday night's tanking of the stock had triggered enough panic.Amarpreet Kalkat, founder & CEO of Humantic AI, said his California-headquartered startup could successfully pull out funds from SVB. He said his first thought was to support SVB, thinking this would pass but the next thought was that he had a bigger responsibility to 20 people whose livelihood was at stake, and the customers and the investors. \"Next two hours were spent in finding a way to transfer the money out (we didn’t have millions but it was still well above the FDIC limit),\" he said in a series of tweets.On Friday, California's financial regulator - the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation or DFPI - took control of SVB, citing \"inadequate liquidity and insolvency\". The SVB is a state-chartered commercial bank based in Santa Clara and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, with total assets of approximately $209 billion and total deposits of approximately $175.4 billion as of December 31, 2022.The collapse saga began on March 8 when the bank announced a loss of approximately $1.8 billion from a sale of investments (US treasuries and mortgage-backed securities). The same day, the bank’s holding company announced it was conducting a capital raise. Despite the bank being in sound financial condition prior to March 9, investors and depositors reacted by initiating withdrawals of $42 billion in deposits from the Bank, causing a run on the bank.As of the close of business on March 9, the bank had a negative cash balance of approximately $958 million, the California regulator said in its possession order. \"Despite attempts from the Bank, with the assistance of regulators, to transfer collateral from various sources, the Bank did not meet its cash letter with the Federal Reserve.\" The regulator said the precipitous deposit withdrawal caused the bank to be incapable of paying its obligations as they came due, and the bank was now insolvent. If SVB can go bust, any crypto exchange can, warns Nouriel Roubini who predicted Great Financial Crisis",

Whatever \"innovations\" we see around the crypto ecosystem like lending, deposits, trading, and centralized exchanges, are actually taking the entire ecosystem towards a centralized banking system. That might become disastrous in the future and we have already got a hint when FTX collapsed. But SVB is a different story. This bank is used to fund tech startups which is a hugely risky venture. Tech startups use a model called \"lean startup\" where they do not have a clear roadmap in most cases. They fail fast to learn from it and to derive a new way to succeed. That's how usually startups work and the risk is huge. So when SVB took a such a risk, they should have really prepared themselves for today's scenario. It's unfortunate that the US government denied a bailout for them. I am more worried about a global recession now because millions of people are going to loose their jobs.",

Over the last three years, cryptocurrency has gained confidence from stable coins and their ability to replace volatile coins even during bear markets. It was showing potential for getting a lot of adoption from government and banks can use it to trade fiat whenever traders are willing to do so. The attack on USDC last year was followed by the attack on BUSD this year. This 2 stable coin tragedy resulted in the attack on Silicon Valley bank, what is next? Is there another narrative that can help this space if all of this collapses?",

Now it depends on how strongly a crypto user trusts the crypto market and blockchain technology's impact. If the fud and fake accusations break that bond of trust then users of crypto will definitely shrink their deposits in panic. if that happens then the same thing will happen as happened for FTT, SVB, etc. This bank has no or less impact on the crypto industry. the same query was also shared by another community member. you can check the answer there too.here is the post;Quote from: Faisal2202 on March 11, 2023, 05:17:08 AMThat's some sad news for crypto market. As market is in red mode now.....overall, these are just anti-crypto users who want to promote banks over digital finance because they are afraid of the potential that blockchain and crypto technology have to dominate the banking system. So do the governments too. because if things get normal as this person asked. Quote from: SosSpagetti on March 06, 2023, 08:51:54 AMwhen cryptocurrency will come into our lives and be normal for all people? Will people be able to trust crypto?If this happens, then the business that these organizations are running will come to an end and the revenue that they are generating on the basis of people's trust will be demolished so to keep the business running they have to transfer the trust of crypto users to banks and also do not wants, there users to migrate to crypto exchanges.",
