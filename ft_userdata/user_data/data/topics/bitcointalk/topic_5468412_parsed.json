Haha, I’m not a card counter and it’s impossible to do that with the way they continuously shuffling their deck after using half of their cards. Card count usually effective when most of the card is already being use since you have a lot of data for the remaining card. I memorized the basic strategy and to calculate the odds of getting high card using some strategy. I can only assure minimize loss most of the time but I can’t guarantee either huge win.I said to inspire because I was on some point that doubting about credibility of live games blackjack when I’m still newbie and continuosly losing. I want to inspire those person to play without doubting the provider integrity so that they can focus on the game.",

You can share here your record such as screenshots to inspire other player.As far as I can remember my longest winning streak in Blackjack was 7. I'm unable to provide a screenshot since it happened years ago, but it's still fresh in my mind because such win streaks are rare for me when it comes to gambling. And still ended up losing all those winnings from the winning streak.Anyway congrats on your profit and longest winning streak on Blackjack!",

Now that you mention it, I’m already regretting for not increasing my bet.  Seriously speaking, I usually increase my bet whenever I’m on the momentum. I decided to stick on fixed bet this time because I’m busy chatting on the dealer most the time throwing some cheezy text. The wait time is very quick since this is speed so I decided on fix bet rather than be confused due to time panic.",

However, I have a small message for you, hopefully in the future you will be wiser in the gambling games you play and you will still be able to control your emotions when playing.Why do I say this, because there are quite a few people who get consecutive wins but they cannot enjoy the results of their gambling because they run out again in the next gambling game.And we need to realize that luck doesn't appear every time we play, even if you have had a winning streak, it's just a coincidence which will probably be very difficult to repeat a second time.",

This is luck coupled with experience.  Contratulation on the winnings@OP.I only happen to have at most 3 to 4 winning streaks in blackjack.  Since I often try to decide on a risky move whenever I am at more than 2 winning streaks.  I often stand when I have 16 in hand and that is mostly beaten by the host.",

It was a table with 4 players playing iirc and its pretty rare for me to play in a table that has players that actually understand the basic BJ strategy. Normally I would find an idiot that would hit on 13/14 when dealer has 6 on his hands thus ruining the momentum when he got that 10 for his hands then dealer managed to win somehowAnyway its pretty rare for a speed blackjack table to be having only 2 players in it, normally its pretty packed",

This rally are really rare.Sometimes you need a lot lose several weeks.Just in, Not that long win streak from my previous one but this time I manage to increase my bet per win from 5$ until 15$ bet. I manage to profit almost 200$ this time through this quick game with consistent win. I never thought to experience this kind of luck consecutively within just a week of betting. I believe this win streak will continue if evolution gaming brings back the continuous game without 2 minutes shuffle on their 5$ min bet game.  I’m very lucky on trying new casino for a change of gambling ambiance.

My longest winning streak is only 9 but my bet amount at that time is insane so I get a huge profit despite my streak is much lower. New update of evolution gaming offers already a cashout feature that let you save your winning streak count if you have a bad hand. I think this feature makes easier to achieve that kind of streak now compared before when your only choice is to stand or gamble hit when your card is so bad. Congratulations to the win. I'm still not playing the new version in long session become cashout sometimes destroy my strategy. I will try to beat your streak once i have a chance to play tomorrow or next week.",

This cash out feature is only available on Stake casino before but now most of the evolution gaming blackjack table has this kind of feature which is available on the settings of evolution.Sometimes this feature makes me confused on what’s strategy I will use especially when I cashout while the dealer has a bad card which I will not do if I’m not protecting my streak.

This feature sometimes very expensive if use wrong.This is the dilemma on using early cashout feature. Your mind will be on the state of confusion while you cashout on dealer 10 then later on faced up a total of 16 below and bust. You will be confused if you will cashout or not which is very painful if you are an overthinker while the decision time is very short.I usually turn off this feature when gambling casually so that I will not have extra decision to make that will make me confused. I’m only using cashout feature whenever I bet huge amount and want to play safe. I’m still not playing for a while due to rest after winning big time last week. Just want to not jinx my charm.",

Also what a number to stop on lol, if you know, you know.For me the longest winning streak is something like 9 wins in a row i think. It happened a few years back in a crypto casino of some sort.
