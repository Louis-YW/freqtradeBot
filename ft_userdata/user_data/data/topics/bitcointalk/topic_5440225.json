This section is for collectibles, which is exactly what you have here. This is a topic that’s been discussed by the moderators quite a few times over the years and the main rules are it needs to be a collectible of some type and you must be willing to accept bitcoin as payment.

Silly to post otherwise, and to say it in such a negative way that may deter a newcomer to the space is simply not ok, and pretty “uncool”, especially from a member who has been here almost as long as I have. I look forward to your list @Kmiller62571 should you still want to share it.Thanks!",

Sure but by being vintage possibly rare LP's and they do accept BTC - it fits here as well.",
