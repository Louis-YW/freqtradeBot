  "content": "Today I have realized that Satoshilabs has released a new update for Trezor Suite which seems to include some kind of protection (probably an auto-detect) against address poisoning for Ethereum addresses, among other bug fixing and features forwards to coinjoin implementation. Just letting you all know in case you want to download it and test it. You can learn more about address poisoning here: https://trezor.io/support/a/address-poisoning-attacksSource & Further details on this update: https://trezor.io/learn/a/trezor-suite-update-february-2023Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/1132lw4/trezor_suite_updates_february_2023/Make sure to validate the download before installing it, as usual.",

I don't think taproot is well used at the moment and I think it was satoshi labs that were trying to make their own coinjoin/privacy based service too so those are both very proactive improvements that might not be used yet but will have been around for so long when they are that they'll have the added security of that (if the code is older, there's likely more people to have seen it and audited it).",

The mempools look better than what they did throughout the week. 20-30k of unconfirmed transactions was pretty normal since Ordinals got introduced. I have checked mempool.space a few times today and it always showed between 5-6k of unconfirmed transactions only. But that won't last long, and I am sure the numbers will go up again soon.",

Hopefully we can see again an empty mempool in some weeks. I am still skeptical though.I also gave a look to the use of Taproot (https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-and-outputs-p2tr/) and there is also a small dump on it, but nothing which could suggest people are done with NFTs in our main-net.

Fingers crossed. I haven't looked into how Ordinals work, but I am certain they use Taproot due to improved smart contract capabilities that the upgrade brought to the BTC blockchain. Taproot usage might be dropping now a bit (together with the minting of Bitcoin blockchain NFTs), but it went up quite a bit same as the adoption of Ordinals. I am not sure I can use that sentence construction?! I never cared much for NFTs on alternative blockchains, so I was never interested in checking if the Ordinals bring anything good to Bitcoin, or if it's just bananas and monkeys.",

While others could argue Bitcoin is supposed to be open and always looking for evolution.I personally like how these Ordinals brought attention to Taproot, hopefully people will continue to use this new format for actual transactions instead spamming the mempool with monkeys.",
