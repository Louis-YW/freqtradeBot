  "content": "Betfury booongo rebrand scam What happened:: I have played at betfury for over a year and only had good things to say about them. I mainly played booongo slots and a number of the slots have a feature that progressively builds and when it is maxed out it can randomly trigger the bonus. I have built up a number of the slots to be full on the high stakes. I should also point out that betfury had a booongo tournament in may where potentially many other people have potentially done the same. Without notice all the booongo slots have been rebranded and all the bet history has been lost. I spoke to betfury support and they originally stated the slots did not do this, then that it doesnâ€™t remember from session to session (it does) I was promised the history would be restored. Anyway you can read the chat screenshots and see for yourself. For some reason I canâ€™t get the screenshots to show in the thread but the links are there and in the right order.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2848599Reference Link: www.betfury.io Amount Scammed:  potentially thousandsPayment Method:  multiple cryptoProof of Payment:  https://iili.io/wSYFEl.md.pngPM/Chat Logs: Here they admit to rebranding the slothttps://postimg.cc/ZCrrqcZxHere they state that the bonus rounds are not lost? Surely if it could remember this state it could remember the progress and history of building the bonus.https://postimg.cc/8svvyHFgHere I show that the history has gone. https://postimg.cc/zLPhQ2S8https://postimg.cc/yJN9vCRLhttps://postimg.cc/Y4V4RGMShttps://postimg.cc/N9HKzsjkhttps://postimg.cc/R3jFfkL6Here they try to gaslight me that this isnâ€™t even a feature and I prove it to them.https://postimg.cc/d78dK1zDhttps://postimg.cc/s1CHQNy4https://postimg.cc/f3XFnczXThen they try and gaslight me again saying it doesnâ€™t save from session to session. https://postimg.cc/sBNXHWf3https://postimg.cc/N5c0nBt2https://postimg.cc/PLPfDqW9https://postimg.cc/nXdV9tBTHere they say that the provider changes the slots and they have no control over it, as far as I can tell nowhere else has changed this slot, they also promise me here that my history will be returned but itâ€™s still not. https://postimg.cc/K4FWRHDhhttps://postimg.cc/njGsvHVRhttps://postimg.cc/w345Yb6tAdditional Notes:  This uses to be my main casino and apart from this issue I would have recommended them to anyone. The games already have an house edge without them pulling dirty unannounced tricks like this.",

      "body": "although I agree that they should have at least informed their gamblers that they would change game providers for some of their slots, I don't think any scam actually happened. I understand OP's frustration but I don't believe you have a scam case here, sorry.anyway, some of the screenshots you shared are the same. check the bottom part of the links you shared.",
