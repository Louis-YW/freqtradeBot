The point exactly, I need not to stress myself and waste yet another penny or effort in buying some chemical or metal work material to destroy whatever have been ached on the steel plate. I’ll just create a brown new non custodian wallet, get my keys properly backed up in a way to get my peace of mind and transfer the coins into the new wallet.I’d not see no way anyone would be taking my coins after I have successfully transferred them to a new wallet. Perhaps I might even get the metal sold off as scrap metal for the scrap guys.We’ve got these easily means to navigate and I’ll use it good in this context.",

It's not totally useless because it contains your transaction history and you might want it not fall into other's hands. Also there could be situations where it's not an option - you want to destroy just a backup, not the wallet. Imagine you have two backups, one at your current location and another at a remote and safe location. Let's say you are moving from your current location to some new one where you wouldn't keep your steel backup with you because the new place is not safe enough. So you'd want to destroy the backup at your current location, while still relying on the backup at your other safe location.",

That melted steel could again be used by other factories. I think you can even get paid for that. However you might feel suspicious of the workers melting your steel plate. You’d just have to wish that the workers don’t care or don’t know about whatever it is that is etched on it.",

They always display the seed, because its for learning purposes only, if you like, go and import the seed, it will be empty anyway. Why destroy something that's empty? Why spend money on Acid just to destroy a plate that has nothing inside? Abandoned the old steel and throw it out through the window, get a new stainless steel and do your backup.",

This is the simplest and most reasonable method, but not effective if you want to break the connection with the previous seed-phrase. That is, it will be better if you physically destroy the steel plate. Quote from: Zaguru12 on March 29, 2024, 11:44:17 PMThe two options mentioned by you are the most practical ones and would be effective. I will go with the second option of mechanical damage that’s using a chisel to put in many random holes in the steel to make it unreadable for any one. Take any available power tool (angle grinder, drill and so on - grind and drill sections of plates with seed phrases words) and use it to destroy the text, shredding it and making it impossible to reassemble the text like a puzzle. For the paranoid, I can suggest scattering the crushed parts in different locations.All this can be done with hand tools if you want to enjoy the duration of the process.",

That would require special equipment, and can of course also be dangerous to the one doing it because of dealing with molten metal. Since the info is on the plate, grinding is another option, but that also requires special equipment. It looks like it's not something easy to do because steel is made to last. I agree with Zaguru12 that the best option is to transfer the coins and thus get a new seed phrase. And then the old one can go to metal recycling or whatever without any concerns. But I've seen the op's response on why it can still be a bad idea. Well, then one needs to buy an industrial torch or a grinder, then.",

Any more ideas?If it is your wallet, and you no longer want to use it, nothing is serious.You can migrate your fund in that wallet to a new wallet. Then abandon that wallet, just throw it away somewhere nobody can know that wallet belongs to you. It will relate to other practices previously like whether you publicly posted your wallet addresses and your identity information.You can complicate it more by destroy that steel back up but I don't think it is too important and vital for you.Problems appear only if you still use that wallet for storing your bitcoins but throw the backup away.Complicate your life, you can read some tests from Jameson Lopp.https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1poBdHCVrd5eErAWySjSBoKh2f_6VCHsy3ForvL8JCRE/edit#gid=197446072Stress test https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test/He has Heat tests and Corrosion tests too.",

I find that protecting them is really a very difficult task while destroying them is not a difficult problem. Also, if we can engrave words on the steel plate, why don't we try changing some of the words on it? That way, if someone picks up those steel plates they won't have our real seed phrase.We come up with thousands of ways to keep our seed phrases as safe as possible, and now we find ways to destroy them, which is interesting  .",

Although, I doubt it would lead to more extreme thoughts, to dispose a seed plate backup shouldn't be much work if you were the one who did the etching in the first place. The tools you used are already present and am sure by altering the letters of the alphabet, or  by adding just a few etched alphabets to the ones already on there would alter the real pronunciation or spellings of the seed phrases, rendering it meaningless to someone who sees it as a special and customized designer product. Adding crossed lines to the etched words could also alter it making it meaningless too.",
