If we buy right now and it drops to $30k, we will be losing more than 10%, so, I would recommend following the drop, and when recovery starts then just ride the wave.",

It is possible that you are right that now could be the best time to buy BTC this year. But let's face the fact that the year isn't over yet and there's still a lot that could change regarding BTC price. I would expand your vision a bit and say that buying a bitcoin now could be the best opportunity of your life if you haven't already.Quote from: mr_ROBOTT on May 08, 2022, 05:03:57 PMBitcoin is currently trading at $ 34,493 and the bear market is coming to an end.I would be interested to know how you get such accurate information that bear market is coming to an end?

Because the market is volatile, you can't just rely on waiting speculation. If you have missed the train then you say: why not buy at the bearish yesterday?. Therefore, in every decline, there is always a buy, no matter whether it will go deeper or it will bounce back unexpectedly. Every analysis will always be broken by a relatively running market according to its will.",

I like Bitcoin because it enables you to send money around the world with almost zero transaction costs and it lets you exchange value instantly between two peers. Sounds like a good thing to have. I also like to think of it as a form of saving. A lot of people have different reasons for buying Bitcoins but I'd say most people buy because they think that it will keep increasing in value. Some people use it for investments. I have no idea how Bitcoin's future will turn out but the fact that people are willing to bet so much money on it means that it could become an incredibly powerful store of value in the future. Maybe in 10 years' time I’ll be kicking myself for not getting into it even more. For now though I'm just buying as much as I can and hoping for the best.",

That's how we miss the opportunity to accumulate some sat. I know it's a good time to accumulate Bitcoin, but I don't expect more dump at all. But still, we don't know what will happen. Some big FUDDER behind this dump and they are doing this. Bullish will start soon and we can see green candles again. This is Bitcoin behavior at all.",

The ongoing market drop is connected to the outflow of bitcoin from the Terra foundation.Terra planned to back its stablecoins with bitcoin and for the same it bought huge volume of bitcoins. So, there is more chances of market getting recovered at the earliest. So, users can considering investing at the moment for short term profiting. This is my personal view and before investing do your own research.",

Because there are miners and whales, if they started to sell, then it might be going down again. But we have to remember one point, brother, that this is crypto and we are with bitcoin only dependent on our hope. because we already know that bitcoin's price is unpredictable. Though people are saying that it might be the bear market's end of the point. Though I have a little doubt on that. I thought we might see a little more dump. because bitcoin was at a stable point for some days. Now maybe we saw a little more than that. Then the bullish market can be started. So it is a speculation. And my opinion can be different from others'. Thank you.",

There's still a lot of time till a new bull cycle starts, if the previous pattern holds true. And halvening will only happen in 2 years, and it usually takes a bit more time after the halvening for a new bull run to start.It's true that bear market is a good time to buy, but it doesn't mean that now is the perfect time, although remember that perfect shouldn't be an enemy of good.",
