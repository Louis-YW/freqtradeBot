  "content": "I know there's already a thread on Ordinals in the Development & Technical Discussion board but it's more on the technical side of things. I guess it's interesting to hear what others have to say on what this latest development fundamentally entails or implies. There have been opposing views on this even among Bitcoin developers. Some would say this kind of non-financial transaction isn't what Bitcoin is designed for. Surely, however, somebody could just brush this off somehow putting Satoshi's original idea seemingly subservient to what the community currently wants to make of it. Ordinals' Rodarmor himself asserted that Bitcoin has already \"transcended the intentions of its creator.\"[1]While a core developer dismissed this controversy as a non-issue, another core developer went as far as calling this an attack on Bitcoin itself. While somebody doesn't understand the fuss over something which is dumb and should simply be forgotten, even Adam Back, perhaps out of frustration, had to call it a \"fair-game for miners to censor the crap as a form of discouragement.\" Of course, he had to retract it in the name of Bitcoin being censorship-resistant and permission-less. But even Rodamor himself had to also censor, at least from Ordinals' site, a lewd image inscription.[2] The launch of the Ordinals protocol even put into question whether Bitcoin's base layer should be left alone or be kept open for anybody to tinker with and develop. Some would even call for Bitcoin's ossification to protect it from features that have possible negative repercussions. And then there's also the issue of fungibility considering that a Satoshi assigned with a unique inscription such as an image or even a video is no longer the same with the rest. What is your opinion on this? Are you in favor of this or not?[1] https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/bitcoin-community-erupts-in-existential-debate-over-nft-project-ordinals/[2] https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-creators-look-for-fix-after-first-instance-of-shock-porn",

Sometimes it makes me feel sad when Satoshi's original vision for Bitcoin is somehow belittled by what we prefer to make of it today. But perhaps it's just the way it is. After all, Bitcoin is not static. But it's not a question of Bitcoin being bigger than Satoshi; it's about Bitcoin being bigger than what it was originally intended for.  Anyway, I'm also imagining potential problems down the road, but there will certainly be solutions as well.Quote from: franky1 on February 02, 2023, 03:10:22 PMfirstly many people keep playing the fungible card. waving it aroundfungibility is not a 2 option yes or noits a scale     a scale of suspicion/uniquenessnothing is 100% fungible or \"fungible: yes\"everything is a scale. even paper cashBut a crumpled and soiled 1 USD bill has the same value and purchasing power and is interchangeable with a smooth and newly-issued 1 USD bill.

Issues surrounding fungibility are always a concern, but if there isn't sufficient demand for it on Bitcoin's blockchain, then it shouldn't become an issue.  I'm honestly hoping that in a few months' time, everyone will have forgotten about this already.",

 Or are you really so blind and dumb that you genuinely don't grasp that very real consequence?  Along with weakening decentralisation by making it more costly to run nodes, you would simultaneously make the blockchain cheaper to attack.  So it's a good thing your vision will remain imaginary when it comes to this chain.  Mainly due to you continuing to have moronic ideas, no code and nothing to offer besides a load of hot air.  You sound exactly like an SV supporter.  Go use their crappy knock-off if that's the Bitcoin you want.you are an idiotyou dont want fee formuleas in bitcoin to make spam/bloat expensive. you want bloaty transactions of batches and length witnesses to be discounted. you want the spam.. you want it so you can sales pitch the flawed subnetwork you adore as the solution everyone should offramp you.. when bitcoin gets congestedyes you want the congestion. you want the premium fes on bitcoin.. as it aids you selling your snake oil subnetwork. which cant even be capable of handling most case tx values that bitcoin process(LN can in best case only handle 95% success for under $30 value payments)(bitcoin does about $2b in movement a day and 350k tx a day=average $5700 a tx)people can move billions in 1 tx on bitcoin no issue. but LN has a 5% fail rate with just $30 and a near 100% fail rate above $800...suggesting everyone should wait because LN is the thing devs see as the progression path. is a patience plea that has been running for too many years now..you dont want bitcoin devs to remove the cludgy code holding payment data down to a 1mb limit. because again you want to limit transaction counts per block while saying you love how devs allowed a 3mb addon weight for bloaty scrypts/metadata/etc. thus again wasting data space while not uprating the tx count to be more usefuland as just shown in your quote. you think anyone peed off with core should f**k off to other networks. again you think the only option is adore core of use another networkYOU are the totalitarian centralist adorer.. bitcoin should be the payment network and subnetworks should be the bloaty data crap. not the other way roundQuote from: DooMAD on February 04, 2023, 12:20:59 AMQuote from: franky1 on February 03, 2023, 09:18:01 PMbut bitcoin is slacking behind.Quoted for next time franky1 pretends it's the LN advocates who are the ones saying \"Bitcoin doesn't work\".  It's really franky1 who believes that, purely because no one wants to relent to his obscene, totalitarian demands.  He states over and over that Bitcoin should be better than it is and that there's a sordid conspiracy to hold it back from fulfilling its potential.  He repeatedly claims Bitcoin is \"stifled\", \"hindered\" and \"stalled\".  There isn't a single LN advocate that slags off Bitcoin as much as franky1 does.the funny thing is you slag it off alot. after all if you thought bitcoin was doing its job you would not need your stupidly flawed subnetwork and not need to try recruit people over to your crap networkbitcoin does work but it needs to evolve too. needs to progress. this progress was growing 2009-2016. but then.. the onchain scaling stopped. you silly guys saying that there are \"scaling solutions\" but onchain scaling is not going to happen anytime soon because devs prefer other option where you have for years been saying \"just be patient\" .. well you said in 2019 just be patient you favoured subnetwork is only 2 years old just wait. well 4 years later you still want people to wait. with the hope your silly subnetwork will(sometime) suddenly flower and bloom into the pretty thing you lot promise.. yea we see your delay stall tactics.. and no your flower is not going to be the thin it was promised as.. Quote from: DooMAD on February 04, 2023, 12:20:59 AMQuote from: franky1 on February 03, 2023, 09:18:01 PMit needs to stop wasting years on half assed subnetwork bridges and \"conservative.. patience\" that after years have not met promises..It has delivered a damn sight more than you ever have.  What have you achieved lately?  How many additional transactions have you enabled?  Is it zero?  I'm pretty sure it's zero.  Twunt.funny part is many other subnetwork bridges that have bitcoin value pegged to it have achieved alot more in 15 months than LN has in 7 yearsyour whole, pretend it didnt happen but let it happen narrative of stifling bitcoin transaction payment scaling growth is obviousyour whole enjoyment of seeing more then 1mb of blocks but not an equal increase in transaction count is obviousyour recruits might be lulled to sleep. but many many people in the wider community see your games they just dont care to call you out and debate your totalitarian dreamspeople can see you adore bloating up and making fees expensive(for normal p2p payments) on bitcoin and cheap(miscounting bytes) for bloaty scripts and metadata. where you want everyone to move over to a flawed buggy subnetwork so you can steal value off them. your shameless sales pitches are getting so bad now that even your own recruited posse are starting to question your narrative and move away from your idolismshere is something you will learnpeople have had enough of your subnetworks unmet promises and hopes. they will leave you behind. whereby other subnetworks will be created that offer things your subnetwork cant even dream to offer let alone fake promise offer. and your wasted 7 years will be for nothing",

Without any input from me, people are choosing to run Core.  I'm doing nothing at all to influence that.  Blame me all you like but it won't make a difference.  People can code what they want and run what they want.  However, they need others to work with them if they want to move forward with new ideas.  Even if you did have any good ideas (and you don't), no one would want to work with you, because you're an obnoxious, relentless, insufferable, unyielding tyrant.  And there is no point repeating the course failed forkcoins have taken.  We've had years to watch them get absolutely nowhere and we aren't going to repeat their mistakes.  If you like their \"dOuBlE fAsTeR hUrR dUrR\" approach, it's only sensible to use their substandard product.  If BTC users wanted that nonsense, they'd run code to make it happen.  Quote from: franky1 on February 04, 2023, 06:24:11 AMhere is something you will learnpeople have had enough of your subnetworks unmet promises and hopes. they will leave you behind. whereby other subnetworks will be created that offer things your subnetwork cant even dream to offer let alone fake promise offer. and your wasted 7 years will be for nothingCool.  Care to specify a timeframe for your unhinged prognostications?",

(a security risk, but you dont want that talked about and you funnily THEN pretend people dont have the power to veto it)sidenote: when i speak of \"you\" im also talking about the royal \"you\" of the monarchy /hierarchy of certain people. (it just gets boring to keep saying your group. of sub-nutters)so when you keep saying how you love that fee's are high.. dont play dumb that you think its user decided to cause a fee hikeusers didnt write the code. devs do. and again you dont like that i critique the devs, and you want shift to blame to everyone else but the devs.. inclding trying to blame me as if im the totalitarian coder making bitcoin central(facepalm).. you really are shamefuland dont play dumb .. core could remove the cludge to reduce the fee hiking principles and replace it with something else.. we both know your silly group you shill for want things a certain way of premium bitcoin to then offer discounted something else.. . and \"you\" dont want core devs or even an opposing brand offering something that can give better utility to bitcoin and reduce the spam while also not causing everyone to \"just pay more\"you may just be a sponsored snake oil sales rep type of guy, but you know exactly what your \"community\" wantand no your \"community\" is not the same as the wider community of millions of users that want to use bitcoinstop playing games and trying to tell people to let core do what they like as long as they get sponsored to do what the corporate merchants want which then pay you to promote their servicesits now obvious by how much you disregard bitcoin protocol scrutiny, and security that you must be getting paid. unless.. only other option is, that you are a scammer wanting the other subnetwork rammed full of naive people for you to scam their funds off them.. one or the other i smell greed in your tacticsbut it is funny how you played the conservative card to say bitcoin shouldnt add more dataspace to allow more transactions (when talking about payment tx count) but now you want people to shut up and pretend its not a problem when discussing meaningless metadata spamming up those mostly unused 3mb block alloctionsyour tooo obviousyou want ordinal spam on bitcoin main net and people spending value on your crappy flawed subnet bridge.. yea we get it you dont want bitcoin used for payments peer to peer. we knowquoting for properityQuote from: DooMAD on February 02, 2023, 10:07:50 PMIt all seems a little dramatic to me.  People seem to be concerned about possible attack vectors, but if Bitcoin can withstand pressures from world governments, it seems almost laughable that people think it could be brought down by a few assorted JPEGs.  I take the \"c'est la vie\" approach.I'm honestly hoping that in a few months' time, everyone will have forgotten about this already.doomads usual techniques confirmed☑ lack of care of bitcoin security☑ not wanting to go against the core roadmap. ☑ just let the spam occur ☑ wants people to forget about it, dont fight it",

As far as my opinion on whether it should be happening or not, I would say this… Bitcoin doesn’t care. Developers can say whatever they want and urge blockchain censorship or going away from a permissionless leger but Bitcoin just doesn’t care. This is the attitude we’ve had and will keep. Those trying to censor transactions or want to give their permission for you to make transactions are showing their true colors.",
