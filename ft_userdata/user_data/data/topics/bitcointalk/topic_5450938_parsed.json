  "content": "I saw this fake Ledger Pre-IPO on Facebook. We're all aware that Ledger don't have this but for the sake of those that might end up seeing this type of ad from a fake claimant and page. The name of the page is Mmprotrust and they've got 10 followers only and there's no engagement yet on that page but I guess that there will be a few people that might be victimized by this fraud, still hopeful that it will be zero.Everyone please remember that Ledger official is warning people to take note of these scam and phishing websites. They've always reminded to be careful of such. I've checked Ledger's official website and there's no such as pre IPO by them. The link that was attached on that ad and it was just to send them a message and no website. I can't see the ad on their page but this has appeared on my wall as sponsored ad and took a quick screenshot. And please, don't join any fishy white listing. I'm doing my action of reporting this.Please also be mindful about Ledger's campaign against these fraudsters.Quote from: https://www.ledger.com/phishing-campaigns-status#StopTheScammersONGOING PHISHING CAMPAIGNS",

Don't rule out that possibility that quickly. Hardware wallets are equally appealing to beginners with a bit more money to spend as well as those who have been around longer. And we have already seen all sorts of scams that successfully targeted HW users: Phishing scams where they entered their seed words, receiving and sending money to fake devices, getting tricked by social engineering schemes like address poisoning, etc.",

Like they've just bought it once and they never get any updates from them or they don't initiate to check what's with them. Because not everyone who owns a Ledger wallet are technically in-depth with these phishing and scam schemes.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on May 02, 2023, 10:40:17 AMContact the support team with the link if that fake page link, they are a company and may be able to communicate with Facebook and close that page quickly instead of individual reports.Yes, I've actually reported it already and Ledger's chat support responded to me as seen on this image below: Quote from: Pmalek on May 02, 2023, 11:26:12 AMYeah, there is surely no Ledger IPO, otherwise they would have advertised that all over the place. We all know that Ledger spends loads of money on marketing and advertisement, and this is not something you would have missed if it existed.That's true and I think these scammers will never stop as Ledger is a big company and not just them will be targeted by these scammers. They might make endless fake pre IPO schemes and from Ledger, they'll just go with another known crypto company and awareness is really important into this matter.",

No device is involved but just like how we see with ICO, launchpad and stuff, that's what they're trying to do and not just with scamming people's money but also identities and info.Quote from: yhiaali3 on May 03, 2023, 04:28:25 PMI don't have a ledger wallet but it looks like an official wallet!!!

Just go to the official website.",

It's neither the first nor the second. The scammers are pretending that Ledger has started selling their stock to the general public. An IPO is an Initial Public Offering. It's when a stock gets listed on the stock market and investors get a chance to purchase it. The idea is to trick people into sending them money in exchange for the ownership of Ledger stocks. Obviously, there are no Ledger stocks, and investors would just be filling some scammer's pockets.",

Yeah, these are crazy numbers and that's no longer surprising to them because they're anticipating that the numbers will just keep on increasing as day passes by. It's becoming just usual day to them dealing with these scammers and phishing links that are popping everywhere on the web. And that's why these campaigns and drives and awareness that they're raising and even from the forum from members that are raising awareness of these phishing links do help. But it won't be a battle that's over because it's hard to eradicate these scammers because they'll just copy another popular crypto company for their scamming tricks.",
