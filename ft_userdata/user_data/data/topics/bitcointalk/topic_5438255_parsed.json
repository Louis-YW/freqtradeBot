AT the moment I am not mining with GPU's as the powerbill is abt €0.8 kWh and at that price I cannot afford GPU mining no matter what other people sa or do.",

Even if it was cost-effective, the profit might be questionable too. Can't say anything for sure unless somebody tested it I guess. Doing some Steam Deck reselling business is probably better at the end of the day, especially in a country where a local reseller is hard to find.OP, from your post history I found that you own a 3070 TI already. Since you already tried mining on it, what makes you believe you can use your Steam Deck to mine profitably? Do you have cheap electricity access but can't make it work with your GPU or something? It sounds like you already run your PC for mining quite comfortably for now. That aside, websites like whattomine might be able to help you calculate further.",

Your PC's hardware, especially the graphics card, plays a pivotal role. Some coins are more GPU-friendly, so it's essential to research which ones align with your PC's specs.Are you going to download miners on this gaming PC on Steam?There are no miners for this video card. Steam Deck hardware is not optimized for mining. If this is a powerful portable device for gaming, then it is not intended for mining.",

You can mine with almost anything but it doesn't mean you should. Most people get interested in miningto make a quick buck, so when they ask if they can they are really asking if the can make a quick buck.The answer to that question is an clear no.There was no mention of learning by the OP, just an interest in the next bull.",
