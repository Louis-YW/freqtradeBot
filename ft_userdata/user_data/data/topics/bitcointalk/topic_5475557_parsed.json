But with segwit, there is virtual byte or weight that is lower than the actual size of a transaction.

What I think is that in the past when segwit was first adopted, some wallets do not support it. Also are those brain wallet and paper wallet signing and verifying message tools online which some people are using to sign and verify just legacy address messages and not supporting segwit addresses. Making them to think that segwit is not widely used. But all the wallet that are supporting message signing with bitcoin address that support native segwit or any other address type can be used to sign a message. Or if not all, all the ones that I have used sign and verify message for native segwit addresses, unless they are not supporting native segwit.",

I wouldn't call it a bug since it affects unconfirmed transactions only and they are never considered safe to begin with so relying on their hash was never a thing! It only is an issue when it come to second layer (Lightning Network).Additionally what you are describing is only one type of malleability that is done by third parties. Many of the ways to malleate a transaction have been prevented before with BIP62. SegWit fixed the rest involving the signature.The other type that is still possible is when the owner of the key simply creates a different signature for the same transaction. That can never be prevented, nor does it need to be prevented.",

If you use a fee rate of 20 sat/vbyte and the fee rate for high priority remained to be over 31 sat/vbyte for a long time, your transaction can not be confirmed. You transaction will be confirmed if the fee rate is reduced to or lower than 20 sat/vbyte.If you use 35 sat/vbyte or higher as your transaction fee, and the fee rate for high priority did not increase more than 34 sat/vbyte before the next block is mined, your transaction will be confirmed in the next block.Fee rate is proportional to fee. Which means higher fee can actually make your transaction to be confirmed faster, if comparing it with low fee that is too low to get the transaction confirmed as fast as high fee.Miners include transaction with higher fee rate into a block and it will be confirmed, leaving the lower fee rate aside until the mempool to become less congested.",

      "body": "I'm rephrasing the stuff  Charles-Tim and hosseinimr93 have already said (they are both correct), but i tried to make it a bit \"simpler\"...My simplification is a bit \"over the top\", some aspects are oversimplified, but i'm trying to give an ELI13 explanation here The bitcoin network re-adjusts the difficulty every 2016 blocks to make sure that, on average, one block gets found every 10 minutes. That's about ~6 blocks per hour. It doesn't matter if the hashrate climbs or plummets, the network re-adjusts every ~2 weeks to make sure that on average ~6 blocks are found per hour.A block can only contain 1 Mb of transaction data, NOT including the witness data of a segwit transaction... A block can contain up to 4 Mb of data, but the first Mb is the \"actual\" transaction data, and the other 3 Mb is only witness data of segwit transaction. This means that only ~6 Mb of \"actual\" transaction data (not including witness data) can be added to the blockchain each hour. This is also the reason that, when the mempool is overflowing as it is now, a miner has a choice to optimize the block he/she is trying to solve... He/she can make any combination of unconfirmed transaction he/she wishes.When people use legacy addresses, the complete transaction has to fit into the first Mb of the block. When people use segwit addresses, only a part of the transaction has to fit into the first Mb, and a big chunk of the transaction data can fit in the \"extra\" 3Mb. The first Mb is the actual bottleneck, a miner cares less about the witness data since he has 3Mb of blockspace to store said data.Any transaction has a number of inputs (with a value) and a number of outputs (with a value). A miner solving a block can send the block reward to himself, but he can also add the sum of all the values of all inputs of all transactions in his block minus the sum of all the values of all the outputs of all transactions in his block to said block reward... SOOOOO for a miner, if there are plenty of transactions in the mempool to pick from, it's financially beneficial to add transactions with the highest fee per byte of transaction data (since the total size of the block is a limiting factor). Since a segwit transaction NOT including the witness data is much smaller than a legacy transaction, it needs less fee in order to become interesting for a miner to be added to the block he/she is trying to solve.As soon as you get this, it's time to look at taproot",
