  "content": "Recently, we have seen many big institutions, like Black Rock, Invesco, Fidelity investment, Ark Investment, WisdomTree, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs etc take an interest in bitcoin. The hottest application in the show is the BlackRock ETF application which many think is a catalyst for bitcoin. Historically we have seen how big companies tried to take control of the bitcoin network but failed miserably due to a lack of strong support. Controlling the network seems like a major interest for the institutions. This time not only institutions but also the US government are on the list due to their anti crypto policies. Though the SEC claims that bitcoin is a commodity, they still consider it a threat to their financial institutions. They can’t allow such financial freedom among their residents as they fear they will lose control over their people which will diminish some billionaires interest.If you read the Blackrocks ETF application then you will see there is a clause that states that QuoteIn the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin network, the Sponsor will, if permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, use its discretion to determine which network should be considered the appropriate network for the Trust’s purposes, and in doing so may adversely affect the value of the Shares.  This means blackrock can determine which network they will consider the appropriate one so it is reasonable to think they might think about pushing another bitcoin hardfork and setting their own rules to consider it the appropriate network. However BlackRock is the 2nd largest shareholder of the top 4 bitcoin mining companies which share a significant portion of the bitcoin mining profit and can also decide which bitcoin network will come first.All this is speculative thinking and might never happens but with the influence and wealth blackrock like entities hold it is not impossible to try to do anything like this. I don't know this topic has been discussed in the forum before or not but i am curious to know what the community thinks about its.Do you think this can be a secret operation by the us government with Blackrock to take control over the network or is this just nothing more than speculative thinking?What will the impact be do you think if they try to do that in the future?Source: https://blockworks.co/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-wolf",

Without having the majority of everyone onboard - miners, exchanges, businesses, developers, community, holders and so on - this would be nothing but a costly and failed attempt of takeover. Something like what happened with SegWit2x. And I don't think that Blackrock put that clause with intention of artificially fulfilling it, it's just a contingency for an edge case.",

Sure, isn't that what absolutely everyone does when there is a hardfork? You choose which network to support, original bitcoin or its hard fork. Shouldn't they state that in their application?Quote from: DVlog on October 29, 2023, 08:27:48 PMDo you think this can be a secret operation by the us government with Blackrock to take control over the network or is this just nothing more than speculative thinking?Maybe Bitcoin is a secret operation by the US government under the pseudoname of Satoshi who just come out of nowhere and disappeared out of nowhere?You are overthinking here, Blackrock investing in bitcoin is something that logically they should have done years ago because they are an investment company.Blackrock is not a threat, even if there is a hardfork and they support it, there is no threat for those who use bitcoin because they can use original anytime. Does price of bitcoin forks or altcoins matter for you when you want to have a decentralized network and improved privacy? You use bitcoin because you believe in these fundamentals, right? That's all that matters for you then, not a cash flow.",

We can't really force bitcoin to submit to the needs of the few, so a hardfork is quite possible to appease this niche. Scalability and general purpose are also things that have bugged the network for years now, and despite the attempts at solving this courtesy of the layer2 solutions laid in place, we can't really find a good way for bitcoin to reliably solve the scalability problem it was bestowed with from the get-go. Hopefully we see something happen in the future but for now, the most that we could really do is sit down and watch as the whole thing unfolds.",

Ever since Blackrock put out their ETF application the conspiracy nuts have gone crazy with that line.Literally all blackrock is describing in that line they wrote is that if a fork happens they will have to choose which resulting chain the ETF tracks. Nothing remotely controversial in that statement. Cuz of course they will have to choose which fork the ETF tracks, because its an ETF! The ETF owners don't own actual Bitcoin so they don't get all the coins from all resulting forks, because, again, its an ETF, not actual ownership of bitcoins, so blackrock (or any ETF issuer) would have to decide which fork is followed (naturally the fork that remains Bitcoin).All they did was describe what happens when a blockchain forks lol. It's not some big secret conspiracy to take over bitcoin. They literally just described what a blockchain fork is. Naturally they would choose whichever fork is Bitcoin, otherwise you'd have all the ETF owners dumping that ETF immediately if Blackrock decided to have the ETF track some offshoot altcoin of Bitcoin in the event of a hard fork. Not every thing is a conspiracy people. This one is just common sense, Blackrock describing what happens in the case of a fork.",
