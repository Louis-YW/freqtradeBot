  "content": "Last Monday, Voyager issued a notice of default to beleaguered Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which had borrowed $675 million from Voyager in the form of 15,250 bitcoin and $350 million in stablecoin USDC.Quote“While I strongly believe in this future, the prolonged volatility and contagion in the crypto markets over the past few months, and the default of Three Arrows Capital require us to take deliberate and decisive action now,” said Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich in a statement issued late Tuesday. “The chapter 11 process provides an efficient and equitable mechanism to maximize recovery.\"Additionally, 3AC had reportedly placed an overleveraged bet on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to arbitrage the difference between the value of the trust and bitcoin. GBTC shares have been trading at a discount since February 2021, which recently widened to approximately 30%, according to YCharts.According to the filing (https://ru.scribd.com/document/581357118/Petition), Voyager’s estimated assets are between $1 billion and $10 billion, with between $1 billion and $10 billion in estimated liabilities.Source: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/07/06/crypto-broker-voyager-digital-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/It doesn't sound reassuring as it may push more lending platforms to flood so it's best to withdraw your money from all platforms at the moment (if you haven't already)",

But I won’t blame him on coming up to this kind of decision because it’s the only way to save some company to this bloodbath and increasing debt to there balance sheet. I thought Celcius will be the one who will apply for this but I guess Celcius still have balls to stand on this crypto market dipshit.IIRC, This company is connected to 3AC which is earlier announced that they are experiencing same issue to Voyager. I agree to your opinion that this might the start for most of the DeFi company to have courage on filing there bankruptcy. This is an alarming news which might cause more FUD to the crypto market.",

Great investment strategy  I never understood why multi-billion companies, not only from crypto, banks, and investment funds, in every economic area known to man are throwing millions at the most stupid things, millions in advertising, millions wasted each month and they can't find a few tens of thousands of dollars to hire a company specialized in risk and have a serious report about the weaknesses of their business.But probably in the crypto world at least most go by the saying get rich or die trying and risk it in order to get those huge returns they probably know down in their hearts those are way too risky to be true.Quote from: hugeblack on July 07, 2022, 02:31:13 PMDoes anyone know the extent to which these services are exposed to cryptocurrency market, and are they forced to liquidate their currencies?I mean, will we see more liquidity in the market?Probably nobody, even if we somehow manage to get all their CEOs and board of directors together and have a meeting on it they won't be able to come up with certain numbers.Quote from: hugeblack on July 07, 2022, 02:31:13 PMFrankly, I was not following the wave of decentralized finance, but I did not think that many people had invested (Pump a lot of money) in this wave.I thought the same but the numbers in money lost and the reactions on social media tell a different story, guess a lot saw those as a far less risky way to get a solid APY and as I mentioned before in topics like this, on paper everything should have been fine.Probably a few billion at risk or already lost is an understatement for the current situation.",

He'll have to prove to himself that these failing companies are worth helping and saving and that they will eventually give him money. Otherwise, he'd better let them die. What's the point of saving a company that's designed to fail right from the start?QuoteDon't they normally find faults to negotiate prices also?And I mean Elon seem to be doing the same when he offered twitter and then suddenly backs away but I think behind close doors they are negotiating prices.\"Faults\" may not be the right term for it but, of course, they have to find reasons to strike a cheaper deal. A company that's good and is doing good is expensive, or even not for sale. But a company that is good but is facing bankruptcy due to a severe bear market could be taken over easily and cheap. So these hard times could also be good times to some. I don't know if this is the case with Elon backing out from buying Twitter. From what I've read it's more about the contentious issue of bots and fake accounts information which Twitter didn't provide and less about price negotiation.",
