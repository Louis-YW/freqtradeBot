  "content": "I have neither of the above but am leaning towards XRP.I believe Bitcoin will reach $100k next bull run but that is less than a 4X from current price. I have been researching more into XRP lately and have read price predictions ranging from $5 to $100 next bull run. I dont believe XRP will reach $100 or even $50 next bull run but feel like it could reach $5 which sounds conservative compared to all the predictions I have heard but is still a 12X from current price. I am leaning more towards XRP purely for the better possible returns. I do believe Bitcoin is here to stay but less than a 4X from current price doesn’t appeal to me. This is my first bull run coming up and I want to put a lot of the profits I make into Bitcoin in the 2026/27 bear market to then possibly cash out in the 2028/29 bull run when Bitcoin should at least be around $200k.Thoughts on this? Anyone more into XRP or is everyone here pro Bitcoin?",

Bitcoin has been around longer than any cryptocurrency which is in use now and has had better price appreciation, to several thousands of times it's initial price, it is only normal that the price would not multiply as it used to in the very early years and this would push investors to try to catch the next coin early on and benefit from it.I would always pick Bitcoin for more reasons than just the price, it's the one of the only few decentralized coins, with the highest level of security, making it the best choice for long term investment, around 10 - 15 years or more, I cannot bank on any other coin which is in circulation now to remain in circulation at that time.",

Go check other shitcoins, you will see many shitcoins will offer better possible returns than XRP and it will never end.Again it's up to your decision, if you're only looking to get rich quick, you can choose shitcoins. Don't cry if your shitcoins will worth zero because it has a high chance to become a dead coin than multiply your investment.Bitcoin is good to store your wealth, not get rich quick, you will a good return after hold it for many many years.",

If you are still a newbie in crypto, I understand why you are still concerned about altcoins, but if you must know, when refilling your crypto portfolio, Bitcoin is what you should consider first before adding any other token or coin that you are really convinced you want to buy, but don't really be overly confident about the token because you might not get the result you actually expected. Bitcoin has two seasons, which are the bear and bull seasons, but altcoins don't have any seasons; they only follow the trend of Bitcoin, and some times they may not even rise when Bitcoin is in a bull market.",

Even though XRP has the same function as Bitcoin (as a means of payment), both have different centralization and decentralization. The emergence of XRP is due to problems with sending money manually, so XRP main clients are banks, in fact banks don't need XRP.XRP needs more adoption support to support the $100 or even $50 bull run, I think it takes a miracle XRP can reach the numbers you desire. I actually think more realistically in choosing crypto assets, if you have the capacity like Elon Musk, it is possible that an increase in the price of XRP could occur because the fame you have can make your fans follow the path you choose.",
