      "body": "Coinbase and Binance.us are exchanges that I think are currently the best option for people who wants to buy or trade Crypto the only problem is if you are ready to submit and verify the KYC procedure it requires some personal documents and a selfie.Or if you just want to buy Bitcoin and don't want to expose most of your personal documents there are some other options like using a P2P exchange like Bisq or using Bitcoin ATM near your area(BitcoinATM has a limit if you increase more than the limit it will ask for KYC).If you want to check if there is Bitcoin ATM near you then check this link https://coinatmradar.com/",

I don't know if they have restored everything, but it seems they still haven't resolved the issue, and things are getting increasingly tense as they and the DGC are accusing each other. OP should only use Coinbase, the leading US exchange, or can choose Binance.us, the US-specific product of the world's largest exchange Binance. If I were in the US, I would use coinbase, I find it the safest.",
