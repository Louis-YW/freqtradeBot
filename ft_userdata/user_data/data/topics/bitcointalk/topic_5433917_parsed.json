Determining the best religion for Africa is going to be as difficult as for any other country.This is along the lines of what I was thinking.  Africa is such an enormous continent, it would be difficult to get so many people in such a wide geographic area to all believe the same thing.  More likely, they will eventually find freedom of religion (I'd like to believe every place will someday) and there won't be a single organized religion that all of the people take part in.  I'll admit I have no idea what religions in Africa look like currently, but I believe there are probably many tribes with their own way to practice religion that aren't really concerned with what outsiders are trying to push on them.",

So I believe religion has contributed in bringing underdevelopment to Africa coupled with other factors.",

Ultimately, it is up to each person to decide for themselves how to view religion and its impact on African development.I am an African from Nigeria and I can say that religion has set Africa (Nigeria as a case study) back more than it has set it forward if it ever did.In Nigeria we have 3 major religions namely;1. Muslim 2. Christianity 3. Traditional beliefs. Apart from Traditional religion which is part of Africa that originated from Africa which is fast fading away, the other two religions that was taught us was used to scam us and rob us of our natural resources. The version of Christianity that was taught us is not the version that the owners of Christianity practice. They taught us not to fight or war that the God of Israel will fight for us but Israel has all the ammunitions fighting for themselves. All these inconsistencies weakened our reasoning power and now many criminals are in suit scamming us and calling themselves pastors. Asking us to sow seed (give them all our monies ) and go sleep, that the God of Israel will replenish the money.",

The population of Traditional religion practitioners is reducing drastically because of civilization. The problem Africa has is not the religion but the application of the teachings of the religion. Because many Africans are not educated, and hence cannot read the Holy Books of some of these religions, this has allowed many religious leaders or teachers to use religion as a manipulative tool. Africans are no longer controlled or influenced by the teachings of the Holy Bible or Koran but by the words of these influential teachers that are sometimes selfish and corrupt. They have always used religion to manipulate people socially, economically, and politically.",

Few people like the idea of mortality and lot's of people feel the need of having alternative made up reality where their lives make sense and have some sort of bigger purpose where some divine being is interested about their lives.
