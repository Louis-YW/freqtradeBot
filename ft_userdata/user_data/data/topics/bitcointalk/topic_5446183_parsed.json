The majority of countries that the OP's chart refers to are countries whose legislation does not support cryptocurrencies or at best they are lenient with crypto activities without there being laws regulating them. The adoption of bitcoin is from citizens individually or some startups that need to carry out operations with parties from outside the country.One of the most important reasons that most of these countries share is the weakness of the economy and the decline in living standards due to the absence of investment opportunities due to bureaucracy and corruption and at other times wars, so I find it strange that countries such as Syria and Yemen are not in that list.",

Yes, maybe that's one of them, but in my opinion, what makes a lot of people interested in crypto currency is because it can provide benefits when we hold crypto or bitcoin long enough (I think most people still rely on it compared to its utility), Is the best news if indeed bitcoin or crypto is used as its actual utility as currency.If cyrpto is really used as a currency and financial system in industry or business, of course we will have a faster life in life and most likely people will ask the government to upgrade the internet network to be faster and better.The Vietnamese people have an extraordinary sensitivity towards crypto. Of course it is an important point in the adoption of crypto in the country, I think it will be easier to find network developers there to improve usability, security and more when using crypto.",
