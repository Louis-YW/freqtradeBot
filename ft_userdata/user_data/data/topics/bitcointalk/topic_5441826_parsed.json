  "content": "I haven been using Paxful for a while. and dont get anything about them, I really enjoy to use it when I trade with honest and good people, they have (had) an amazing affiliate program to. (But it have been temporary shut down for soon SIX months) and all the earnings you should get, is getting to their pocket instead. I cant see that its anything else then greed, why change something that works so good and everyone is happy about? How it works? If you invite a friend to paxful, you earn 50% of the escrow fee and they earn 50% of the escrow fee, instead of them earning 1% of the escrow fee when they buy bitcoin.I actually earned like 150-200 USD each month from that, but now I have got nothing for almost six months, lol. and they only say \"we dont know when its coming back. also.. when you send btc to an external wallet, the fees they take is INSANE... If you send under 9.99$ the fee is around 1.65$ if you send up to 19$ the fee is 3.80$ USD and over 20$ its around 8$.. its insane.I dont get why they are so greedy, when they have a good platform that can reward them so good.Also... Paxful is FULL of scammers.When you want to buy BTC with PayPal. its almost only kenyans, and almost all of them, not everyone, but almost everyone will try to scam you, saying you send to less, and want you to cancel, and re open trade (then they disable the trade and keep the btc and money on PayPal... or send fake recipes that they have refunded if some problem come up, but they dont refund, i could sit here all day to show examples, but not worth it.This is the most sick and strange thingAlso.. when you wanna sell BTC.. For example with bank transfer, the first 10 offers is scam offers from... Yes Kenyans or Nigerians.That they offer to give you 20%-40% over the market price.. of course they would not pay you anything, just try to scam you.(THIS PEOPLE ONLYH HAVE LIKE 300+ BUY BTC OFFERS IN ALL PAYMENT OPTIONS FOR LIKE 20%-70% over market price.  And of course, no sell BTC offer.When I report these offers, it take admins like ONE week to shut down them?! How is that possible? If I would work at paxful, the offers would never ever been gone up in the first place.Is so strange.And at the same timeThey have like \"meetings\" in africa where they \"teach people economy and other stuff\"....But its only Africans scamming people on their website, and I feel that paxful is on it to, because its impossible that it take ONE weeek to shut down a scam offer. it takes one minute, just open the website and see offers, and they see it straight away..Its so strange, and so sad..a big part of me love to using paxful, but one part just have no idea what they are doing.",

My earning is their earnings. and I dont know they will never re launch it.They are to greedy, and thats so sad.You will not have any earning from October 2022 to February 2023 because of the effective day of this change.

Companies can run their marketing program which is paid from their earning budget and obviously they have rights to stop it any time.They announced it and after that, no program, no party.QuoteYou will not have any earning from October 2022 to February 2023 because of the effective day of this change.

Because after the effective day, that program is no longer applied. So let's count backwards from now to that day, it's about 4 months without that program and you said you want 6 months, that is not true.How to reach customer support service",

I just took it up as one thing as many others thing to, they can disable it. its not that big of a deal. all the scam offers and kenyans is a much bigger problem that they dont seems to give a fuck about, and its most sad about the honest kenyans, that lost so much customer of this shit.",
