It's great for having questions and discuss/debate certain news and topics, but if you're a beginner you're better off reading articles off the web.I have many issues learning off articles, for one, you get a one sided opinion, from the writer. This is different from a discussion, where users can correct and add to already said points. Also, articles are not usually updated, and search engines are more likely to bring out older ones, with more engagements than newer ones, hence, there could be a gap in knowledge.Learning how to use the search option effectively can unlock so many ways beginners can learn from the forum.",

If you haven't already, I suggest you familiarize yourself with the rules of the forum, because it is something that will help you better understand how the forum works, which will be good for you and all the other members of the forum. One of the rules says: \"Posting multiple posts in a row (excluding bumps and reserved posts by the thread starter) is not allowed\". You can read more about all the rules here -> Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQRegarding the forum and the time you want to spend here, my personal opinion is that it is definitely time well spent, especially if you want to study what happened throughout the history of Bitcoin through various discussions of forum members. Although I have officially been on the forum since mid-2015, I often find some interesting information that I did not know about before. Of course, the forum is not the only place where you can find information, but it is certainly a much better place than various social networks ruled by various so-called crypto experts and scammers.",
