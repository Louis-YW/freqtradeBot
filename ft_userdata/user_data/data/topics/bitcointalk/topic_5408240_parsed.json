So I will not give him discredit for it. He will learn.Quote- It is best to display your past experiences in a way that the user can verify.I take this. If a user is offering service then he at-least present it with some efforts. OP haven't put any effort at all. @ahmazoo, I would like to see some past work you did and details about your skills.",
