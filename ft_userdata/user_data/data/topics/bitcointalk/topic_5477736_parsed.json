I was studying Business Administration, my speciality was finances and banking. When I had lectures in math and finances, I was often asking my lecturers what were they thinking about Bitcoin and why they didn't they tell us anything about bitcoin during the lectures and etc. Their answer was that they didn't like Bitcoin and thought that it was a scam, most of them even didn't even know anything about it. I was making my uni projects about Bitcoin, was leaving lecturers captivated and amazed and was getting good marks on my presentations.",

After all, kids can spend money. Expect anything if everything on your assets is not maintained correctly.  Money-minded is a big word if you mean they are more literate in money-related issues? I don't think so. I think what the next generation experiences is to have more tools and apps to play around with little amounts as if it was play money. When someone wanted to invest small amounts a decade ago, I don't know, there wasn't much someone could do except for going to the bank and get one of these garbage saving plans that literally pay you nothing in return or make you lose money due to inflation. But today they have all these apps where they can buy penny stocks or smallest shares of a share in a share, you get the point. But do they make investment decisions based on research? I think it is a lot about this social component and how they can track or follow each other and make investment recommendations and so on and so forth. Investing to me involves research and knowledge and this is where I think your wording \"money-minded\" could be misunderstood.This is why I like it when younger and younger people take the time and invest the effort to become well educated about BTC and then decide to spread their knowledge and the overall message. That's great!",

Whether the people will accept it or not, but bitcoin is here for good and it continually grows and progress with time. So it should be taught at school where foundation of learning begun. And just like fiat, bitcoin will become our daily currency in the future, so children at a young age should be aware of that and should be educated about bitcoin so they can also educate their siblings at home.However, I should say this young boy has definitely a bright future with bitcoin. If he will be guided properly, he might also be a good trader and successful investor in bitcoin in the future, who knows.",

Op it is good to teach your child or children about Bitcoin and remember they will learn other financial services so when you are teaching them, you have to tell the the advantages and the disadvantages and when they have finished high school and about to enter university, you have to ask him or her if they will like to continue with Bitcoin or if they have any other course they are interested to continue and they choose another course over Bitcoin then please don't force them to choose Bitcoin allow them to continue their choice of life. Forcing them to accept Bitcoin might not help them in the future because they monds are not in it. Allow the liberal mindset to prevail.",

That's great guys he has more knowledge if he provides knowledge to his friends, including his background with parents is very thick with bitcoin so he is sure to provide subject matter to his friends.At the age of 9 years it is still very rare for a child to already know bitcoin let alone understand it, even around nothing like this may be different because it depends on how the parents educate it but this is something good where a 9-year-old child has mastered all about bitcoin.Yes we need to prepare as early as possible to our children later to teach about bitcoin slowly.",

I have noticed my daughter always picking interest in what I do and most time she drag my phone with me, to read through Bitcointalk or any research I am in at that moment and I am sure that in the near future she is definitely going to be engage in Bitcoin and the crypto industry finding paths for herself with the foundation I am building to aid her learning process,  so for sure at 9 years just like this kid,  she will also be doing exploit in this industry,  so for the boy he has proven to the parent that he has learned we'll and can teach others perfectly.",

Due to ignorance and lack of computer knowledge most people from 50 years and above have shallow understanding of the cryptocurrencies.  I am predicting that in a few years most of the policy makers in many countries will be supporters of the crypto industry. Seeing a nine year old teach his class mate about Bitcoin also shows that Bitcoin is easy to understand. I hope some of his classmates will pick interest in the currency and become Bitcoiners in future. QuoteI think this is how I will teach my child about Bitcoin.I have a child that I want to raise from an early age to experience Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.Now that he is only 6 years old I think he has enough time to learn.The nine year old boy in your story is exceptional because he was not forced or persuaded by his parents to learn about Bitcoin. But he voluntarily and naturally became interested to learn about Bitcoin that was why he was always asking his parents questions. Such kind of children should be encouraged to keep learning. But there are some children that don't care about learning about Bitcoin, they shouldn't be coerced to learn about it. Children should be given the privilege of enjoying childhood by engaging in what interests them. I also think that six years is too early to introduce your child to Bitcoin.",

If I am in their situation and have dream of becoming a teacher for example then I wouldn't forget to take my chances and risk in crypto while I have my job. As what reputable forum members here said or what they advise people to do is that we shouldn't quit our job just because we earn money with crypto.",
