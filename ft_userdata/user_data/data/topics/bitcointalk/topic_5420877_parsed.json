  "content": "After I tried the Identity Verification multiple times, I got blocked. Now, when I open the verification link, I see the message, \"You are temporarily blocked from ekyc due to multiple verification within short period of time.\" The screenshot: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AmuCqe6gZspyhB2mbcxBr_k2FSkm?e=PJMCks It has been over 24 hours since my last attempt at the Verification. The situation extremely stresses me out.  Please, help.1. What does \"temporarily blocked\" mean? When will the block be lifted? I am concerned the block might be permanent.2. Is there a way to reach MTGOX Claim administration to explain my situation?  I submitted the Inquiry on the FAQ page and got the \"Inquiry Received\" auto response with the not-reassuring disclaimer \"However, please note that the Support Center receives a large number of inquiries recently, and responses or replies to your inquiry may not be timely.\"Any help would be appreciated.  It looks like I will not be able to receive my claim repayment.",

It says \"temporarily\", so it seems that you will be able to try again after some period of time.I suggest that you figure out why you have failed multiple times before trying again.",

There is January 10 deadline to select the Repayment Method. \"Temporary\" might be a stock interface message while the system might have blocked permanently. Usually, interface provides specific time frame.I have ideas why KYC did not work:1. On the first try, I used a temporary Real ID which was printed on paper. The system warned not to use copies and must have recognized my temporary ID as such.2. On the second and third try, I must have failed face recognition - my expired Driver License was issued 6 years ago, expired passport 20 years ago. The fact that both documents were expired could be a problem also.Last night, I received a permanent Real ID which will be used if I ever get past \"You have been blocked\".MTGOX prefers passport which I applied for yesterday and paid extra for expedited processing and Priority shipping.",

I think it redirects you to claims.mtgox.com but this is me on my mobile assuming that. Following the steps and not getting links from strangers is probably good advice. Not sure why anyone would ignore the mtgox situation if they had funds there, but to each their own. Something will definitely happen with this, and likely before next summer.",
