  "content": "This user is advertising a software which I believe is malicious. He claims that It can drain user wallets once an approval is made.Quote from: X-Drainer14 on March 19, 2023, 05:54:36 PMXDrainer - software powered by Docker & Yaml. Which allows you to interact with users' wallets to sign malicious transactions that deprive them of cryptocurrencies and nft. Our software stands out from the rest with the best functionality at the moment, and the best price on the market.This is probably the kind of tool used to scam users.Is reporting this user as a malware poster appropriate?",

It's true that usually they will come again with a new one and try to offer again this type of tool to deceive those who are affected.If I will find something like this maybe I will immediately report it because it is clear this is a scam that he did in the forum.Quote from: PX-Z on March 19, 2023, 10:51:45 PMEdit: Well, after checking modlog, looks like its OP (original poster) is spamming the same wallet drainer in the forum, there are at least 3 the same thread with different user but the username is \"X-DrainerXX\" it just differ the number in the last.But is it possible if there is a thread that has to report it on the Lafu thread? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5182222.0Because I'm sure he will come again with a different offer from the type of wallet that is offered.",
