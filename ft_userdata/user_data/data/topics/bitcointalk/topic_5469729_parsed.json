Why not?[1] https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/3/176",

Having a comfortable workspace with good lighting is essential for maintaining focus. As for the preference between a standing desk or a mix of standing and seating, it seems that both can work, provided you manage your emotions effectively.However, if we're taking out all other factors like sleep, diet, and exercise, I might lean towards a mix of standing and seating. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of increased alertness from standing while also having the option to sit when needed for a more relaxed and composed trading experience. But it's always fascinating to see how different traders find what suits them best. What's your personal preference, and why?",

My bots don't really care if they work at a booth table or not, they are always damn fast in executing the trades   Joking aside ... I had some of my most successful, directly executed trades on the smartphone in the subway, the worst trades in a large trading center with tens of screens. Not directly executed trades run anyway via bots (as certainly at least 90% of all trades), these are simply unbeatable when it comes to the fastest possible decisions. In some markets, a real battle for the best bot with the fastest decision algorithms has broken out. For the general daily business work, I agree with you, here standing desks are unbeatable. Less because of the attention or concentration ability, much more for health reasons ... So I can only warmly recommend the tables to anyone who works several hours a day at the PC. The desks are also not as expensive as they were back then, at $500 upwards you can already get quite usable work desks.",

Standing desks have their perks, offering potential health benefits and increased alertness, which can be crucial for making quick decisions in the volatile crypto market. I did not know if there was anything like that. I mean, I did not even have a slight idea till now that there is a topic for such discussion. Well, if there is really a concern about such a selection of desks, or standing setup of trading, then I don't think we have to be that fast in trading, because we do TA and FA and make trades and set different limits orders to book profits at different prices. And yeah, sometimes, the market does make unexpected things that one has to react and think quickly in order to make a quick profit or lose. But such cases are totally rare, and we can not just stand for such trades, because we don't know for how long we have to stand to make a quick reaction and we might get tired and in the end, we might miss the chance of reacting quickly and lose the opportunity. But to be honest, I really liked the idea of health because standing does make us healthy but standing trading is not what we need instead a healthy lifestyle is what we need.",

There are comforts, calmness and proper tools to this shit.Just how do you use your tools in a standing position?It just doesn’t seem okay to me and it’s not something I’m willing to try either. A more sitting position would have the greater advantage.",

I didn't know this could be a topic and I haven't got your point of making quick decisions by using a standing desk.It depends on the user's desires and requirements. A desk that can change its highest can be a good option. If you think you want to work standing or sitting on a chair you can do that. Sometimes I also feel like it would have been convenient for me if I could change my body position frequently when working in front of my desk. I have seen this kind of desk is available in the Amazon store.",

Being a trader is no different from any jobs that are done sitting on the desk looking at the monitors. But it doesn't guarantee any results. Best crypto traders i know do it with their laptop on the road.But if you really want to tweak your trading conditions, start from the basics. As with better health and better life, you can concentrate better. Using brain power is wears you out. You need to be able to snap out of it and keep other valuable things in your life than just work.Remember to utilize free time well. Exercise, sleep well, eat healthy, practise midfulness or anything that relaxes your mind. Work on your psychological issues and balance your time you have for your work / love / family / friends / alone time. Because health comes from balanced life, mind and body. Not from tricks. You might have as much time for work as you would want, but surely you want to enjoy your life too? It isn't all making as much money as you can if life is otherwise empty.",

Your experiences and opinions matter, so let's hear them!I was stunned to read that there are such topics that need discussion. I mean, analysis and the study of a token need proper time relaxation, and comfort, and when you do that in a standing position, you will definitely get tired, and in the end, you might make some mistakes during the analysis, which would hurt you in the form of lose. We definitely cannot ignore the benefit of standing because it is good for our health. But definitely not for trading.I have a question for the OP, if he tried both ways of trading, like sitting on the chair or standing, then why shift to only one method? Why not use both ways to do trading? Like you did on the floor. You must have seen many traders standing in the trading when they exhausted themselves due to laziness and tiredness from sitting for a long time.And you must have a chair to do the analysis when you are tired of standing out. I hope you are getting my points, dear OP.",

Especially since its located inside their home and they might want to watch a movie and doing that while standing would be uncomfortable. Last time I went to IKEA they had a desk which basically had a height setting and you could adjust the height. So it can be standing and sitting just by moving the lever. These aren't that expensive and its a better solution than getting a standing desk which you might get tired off after a few weeks and then have to buy another desk.",
