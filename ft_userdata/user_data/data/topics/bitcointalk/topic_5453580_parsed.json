Why don't you write your entire domain here and its history? Domain is very important for every business, but it doesn't have to be crucial. However, most often one first has an idea about the business, and only then does one look for an adequate domain.If you would give more details about it, you will probably get some useful tips, and instructions on what the possibilities are and what to do next with it.It is also very important what your interests are, so logically the website or service you start should be oriented towards that topic. Sincerely, I believe that a unique domain is not enough for someone to enter into business with an unknown person. The initial capital in that case cost only a few tens of dollars in the most expensive case and that is not an unaffordable amount for anyone with an idea.",

I hope this is okay posting this message here as I am not trying to spam at all, completely the opposite?Thanks GaryYou have came to the right place my friend. There are many such people on the forum who would like to purchase good domain names. If your domain name is truly good and it serves the purpose well then you will definitely find someone who will purchase it from you. But, in order to reach those users who are interested in purchasing such digital goods you should follow the instructions of decodx and go-to the proper board for finding the interested buyers.In order to get buyers you'll have to create a new post at the appropriate board. In that post you should write complete details about your domain name and also mention the niche of your domain name. There are many people who will find your post and send you offers either on the post or on your inbox. But, to keep things safe you should choose a good member of the forum who would work as an escrow for the deal. That way you'll be safe and you might get good amount for the your domain name.You should also keep in mind if you are really finding someone for collaboration then you must share full details of the domain and the way it could be helpful to generate good revenue for both parties. You can also find good writers in the forum who may write good content for your website within your budget range. Now, it's your choice either to sell the domain, or to find someone for collaboration or to hire good writers who can create good content for your site. Best of luck from my side!",

I wish back then I had bought bitcoin but I didn't, so hoping it might be worth something to someone who has a lot of bitcoins lol!Anyway, feel free to get back to me if you want any more info?BestGary",

I'm not sure if I have the knowledge and mind set to take this domain and social media sites to the next level as I'm coming up to my retirement soon, so I think it needs a young active mind that can develop it in to something truly Worldwide amazing, for me to look back on!Your response was a warming one and I look forward to staying connected here with obviously a nice group of people to date!CheersG",
