I believe in a time when the crypto market is congested, most investors will badly need it. They won't gonna need to research anymore because they know that Paypal is something that they can temporarily trust with their cryptocurrencies just until when the crypto market is back to normal, and when that happens, they can quickly convert it to their desired crypto and move it to their personal hard wallet if they want.",

But in fairness to PayPal, they don't land quickly in building a stable coin without having the adoption first by accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptos on their platform. So, it's like all set that this is together with those adoption but before, they don't allow to withdraw crypto. And everything has started to change when they've been open with the withdrawals and now with this, they've got userbase and for sure that this is going to be used by many of their users.",
