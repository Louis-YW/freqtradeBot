Recently I came across a job listing that required over 9 years working experience to be qualified, looking at the job description, I didn't see any reason why someone with 5 years working experience was not suitable for it since it was not a job that required special skills and the monthly pay for the job was not encouraging. What is your opinion on eligibility for regular jobs that are based on working experience, do you think they are necessary, and what chances does it give to the young job seekers who are looking to gain experience on a job? how can they get experienced if they are already been disqualified for little or no working experience?",

If I owned a company, unless it is a very specialized role I wouldn't mind employing a young graduate with six to 12 months of experience. On the other hand, getting work experience has become easier because of technology. What do I mean? Young graduate can take advantage of remote Internship, volunteering experience, or just working for free in a related organization. Takis these experiences to the best of my knowledge could count as a work experience especially when you have the required skills to get the job done. And that is what companies really are looking for do you have the skills? Can you get the job done? If any Young job seekers those they would hire you and train you on the job.",

      "body": "Some of these years of experience asked are actually just for formality some companies overlook it and when you express yourself well at an interview. Other thing is its easier to get these experiences now if you are eager to work there. Universities gives time to  students to go out and earn experience outside the school and this span between 6 to 12 months. Various companies considered this experience valuable when they employing workers. Various companies also offer internship with pay rate for fresh graduates.Some companies have also taken it upon themselves to train new employees regardless of there experience.So right now experiences are sorted after by companies for bigger roles like managerial positions and yes this should be close to five more years experience for me",

This could be the reason that the work experience requirement is taken to be 9 years. The employer understand that it is a lucrative job in terms of payment and probably other packages and decide to limit prospective employees chances of getting there. They feel the higher work experience the more the better chance to get the best set of candidates. The 9 years experience is already a criteria for the interview of which someone not having such years of experience is naturally screened out. And yes work experience matters in some certain jobs especially in managerial positions because you are expected to have managed other smaller businesses with fewer workers to taste your managerial qualifications and skills. You don't jump into some jobs without working somewhere.",

You have two choices, employ folks with little or no experience and spend a whole lot of money to train those new employees on how the job is done. Or you could employ folks that has on the job experience and spend little or no money to train them? Your pick. Employers generally employ people with work experience so as to cut spending on training the new employees. So you could say work experience is important and it gives the applicant an edge over an unskilled and untrained applicant applying for the same position. In most cases, work experience can’t just be ignored.",

The best thing is to ask in the ad or position description what the minimum experience requirements are so you don't waste your time applying for something that you may not have enough skills for. That being said, employers also need to realize that a lack of experience can be easily offset by other skills an applicant has – like talent, hard work, and a good attitude. If a person is great at what they do and passionate about it, most people will find a way to overlook any experience shortfalls.",

I can tell that because I was once in a hiring position and it was one thing I look at when hiring people for the company and usually, it should be related to the job they are applying for. This is to give room for those who have long experience to work without close supervision and of course, to save from spending time in training. It is one benefit that the company gets from hiring them. Though inexperienced people can still send their applications, however, it was the discretion of the hiring manager to accept them or not. As for me, this is really matters now and every applicant must aware of it especially if you are applying for a skilled and higher position.",

The purpose of the job interview is for them to check if you are qualified for the position, if they think you fit the job that you are applying for they might hire you even without sufficient experience.Imagine if all jobs would require job experience, how can first-time job seekers find a job?",

They would be really lucky if certain companies are given the chance even if they are not experienced.As far as I know, network marketing companies are the ones that doesn’t require experience and has willingness to learn, but the downside is that we need to invest rather than looking for a job.",

When hiring, it goes without saying that people are graded according to their experience. This is quite logical. There are positions where minimal experience is enough, and there is an assumption that a hired employee who has a desire will develop, expand his knowledge and gain new experience, increasing his professional suitability. There are many vacancies where experience may not be needed at all, this also happens and this is normal.But there are vacancies where a lot of experience is required, which cannot be obtained in a short time. For example (IT is close to me), a developer. Can't be a team leader with 6 months experience. More precisely, a person may consider himself such, but he will not be a real specialist. Or developers - a middle programmer, cannot become one, for example, from scratch and after 12 months, he simply physically cannot study, test, and almost hastily use a large list of technologies, frameworks, databases, ..

I think the job you are talking about is an important part of the company that requires sufficient experience in the job if your friend has the experience that does not match the job offered by the company, no matter how long he has experience in the workplace without any consideration the company will reject the friend's application You.Work experience is very important for companies because indeed people who already have experience will know how to work in a company, therefore many companies prefer people who have work experience.I think the case that you find is for key positions in companies like executives, managers, specialized teams and others that require a fair amount of work experience in the job.What about young workers with little experience?I think there are not a few job vacancies that require workers who have no experience, you can have experience there even though the position offered is under the company.If you don't have the opportunity to jump right into a key position in the company, start from the bottom.",
