  "content": "Ozone Chain - Karthik Sakthivel - Scammed the Bounty Hunter's payment.Scammers Profile Link:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3557086Amount Scammed:  $5490 (Bounty pool and My wage for Bounty Management and wearing Ozonechain signature)What happened::  (long history short) The project is ozonechain contacted me to create their ANN thread as well as the other promotions later. After the first impression, the project looked solid. I took the task and started working as a Bounty campaign and signature campaign manager. The first time they wanted to run the bounty for one Month / 4 weeks. Which was a weekly pay bounty campaign with USDT payment. They were also interested in running BTC payment Signature campaign. Everything was going smoothly with the payment (except for a little delay). Later they want to run another bounty for 3 months which will be a monthly payment. I took the task and started to manage the bounty. during the first 4 weeks I notice ozone_chain start to do less response. I always try to contact him through telegram. Meanwhile, I paused the bounty campaign and prepared the final spreadsheet, and sent it for payment. While preparing the spreadsheet he came and told me no worries about the payment.After a few weeks of no response (no seen), I contacted the ozone chain CEO Karthik Sakthivel (Previous CEO - now CTO),Linkedin - https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthik-sakthivel-6114a799Telegram - @Karthik_ozoneThe first time The CEO did not reply to me. Later I talk about scam accusations and told you that bounty hunters will be crazy and spam in the official group. Then he responded and said to me that @Eriscrypto_ozone would contact me. Here are some conversations with Karthik Sakthivel.     And now 22 OCT, None of them are replying to me. That means they are not going to pay the bounty hunters as well as I dues.I tried for a long time to make sure the bounty hunters paid somehow without creating any scam accusations. Because they always promise me that payment could be delayed a little bit but they must pay. But in the end, they are not keeping their promise lately.I am still waiting for them if they come here to respond and pay the hunters.",

If they come back to make things right, great, but don't be surprised if it's just more stalling BS. That hospital line gets tossed around a lot when scammers need to buy time and string people along and  you seem smart enough to recognize their typical tricks.  Hope it all works out in the end, but sounds like you got taken for a ride. Don't let them take advantage of you again.  Stand your ground and remember whats already happened.  Best of luck getting this sorted.",

These hunters and you worked hard to promote their brand and them expecting to receive it free is stupid. Isn't it better to receive the payment upfront so that you don't need to chase them? As a forum member you have a reputation to protect but for them there are no incentives if they do not get desire results.",

I don't blame you OP, the scam accusation was long overdue, and you were so patient with them. In fact, some of these projects should be sending funds to the escrow address in advance. You don't walk up to an advertising company and tell them to advertise your product without even making any advance payment.",

I’m sensing that they are just prolonging the conversation as delaying tactics to dodge their obligations to pay bounty campaigns.A month of inactivity on telegram is already close for the account being deleted for long inactivity. I’m not sure what the guy doing in real world but it doesn’t make sense to become inactive knowing that he has responsibilities to fulfill especially your contract with them regarding their promotion.",
