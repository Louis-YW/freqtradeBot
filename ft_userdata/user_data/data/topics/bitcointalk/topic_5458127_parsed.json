If your actvity doesn't increase after every post you make, that's because your post count is equal or bigger than 14 * number of two-week activity periods in which you have been active and you have to wait until a new two-week actvity period starts and you make a new post in the new period.",

So I wonder what the point is of doing this in order to be accepted into campaigns if you really have something to hide?I didn't catch the purpose of the information shared by OP by do understand the reason for creating this thread, which is obvious that either you make or delete the post after 14 activities will be updated accordingly. if You delete all posts then obviously only 15 activities will be deleted in 15 days. (I do not remember exactly if is it 14 days or 15 days). Well, I do know that the number of days = to a number of activities.Now, as Eternad and IWMHPWB2 mentioned their opinions about why anyone will delete their posts to get accepted into the signature campaign while the managers can check the reality in the edit log and on the delete log (also on ninjas too). And Eternad also mentioned that managers prefer to post or activity to merit ratio. Let me tell you all that.I made more than 600 posts directly in bounty sections because at the start i was a bounty hunter and when I became full member in 2023 I was excited to join the sig campaign but after applying too many times (like 4 to 7) I thought i am not accepted due to my involvement in bounties so I also planned to delete my report posts which. But I thought it would be nice if I ask the manager. So I just sent a message to Royse777 on his/her TG group and he/she advised me to not delete them because the factor that Eternad mentioned is not a universal rule for managers to select applicants. Well, when I was being encouraged by the Manager, I applied again like maybe 2 or 3 times, and got accepted. And work for 1 or 2 weeks then I worked for Hamphuz campaign in Whirlwind which you knew the highest-paying campaign. and then in the sujonali1819 campaign and now I am working in Yomix.The point is, you can never understand the psychology of rules that managers follow to select applicants, but my rule is your prayers work, and content too. So being creative and keep growing is the only key, Not deleting the old post which you find useless.",

Anyone who has an activity of 500, and his posts are 600, now if this user removes 150 posts from his overall posts than his activity will automatically drop to 450 because he has deleted those 50 posts that had gained him activity points in past. The activity system works on two week basis, and is limited to 14 activity points per two weeks, a user who makes  14 posts in those two weeks will gain 14 activity points only, and that's how this forum's activity system works. If the same user deletes those 14 posts after gaining the activity points then those points will be removed as well with removed posts.The user who has 5000 posts and having an activity of 2000 can delete 3000 excess posts, but still there won't be any impact on his activity points, however if he deletes 200 more posts then his activity will be 1800 instead of 2000. Your activity reduced because you have deleted most of your posts, and the posts that remained on your profile were the only ones with activity points. You will have to gain those activity points like a normal user once again, and it will take you a long time. If I'm not wrong then a user can gain 365 activity points per year, and you'll need more than 2 years to gain your activity points back.",
