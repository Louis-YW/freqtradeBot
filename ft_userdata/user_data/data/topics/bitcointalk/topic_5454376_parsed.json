Web3 wallets like Metamawk, Trustwallet Coinbase wallet and many others are connecting to altcoins Web3. There is nothing about Web3 that is related to bitcoin. Web2 are not bad either. I use many of them and they are good. But I wish moderator to have left Web3 gambling site official thread on gambling board too, but bitcoin not being Web3 would be the valid reason it was moved.",

Though the reason your thread is moved to Altcoins is not because admins are against decentralization, it is because the forum is the Bitcoin forum...I don't agree with this personally because web2 casinos are sketchy at best these days, but that's just the rules. Unfortunately it is difficult to achieve the feet of a decentralized web3 game that accepts Bitcoin. If you do achieve that feet though, then you can gain exposure in this board.",

If you want to be under the gambling section properly without having the Moderators move your thread to the Altcoin section, then you have to include Bitcoin in your means of funding, which seems impossible since you are Web 3 projects, unless you want to go beyond that and then make it some kind of Dua something where the Bitcoin network will be integrated into your case. I don't know how, but maybe you can think outside the box, and maybe your developers can be the first to properly develop something that can allow direct connecting of Bitcoin wallets to an online casino site since it seems we don't actually have one that I know of.The things that could actually make you stand out from your competitors are that you offer a better service than they do, have more transparency, be open, and have more quality features that can only be seen on your side of the casino.",

What do you advise to improve our casino to beat unfair web2 casinos. Because their reputation speaks up louder than those new casino offer web3 feature. This one is the important factor why people still gamble on web2 casino since they already prove that they can handle their business so well and they satisfy many gamblers who try their casino service. But if Web3 became more famous for sure those existing casino will also shift to web3 so I guess the only deciding factor for people to shift to other casino is if their existing one will not show any appealing promotion nor rather became active on changes like this.",

I think that such conditions are enough to safely play in an online casino.Exactly, Web3 casino have a license to operate while they are just using a 3rd party provider for their games is audited and license too by gambling regulator. A pure decentralised casino is not in demand that much since centralized casino already move forward on the legality compared before that most casino do exit scam since they have nothing to lose because the owner is a complete anonymous.Centralized casino is operating for so long without a problem or known serious scam accusations that doesn't solved. I doubt decentralized casino can beat that considering the games offered on web3 casino is very plain and simple.",

That’s another reason why Web3 platforms aren’t as popular: they have potential issues with governments due to their nature that’s why people wouldn’t dare risk it. Of course, we are working on having a license. But what is the license for? It is to protect the user from central authorities. Getting licenses for DAOs isn't easy because contracts own the system. For example, AAVE is like a bank, but it does not have a bank license. There is a lot of uncertainty about DAOs. Hopefully, we'll be the first to figure this out. Here users have to trust the contracts. For the security of the codes, of course, it is necessary to have audits with highly reputable security companies. All of this has already been done. We are negotiating with various license providers on the other issue and we will definitely reach a conclusion. Currently, games can be played with WBTC on the platform. It is not possible to integrate Bitcoin in a decentralized way. If we get into the deposit-and-play thing like everyone else, then we'll compromise on decentralization.",
