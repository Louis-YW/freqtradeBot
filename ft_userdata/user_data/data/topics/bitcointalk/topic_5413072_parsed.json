Well, this is very exciting because we don't actually know what will happen aside from the merge that tend to solve the energy consumption of mining, with this we might see ETH start to pump even before this update, many are already anticipating a positive result for this update.",

It rather empowers a few powerful ones ..i dont know if there will be higher chances of market manipulation with POS. I just hope that won't happen.That doesn't make any sense to me. Same argument about \"empowering few powerful\" or taking away decentralization applies to PoW too and even more accurately. In PoW Only rich few who have actually farms would profit while in PoS holders hold the power, not the miners who can literally dump the market when covering their mining cost. Miners in PoW don't need to care about crypto or holders, they literally sell it for Fiat money, while in PoS ETH holders are being rewarded for hodling/staking.",

They just start to introduced this feeling lucky stuff as part of there marketing strategy few years ago for all the events that celebrated globally. Maybe the upcoming Bitcoin halving will sure get this kind of exposure from google.AFAIK, Google has strict restriction that time for Bitcoin by the time halving occurred and maybe the reason for not giving this kind of importance.",

I remember in 2018 google and big companies like facebook banned every single advertisement related to crypto because of the risks that crypto poses. And now we are at another important milestone, traditional companies not only openly support cryptocurrencies but nowadays, they are also investing in cryptocurrencies in large quantities. If I remember correctly, google leads in the race for blockchain startups with the amount of up to 1.56 billion USD.I'm sure the bitcoin halving event will get more attention, they definitely won't be able to ignore it.",
