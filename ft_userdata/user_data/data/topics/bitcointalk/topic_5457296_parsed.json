  "content": "Privacy is freedom from interruption and intrusion.Everyone has right to respect for his life and correspondence.When you hear the word privacy,you might think of the desire to be alone.Privacy goes beyond your personal space,however,it applies more broadly to your life as a whole,it is what lets you establish boundaries to protect your information and your life from unwanted interference.  Privacy is a qualified,fundamental human right;the right to privacy is articulated in all of the major international and regional human rights instrument,like article 12 of the universal declaration of human right (UDHR).The rise of the internet today has a tremendous effect on privacy laws and many believe that the law has fallen behind.Keeping your data safe from prying eyes matters regardless of how you feel.Here's some of the reasons privacy matters;Privacy right maintains your personal spacePrivacy protects you from financial losses Privacy gives you the freedom of speech and thoughtsPrivacy protects your reputation,no one has the right to look into or judge your personal life.No matter who you are,where you are,what you do,your reputation should be protected and there are always people who what to tarnish it.In same vain,privacy prevents  the government from spying on people too.The government has a responsibility to protect it's citizens,but it often crosses the line when it comes to surveillance.In 2013,Edward snowden,disclosed some information on the NSA's spying project.He highlighted the issue of privacy invasion.He talked about the plans the government has which will eventually destroy privacy rights,Internet freedom and basic liberties. Privacy today faces growing threats from a growing surveillance apparatus that exists in the name of security.For instance,government argue sometimes that it is necessary to invade the privacy right of a citizen in order to prevent a much greater crime.  Citizens security and safety has been compromised and fully disrespected so let us all stand together empowered by the knowledge that a private life encounters fewer threats,and protecting our privacy leads to a more secured life,",

Their mindset is that: if they do nothing illegal, then they should not be afraid of surveillance. I personally do not share that way of thinking, because law can change and freedom can be stripped away while we still accept surveillance as some normal element of the modern world.At first, the data collection by the companies was about profiting off the targeted advertisement, but I am afraid it has become something more sinister which leans onto the Chinese model of authoritarianism.",

But not all government is the same, there are many other countries in the world where privacy is largely respected although maybe not so many countries. In a government with a leader that largely respects human rights, there will be respect for privacy which is part of human rights. In government where the leader of that government has little or no regards for rights of common citizens, privacy will be greatly encroached.",

A lot of people don't understand that privacy is a right and not a privilege the government gives. The government doesn't openly say it that they don't care about the privacy of its citizens, but it's clear by the way they operate. Companies that want to be in good graces with the government won't even hesitate to give your information to the government, even without a court order, warrant or something.",

Google is listening to all over conversation, our microphone are on without our consent. I had doubts of this claims until I experienced it myself. We no longer have our privacy, the apps on our phone exchange data between each other and all our private information are already known by this apps on our devices which means the government have access to knowing all our secret. Privacy is a human right yet the government doesn't want us keeping secrets from them that's why they monitor all we do with all the electronical device in our house. If they get confronted, they'll say it's for security reasons yet we have security threats and they don't get prevented. We have lost our right to privacy, and it'll be difficult to gained it back because they government loves the control having access to our privacy gives to them. We can't stop using the apps and mobile devices because they make our lifes easy. It feels like we have exchange our privacy for modern living.",

But the governments don't like this and the surveillance is becoming more and more intrusive with each passing day. This don't just include oppressive regimes like China but also democracies like India.Funnily enough, I remember a news from last year when Indian government (one of the largest democracies) ruled that VPN companies have to collect and maintain all kinds of personally identifiable data about their users! Most reputed companies either stopped catering to Indian users or switched to virtual Indian servers located outside Indian jurisdiction.QuoteUnder the new directions, Mint reported that VPN providers are required to store validated customer names, their physical addresses, email ids, phone numbers, and the reason they are using the service, along with the dates they use it and their “ownership pattern”. In addition to that, the government is also asking VPN providers to keep a record of users’ IP addresses and their email used to register the service, along with the timestamp of registration. Further, VPN providers are also required to maintain a list of all IP addresses issued to a customer and the IP addresses that their customers generally use.",

If there is a protest in my country about the evil act of the government,they will use the opportunity to arrest innocent citizens,if an information is given to them that that person knows the people that started the protest. If someone is mob on the street,police will start harassing the innocent passersby and not giving them the right to express themselves.

In today's world we see individuals who are not terrorist being extracted from a country by agencies from a different country, then one will be tempted to ask how they got to find such person in whatever local hideout he's taking refuge. The answer is self explanatory as we all know, at this point we will agree that such person's privacy has been violated. Let's take for instance a case was recorded just recently here in my country when some uniform men barged into  a lady while naked all in the name of an arrest which has no warranty at the same time assaulted her and her kid brother   by torturing then with their guns ,zoomed of with them at a very ungodly hour only to push them out of a moving vehicle at different locations after extorting money from their account through their phones .So with such scenario  shall we say that our privacy is being respected.",
