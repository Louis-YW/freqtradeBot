      "body": "When we phrase it like that, it seems as though Nigerians have done something wrong. However, the banned IP affects not only Nigerians but also people from other countries. If you try to make a new account using an IP address with a history of negative activities, you won't be able to create the account.There's a quote from theymos, about the evil point stats Quote from: theymos on July 27, 2014, 04:08:57 AMWhen you register, the IP that you used when you submitted the registration form is used to calculate your evilness. The more frequently this IP or its neighbors were banned, the more evil is associated with your account. The amount of evil associated with an IP decays slowly over time, but the amount of evil associated with an account does not. You must pay or be manually whitelisted to enable posting on one of these \"banned\" accounts.Here are some stats:Evil% new users0530-1351-104.410-200.8020-502.250-1001.3100+2.9Currently each unit of evil requires a payment of 4023 satoshi. You only need to pay something if you have 1 or more, though.  But You have another option to register on Bitcointalk without paying the \"evil fee\" and that's by using a secured  VPN. This is not considered an offense on Bitcointalk. Moreover, using a VPN is not only useful on Bitcointalk sometimes, other social media platforms require using a VPN to establish a secure connection.",

Yes the people that has given this country bad name have also succeeded in tarnishing our image to the international community because when you want to do business with a foreigner and he knows that you're a Nigerian, he will be very careful with you because they see us as criminals as a result of previous experience they've had with a citizen of Nigeria. The worst part of it is that despite the fact that these people know the wrong narrative they've created for the country yet they still continue in doing things that will still jeopardize the reputation of our dear country and it has made some of us that are good and genuine to look as if we all are bad eggs.",
