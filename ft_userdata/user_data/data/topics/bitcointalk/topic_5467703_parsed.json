  "content": "I just want to share this story because it might help someone here understand the importance of using two-factor authentication (2FA)Two years ago, I lost my phone, and the thieves managed to hack into my phone and take control of my Facebook account. Unfortunately, I couldn't recover my account because I hadn't linked it to my Gmail, and I didn't have 2FA set up . This incident prompted me to activate 2FA for all my social media accounts including WhatsAppsRecently, I discovered that my child's WhatsApp group page had been hacked. The hacker was calling parents and attempting to compromise their accounts. I wasn't  aware of it until the day before yesterday, I received a whatsapp call from a number that displayed the school Display picture (dp) and a caller claiming to be an admin from the school. He said that parents would have a Zoom meeting the next day and would receive a link or number that would be sent to me now which he wanted me to call for him.I didn't think twice and called the number, assuming it was legitimate. However, as soon as I did, they gained access to my WhatsApp but were met with the 2FA  I had set up earlier. The hacker then asked me for a set of six numbers to use for the Zoom meeting. Omo! It was at that moment my head come click say they were trying to hack my account. I confronted them, asking if they were attempting to hack my account, and they immediately hung up.I quickly logged back into my WhatsApp on my phone, entered the 2FA code, and regained my account backThe purpose of this post is to emphasize the importance of using two-factor authentication. Whenever someone tries to compromise or hack your account, they'll need that code, and without it, they can't gain access. How you can activate 2FA for WhatsApp:1: Go to settings on your WhatsApp page,2: In the setting menu, click on account3: Tap on 2-step verification and enable the step-up. You will be asked to use a 6-digit PIN or even email, Confirm it and you have set up your 2FA.Now, whenever you or someone else tries to set up WhatsApp on a new device with your phone number, they will need to enter this PIN to verify the identity.Do the same for your other social media accounts today and save yourself from hackers.",

Also, I have seen some Bitcoin wallets that have a two factor authenticator and the ELECTRUM WALLET is one of the best because it has a remote sever, and these are the guide on how to use the  two factors authorization.",

For high security, use authenticator app or security key (hardware authenticator). One GmailClick on the menu -> settings -> click on your gmail account that you want to activate two-step verification -> manage your google account -> security -> 2-step verification. For high security, go for 2FA app. On Telegram:Click on settings -> privacy and security -> two-step verification. Only text message authentication is available. These are the ones that I am using. Social media and other accounts for personal use has two-step verification which can be activated under settings -> privacy and security, or security.If you care about your account and others like your friends and family, you need to be protecting your social media accounts.On FacebookClick on the menu -> security -> password and security -> use two-factor authentication. Authentication app for high security.It is worth knowing that if you lose access to your authenticator app secret code backup, you will lose access to you account.",

I followed the instructions and the steps to set up the 2fa for the accounts that have not been set for the 2fa. This is a very good thread for security matter. 2FA is really good to set because the scammers these days are very smart to scam their victims of there are Ignorant. I was about to scam last year when I was trying to buy paga machine but I thank God for the 2fa code which restricted them from entering to the account. Op thanks for bringing this to the forum for remembrance.",

Whenever someone tries to compromise or hack your account, they'll need that code, and without it, they can't gain access. Nice story and write up and I was surprised to hear that a WhatsApp group was hacked like how or probably they hack the admins phone and gain access to numbers in the group. Some things I understand from this story is that even after all the warnings of not giving  sensitive code you receive on your phone to anybody that calls you and asked for it especially those you haven't been in contact with, I'm surprised people still fall for this trick. You get luck say you realize yourself on time. Me I dun put that 2FA since for my WhatsApp and it's best everyone does it because Whatsapp hacking are becoming very common dis days because hackers dun dey realize say na Whatsapp many businesses are been dun dis day and that's the easiest way to get contact of potential victims to defraud. QuoteDo the same for your other social media accounts today and save yourself from hackers.To add to this, I'll just give out a friendly advice to make the security of all our device very strong. Some platforms has the security features of not been able to login from a device or IP that hasn't access the platform with that your account, enable them to make your account strong and this advice isn't just for social media but for every platform that you use and it's important that you exchanges, wallet etc make sure you have an addition security that isn't just your password that'll be needed whenever you want to login, make a transaction or trade. Your bank apps, trading apps etc should all be extremely secured because scammers and hackers are everywhere looking for the next victim to defraud, no go talk say na lack of information cause am because now we dun dey pass the information to be alert and keep your accounts secured.",
