An Oracle is a middleware which allows data from outside be used in the blockchain. Usually,  those oracles have validators  (similart to bitcoin nodes) which validate external data.",

In most cases, it just extracts data from the real world without conducting any fact-checking and then sends this directly into the blockchain. If data turns out to be incorrect or malicious, well, it is a terrible situation for people who rely on smart contracts to benefit from particular outcomes. How do you mitigate the risk of fake information? You employ several oracles from different vendors, written in different programming languages and using different algorithms for extracting information. If 9 out of 10 oracles tell you that something should be true, then it must be true, and you just ignore the 10th one.",

Some smart contract attempt to mitigate that by choosing some oracle which meet some condition (e.g. only masternode or anyone who stake at least X coin) and optionally punish oracle who give different data compared with all other oracles.And since this question asked on Bitcoin board, FYI Bitcoin doesn't have smart contract capability.",

This information can then be used by a smart contract to trigger a specific action, such as automatically paying out winnings to people who bet on the winning team.",

Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that oracles are trustworthy and reliable and your data is verifiable and auditable.If you are still curious or willing to learn, some of the links are not working anymore so im just gonna drop that is working.https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-oracles/",
