If I already planned to travel to any part of the world to go and spend time and have some fun, then it will be very smart of me to gather funds that will be enough for me based on their accepted payment method. Every government is just looking and acting in line with what they think is best for their citizens and their economy at large. If they say no Bitcoin payment, then tourists should respect their decisions because, in a country like that with strict rules, if you are found breaking any of them, I think the punishment might not be nice at all. Although the Bitcoin payment method is not acceptable, opportunities for breaking those rules will barely present themselves.",

If I intend to use Bitcoin, then I will never visit Bali because the consequences will be harsh. Every tourist should abide by the laws of the land of the country, so if the government prohibits the use of Bitcoin and other coins as a means of payment, there is no need to violate the law. After all, many tourist destinations are crypto-friendly. Instead of facing deportation, arrest, or even imprisonment, it will be better to avoid such a country. But the government of Indonesia will regret its actions because it will not attract crypto-friendly tourists. At a time when nations are opening up their territories to crypto, the Island of Bali is shutting an opportunity for more revenue.",

This is a common occurrence in all countries and in all countries, the only legal means of payment is the local currency (with some exceptions, like El Salvador, where bitcoin is legal). I think that around the world it will gradually happen in much the same way: as soon as the payment in BTC in the country increases, the authorities will react to it. Some countries will prohibit, others will allow to pay using btc. The status of neutral will be kept until a certain point, and then governments will have to choose.It seems to me that this event is not a reason not to travel to Bali. As I understand it, owning bitcoin is not yet prohibited there, which means that you can exchange it for the Indonesian rupiah and pay with it.In this news, I see a positive moment, and it is this: the amount of btc payment has reached such proportions that the authorities were forced to do something about it. This is a good indication that bitcoin is still being used as a means of payment in some places. Until a certain point.",
