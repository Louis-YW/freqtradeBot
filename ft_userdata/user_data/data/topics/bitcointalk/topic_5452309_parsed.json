I doubt a casino needs strict deposit time windows since they don't function like a marketplace unless they automatically convert your coins to fiat.

You sent your bitcoins to your account at ggpoker platform (not network).Quoteit was confirmed today but they informed me that the transaction failed for them and they said that my bitcoins would go back to my wallet , and here I am waiting without knowing how it works , please ask someone for help ... follow my transactionAsk them how a confirmed transaction on Bitcoin blockchain can be called as \"failed\" and how that coin can go back to your wallet after having confirmation?Quote39d5e769506b0f2b3973d60b4ae9d65dea4463b89a481c5d7313c688ddb4a813Don't trust them. Verify with blockchain explorer: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/39d5e769506b0f2b3973d60b4ae9d65dea4463b89a481c5d7313c688ddb4a813That transaction has 34 confirmations and is irreversible.With 34 confirmations, that transaction has become very deep on the blockchain, impossible to revert by any attacker.If they continue to claim that your coin was sent back to your wallet by the blockchain, they are liar and try to scam you.",

BTC transactions are irreversible and immutable; so you should be suspicious of that Poker site as they claim that your transaction would be reversed back into your BTC wallet, if they ask you to make another deposit, do not do so until this issue is resolved. You said you play Poker, but is this your first time playing on this site, and have you made any deposit into your account previously, maybe not with BTC but another deposit option?",

Blockchain.com first saw the transaction on May 6. That's likely the date OP broadcasted the transaction.",
