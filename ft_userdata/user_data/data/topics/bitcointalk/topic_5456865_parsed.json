It's also curious that most of them time when people are asked with this question, no one asks back what is Bitcoin or what's the price of bitcoin or how can they exchange it, that's why I don't believe in the authenticity of these videos.",

You canâ€™t expect these Nigerians to choose bitcoin too since they most likely donâ€™t know about bitcoin in the first place, or the value that it possesses. It could also be that they are in dire need of money and would rather choose the quick cash over compounding value since they need it right now and not for the next bull run. See thereâ€™s so many things at play here and we fling ignorance at them not knowing what stuff they are personally going through that pushed them to choose that over bitcoin. Perhaps a little openness and perspective could help you with that? Itâ€™s funny cause we know how valuable bitcoin is but if the situations were changed, and youâ€™re someone who doesnâ€™t know bout bitcoin asked on-the-spot if you would choose your local currency over bitcoin, what would you do?",

When you live in a densely populated city, it's not hard to find a few people willing to be interviewed and then cherry-pick the funniest (or most stupid) answers. And it's probably cheaper too, as with staged videos, the \"actors\" would likely want to have their cut.As for Bitcoin's recognition, there are loads of people who are familiar with its name, but don't know pretty much anything else and are clueless about its value.",

Seems like they are just trying to troll which most of the people choose it's the bitcoin over the cash but for me, ill go with the higher value and have an option to buy Bitcoin.",

The citizens of the nations are seeking ways of avoiding inflation and the decline in the value of local currencies. Many people have been introduced to Bitcoin to help them fight this inflation and devaluation of the currency of their nation which will make their savings worthless in the future. I know Nigeria has one of the biggest bitcoin markets in Africa because many Nigerians especially the youths are embracing it. But bitcoin awareness is low among those between the ages of 50 and above. Many of them might have heard the word Bitcoin but I can attest that they know little or nothing about the currency. In the rural areas, many people have not even heard the word Bitcoin. As many members have said, most of the content on these social media space is staged to achieve an objective. But no doubt bitcoin awareness is increasing every day even among the elderly.",

They are from Nigeria and they know their currency very well and that's why they are choosing their own fiat currency over Bitcoin. I must say that their English is totally un-understandable, and most of the words just flow over my head. However, the guy was asking about Blockchain and people were saying something really strange because I think they considered blocks + chains and came with conclusion as blockchain which makes sense.After watching the video I found nothing special, but someone who was pranking with innocent people who weren't even aware about Bitcoin. It's understandable that the technology of Bitcoin is not as old or mature as of fiat based currencies and that's why most people don't know how to use it. In many small cities people are so weak in technology that they can't sell anything online because they don't know how to do bank-transfer or receive bank-transfer from the banks own application. Although, the banks are nowadays giving complete control to a user to transfer and receive the funds using their own applications but still users aren't that knowledgeable to take benefits from such services. So, it's not fair to prank with those people who aren't aware about a technology, the better way is to teach them about the technology they are lacking, and promote awareness about it so that they may get interest to learn about it. Teach them what's Bitcoin and how the blockchain and Bitcoin works, that would be a great thing for humanity rather than creating prank videos that show people's lack of knowledge regarding Bitcoin.",
