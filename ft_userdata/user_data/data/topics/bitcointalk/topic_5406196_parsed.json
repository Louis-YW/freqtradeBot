  "content": "I am learning lightning network and I encountered an issue.Purpose: We need to prove someone owns a certain amount of BTCs.When the BTCs are in Bitcoin's original network (layer 1). If a person claims he owns 1BTC, we can simply have the person digitally sign a message for the related addresses (to prove ownership) and then we can check through a bitcoin node (using an indexer) to find the BTC balance as of a specific block height. The problem is that with the proliferation of the lightning network (or other off-chain state channels), we now are unable to simply “go to the blockchain” to find the balances at a specific block height. Given this person could have his lightning channels available stored on his own node, and this person is not objective (and could be lying). Is there a way to compile lightning channel balances from an objective source? What would be the best way to prove this person owns the BTCs while these BTCs are being used in the lightning network?",

You'd either have to close the channel, sign an old address that funded the channel or sign the new one that is used in part of the channel.For standard wallets, you might also be able to test inbound capacity but it's not possible to know if someone's using a \"standard\" wallet.Also, you could just get them to send a payment to prove ownership (even with a code in the amount of coins they send).",

Then, I can request the node owner to provide all the \"commitment transactions\" so far and since these transactions use HTLC, these transactions are pretty much \"linked\" via secrets and hashes. Hence, when we need to proof ownership/balances in a channel at a specific time, I can request the node owner to create a new \"commitment transaction\" and use the previous \"commitment transactions\" to proof it is not just a random or a fake \"commitment transaction\".Do you guys think this is feasible?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I just found a channel tool (https://github.com/guggero/chantools). This might be helpful.This tool provides helper functions that can be used to rescue funds locked in lnd channels in case lnd itself cannot run properly anymore. It has a command called dumpchannels (dump all channel information from an lnd channel database).",

So, if Alice and Bob are in the same channel, it is possible to prove that you have at least N coins, if the channel can function only in one direction. And that's another reason, why two channels working in one direction are sometimes better than a single bidirectional channel. But of course, the cost is rebalancing the channel more often, because bidirectional channels can be left open for weeks, months or even years, while unidirectional channels are, well, unidirectional, so after filling them once in some direction, they have to be closed on-chain, to make them useful again (channel refresh can be done in a single transaction, because it is technically possible to close and open channels in one shot).",
