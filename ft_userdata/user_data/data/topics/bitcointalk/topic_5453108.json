You misunderstood the meaning of \"free from censorship\", that means when you make an onchain transaction, nothing will prevent or block the transfer of bitcoins, it will still arrive at the destination address.",

      "body": "yes, rat03gopoh is right. Having control of your private keys generally provides you with more autonomy and censorship resistance, but it doesn't mean that you are immune from legal actions or consequences. Law enforcement agencies can trace crypto transactions on the blockchain and figure out who's involved. If they find evidence that those funds were used for illegal stuff, they can take legal action to seize and confiscate them. They might go after centralized exchanges or other custodians holding the assets and get a court order to freeze or take control of the funds. In some cases, when law enforcement agencies conduct investigations, they may seize physical devices and media records, both offline and online, that could potentially contain wallets and preivate keys. One example is the ChipMixer case, where the police confiscated bitcoins because the private keys were likely stored on servers in an unencrypted form.",
