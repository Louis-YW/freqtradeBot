Dis company na come out con show say Dem build Dem own mining container wey fit carry 500-kilowatt Bitcoin mining site and run about 150 Asic (application specific integrated circuit) units. Even though say e no big, Dem still try small to at least put effort to take start. Small small dem go fit expand them mining. Dem oga CEO, Yassar Siyanbola also talk say Dem go put Dem best effort to become d no one leading Bitcoin mining farm for we country, and we all wish Dem a good luck for dat one.We know say one of d problems wey mining get na e be high electricity cost.

      "body": "No be bad thing Sha. But wetting I dey ask be say how Nigeria youth go fit benefits from am? I no employment opportunity go dey for Nigeria people but I for also dey happy say federal government go chuck eye for construct this plant to make money to carry settle or tacle some of our problems expecialy the Loan we owe some contry. E for just become another financial production sector just like we dey produce oil and gas plus agriculture.Sometimes e dey pain me say some financial infastructue wey we sopos get for we contry 9ja, na another country dey come Nigeria come dey do am, dem go only employ few Nigerian dey tactically enslaved them. If you go abia state na so you go see one iron company wey dey dere. Na China get am and I no say most of ona don go there (Ina galazy). the way Dem dey treat people no good Even for Benin I hear say one company dey there too wey my fellow 9ja people dey suffer to get endsmit but no way. So all wetting I dey try talk be say our government no wetting them sopos do but them go just dey look, while there contry is being developed by other country. And that go make Dem reduce in production and our youth go dey turn to slave for our country. Those politicians go only collect there own shear of the money wey be land agreement. And any other thing no concern them again even the welfare of the citizens no be there concerne. Another one too na dangote refinery wey dey Lagos. I no say no be China get am but if don work for there you go pity Nigerian because Dem give power to Indian and China over Nigerian and if them do you anything the matter no dey go anywhere. So that thing come make me come they reason say na like this we go dey dey for our country 9ja? So make government just look into all this things.",

This na welcome development because hydro-power na renewable energy which I believe will not attract sections or condemnation by the clean energy policy specialist that are doing everything to put Nigeria at the front of climate change champion. This one also show say Nigeria done dey expand Wella for Bitcoin pass wetin people think. Nigeria na country wey dey front for Bitcoin and plenty people dey run am low key, no be today I don't know this one. E even get some big hodlers wey say them start Bitcoin matter as far as 2011 and na this people we dey call early adopters. This success of companies like this one go make more people go into Bitcoin. My mind dey tell me say them go succeed.",
