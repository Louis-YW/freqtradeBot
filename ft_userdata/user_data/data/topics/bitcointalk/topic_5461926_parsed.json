  "content": "In light of the current occurrence, it is noteworthy that six African nations, namely Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali, Sudan, and Niger, have come under the governance of military dictators.Which country is next? Only God knows, but the resurgence of the coup could have been because of corruption, I guess, but the junta of Niger cited rising insecurity and a poor economic situation.But there are deeper reasons for this; remember, Russia and the West are still at odds with each other.And the fact that hundreds of youths in the capital, Niamey, gathered to celebrate the July coup, waving Russian flags and chanting ‘Wagner, also signifies something.Russia is not only against democracy but also a dictatorship-ruled country, so a military coup may be in their favour.In the midst of this rising Military coup, I cannot just stop questioning: why the military regime?What could have caused the rising military coup in West Africa?Why are there still insurgents in countries where foreign military bases lie?Can a foreign military base foster a military coup?Despite the saying that \"worst democracy is better than the best military dictatorship,\" why do West African countries fall victim to coups?As a Nigerian, I hope this coup will not affect our security, economic stability, or political stability.",

Supposedly the militants in Niger have dissolved the constitution after they ceased power from the President, so it's a fascist nation as of now. Who benefits from that? Certainly the west has some level of interest in the region and this coup isn't good for business.Quote from: Jchris50 on August 03, 2023, 09:24:26 AMDespite the saying that \"worst democracy is better than the best military dictatorship,\" why do West African countries fall victim to coups?Centuries of failed and corrupt government.

Arms are everywhere in the region and of course they come in from outside Africa and whoever the pay masters are is left for 55 member countries of Africa Union to unravel and the purpose known. Corruption allegations levelled against those oasted democratic government should not be issue because the military is not free from corruption themselves.",

Since the beginning foreigners tried to take over Africa, change their traditions and exploit resources for their own selfish purposes. Even today, as independent states, Africa continues to be culturally and politically dominated by powers beyond their frontiers. It is inherited weakness from the colonial era, in my opinion. It can be USA or Russia, it does not matter as long their own interest are at stake.",

They want to rule till they did in the seat. Their behaviour is weaking the Democratic hope of Africa states.It's because of the fail democracy in Africa that some military junta are emerging today.

There is no difference between civilian and military rule in Africa. That is why Africans will always celebrate a coup because it is just a normal change of government. QuoteIn the midst of this rising Military coup, I cannot just stop questioning: why the military regime?The main reason for military coups in Africa is corruption, electoral malpractice, and poor economy. The military will justify their intervention with corruption. They will claim that they have come to rescue the nation from bribery and corruption. When these politicians manipulate electoral results to get political power, it gives the military the right to topple the illegitimate government. If the economy of a nation is sound and people are living well, the military will not use the economy as an excuse for coups. QuoteAs a Nigerian, I hope this coup will not affect our security, economic stability, or political stability.The coup in some African countries can be a motivation for the military to strike in other nations. ECOWAS is threatening to use the military to force the military government of Niger to return power to the elected politicians. A war in Niger will destabilize Nigeria politically, economically, and militarily. The best option to settle this crisis is dialogue and diplomacy. If ECOWAS is cajoled by some powerful nations to start a war in Niger, it will be the beginning of a proxy war between superpowers. Africans shouldn't forget that they have nowhere to run to because no nation in the West or East will be willing to accept them as refugees.",

In fact it is already affecting the states that share borders to Niger because of the closure of boarders. Closer of boarders means no bilateral trades and both neighbors in Niger and Nigerian states will have the first impact. It will affect our security and everything if Bola tinubu allows himself to be used by the Euro or Americans to instigate ECOWAS to use military on Niger. If he doesn't read the hand writing on the war and goes on to do that despite the challenges of illegitimacy of his government that is still challenged in court, those West Africa countries that have pledged support for Niger like Burkina Faso, Mali etc will come in from different Nigerian states and that will mean disaster for Nigeria because the Nigerian military is already stretched in fighting of boko haram and other insurgence in the country. So he should better play cool.The African politicians are the cause of insecurity and coup that they witness because they are selfish, corrupt and will not allow democratic tenets to grow, no rule of law, they don't obey court judgement. In fact no difference with West Africa democracy and military rule.",

      "body": "Six of the approximately seventeen countries in West Africa have been taken over by the military. This merely denotes that West African nations are gradually reverting to the military rule of law they previously had before becoming democratic nations. If we were to investigate what led to the military coup in the six nations you named, we would all discover that it was poor governance and corruption on the part of African civilian leaders who made it necessary for their citizens to endure hell in order to survive in their respective countries. As a result of the difficulties, this now leads to a military coup. A military coup similar to this one should be anticipated in other of the remaining twelve West African nations that have not changed how they govern their citizens. Because of the hardship and corruption that have long pervaded the nation, Nigeria may be the next place where a military coup takes place. This military takeover in six West African nations is a bad one since it means that there will never be freedom of speech and the application of the law in those nations again. Now, without using a dual procedure, the military will make decisions and manage national affairs without questions from the masses",

There are people who say that a bad democracy will be always better than a \"good\" regime. But that kind of mindset is not to be expected when people who feel oppressed and victimized during years of allegedly a good democratic government.I personally fear that this uprising against democracies in Africa could continue in coming years and it could be translated to an increase of the influence regimes like those in Russia, China and even in the middle east could have there. Let us not fool ourselves, Those countries are very interested in expanding the range of their influence (specially the sanctioned Russia), and they would not think too much on the idea of overthrowing small Republics in order to achieve their agende in the long run.",

We saw citizens of Niger waving the Russian flag because they assume that Russia will be a better partner. Nigerians now believe that France has been exploiting them since independence. I wouldn't know what the Russian government has promised these coupists for them to immediately align with them. Maybe they have been promised that instead of exploiting and exporting raw materials industries will be built in Niger thereby improving the economy of the nation. It might also be that Russia has promised to be proactive in the fight to get rid of Islamic jihadists and terrorist groups waging war against Niger. I also heard the Russian leader promising to forgive the debt of some African countries and support them to get non-permanent seats in the United Nations. But before African leaders fall for these enticing promises they should do a check on other African nations that are under the influence of Russia. It will be good to ascertain if Russia's influence has benefited the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, and Mozambique.",

I think more of this will hit other African countries too because the domination of the France government in some African countries where they are sending there raw materials to France and there citizens have nothing to write home about. The politicians also are one of the major problem of the reason why the force are taking over the government regime called democracy because the people are tired of what they are giving out and they are not receiving.
