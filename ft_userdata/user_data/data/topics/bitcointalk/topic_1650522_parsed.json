So bitcoins are screened and documented. Really awesome. Why dont we keep publishing more series or films on bitcoins so that more and more come to know about it. Media is the one made everyone and everthing popular. This is the main source to reach something to people of every corner at the same time. I am sure all bitcoin lovers who have money to invest can afford to create a new era for bitcoins via these medias. Wish this can happen.",

A team is formed from our community (bitcoin community), contributes money, creates a documentaries and brings them to the screens? We have a thread created by a dude stating, what if bitcoin stores are established in big cities? The goal behind it is to spread BTC worldwide. I am sure screening a documentary would bring more into bitcoin community and so on.",

Want to know. So bitcoin was popular in earlier days as well. Though many come and go, the value is kept high always. Would love to watch more films and series on bitcoins. Will there by any chance for more films on it? We have many skilled on medias. This could be a key to spread BTC.",

I haven't heard about these movies before. Maybe because cryptocurrency was not yet popular that time compared today. In addition, I didn't know yet about bitcoin last 2014, so I may not be interested with the movie too. Since I'm into it now, I'm thinking of watching those in the list because just out of curiosity, I would like to know if they are good movies about bitcoin.",
