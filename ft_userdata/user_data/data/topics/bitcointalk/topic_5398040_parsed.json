I know that NAS guy and he has interviewed a couple of billionaires, some wealthy people who made the impossible become possible, some billionaires who were born and raise in trenches but now living large with huge steps in investments.CZ was able to create a platform to unite people, collect their Identifications and Documents, and collect withdrawal fees. Today, he is among the crypto richest but since you and I don't want to get involved in centralization, buy and hold your Bitcoin on your wallet like satoshi advice.Don't be like CZ.",

Now he's stopped playing poker, because it's a dumb idea to gamble (LOL) and 9 years now, he's working to make the world a better place. Happily ever after. Seriously now, I don't know about you, but I'm honestly annoyed from the fact that this, along with the following is the cryptocurrency content the media's showing nowadays:  In contrast with 8 years ago:",

If Binance wants to get more people in the platform, he'd pay to get that exposure. You see in the end of the video they bump fist saying \"we're done.\" If the story is true then he didn't start being a poor man really, he just discover and fascinated by Bitcoin and then started a team to develop his exchange. Good timing I guess because it was also the time of ICOs.",

Quote from: Charles-Tim on May 10, 2022, 06:02:41 PMI do not see nything CZ did wrongFrom the video? No. Outside the video? Well, he's silently mocking everyone by impinging upon on every trickle of privacy that's left from his clients, sells their personal data to chain analyzers, Putin, his mom, charges unjustifiably high fees for withdrawals, blackmails for further info and promotes a scum token, so yeah, he's kinda wrong in some ways.",

I meant from the video. About others, Binance is a centralized exchange, anyone that gives his personal data and got registered on Binance or any other centralized exchange or service should expect that their data can be sold, hacked or exposed to other parties. We know that the best way to privacy is by never giving out personal data to get verified.About fee, Binance withdrawal fee for altcoins are not much, unlike exchanges like HitBTC and some others. For bitcoin, on Binance, the withdrawal fee was 0.0005 BTC before, but has been reduced to 0.0002 BTC. Although, it is still high if compared to onchain bitcoin transaction fee.About altcoins pegged with bitcoin on BEP2, BEP20, ERC20 and on other networks, that is really a means to make people mistaken those altcoins for bitcoin, and because of low fee, some people will withdrawal from such exchange into altcoin network thinking it is bitcoin network.",

And the latter is always more important than the former, although sometimes it is a bit necessary to capture the former to gain the latter. This is true to both CZ and NAS Daily. Of course, they have to make a script that is somehow touching and encouraging. That's typical NAS Daily. On the part of CZ, it doesn't matter for as long as it is promoting his name and business.From a certain standpoint there's nothing wrong with this. But from someone who has read a little more about CZ, Binance, NAS Daily, and Nuseir Yassin, this might come nauseating.",

They seem to be famous, but I don't think they are famous in the Arab world, or at least those who live in the Middle East countries.Frankly, the video is cute, and the promotion of the platform is not pretentious, but he showed himself in the advertisement, which suggests that he is trying to show himself as a figure with influence in cryptocurrencies and is not trying to hide himself as most developers do.[1] https://nasdaily.com/",

I don't know if CZ paid NAS for that video but one thing we can sure here they do that for marketing Binance to the world.But I don't see any problem with this since if this one could help bitcoin or crypto then they are doing great with this.",
