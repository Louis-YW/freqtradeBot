They have to be 2,000 feet from a residence and can't be controlled by a “prohibited foreign party-controlled business.” The second new law subjects mines which break the rules to civil penalties.I hear that in developed countries, US is the example, you can easily sue anyone despite you're poor, as long as you're correct, you will win, why did the neighbors not sue it?",

All they do is make alot of noise and disrupt peoples' lives. What a disaster. I don't think I like bitcoin anymore.  There are pros and cons but if big mining farms are too closely to urban areas or where locals are living with high density, I believe that there will be more regulatory rules in future to solve these issues and negative impacts of Bitcoin mining activities on locals.Like many other industries, there will be regulations, more and stricter with time but there is no reason to ban Bitcoin mining industry so my belief goes to good survival and existence of Bitcoin mining farms, under future Acts, Laws and Regulations.There will be solutions to reduce Cons, and increase Pros, but companies in any industry will not proactively do this. They often wait for official regulations from governments to adjust their industry streams and infrastructures to satisfy requirements. With Bitcoin mining industry, we will witness same progress in future.",

      "body": "Datacenters are noisy as well, but they are generally well enclosed and have a comprehensive ESG outlined for their companies to follow. GCP has it, AWS has it but I haven't seen any from miners so far. I've got a Google DC right next to me and I don't hear a thing. Through my years of study on Bitcoin and their environmental impact, I've yet to come across a company which outlines it. Rather than saying Bitcoin mines are bad, I believe that more should be done from the miner's perspective to clearly outline what are their different considerations in the areas of operations.I don't own a mine, but I've had a home mining farm previously. Noise pollution is definitely a concern even with my small operation and decent sound insulation. There should be more regulations and more to be done to mitigate these sorts of issues.",

China banned Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining effectively forcing some of the miners to shift from China to US where prices are competitive enough. It is not a political tool used by either country.It is important to note that the migration also changed the composition of renewable energy being used by miners according to some estimates.",

So i expect Arkansas also did that, which means those miners should be sued or at least forced to reduce noise to acceptable level by noise regulation.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on July 27, 2024, 03:35:31 AMI don't think I like bitcoin anymore.  That's weird statement, when the actual problem is a company violate noise regulation.",
