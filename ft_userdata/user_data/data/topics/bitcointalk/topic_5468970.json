      "body": "Over the years, the purchasing power of almost all World currencies has been reducing, but it is highly unlikely that any of those currencies will fail. On the other hand, Bitcoin's value/ purchasing power has continuously increased since its inception. Bitcoin adoption is on the rise. Bitcoin should be your priority as far as the investment and storage of value is concerned, even if the other fiat currencies have value. It might not be considered a hedge against inflation at the moment, but it will help people fight inflation and devaluation in currency. It is also important to keep in mind the Bitcoin volatility and associated risks before investment.",
