  "content": "QuoteThe app is also working on \"awards\" that can be purchased with coins.It seems Elon Musk’s Twitter is working on a new scheme to make money from the platform. The service appears to be experimenting with an in-app currency called “coins” meant to help creators earn money from the platform, according to screenshots shared by two app researchers.The feature has been spotted in recent days by Jane Manchun Wong and Nima Owji, app researchers who often publish images of unreleased features. According to their posts, coins appear to be an extension of Twitter’s existing tipping feature. “Coins allow you to support creators who Tweet great content,” reads a screenshot shared by Wong and Owji. An image shared by Owji back in December showed a new “Coins” tab in the same section where users can keep track of their tips.For now, it’s unclear exactly what Twitter’s plans are for coins or when the feature could launch. The company, which no longer employs communications staff, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the screenshots suggest Twitter is at least considering featuring coins prominently in its app as both Wong and Owji spotted it in the main sidebar.But coins may not be just for tipping. Wong also spotted an “Awards” feature, which allows people to use coins to buy in-app gifts for others. According to the image shared by Wong, users would be able to buy gifts for as little as one coin (called “Mind Blown”) or as much as 5000 (called “Gold”). It’s not clear how much coins will cost, though Twitter would presumably get a cut of revenue generated from coin purchases.So far, Elon Musk doesn’t seem to have publicly weighed in on coins or awards, but he has spoken broadly about wanting more ways for creators to be rewarded. He’s said that Twitter Blue revenue would potentially “give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators” and that “creator monetization for all forms of content” is also in the works.It’s also worth noting that despite the “coins’ moniker, the feature doesn’t seem to have any cryptocurrency tie-ins, at least for now. “Twitter Coin is still under development and we don't even have any evidence that it's something related to crypto,” Owji noted. “Don’t let the scammers fool you.”https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/twitter-coins-awards-creators-210326649.html....Aside from youtube ad revenue has there been a social media platform offering the following features?:QuoteHe’s said that Twitter Blue revenue would potentially “give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators” and that “creator monetization for all forms of content” is also in the works.I'm interested as to how they propose to deploy content creation revenue given the text limit along with limitations on server video bandwidth. Could image based memes could be considered approved content?Could they conceivable payout decent revenue based on end users publishing a few sentences of text? Could that disrupt the freelance writing market where some authors are paid by number of words published?They're reporting twitters proposed internal currency coins feature will not be crypto based. Which is interesting development. I think most of us expected dogecoin support. Or something similar. There have been a few previous leaks that this was coming. Although unfortunately the sources were apparently deleted before anything more than a few unconfirmed screen caps could be recorded.While twitter's launch of a watered down version of facebook's proposed diem and libracoin projects might not be the most exciting headline anyone has seen. Perhaps this could be a step in the right direction?",

The parameters to which these rewards would be given will also be interesting too. I don't think it will be solely reliant on content quality because that is subjective. Engagement will also be a hard factor to base on because there are a lot of paid services that can artificially boost post engagements that can game the system. Hopefully Elon and the Twitter team can come up with decent guidelines that addresses this question from content creators and us consumers of content as well.",

This is one of Elon's plan he announced immediately after acquiring Twitter. So let's wait for an official announcement. But I am sure that some token based system is going to be introduced which will be used as an in-house currency. I have seen a lot of speculations around the KPIs for monetized content similar to yours. But no one really knows the reality. Let's wait for that! Every platform faces the risk of misusing the reward system. Twitter is no exception!",

Even if it were a fraction of that amount, it still be a lot more than most writers are paid on average on a word per word basis.

This new update of Twitter may disrupt other freelancing sites but not specifically those are into writing, as some freelancers might try this out and if it works well on them then they will focus on it.Before Musk, I think Twitter is one of the leading social media sites so this means they are also earning well. This is why the deal took a while because Jack did also think twice if he will sell his beloved company to Elon or not but the huge offer, made him surrender it.
