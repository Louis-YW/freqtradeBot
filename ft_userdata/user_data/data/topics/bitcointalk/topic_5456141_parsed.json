Although I know that it's gonna be easier if you're a busy person but having a few minutes of your time visiting websites like CNBC or any other websites that you prefer that covers those topics, news and updates that you need.It's actually a good practice when you're doing it with your spare time because you'll discover a lot from these websites. And subscribing to their newsletter is probably one of those features that you'll like but it goes through your email.",

Similar to watching just one news channel.You can turn on notifications for financial blogs or social accounts which would inform you once there's an update for you to check.That's right, to analyze and look for conclusions we cannot see only from one source or two sources, because it is the same as you believe in things that have no recognition from other parties, manually and collect many sources and then analyze and we can see the conclusions Can be trusted or not about financial news, especially if it is formed in a graph and or only limited to the description can still be manipulated by news makers, and we only need to juxtapose and compare the same news in different sources.Today we can see a lot of financial information media, as said, both from articles, journals poured on social media or websites, as an analysis must have many sources.Quote from: sunsilk on June 13, 2023, 06:47:33 AMIt's actually a good practice when you're doing it with your spare time because you'll discover a lot from these websites. And subscribing to their newsletter is probably one of those features that you'll like but it goes through your email.Using a subscription feature may be good because it will get the news update in detail from a platform, but I think it will spend a lot of funds, unless you work in data and financial information which then you have to make content about finances also to get the income is good, it might be good, But if you only see financial news as an analysis to make an investment decision factor I think too much too, because basically today information about financial news is also still a lot of free without having to take a subscription feature, you only need to wait for the platfom that gives news for free.",

While I don't have a specific app to recommend, I've found that a combination of sources can be helpful. I usually keep an eye on financial news websites, follow key influencers on Twitter, and join relevant online communities. It's like creating your own personalized financial event tracker.

I often use this website as a reference for upcoming events related to cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin specifically, not for stocks. Keeping an eye on such developments is crucial as they have a significant impact on the fundamental aspects of a coin. By knowing about major events that will take place in the coming weeks or months, it can instill confidence in our decision-making process.It's important to note that this event calendar relies on input from members. There are still a few submissions that are fake or untrustworthy, which can be identified by checking the trust score at the bottom of each event. Usually, submitters include valid sources, allowing other users to fact-check the event information directly.",

You can integrate it into the telegram bot and get notifications in your channel with customizing the news according to what you want, which is a better solution than relying on third-party channels or applications, in which the possibility of customization is often limited, or not as comprehensive as RSS gives you.Just for crypto news, I prefer these two sites. You have an update on the expected news, and it may help you to anticipate a token price hike before it happens.https://coinmarketcal.comhttps://coindar.org/there are some good alts for coinmarketcal, but consider that they all work with the same idea.",

      "body": "Usually I see news information about the domestic or global economic world mostly from a television station, which every day presents news or developments on the rise and fall of currencies, stocks and the global economy. Maybe many already know about the television station that I usually watch, because it's not just a television station, but also the website and the name of the news company and the website.namely CNBC. But I also don't only look at economic news only on CNBC, but there are also many websites that I often browse to find information about the state of the world economy.So if you want to find a website or an application that contains economic news, all you have to do is search for it on Google and there will definitely be a lot of news coming out of the search results. But the most important thing is that you have to be able to research and filter the news, because there are always news-making websites whose information does not match the original situation. And if you really need a reference for news about the global economy, I would advise you to try looking at the CNBC website instead. Because I believe that CNBC's news is always up-to-date, and there are no lies.",

Twitter is usually pretty quick, usually in a few minutes you will know why something happens while a news report will take a few hours.As I mentioned above, I use it too but the noise and information overload of Twitter's fast-paced nature can lead to information overload, with lots of noise and irrelevant content. Maybe we should sift through it again and distinguish reliable information from rumors or misleading posts and Twitter there is also a posting character limit per tweet for information to be shared as a result, tweets may lack in-depth analysis and comprehensive context, which are essential for understanding complex financial events overall.",
