  "content": "SLIC: Single-phase, Liquid Immersion Cooling for Cryptocurrency & BlockChainJust came across this special system called SLIC while researching about the \"Coolant CPU\" terminology. It is wondering how they have engineered this synthetic component and making it possible to mine with low heats, high efficiency of the miners and obviously reduced electricity paycheck!Though it seems this system is only for the big farms and not the solo miners. The documentation clearly shows pictures of heavy duty pumps that will be sole system pumping Synthetic coolant from all the immersed miners and carrying away their heats. However, everything comes at a cost too. Setting up this system and placing your miners in it is tedious work. What is more inconvenient in this system is, the space utilized by these heat sink tanks. They are huge and are placed apart from each other to run the fluid piping network around them. I am not how feasible is this but number of advantages are also equally balanced. Key Points:Coolant has more than 1,600x the heat density of airSafely overclock your minerâ€™s hashrate Lack of noise (by cutting those fans)By far the system looks way simplified with those segregated tanks. Properly wired channels, and removed fans make it way simpler. Obviously it entirely depends on the space and miners available and by far it seems for mega projects only. The second image is holding tank and also pumping system which makes it giant project considering it will also add up lot of value to the mining operation as initial investment. Not sure about the maintainer cost, but this could end up as profitable only if system does fail in between. Interesting read from Single-phase, Liquid Immersion Cooling for Cryptocurrency & BlockChain",

      "body": "Do you have cost details? The part that I liked is that it has almost no moving parts but I am still not convinced that the cost of the whole system is much less than the cost of air cooling.Personally, I think that making profits here is based on calculating space versus efficiency, meaning that you have a small space, cheap electricity, and noise is an influential factor, such as an industrial city or a closed area, but if space and noise are not a big problem for you, the initial costs (CAPEX) are sufficient to purchase several mining devices.",

      "body": "No moving parts, because that is a circulating system where pumping station is located outside your work area and does all the dirty job out there. Basically it's like a car engine cooling system where you have coolant tank, in-built pumping mechanism that keeps flushing the coolant throughout the engine periphery and thus carrying away the heat along with it. The SLIC mechanism improves the process on larger scale and in reality it's even easier since you get more \"surface area\". Ideally, the higher the surface area, the more is efficiency of cooling the entire system. Nonetheless, you can already see how it is having multiple panels increasing the surface area even further. The magic also happens with the coolant which is capable of carrying most of the heat. I am not sure about the cost neither have any clue. The quote is mostly based on your working area.",
