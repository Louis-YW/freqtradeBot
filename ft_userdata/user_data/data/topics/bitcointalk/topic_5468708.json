  "content": "This thread is to serve as a reference for my negative trust on the member in question.I decided to get off my ass this morning and start spreading some merits around, and a couple of PMs into my backlog of requests for post history reviews I came across one from superman184.  I checked his registration date, looked at his merit count and kind of scratched my head.  After un-ignoring a bunch of sections I was able to see that he started off his lousy bitcointalk career on June 28, 2017 with a post in the Indonesian section (forgive me, I forgot how to quote posts from locked threads):Quoteane sejak 2013 main bitcoin dalam satu tahun berhenti karena kalah dalam taruhan dana nya hasil dari stellar dulu 0.6 btc waktu harga masih murah, setelah kalah ane pensi jadi kagak main btc lagi ini mulai lagi gan mencari hasil dari btc 2017, vakum 3tahunanNo idea what that means, as I don't speak the language.  His first post in the English section on January 5, 2018 was this:Quoteoh god it was still a long time ended participation for bounty earth token this, i just read and asked, hope not disappoint only and success always to token earth greeting profit.do we have to show a reply about the reposts of fb and twitter we repost, I do not think there is a rule asking for it, what should?Obviously homeboy's grasp of English is straight-up bad, bad, bad.  He continued to post here and there in the Indonesian section and used the same quality of English his main section posts up until July 18, 2018, after which there was no activity on the account until September 20, 2021 when he came back with this:Quote from: superman184 on September 20, 2021, 10:02:44 PMQuote from: U Got on August 26, 2021, 12:08:21 PMHi I am new to crypto and wonder what are some of the best technical indicators to use for trading?According to my experience in trading in cryptocurrency more to use the Moving Average (MA), because MA is an indicator of the trend-line moving lagging, or slower than price movements. The moving MA line indicates an uptrend or bullishness, while the downward MA line indicates a downtrend or bearish trend. I also use two MA lines with different periods to determine the open position signal. For example, MA 20 and MA 50. MA 20 which is MA 50 from top to bottom produces bearish signals, so I can open short positions. On the other hand, if the 20 MA 50 is from the bottom up, this indicates a bullish signal to open a long position.If you compare the two posts in English that I've shown, the jump in proficiency is incredible.  You might say that one could improve one's language skills considerably over the course of 4 years, but I would argue that going from this:Quotein my opinion many benefits from the best project token earth here is the existence of a comfortable and clean environment. because the earth is old and added more natural damage caused by humans so that the weather on earth is so uncertain because of the human hand itselfto this:Quote from: superman184 on September 17, 2023, 03:30:38 PMQuote from: Hewlet on September 17, 2023, 10:53:49 AMSince the popularity of AI, a lot has changed in so many sectors;1. Students now rely much on it for their assignments and it's almost difficult to engage the brain in constructive reasoning since AI can always come through for themThis only happens to students who already use the internet every day and continue to use the internet when they know that (AI) can really make it easier for them to complete the assignments given by their teachers at school. So his own reasoning and thought patterns will not work when he is not dealing with the internet because he cannot access AI to complete every existing task. So when this happens, should we blame the AI developers or should we advise every teacher in school to check all of their students' work using special checking technology that can detect AI thoroughly?Quote2. It has affected the graphic space since you can just do an AI portrait, or simple graphics for yourself using the AI tool, and the graphics guy is technically not needed anymore.When graphics experts are generally no longer needed and no longer paid well because of the presence of AI, this makes me think of aerial cameramen whose work is no longer needed since the advent of drone cameras. So in general, graphic experts are also very disturbed by the presence of AI because their work is no longer valued expensively by people who previously needed special services from graphic experts. There is also a need to find a solution for this so that graphics experts can continue to develop their skills, even if it is not to beat this AI.Quote3. The coding guys are not even left out and although it has its advantages in all these sectors I feel it also has done a huge damage in increasing the rate of laziness on the part of the youth.Because the aim is to make things easier, of course the level of laziness among young people will naturally appear. This is also triggered by the complexity of creating your own coding so that on average beginners who learn about coding will choose shortcuts when they already know about AI and this also makes coding experts lose space to work as usual. So I don't know what solution to look for to overcome this because in fact it has happened like that now.QuoteWe are enjoying the ease that comes with doing things using AI at the snap of our fingertips but I fear that over dependent on it might have serious effects on society, in the years to come.There will definitely be an impact if it continues to be used and relied on excessively because when everyone no longer relies on their own minds and tends to rely on AI for everything, and what is really feared is that the minds of all humans will always depend on AI without any sense of creating their own new things in his life. Even though everything that can be detected by AI now also comes from the creations of all the people who already exist on the internet.....isn't reasonable, especially not for a shitposting bounty hunter/sig spammer.  In addition, all posts in the Indonesian section stopped in 2018.For the reasons I've given above, I'm tagging superman184's account, and I would ask anyone who's willing to see if they can find any alt accounts this guy has, because members like him are like cockroaches.  If you see one scurrying around, there's probably a zillion of them hiding out where you can't.  I've been getting a sinking feeling in my chest lately that there are a lot of members asking for post history reviews for themselves and for who knows how many of their alt accounts as well, and I think I'm going to have to either rescind my offer or modify my requirements.Thanks in advance, guys.",

Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on September 30, 2023, 10:13:49 PMOn top of that, if my theory is correct and this guy does have alt accounts I might be able to do the forum a favor and render a few shitposting accounts useless (perhaps) for sig campaigns.That's what happens, when we discover one thing it's usually the tip of the iceberg. The clearest example can be seen in those threads that are opened in this section, protesting a single tag, sometimes even neutral, and that make the DTs investigate the person, who ends up with several more red tags for other reasons. I remember DireWolfM14 defending that people should not be red tagged for simply buying an account, and there was a quote from theymos saying that there are many more accounts bought than we think, but I think they do not meet the characteristics of this case where it is clear from the posting style that there is something else behind it, as we can see with the analysis of Apocollapse. I believe the cases where someone simply buys an account and doesn't break any more rules, especially after the introduction of the merit system, are statistically insignificant.",

They bought the account to make money from sig campaigns or to announce a project. If they bought the account with loads of positive trust, they likely have scam intentions, and the community should be warned they aren't dealing with the original owner. If they gain reputation after the account was purchased and become a staple in the community, then that's fine. It's all about when the account was purchased to me.

I'm saying that a bought account from 5 years ago who wasn't someone important in the community, probably has no intention of scamming anyone. They bought the account to make money from sig campaigns or to announce a project. If they bought the account with loads of positive trust, they likely have scam intentions, and the community should be warned they aren't dealing with the original owner. If they gain reputation after the account was purchased and become a staple in the community, then that's fine. It's all about when the account was purchased to me. I think you say that from your common sense, while I do it from a legal point of view, because whoever commits a crime does not change the typology of the crime. This of applying a penalty depending on the status of the person or the perception of whether he is going to scam or not, has a difficult defense based on laws and legal regulations.If you use a legal perspective, are there any regulations that prohibit buying and selling accounts here? As far as I know, buying and selling accounts is allowed on this forum. So legally in this forum, this account has not violated anything, but if we talk about forum ethics then it might have violated ethics because most of the members here don't like buying and selling accounts.A few questions: Are there any indications that this account is committing fraud or causing harm to other people so it deserves a negative tag?",

It seems I missed some of the discussion above. However, it could be that the account owner doesn't dare to come here, that's a sign that he admits his mistake.

As usual, you always use dirty words but it's always interesting to read them At first I didn't agree with Redtrust for buying and selling accounts, because as far as I know it's not prohibited on the forum, but I changed my mind and it's annoying if new people join the forum and immediately have a ranking and get a campaign salary. I'm not jealous, but it still sucksThe guy didn't come here and defend himself so maybe he admitted his mistake and wasn't interested in arguing or putting up a defense. Have you sent a message? If not, I will send him a message in Indonesian about this accusation thread",
