  "content": "QuoteThere is a group of people that longevity researchers call “SuperAgers,” who are in their 80s and beyond, but have the cognitive function of those decades younger.Conversely, it’s possible for your brain to be older than your chronological age, which is what we want to avoid.As a neuroscience researcher and author of “The Age-Proof Brain,” I’ve found that it’s our behaviors, not just our genes, that have a powerful impact on our brain’s destiny.  So what sets SuperAgers apart from people who have weak memory skills? According to a 2021 study that followed SuperAgers over the course of 18 months, one key differentiator was that they kept learning new things throughout their life.SuperAgers learn something new every dayThink of the brain like a bank account. We make “deposits” — or new connections between our brain cells — by learning. Our memories are housed in these connections.As we age, we naturally lose some of those connections. It’s like making a withdrawal every year. But the more deposits we make throughout our lives, the less our net worth is affected by these withdrawals.One study found that adults with more years of education had more active frontal lobes when they took memory tests. Activity in the frontal lobe is associated with better memory.But higher education isn’t the only way to maintain memory. In another study, even if individuals had lower levels of education, if they attended lectures, read, wrote and read often, they had memory scores on par with those with more education.Which types of learning are best for brain health?Keeping your brain healthy is not all about Sudoku, Wordle or crossword puzzles. Those can have cognitive benefits, but you are mostly exercising with the knowledge and skills you already have.What does make significantly new connections in the brain is learning new skills and information. And the process should be challenging: SuperAgers embrace — and sometimes crave — that feeling of frustration when they learn something outside of their expertise.‘Cross-train’ your brainApproach learning the way you would with fitness training. You wouldn’t go to the gym and only work out your forearms. Eventually, you would look like Popeye.The same goes for the brain. Learning a new language, for example, works out different parts of the brain than a new sport or instrument does.You can cross-train your brain by mixing mental and physical learning activities. Get out your calendar and plan different types of activities using this plan:Day 1: Learn something mentally stimulating, such as listening to a podcast or taking an online course.Day 2:  Do something that requires learning through movement, such as a new sport, dance or yoga pose.Day 3:  Be social. Grab coffee with a friend or go to a dinner party. Yes, social interaction is a form of learning that has been associated with staving off dementia.No matter what it is, learning new things keeps your brain young. So if you discovered something you didn’t know before from reading this article, you’re already helping your brain age at a slower pace.Marc Milstein, PhD, is a brain health expert and author of “The Age-Proof Brain: New Strategies to Improve Memory, Protect Immunity, and Fight Off Dementia.” He earned both his PhD in Biological Chemistry and his Bachelor of Science in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology from UCLA, and has conducted research on genetics, cancer biology and neuroscience.

Although it seems a wider variety of activities which are dissimilar from each other produce the best results. In this way cognitive decline due to age can be reduced. In the way that exercise can limit issues with loss of bone density and osteoperosis. I am curious to know whether learning and brain exercise might also be useful in addressing disorders like alzheimers. In recent times, there have also been studies claiming that microdosing with psilocybin carries a potential to repair brain damage. Which urban legends say is irreversible. Combat veterans with brain injuries have shown remarkable improvement from psilocybin micro dose treatments.",

      "body": "I might not be able to confirm the reliability of this information because I am not conversant with the research procedures but the finding might be correct. This is because I have observed that one of the professions that promotes cognitive ability is the teaching field. Teachers always have a long and active mental and physical lifespan. This might be because they keep learning new things althrough their teaching career. Due to the constant review of the educational syllabus and teaching methods, teachers have to keep learning new concepts so that they can be able to be productive in this ever-dynamic world. Some of my teachers look younger and more mentally alert than me.",

Intuitively, even I feel mentally stronger when I have to study something new or work in something that requires more intellectual effort than usual. Hopefully, science will eventually deliver a \"chemical solution\" for the problem, for now keeping active is know to be useful",

From what I read some time ago, any brain-training games/apps are proven to be ineffective.So yeah, providing your brain with the right type of stimulation, staying away from harmful activities (i.e. dopamine overload, such as porn or compulsive use of social media), and most of all - keeping the right diet - could help you keep your brain in a good shape for a long time, but that won't increase its potential.",
