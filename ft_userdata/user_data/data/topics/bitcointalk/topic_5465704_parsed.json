  "content": "Sometimes at the edge of difficulties and frustrations, the period of such situation could trigger to a nonchalant actions and sometimes provides you knowledgeable factors on how to get fix the messes  up without a call of rampages.Who else ever feels fraudulent is being sponsored my some influential citizens and of some predatory leaders?Seriously,i weeps and breaksdown furiously when I learn some of our social influencer, model and celebrities publicly campaigns for a system that has motives and logically with the potentials of fleeing before the rising sun  after accumulating the masses harvests.The worse of this is that this is promoted by an approved sites, platforms, networks such and of course public service presenters boosting strong reliance believes one the masses with whole manners of sugarcoated words as a means of adverts and campaigns.There you will see and hear go grab your copy now before it is too late, to take a chance before it is too late,what are you waiting for to be part of the beneficiaries? We are operating on a limited time out do hurry now and grab your offer as we currently offers a discount,  buy 2 and get 1 free. Oh damn. I call this a coalition of fraudulent after scamming motives is archived and the antibodies  as an institution doesn't take hold of it.Why and how could such above mentioned categories of persons and platforms get indulge into a system they have not rootness details of it's reality of , aim, objective of foundations about in the first place?For goodness sake, you are an influencer, a role model to the masses and are looked up upon and for the platforms, you are a registered and approved sites and so as you are believed to have genuine and and confirmed legit broadcasting informations and updates detailed before the masses.There have been too many mischief of proxies all around the world that calls for an orderliness alarms.I am inspired of this post after I came across a brothers post pertaining Patricia's online platform that is currently on a suspension as state through the link below where people are crying out loud with so much heartbeats already broken through their commentaries which has also remindedhttps://twitter.com/PatriciaSwitch/status/1662049215772516352?t=BTNf10Oo158vorot9LlNsw&s=19.This has also reminded me of 86 FB football ponzi investment that has fallen to it's end https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gazettengr.com/how-86fb-86z-ponzi-scheme-met-its-end/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiZkb7qypKBAxXZQUEAHSrLClUQFnoECAAQAg&usg=AOvVaw3KCVsYyVJ3LI6dqjafZnCiand the side of the empower network and many more.This has also reminded me of \"De-Villa Homes\" a real estate developer in Rivers State Port Harcourt who has scammed over 400 landed buyers and investors with multi millions of naira in about 3 years back. You can read below on https://www.google.com/url?q=https://authorityngr.com/2020/07/25/victims-of-de-villa-land-scam-demand-justice/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjE-4n10ZKBAxWSU0EAHadmDwMQFnoECAYQAg&usg=AOvVaw3Wu8WskHjG1_EZOaqyUtwA.A related point of my views towards this is that this so De-Villa Homes has been on a trend and televising on the networks holding programs with the networking presenters fuming with enticing offers and benefits that could be convinced and brings about people's interests to engage on patronizing the landed business without undergoing a research or investigations if it was a legit one or not. But at the end time of the so real estate business man was exposed, the same networking stations was the the ones blaming the victims for not going a thorough investigation to know if it was a legit or not legit properties before they could go for a purchase.How the hell you the networking stations and platforms fails to understand your influences on peoples mind?I personally suggest these key words to be undertaken to limit the risks of fraudulence *Approvals conciousness techniques  It is assumed that  before any form of investment or a platform that demands an approval permission could aim to acquire a multimillionaire in due time as a system to earn incomes through patronages to be  including individual organizational systems which are likely to be indited to face detriments if gone contrarily against the terms and conditions of keeping the masses unharmed by demanding a signed undertaking and of a strong hold on a surety and if needs be an enhancement of a deposit as a collateral means should be adopted depending on the investment or the organizational networth rates.Furthermore, sanctioning any forms of it's promotional campaigns and advertisements of any individuals and assorted networking platforms of such as it's ambassadors and other related social influencer to be ready of sarcasm justice.*Promotional and campaign bodies integrities This is to bring about the carefulness and a reputable personalities to oneself at its endivoirs not to lead the people live by the forms of fallacies.*Rights and conciousness of afflicted partiesAt this point, all afflicted parties including the approval and the promotional and campaign bodies should be granted internal access to monitorship with a prior to stand firm behind and across its premises.I am particularly relating this to the pozi's because they portrays massive hit access to succeed on its victims due to its disguise in operations.",

Big bro, of course it getting this to an end na collective measures start from individual willingness to fight against am but the true be say where active law no dey, the laws no go hold anybody so my take na make there be an active and genuine law against this acts as to limit the nonsensical acts. I know say laws already dey on any caught fraudster but make e also affect those individual influencers and the networks and platforms way dey promote the acts. Bcos many of us falls victims to this bcos we hear say 1 famous celebrity, 1 famous and government approved radio stations, TV stations and internet famous sites put mouth for the matter with all manners of sugarcoated words and we looking and such we no fit get doubt on am but just get in and at the end we bcom victims. Na why I say make all those influencers and networking promoters too be hold responsible if the organization or the investment do any magic cuz the influencer and the networking stations no supposed dey promote wetin dem no dey sure about but only cares about what the gets in returns.",

My take is that these set of people should also be held responsible if there comes a compromise.Let's learn how to keep good leads for there are still people who does not hear, see or talk but relies on you to take their leads while they follows.",
