Taking a leaf from the bible in the creation story where eve was asked to eat from the tree of knowledge and she herself wanted to know what would be the outcome of it. So humans always want to know outcomes and that is why we are where we are today.Now, are we going to say that life now with alot of comfort is not better than the medieval times, the times that Thomas Hobbes described in state of nature. I don't believe that things would have been far different from what we are witnessing now.",

In that sense, such a reset would not be possible without also resetting the way of living or the brains of the population, it would be like taking the population of the planet and teach them how to live in the early 30s, when there was not Satellites, Internet, social media, etc. If this is a thread which is supposed to be about the rejection of modernity over the simpler times we learnt about in our history classes, I dont think it would be a good idea. After all, humanity is about advancing and trying to reach new boundaries with technologies as far as we can. We just managed to successfully get energy out a fusion reactor. Why give up on such important advances.?",

The answer is, yes.wars have long existed even before technology was invented tribes were fighting each other for land and for resources humans are naturally greedy and prideful wars have and will always exist the only difference is that those wars weren’t recorded because obviously there wasn’t anything or anyone to record it humans were fighting each other before learning how to read and write",

Most times, while in the course of interaction, conflicts may arise, this has nothing to do with modernisation. It is in the human nature to disagree to agree most times.

I say forced, because he wasn't living in a palace with servants to come up with this idea out of boredom, no, a force from outside made him to make a move, and now what if we could destroy all the governments and their corrupted apparatus to build a decentralized government ruling the world? an AI  with admins being humans, or simply a network of nodes following a single protocol, with no discrimination when it comes to decide a course of action to be taken in order to have a result.For instance, no favoritism in bureaucracy, or no bureaucracy at all, no control of wealth in to the hands of a few, but instead using the God given wealth to advance everyone's lives regardless of their color and \"race\", currently there is no justice, so we either fight for it, or lose everything we have.",

Guess you mean \"no Modern Military\" and \"no Banking System\" because Military and banking system are not really modern institutions. They have been in existence for many centuries, though the ancient ones may not be so modern compared to what we have today.Secret is necessary unless in society where no evil exists and everyone is trustworthy. Things are kept secret mainly for safety reasons. If you are completely safe in a society where everyone is good no need to keep secret unless maybe for games/test.Now to the topic, restarting humanity or society will only be good if the society will start with just/good law that must be followed always. A slight deviation from the law will definitely lead them back to the issues you highlighted. Besides, those issues are not unique to modern world. You can find them  worst in primitive societies.In regards to the use of modern technologies, to be honest the issue is with the way they were designed or made, and the abuse/misuse of them. It's OK for society to be very creative/productive as long as what they produce is good/safe. There is a race by humans to be at the top and they believe having the best tech/stuff will get them there. And if you try to restrict yourself from producing such tech other people would do it and get there before you and probably have advantage over you. So, you see why it's hard not to be very productive in the world. You are always under pressure to get there first.Unfortunately, the current world's way of advancement is preprogrammed to move in predetermined direction. Any invention you make that deviate from the program, no matter how good won't be accepted or would be modified to be compatible with the program. The goal of the program is to get societies to a point where they are completely controlled.",
