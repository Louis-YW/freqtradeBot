  "content": "Hello there. I have a slightly more technical question for somebody knowledgeable about BIP39 standards and the rules involved.During 24 word seed generation, when a wallet randomly generates your seed, I know it's possible for a word to be repeated in the seed - roughly a 12% chance from what I understand. But is it possible that the same word gets used THREE times during a 24 word seed generation? Obviously this would be even more unlikely than twice, but I'm just wondering if it's possible and what the chances are - or does BIP39 have rules that prevent the same word from being generated 3 times?Appreciate any insight and answers I can get on this. Thankyou.",

      "body": "The BIP39 standard doesn’t allow for any word to be repeated more than two times in a seed phrase. BIP39 seed phrases usually consist of 12, 18, or 24 words chosen randomly from a predefined list of 2000+ words. There are over 30 trillion possible combinations of these words, so there is no need to repeat any word more than twice. I don't know if those figures are exact, but it's something close, as I can't recall where I read about it but am certain of the content.I have created more than 10 wallets this year, and I have not come across a single word repeated even twice, which is barely possible—talk more than three times.",

So you're saying there's actual code baked into BIP39 that will prevent a 3rd repetition if a word is already used twice? If this is indeed correct, then why do wallets accept phrases with multiple repetition? Wouldn't they be invalid if a seed contained 3 or more repetitions of a word + a valid checksum were used?Andreas says in this video that you could use the same word 23 times + valid checksum and it would still be valid. If that's a mathematically valid wallet, then what's to stop a wallet from generating a seed with 3 of the same word? I'm not trying to get into the chances so much as if it's possible. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGClNWZcYV8",

For a generating a seed phrase, a random entropy is generated and that's encoded to a series of words. If the seed phrase has been generated in the correct way, there's nothing to worry about.

So one in every 2,000 seed phrases roughly would have the same word three times.

Let's assume up to 3–4 random words are repeated to make up those 24 words. won't it make it a bit easier for such a seed phrase to easily be guessed?No. There isn't a \"higher possibility\" of words being repeated - there is the exact same possibility as any other word. If my first word is \"zoo\", then my second word has the exact same possibility to be \"zoo\" as it does to be any other specific word. Indeed, if we introduced code to prevent a word from appearing more than once, then you would actually be decreasing the final entropy of your seed phrase, since by the time you get to the 23rd word in your seed phrase, you no longer have 2,048 possibilities for that word but only 2,026, since you could not repeat any of the 22 words you had already used.",

It's virtually impossible for anyone to guess the presence of a repeated word in a seed phrase. Therefore, a seed phrase with one or two repeating words is just as robust as a seed phrase with entirely unique words. Actually, I believe the opposite is true.
