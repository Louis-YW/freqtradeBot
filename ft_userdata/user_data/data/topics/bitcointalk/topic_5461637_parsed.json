  "content": "Russia has canceled 23 billion of debt that African countries owed it and will give them another 90 million for development. President Putin announced this at a meeting in St. Petersburg, where he also promised to send free grain to some of the poorest nations. He said Russia wants to boost trade with Africa and support its regional integration.SourceÂ @wealth https://www.instagram.com/p/CvSg6MsuKgm/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==Â For me Africa needs more exposure to crypto and the west SEC not helping issue currently All of the world has seen it so much from the west. Africa remains the truly untapped place where the true wealth resides. Putin is playing hard core chess with this one. He's got India on his side, China, Â South Africa. Â Meanwhile the United States is still there trying to police the rest of the third world , if you were a third world country where would allegiance be? The one who threatens you or the one who wants to work with you as a partner not as subordinate?",

Makes the connections with the Arabs and the African Countries even more deeper apart from them just funding the war against Ukraine. Cryptocurrencies can only do so much since it inherently does not provide them with anything other than a better payment system, it doesn't give them money or not unless you're talking about donating literally thousands of bitcoins on a single country to fund their treasury and actuate their plans to which I say is not a bad idea, but at the same time why? Gold is a greater alternative and it would be easier to use than bitcoin in some cases. I feel like they're already past the negotiation phase and are already working hand-in-hand to challenge the US's financial capability.",

Nothing comes for free.I don't think that Africa can be dependent on their own because they have relied so much on this foreign countries for everything that they will consume. Instead of a newly elected president to think on how he can improve the country economy, with the resources of the country. Instead he will go out to this foreign countries to seek for loans all in the name of wanting to help his people which ends up being a fat lie.The leaders of Africa are the problem to Africa because of their shortsightedness. They will have citizens in their countries that can produce what they do import locally but instead,they will kill the talent of the citizen by not giving him the opportunity to showcase his talent. How will such country grow.",

Russia and China are now all of a sudden on their side because of what is in Africa. The Minerals. A good weapon against the US and the West. I am not surprised that many of the world powers want to gain from Africa and if the continent is not wise enough the West and other regions will come with a silver soon to gain from them. African need to be dependent on what they have and remove the external no Powers that tend to make them to oblige to pressure when it comes to some certain things. The West had been benefiting from the continent for long and I think is a time for the whole countries in Africa to form alliance and fight for the freedom from external powers to become self reliance.",

The one who threatens you or the one who wants to work with you as a partner not as subordinate?African allegiance should go to any of these powers that are willing to help them develop the continent. For so many years colonial powers have partnered with corrupt African leaders to loot the continent's rich resources. It is sad to see that much-stolen wealth is hidden in banks in Europe and the US, yet the same people will call African leaders corrupt. If these world powers are sincere, they can help Africa stop corruption but because they benefit from the loot, they encourage it. Many funds stolen from Africa are safely kept in banks in Europe and America. Africans should partner with nations that will help them fight corruption African leaders should align with nations that will help them to industrialize. Africa should not be seen as a place to tap natural resources but as a place to refine and export them. Leaders that will help the continent establish industries that will make Africa a producing continent and not for just extraction should become Africa's allies. African leaders should also shun corruption and lead their people transparently.

Africans always support coups because civilian governments are usually corrupt and don't respect the fundamental rights of citizens. The people prefer to have a military regime than to suffer under a civilian government that they gave their mandate. The ousted government has been accused of corruption and the people are celebrating the coup.",
