  "content": "The CEO of Terra Luna, Do Kwon will be explaining to the South Korean Assembly what actually happened to Luna that has caused many investors to lose their money in the investment. He has been summoned by the assembly lawmakers to explain what he has been doing to safeguard investors after the sad crash of Luna.According to the spokes person, Chang-Hyun \"We should bring related exchange officials, including CEO Do Kwon of Terra, which has become a recent problem, to the National Assembly to hold a hearing on the cause of the situation and measures to protect investors.\" Chang-Hyun also wants crypto exchanges to account for their behavior during the crash.I think he maybe caught in some hidden games that led Luna to crash because there are many Luna released to the market. How did that come about if not that it was a game played. Will this be more troubles for Kwon?https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/147269/south-korean-politician-calls-for-hearing-terra-do-kwon",

Until now he is insisting to fork the Luna and leave the retail traders with useless Luna Classic while the rest of his gang that enjoy ponzinomics on anchor for long time will have the reset and off the hook easily? He should be put in jail and seized all his asset. Let the court distribute available funds to all the victims and prioritize small investors.CZ suggestion is what make sense, I don't care if CZ is just bullshitting and playing the good man here but his statement about buy back or retail trader refund is the best path if he wants to continue Luna project.",

This problem caught the attention of many people because there were many who suffered losses due to the collapse of Luna and UST. and I doubt he'll escape prosecution this time.",

The CEO of Terra Luna might have rubbed his hands in oil secretly with the team for such kind of lost on investors. It is good that he will face the legislators maybe something could be squeeze out of him. It however depend on the government to make sure investors are compensated if his having hand in the shady crashing of investors money.",
