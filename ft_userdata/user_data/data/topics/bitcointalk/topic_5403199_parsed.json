That is why even if a lose, I don't get hurt, of course, sometimes disappointed but I do understand what this gambling meant for me, it was just for pleasure. And in the first place, I don't expect to win, unlike the others who gamble a huge amount of money thinking about winning big.

It is not about looking for hopes but it is our decision that is why we also have accepted losses than blaming others and the site.",

You cannot win every game in gambling so you need to prepare yourself that you can face the loss too. If you have prepared on how to handle the loss, then you will still drive the pleasure out of a loss (though it won't be similar to a win). In order to be prepared for a loss, the best and the most important thing which you need to do is to do risk management. Without risk management, you will lose all your capital.",

I think the more people lose their money the more depressed they are as you said and some people know exactly how to hide it by playing poker face but in reality, they are depressed because they don't know where they will gonna get back money to play or how they will get back the money they lose. That's why it always needs to consider before spending on anything, people should better think about whether it's important or not because regret cannot become medicine when you lose everything you have right now because of a mere bad decision.",

A significant part of gamblers play for the sake of winning the jackpot, I can call it a dream, there is nothing wrong with that. And a very small (in my opinion) part of gamblers play for the sake of earning. It doesn't take a genius to play once or twice or ten times to understand that gambling is not suitable for making money.",

      "body": "The feeling of euphoria even when losing is due to dopamine.  We all know what dopamine can do to our emotions.  QuoteDopamine – The Brains Reward SystemWhenever we do something that our primitive brain finds to be good or beneficial, such as eating, procreating and exercising a neurotransmitter called Dopamine is released in our brains. This chemical messenger is synonymous with pleasure and when it is released, we can often feel a sense of euphoria.[2]That might explain it well.QuoteFor it baffles me that someone could decide to engage into gambling only because of the pleasure he claims to derive while engaging in it as opposed to making profit or winning money which is every gamblers most concern.I think it is the player's choice.  If he intends to have fun then he is playing for fun or he can just play for profit, while others might want to take both options.  We really can't judge these players' intentions so saying that profit is the only thing for gamblers is somehow a biased statement.",
