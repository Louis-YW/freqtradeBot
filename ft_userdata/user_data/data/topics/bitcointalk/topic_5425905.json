  "content": "Most of my play these days is at blackjack.fun, I have wagered over 2000 BTC there. I mostly enjoy the competitions but the community has made me come out and socialise, making a few friends. I recommend the free spin promotions to smaller players as it's a great way to build a bankroll. Winnings from freespins are placed into you bonus fund which you clear with ANY game with 40x wagering. Each freespin is worth 200 sats so once you get a few hourlys etc it can really build upDaily Bet Count Competition 5fsHourly Bet Count Competition 5fsDaily 10fsWeekly 60fsDaily Biggest win 5fsTODAYS HIGHEST BET COMPETITION 5fsHourly Biggest win comp 2fsHourly Wager competition 2fsThe easiest is the weekly voting, you will get 60 freespins if you can vote on the winner. if I'm playing it will most likely be me (realwinner is my handle on blackjack.fun)You can also vote on the daily competitions and hourly. Voting rewards listed above. there are expires for voting hourly in last ten minutes of the hour, daily's you need to vote in the first 12 hours. weekly I'm not sure, should be available for a few days.  you also get up to 10 freespins for chatting each hour, I'm there most of the time. make sure to build a conversation as spamming the chat is against the rules and the ban hammer will come out.The game that freespins are played on at the moment is Dig Dig DiggerI'm only scratching the surface as they have competitions/races to compete in much easier than other casinos I play at.this was the first time writing a guide like this so go easy on me and offer some suggestions or constructive criticism. If it goes well I might write some other gambling related content to get more involved in this forum.",

      "body": "Is the game with low house edge like Dice, Roulette and Cards that gives draw result is credited to the wagering requirements to clear the bonus? I still have 1mbtc reward left on my wallet but I'm hesitant to play just to claim it because x40 is not joke for small player like me. I might lose more than the potential bonus that I can get while the reward is not actually fixed but random based on slot profit when I received that bonus. The only way to claim the bonus without hurting much my balance is to play only on low house edge games but I remember that doing this will not count towards wager based on last update that I know before I quit.This freespins reward of blackjack.fun is really awesome because you can get it for free. The only thing that makes it unappealing is the wagering requirements. x20 is more manageable than the x40 current requirements. Thanks btw for summarizing the current reward of the casino.",

      "body": "I don't think draws are counted still. I would play Blackjack the house version and clear the 1mBTC bonus with small bets. There are a few other 3rd party blackjacks I would recommend but can't think of the names right now.The best thing when wagering the bonus is you contribute to the weekly/daily/hourly leader-boards, so you will be earning more bonuses.",

Thanks btw for summarizing the current reward of the casino.I believe a better trade-off for small players like us would be for BlackJack.Fun to release the coins from the bonus wallet at $0.10 per $10.00 wagered. Waiting for the user to wager the full amount of x40 of the bonus would make him/her lose his/her entire deposit before clearing the whole bonus, requiring another deposit. It will make users feel defeated and leave.Plus I believe the free spins won from the votes, and the free spins from playing should be treated separately. Free spins earned from playing should be treated like a cashback by the casino with no wagering requirement.",

Bjfun has to make money also.  The coins won from the free spins that were accumulated from voting and from using the chatbox, definitely YES. They should go to the bonus wallet and to be cleared by the user. BUT, all coins won from the free spins that were accumulated from the user's payment of casino fees through playing/gambling should be given directly to the user. I believe they should be separate, and should be treated like cashback rewards.",
