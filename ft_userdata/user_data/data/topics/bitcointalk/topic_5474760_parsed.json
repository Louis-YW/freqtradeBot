What is the essence of you posting this about prepaid metres for electricity? How does that concern this forum or this local board? I think you should lock your thread before other people start commenting. Some legendary and other senior colleagues are always preaching that we should stop posting low-quality posts, and I believe this is one of them, so lock your thread. When they said educational content, this is not the type we are talking about; we are referring to bitcoin-related discussions.",

First, wetin concern prepaid meter with NIN? Wetin be the benefit? Of you put NIN, it mean say you don put BVN and with that your bank account don connect. So this one fit be a way to charge people account directly especially people wey dey owe plenty money for their meters. Them fit no talk am openly but here na Naija, anything dey possible. So, I no dey comfortable with this their new development.",

When they said educational content, this is not the type we are talking about; we are referring to bitcoin-related discussions.I don't mean to be disrespectful but there some people this will be helpful to. There are people here that are Prepaid meter users that will benefit from this. If you don't have access to electricity in your house because you didn't follow simple instruction can you be able to access this forum? Your opinion is well noted but I think this post will be helpful to some people here. But if those senior members you are referring to come online and said I should lock the post I will do that but for now let others have the same opportunity you had in going through it. It's possible you live in a place you have free electricity and possibly you don't know what prepaid meter is and how important it is, to it's users. Let's not be too fast to attack what we don't know.QuoteWhat is the essence of you posting this about prepaid meter for electricity? How does that concern this forum or this local board?Electricity is a major concern in Nigeria. Without electricity you won't be online here in this forum and this local board. I feel concerned for the members that will be affected if they lose electricity in their houses. It will hinder their possibility of coming online here regularly and thereby denying them of the chance of making useful and meaningful contribution to the forum and local board on a daily, and weekly basis.",
