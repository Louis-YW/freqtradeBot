Â Then just recover in any wallet...Be careful about anyone who request your file.by handing over your file in the forum there is a considerable risk of being scammed.I never used, but this service is very popular, and they might help you:https://www.walletrecoveryservices.com/",

I'm not aware of any relevant software by the name of bitrecover.Your only options are either:1 - Share with us as much as you can remember about your password and what you have tried so far, and we can try creating a new tokenlist file to widen your search.2 - Pay for a professional recovery service as bitmover has suggested.",
