Under Trump’s presidency, his policies on Bitcoin were generally positive, while China has maintained its stance on banning it. So what do you think? will the US’s adoption of Bitcoin help boost its economy and give it an edge over China, or could it have the opposite effect?~snip~Do you even understand what you are talking about when it comes to the facts about the total value of all the BTC in circulation and all the money that is generated around the BTC business in relation to the GDP of the US and China? China's GDP in 2024 was around $18.30 trillion, while US GDP was just over $29 trillion, while at the same time BTC market cap is around $1.88 trillion. If you understand basic math, then you should understand that no country will profit significantly even if they gain absolute dominance over BTC.We can say all kinds of things about the Chinese, but we certainly can't say that they are stupid and don't know how to recognize a good opportunity - that's why those who live in the delusion that the Chinese made a mistake when they banned BTC mining and trading have no idea what they're talking about.Communism and decentralization have never and never will be able to work together, and many people seem to forget that when they talk about BTC and China.",

It has the second largest economy in the world, following the United States. It has grown rapidly in recent decades, shifting from an agricultural economy to a global manufacturing hub. China's prohibition on bitcoin stems from fear, as they seek to reduce financial crime and avert economic upheaval. They are concerned that cryptocurrencies have made it simpler for money to exit their markets, circumventing conventional constraints. I think China, being a country that always wants to get to the top, they might be working on their own crypto that is fraud proof so they can overtake all and become the kings. that just what i guess this guys might me up to,",

If the United States succeeds in adding bitcoin to its national strategic reserves, China may soon lift the ban and consider doing the same. Because once the US succeeds with that idea, countries around the world will soon join in and China cannot stay out of the game. China can compete directly with the United States but cannot compete and fight against the whole world. But China knows for sure that won't happen and that's why they're in no rush when it comes to bitcoin-related issues. It won't be easy to create a national reserve with a new, volatile asset just because it's a president's idea. Especially for a superpower like the United States, where power is distributed evenly across all different agencies, rather than concentrated in the president. And unfortunately, the US national reserve is not decided by the president.",

It is evident now that China is playing a game that shows how cunning these guys are and I am sure they will continue with the same attitude.BTW! After Bitcoin reached a new high, I do not think any country can ignore the value of holding it.

Before china considered to banned Bitcoin I believe they are up to  something because China is one of the country that is working tirelessly to improve in all sectors both technology and economy. If US succeed in making Bitcoin a strategy reserve before any country it will definitely have positive impact on US economy and eventually put US economy ahead of China economy and many country will fellow suit to making Bitcoin a strategy reserve which may likely make china to consider lifting ban on Bitcoin.",

China banned crypto mining and trading in 2021. What I think about this is that the adoption of Bitcoin is a must for any country that wants to remain powerful and on top. I don't know why China does what it does but if the USA wants to have an edge over China, they definitely should adopt Bitcoin. I think that's what the US will do but the problem is that it's not good for us. As Trump said, he wants to mine the rest of the Bitcoins in the USA, which is bad for the decentralization.Bitcoin as a strategic reserve will radically change many things. It's clear that this currency is becoming something more than what it actually is.",

The US's support for Bitcoin shows a new outlook, openness to decentralization, and desire to allow innovation develop without government interference. Meanwhile, China's restriction shows its desire for tight control, protecting structures and limiting disruptionHow then does this affect common people? For some, fresh ideas, new employment, and cross-border transactions free from too strict gatekeepers will present opportunity. Volatile prices and government crackdowns may worry others. Man, emotions run strong when money is on the line. People get hopeful, fearful, ambitious, curious - all at once. It might be exciting how the US can integrate Bitcoin beyond speculation into real-world financial that appeal to average peopleCan gov strike a balance between liberty and security? Decentralized finance can change the game, but they can't blindly follow hype. Those who are unsure about fast change need empathy; but, there is also drive for the inventors who view Bitcoin as a means of escape from outdated frameworks. That tension (between protection and development) defines exactly how the US might stand out, or lag, in regard to China",
