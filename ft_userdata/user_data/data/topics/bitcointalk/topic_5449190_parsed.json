  "content": "Because of this topic, I tried to experiment with reporting some old posts to the moderators [spam, shit post and zero value], so that I find answers to what I doubt here.QuoteOld post: We generally do not moderate posts this old for on-topicness, substantiveness, multi-posting, and other \"cleanliness\" issues.I can actually come to one conclusion that reporting old posts is pointless as moderators will likely tag them as bad or unhandled. The warning above is very clear that moderators do not moderate old posts for any reason. So I'm going back to the old principle of still reporting the newest posts even if they are paltry compared to spam and posts that have absolutely no value for old posts - unless I am find malware or something dangerous.To whoever the moderator handled my report, thank you for that.This is just a warning to any of you who want to contribute to cleaning up forum spam by reporting it to the moderator, but if you want to continue for whatever reason, that's up to you.",

But reporting them doesn't help at all, nobody reads there, so it's a waste of everyone's time to go through them.This is just a warning to anyone who really cares about the accuracy of their reports. I am one of the few users who care about this accuracy, therefore this thread may also alert them.So far I don't have many reports [just over 2000 good reports], but I do regularly when I find something worth reporting. So that's why I care about the accuracy. But sadly, some bad reports today have reduced the accuracy of my reports form 100% to 99%. LOL - It doesn't matter.Quote from: LoyceV on April 17, 2023, 04:49:15 PMI do report older posts once in a while though, for instance when an old spammer became active again. Or if it's link spam: deleting those post removes one more backlink from the internet.I also do the same for some reason. But until this post was made, I thought I should filter more to report more in the future.Quote from: Halab on April 17, 2023, 05:00:30 PMQuote from: _BlackStar on April 17, 2023, 04:26:49 PMThe warning above is very clear that moderators do not moderate old posts for any reason.No, that's not exactly what it is written.
