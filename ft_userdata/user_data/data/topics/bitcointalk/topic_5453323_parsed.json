      "body": "Note that electrum versions older than 3.3.4 are vulnerable to a phishing attack in which the server can display a message and ask you to download a fake version of electrum. So, ignore any message you see on electrum asking you to update the wallet.If you want to update electrum, go to its official website. Download electrum from there and don't forget to verify your download.Quote from: QPlondon on May 19, 2023, 04:22:18 PMIs it safe to upgrade Electrum on the same machine?If you want to be completely secure, you should have your electrum wallet on an airgapped device. If your wallet has been already connected to the internet, I don't think that makes much difference whether you install the new version on the same device or not. If you have two devices and you think one of them is more secure than the other one, it's obvious that you should use the more secure one.",

Just head over to the official website and grab the latest software version (and, as hosseinimr93 suggested, make sure to verify it after downloading). Unzip the downloaded archive into a folder of your choice. Once you launch the application, you will be prompted to either open an existing wallet or create a new one. Just locate your current wallet file and open it. It is as simple as that!",

Before deleting wallet file, check that you have backups and they work.Where is the Electrum data directory located?",

As for trying it on a different machine there may not be a need to do so since your old Mac is already secure (assuming it's already secure) A better alternative:It could be better to make your old Mac as an airgapped device. By doing so you can create a new wallet on it and transfer all your funds to that wallet, this method ensures that your wallet remains disconnected from the internet providing an extra layer of protection.",

You can use the same device to upgrade the wallet to the latest one and that was what I did as well. There are three ways which one can use to upgrade app from a mobile device. You can upgrade it from the app directly, or from the phone settings or from the google play store. And the fastest way to do that is the google play store. When you enter the play store, you type the name of the wallet and you click update. And that is all.",
