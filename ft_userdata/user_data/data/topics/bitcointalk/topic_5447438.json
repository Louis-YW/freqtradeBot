      "body": "Bitcoin don't need regulation in other for it to be globally adopted, from my own point of view Bitcoin is already at the stage of global adoption. Every country in the world have different ways in which they relate with Bitcoin we can not elaborate how all country relate to it all at the same time it's only who is from ones country that can talk little to small about it's citizens.",

My Thai neighbor is sending ETH, doesn't care what regulations they have in their country.",

      "body": "Perhaps, we never know their plan either. However, I was believing that they will come out with a good idea to promote and adopt Bitcoin for the benefit of their netizens. I was certain that they will impose regulations and taxes just like it happens to other countries but I'd never found it a worrying part as it was indeed to happen whether we like it or not - just like fiat. They'll be implementing their own rules, might some of them be similar to other countries but can't expect it. Well, the good thing is that it was not yet implemented in our country and we are free to do whatever we wanted on our crypto and free of tax.",

Among those countries are El Salvador and Central Africa.- Countries that prohibit the use of bitcoin according to clear legislative laws: Most countries in the world prohibit the use of bitcoin according to laws that prevent the use of currencies that are not recognized by the state and consider them within the framework of money laundering and financing suspicious activities.- Countries that do not legally legalize the use of bitcoin, but do not mind enabling companies operating in the field of crypto to obtain work licenses. It can be considered countries that are lenient with the uses of bitcoin and are closer to legal adoption than others.In countries that follow a federal system such as America, the use of bitcoin may be permissible in a particular state and prohibited in another. The United States is an example.",
