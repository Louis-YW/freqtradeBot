That's why we're here to sum up 2023 by voting for significant events or users who you think deserve an award! 🏆       What prizes await the winners?You have probably heard from us repeatedly that public recognition is the most prestigious award, it really is. However, our sponsor 👻 [banned mixer] made sure that the winners really felt they mattered. In addition, [C]ryptioS is also preparing a surprise (this will be announced later in this thread). Please note that Bitcointalk Awards 2023 is not an official event and is run under the auspices of the community. There will be 27 winners in total!🥈 2rd place🥇 1st place🥉 3rd placePrize of $200Prize of $500 Prize of $100                                                                                                                                                                              How it works?From the moment of publication, and for 60 days, public voting will be open, in which any active user can take part. Any user has the right to campaign for or against other candidates in a separate thread specially created for this. Who will be among the top three winners in each respective category depends only on your activity. For the voting system to work, any nominated candidate must have the support of at least three users.Up to 3 users you can vote in each category ➥ Note.You can edit your application until the thread is locked ➥ Note.You must have 50 earned merits to vote ➥ Note.No merit sending is allowed from nominees to users which nominated them ➥ Note.Custom titleDescription of the Nomination  AbsoluteHero of GoodThe award is given to the informal leader, (the presence of a cult is encouraged). 🎭This outstanding man has devoted many years to serving the community and has left an indelible legacy by doing community service without regard for personal gain.Golden FeatherThe award is presented to the participant whose name symbolizes trust and wisdom.There have always been users on the forum who stand out from the crowd in writing style and objectivity, those whose posts are always pleasant to read, and discussions with them bring satisfaction.Bitcointalk NinjaThe award is given for exceptional contribution to the development of Bitcointalk!A person whose activities are extremely useful for the Bitcointalk community, or someone without whom you cannot imagine a forum. In this category, the truly creative people are judged, and now it's time to determine the best!Bitcoin GeekThe award is given to the participant who you felt was the most helpful in the Bitcoin-related areas.Tell us which of your acquaintances is passionate about Bitcoin to the extreme, who can easily explain to you such nuances that you did not even know about or who simply chose a ASIC for your grandmother.Event of the YearWhat event had the biggest impact on you?This nomination is a tribute to the most notable events in the crypto community or the most significant for you personally. This is the third annual award, you can only nominate and vote for all significant events of 2023.Fail of the YearThe most promising event, which brought a lot of disappointment to the community. It is much more pleasant to remember pleasant events, but nevertheless, it will be useful for us to draw conclusions in order to avoid disappointments in the future. What was the most difficult thing for you to come to terms with?Discoveryof the YearPerhaps one of the most unexpected but at the same time iconic categories, which shows that the forum is alive.The award is presented not only to novice Bitcoiners, but also to other users who have been actively participating in the life of the forum over the past year ... heck, you can even nominate your best Bitcointalk friend!SpamBusterThe award is given to a volunteer user for their invaluable contribution to maintaining order on the forum.We tend to think that this award is best suited to the most important figure among moderators & reporters or who contributes in every possible way to the suppression of fake activity in the threads.  ScamBusterThe award is given to an outstanding volunteer working exclusively for the benefit of the community.He adheres to a fairly strong moral codex, is a role model and consistently demonstrates an inexhaustible enthusiasm for identifying abusers on Bitcointalk, (here [1] [2] you can get to know such users personally).  Craft MasterThe award is presented to those who sincerely love their craft, whether it is a professional activity or a hobby.We tend to think that this award is best suited to the most significant figure among collectors, managers, escrows, designers or users who are so passionate about sports and p2p that they motivate others to bets solely in BTC.  Local HeroWell, let's see whose local community is the most united?We know that many users do not go beyond their local sections, so we would like to know whose names represent this or that community. Vote for your friends, too!  Miss BitcointalkAlthough girls are now in the minority on Bitcointalk, 5 to 1, they are still wonderful, interesting and important to us. I understand that choosing three winners from among all our beautiful girls is problematic, but still we will try.Who do you think especially deserves to be Miss Bitcointalk?__________________________________Quote from: Mr.X ➥ I would like to express special gratitude: Jay Johanson, Jayce, GazetaBitcoinFor the most part, this thread is for voting, to facilitate the counting of votes / the thread for discussion and agitation is here.",

Allegedly he was a bitcoin billionaire. I hope this was just a boating accident. Godspeed to his republic, if it still exists. Oh, man....is that MPOE-PR?  If so, although he hasn't been active in years I always found his posts to be some of the most biting and humorous I've read on this forum yet.  Who exactly was he?  I only know the username from my lurking days, not who he was in the bitcoin world.Mircea Popescu was one of the earliest bitcoin adopters. He had built a securities exchange almost purely based on bitcoin and cryptographic verification. It was so barebones that very few were able to actually use it. He would famously call those that didn't manage to use it idiots. It's very hard to document his antics because he was ridiculously active online and apparently only a very small but nevertheless dedicated crowd seemed to have been following him around. MPOE-PR was the account representing Mircea 's security exchange, MPEX. Now defunct. Mircea sold these securities when BTC was worth peanuts. I can only assume that most people never cared enough to retrieve their bitcoins and that's how he ended up becoming a billionaire. But by the time these bitcoins had any actual value, there was no one left to generate demand for buying back said securities. One of the securities was of a now also defunct new website, qntra.net. Another was of a bitcoin based economy MMORPG, Euloria I think. In the end, we have no idea what happened to these coins to be honest. MPOE-PR was a woman btw. Not sure what her relation with Mircea was. He would post pictures with naked women regularly though. He apparently was very much into BDSM and featured it prominently into his life, posting about it for the whole world to see. Maybe in one of these pictures it was her. Who knows...  Some of his blog posts remain up on trilema.comMircea was considered by many to have tainted bitcoin's early image because of some of these antics. No doubt he was a very eccentric dude. Ms MPOE's still alive but I don't know if she still cares about bitcoin or this forum in general. All that absolutely useless information is still stashed deep into my head, thanks for asking and thank me later for the TMI that you didn't exactly ask for.",

Votes for inactive users will not be taken into consideration anymore. The event is related to the activity made by users during current year and not for the past. As a consequence, votes for users like Satoshi, Lauda etc. (with all due respect for all good things they did in the past) will not be counted. Of course, this does not mean that a user's vote will be entirely not counted, if he nominates an inactive user. Only the vote for the inactive user is not counted.As a sum-up: if a user makes nominations of both active users and inactive ones, only the mentions of inactive ones will be not counted (in the contest's final results there will be no Satoshi, no Lauda etc.).",
