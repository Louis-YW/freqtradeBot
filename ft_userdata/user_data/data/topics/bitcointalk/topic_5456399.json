My friend works in a private company and he has saved some money from there. With that money they went into business in a four person partnership, initially he made some profit in the business then he suffered some financial loss. My friend knows that I am involved with Bitcoin. He got some ideas about Bitcoin from me. So he wants to invest money in Bitcoin. I didn't tell him anything about the risk of investing. Since he wants to invest, should I advise him to invest?",

When you start, it looks rosy like your friend business, profitable first and loss later.QuoteMy friend knows that I am involved with Bitcoin. He got some ideas about Bitcoin from me. So he wants to invest money in Bitcoin. I didn't tell him anything about the risk of investing.If you didn't tell your friend about risk, don't tell him about opportunity with Bitcoin. Because risk and opportunity, profit and loss are two sides of a coin, are two parts of investment. An investor must know about both and if you are a tutor of your friend, you must tell him about both.You must be honest with your story and lesson to your friend, about your loss, profit with Bitcoin and what you learned so far, what you want to avoid in future and what he should not step in shits like you, if you did and escaped successfully from it.QuoteSince he wants to invest, should I advise him to invest?Just tell him stay away, if you are not ready to talk about risk.",

Since he wants to invest, should I advise him to invest?my advice is that you better give him information to invest in bitcoin instead of investment advice. you have to explain to him things about bitcoin, and in particular you need to emphasize that investing in bitcoin is high risk and it is not a get-rich-quick way.you have to explain to him that you are providing the information for the bitcoin investment because he asked, not because of your will. because according to my experience, usually these ordinary people will blame us if their investment suffers a loss or various other things. so you need to emphasize from the start that all risks are borne by him not you, you are here only as someone who provides education about bitcoin investment.",

Since he wants to invest, should I advise him to invest?Why don't you talk about the risks of investing in bitcoin? You already know that investing in bitcoin is riskier than any other investment. I don't think advising him to invest in bitcoin would be a wise decision. Instead, you should tell him everything you know about bitcoin, especially you need to emphasize the risks he will face if he decides to invest. Let him decide things for himself, you should not interfere or give any advice, if you don't want to be the one to blame if his investment fails.",

Yes, you should advise him to invest in Bitcoin but give him the pros and cons of investing without knowing it first. Being transparent and tell him your experiences which will speak for you.Quote from: synchronym on June 15, 2023, 06:58:17 AMI didn't tell him anything about the risk of investing. Since he wants to invest, should I advise him to invest?Then, that's the start and you should tell him the risk of investing and since he's into a business before. He surely know that investing into such or any investment or asset bears risk. You just have to explain to him how volatile Bitcoin is and then let him all do the decision making after you explain it to him.",

Let him know that bitcoin is not a get rich quick project,it needs patience and endurance for him to enable him benefit from his investment. Advice him to only use money that he can afford to lose,he should invest in a long term investment so that no matter how dip bitcoin price goes,he wouldn't panic and sell because bitcoin price is volatile and unpredictable. Tell him on how he can keep his bitcoin safe by using a noncustodial wallet to keep his coins and let him not leave his coins in an exchange. Bitcoin has high risk than any other business.",

IMO, it's best to explain everything about the advantages and risks of investing in bitcoin or crypto. after that, try to suggest that he do his own research. when he is ready to invest in bitcoins, you just have to tell him to come to you to know where to exchange or where to buy bitcoins and a safe place to store them. Besides that, make sure that all the risks that can occur are beyond your responsibility.",

If your friend is coming straight into bitcoin invest right after loosing in his business then I think you friend is looking for way to help make up for his losses and probably might have seen how you have gained profits from bitcoin in the past and that is why he wants to invest in them. With such narrative it will be hard for him to hold for long because that is the easiest and safest way to earn profit from this space. And also as a person you shouldnâ€™t be keeping the risk away from him just because you want him to come into bitcoin, any losses incurred by him will definitely be blamed on you. So best his give him the necessary information and allow to make his own decision",

After all, your friend will invest his savings there, and he has the right to know the pros and cons. Actually, it's strange that your friend didn't ask you about the risks.",

As long as you also have to say how the risks are so that he can understand the risks and be able to deal with them himself when what he hopes for doesn't happen to his investment, apart from that you also have to advise him to keep working at a company or open another business that he can master so he can continue to earn real income while waiting for income through the investment he wants to make. After all, the failure he has experienced can also be a valuable experience and the key to starting another business with the hope of becoming more successful, because there are many investors who, after investing, still work at their main job. So it won't be wrong if your friend also tries to keep working while investing in Bitcoin, that's a little advice from me to your friend.",
