  "content": "Hey guys, I thought Betcoin was a reputable Bookie. Of course, you can always find a few negative reviews, but actually most were positiveI started to play and made my first deposits. In total I have deposited three times.0.02470257 BTC0.01552169 BTC0.02483684 BTCI won a little bit with sports betting and send my first payout request. I received 750 Euro in BTC. Everything is fine. Later I got a personal limit, but I still could place bets at mainstream ice-hockey leagues. From one day to the next I couldn´t log in anymore. I asked in chat and the told me to contact them via email. I received these answer from betcoin.agQuoteHello, please help us confirm your unique identity and location by completing this verification from the same device and connection used to access the gaming platform, within the next 360 minutes.https://app.shuftipro.com/verification.....Regards,SecurityI finished security check and all infos were send. I thought the will re-open my account. but I received next message:QuoteHello, the account cannot be reopened, as you are in violation of our terms of service, with regard to arbitrage bettinghttps://www.betcoin.ag/termsPlease provide a BTC address to return the remainder of your deposit value.Do not create any additional accounts or they will be closed and funds withheld, including deposit.Regards,SecurityThe accusation is absolutely not correct. I have not played any arbitrage bets there. I have placed normal bets. For example:Italy U20 - Ukraine U20 1ML 2,45 60 Euro / 1(0) 2,51 175 EuroMannheim - Nürnberg 1 1,94 240 EuroWolfsburg - Schwenningen 1 2,01 250 EuroRomania U20 - Netherlands U20 1ML 3,15 25 Euro / 1X 2,33 100 EuroSpain U20 - Netherlands U20 1 1,75 105 EuroNorway U20 - Hungary U20 1 1,95 95 EuroThese were normal bets like everyone places them. It is of course very easy for a bookmaker to claim that I am placing arbitrage bets. The account will be closed. Done. I got my deposit back in full, the winnings were retained. QuoteThis will be sent within 48 hours.Regerds,Security2.435 Euro are still at my account and betcoin has cheated me out of the amount. Any ideas if there is anything else I can do? Thank you for your help.",

AFAIK --by \"as far\", I mean I was just closing my google searches to learn about it-- sportsbet providers detect arbit bettor by crossreferencing their data with fellow bookies. I don't think it's something any provider would like to share freely without getting a backlash from their fellow bookies.Although, I have to say that the burden of showing proof does fall to Betcoin.AG. OP shared their betting history --not a screenshot, though-- and one certain telltale of arbit betting was an unrounded number placed as a bet --$12.34, €72.19 as opposed to $12 or €75, for instance-- and although OP can intentionally rounded their number to hide the suspicion, it'll be nice if betcoin could give something more than what can basically summed to, \"we're right, you're wrong. Our decision is final. Bye.\"",
