The criminals will still see ways to do their work.",

Lots of all kinds of things there.Quote from: The Cryptovator on December 01, 2023, 10:08:23 PM.... So everyone would get the services from there, but it will be hard since Mixer won't offer any affiliates for that.  They would be forced to create affiliate programs since there are no more bitcointalk signature campaigns. In fact, I think I have seen some mixers with affiliate programs.Also, just because Bitcointalk has banned signature campaigns for mixers does not mean an end to them on the clearnet. There are sites like Quora, Reddit, guru99.com, YouTube, Yahoo Finance etc",

It doesn't make sense for North Korea to have so talented hackers, even if they are protected by the government, it still doesn't make sense if we keep in mind the philosophy of that country.

There are tons of pirate websites in Russia and it looks like Russian government is more than open to allow someone to host something that has a negative impact or is against the US policy. It would be wiser to use Russian local host that will allow this but it wont' be easy to find if you don't understand Russian.Quote from: NotATether on December 02, 2023, 08:05:30 AMObviously, no links to dead mixers, no Sinbad or other darknet sites, only the mainstream mixers.It's a bold statement to say no Sinbad or other darknet sites.
