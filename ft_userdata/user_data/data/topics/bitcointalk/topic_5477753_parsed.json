Scammers are always everywhere with the high rate of unemployment and underemployment in the country. It is we that should know how to avoid scam. But if someone bring up anything about scam in a way to let people to be aware of some scam and how to avoid them, it is good.Still no matter how you bring up something like this, there are still people that are still scammed, likely because no one to let them know about such scam.Many times, humans are greedy and foolish. They will trust someone that they did not know, or someone they have not seen before and not knowing anyone that knows them. If we do not use our brain the way we can avoid scam, anyone can scam us at anytime.",
