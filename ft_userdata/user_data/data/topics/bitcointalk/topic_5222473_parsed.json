Tesla had an obsession with 3, 6 and 9, and referred to \"vortex mathematics\", which relates to what the OP is doing with those numbers. Einstein of course... you should have all learnt from your institutional schooling. I won't agree or disagree with posts like the OP as giving this much weight to numbers is indeed paying too much to pseudosciences.

This stuff is way above my pay grade and I would never take the time to compute these things but I do find some of them rather fascinating. I do like seeing power numbers like 555 , but other than that I'm not too familiar with the science, although I do think it is very interesting to your point of the nadi using this to hide their agenda in plain sight. Maybe I need to keep more of an eye out for these things....",
