  "content": "We have an option on this forum to put our bitcoin address in our profile in special field. Recently, I was viewing some threads and reading posts in Reputation and Scam accusation sub-boards and saw that sometimes accounts with high reputation were getting hacked and hackers were using their reputation as an advantage and lying user(s) about payment address. I don't have high hopes that I'll ever see not only Bitcointalk's new software but new design too but still wanna give a try whether anyone supports my idea or not.What do you think about Wallet Address verified badge? Let me explain it well:1. You put your address in Bitcoin Address field and also put your address in Stake your Bitcoin address here and sign a message. There will be some moderators who will confirm your address and signed message and permit you verified badge next to Bitcoin Address field. This means that it's your address and when someone trades with you, they won't have to check your past posts and dig deep to determine whether it's actually you or not. If user wants to change address, they have to sign a message from old address and include a new address into that message and sign a new message from new address too.I think there are two good options: 1. It will be optional for everyone and 2nd, users who want to post in certain boards like Goods, will be required to have Bitcoin Address verified badge. We may provide them with tutorial.I think it sounds cool Idk if this thread should be in Meta or here, mods please move it if it doesn't belong here.",

      "body": "Imo it will encourage members to rely on mods and not do their own research which is dangerous because they do not learn the skills or importance of research but it does not prove any thing. A verified address means you have verified it belongs to the member but it does not mean they will not scam and could give a false sense of security. It is a privacy concern because some members might not want people knowing their address and by requiring them to post it on their profile and verify to post in marketplace requires them to give up data they do not want too.  I do not think this should be added to the forum.",

      "body": "Address verification serves no purpose at all. Staking Bitcoin address was used as a way if one is the original owner of the account or not, but it doesn't stop the person from scamming.This guy for example was highly trusted by the collectibles community and even staked his bitcoin address here, but it did not stop him from scamming lots of members here.Bitcoin address verification badge would mean the mods and admins would start moderating scam, where they have been clear in the past that they don't.",

I do have address (actually 2 addresses) staked, still, when I want to do things, I usually do on completely different addresses so I don't reuse that much. Would that make me a scammer? I hope not  2. Knowing the fact from point 1, nobody stops a hacker (especially the hacker of a long inactive account) remain with this badge and still use a different address.3. One can make a new account and stake his address and might be (wrongly) seen as reputable.So.. I think that this kind of badge would not help. It could even mislead. The proper rules for engaging in trading on the forum are:* Read carefully all trust feedback no matter who made it, then decide for yourself.* Make proper use of reputable escrows.* Avoid impersonation by avoiding other messaging platforms and by using and requesting signed messages (and here the staked address will help).I think that this is more appropriate for Meta.",
