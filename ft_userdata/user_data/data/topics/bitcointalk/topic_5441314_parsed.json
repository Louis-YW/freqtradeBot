You can continue to use Windows OS to interact with Bitcoin wallet and that's your choice, but if you're concerned about security, it's better to stay with Linux OS. You can't neglect the security of your assets if it is dear to you.Friends don't give bad advice. Moreover, as you say, they all switched to Linux OS themselves. This is an occasion to think, maybe you should use their example.If you enjoy using Windows OS, then keep doing it. No one is forcing you to completely change to Linux OS. You just need to use Linux OS to work with Electrum. This can be done on a separate PC or a separate drive. It is also possible to install Linux on a flash drive. There is a ready-made solution Tails OS, which tranthidung suggested above. A bunch of Tails OS on a flash drive + hardware wallet = you get security and keep your old habits with Windows.",

Security?As tranthidung already said, maybe because most people use windows and most hacking tools are made for windows. Linux OS is targeted less by hackers. Still, you have to be careful. I don't use Linux yet because I don't know if I will be able to use all the software on a different OS that I am currently using. I can easily find free software for my Windows platform. Surely There must be similar software for the Linux platform as well. But, I have to learn new things. Because of this fear, I never tried Linux OS. But, hacking, phishing increasing day by day. You have to be careful before you click on anything. I don't know if I will move to Linux or not. Maybe I have to.",

It is better you use cold wallet instead of online wallet, use online wallet for the amount of coins that you can afford to lose.

Hackers know that Windows is a most famous operation system and they spend most of their time to build malicious things on Windows.I have seen this in many places before and I do not doubt it again that Linux is most hacked among computer operating system.This is another example which is true: Quote from: http://library.palcomtech.com/pdf/6105.pdfLinux is the most popular choice for hackers due to its flexibility, open source platform, portability and command line interface and compatibility with popular hacking tools. Windows is a required, but dreaded target for most hackers because it requires them to work in Windows-only environments.But Linux OS is open source and there is no computer OS that can not be hacked, if you know the simple way to avoid hack, you are 100% fine. No computer OS is even safe among them all if you want to have bigger amount, get a cold wallet or hardware wallet.",

Once I have my new Linux distro set up and running as I like it, it tends to continue to run smoothly with little to no issues. My limited experience with Windows is that it will often automatically apply updates or new software packages you didn't ask for, reboot when you didn't want it to, then run in to some problem installing the new packages, have to roll it back, reboot a few more times, and throw a few errors in the process.",

Sure, most important advantage is that Linux is open source, they don't spy on you like wiNd0ws, and there are not so many malware made for Linux os.That means you won't have to use any antivirus software, and you will generally be safer with anything related with Bitcoin and crypto wallets.

There should not be any qualitative difference when it comes to running your wallet over Windows or Linux, the difference is that Linux is a safer and more robust OS than Windows, if you are unwilling to give up the convenience of Windows the solution is easy, install Linux in a laptop you may not be using, a fully updated Linux can be made to run under very low specifications as long as you know what you are doing, and in this way you can keep your main computer running Windows while your coins are more secure in a wallet installed under Linux.",
