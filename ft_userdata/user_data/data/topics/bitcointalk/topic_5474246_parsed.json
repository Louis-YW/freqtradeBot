  "content": "Hello, I am looking for a wallet I think I had back a few years ago. Looking for those magic numbers and I found a couple of hundred. I am copying the 64 characters after these numbers I noticed that hundreds of them have code beginning with D03 and ending in 47. Is this normal for a wallet? Or is it a macbook thing?",

Is this wrong? I'm afraid I don't totally understand.",
