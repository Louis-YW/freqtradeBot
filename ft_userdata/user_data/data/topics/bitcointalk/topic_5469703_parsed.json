It seems they have been in business for a while so they haven't created a new company as 'S21 approver' https://www.rebuildingsociety.com/s21-approval-service/I read complaints about the support team and the slow response to this service, which appears to be a lending service, but they seem to have a long history since 2016.",

Not necessarily for the market, because the price did not react. It's been dead at $200 for months. Strange.There has been a lot of negative news lately and I was afraid that other EU countries would slowly ban binance. But it turns out the problem of banning Binance was temporary and binance is about to solve all issues by creating many platforms for any jurisdiction that causes problems e.g. binance.nl or binance.de or binance.eu and everything will return to normal. The special version of Binance for US customers - binance.us - has been working well for a long time",

Binance would have to restrict its services to only the ones that are approved by the UK regulator. Services like Gift Cards referral bonuses will not be available to Binance customers in the UK but other services will be available.

However, the new Financial Promotions (FinProm) by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will redirect UK users to a new website different from the general Binance platform.  This new website is to ensure that only services approved by the UK government will be offered on this new website.",

Buying us as an exchange has been at the forefront of several Court battles. I see them as an honest organisation who wants to do the right thing so it is a positive sign for them launching a UK domain. I expect all the countries to very soon ask crypto exchange organization operating in within their shores to used their own custom domain names. This could be part of the citizens protection act. To encourage their citizens to have more trusts I'm these exchanges. Anyways, I think more gives more room for dada mining.",

It is encouraging to see that Binance is taking proactive measures to align with new UK financial promotion rules. Regulatory compliance is of utmost importance for long term success of cryptocurrencies. I have used Binance over six years, and based on my experience with this exchange, I can attest that it is one of the top exchanges of the world, offering long range of listed coins, large number of trading pairs, and outstanding customer service. Hopefully, Binance will maintain its high standard of service for its users in coming months and years.",

      "body": "I think this is good, I also would love to see binance.us to prosper and they find a way to deal with BUSD once again. That was a good stablecoin and they did alright, if USDT can stay and nobody cares about it, then it is weird that BUSD can't stay. USA didn't do anything about USDT or stopped them, they could have if they wanted to and they did an investigation as well but at the end of the day they didn't do it, I do not understand why that was.I think it's quite important to realize that you are going to end up with something that is a bit biased. If you bow down to USA then they let you exist, if you do not do it and put your company headquarters there or pay your full taxes there, then they will ban you like they did to Binance. UK is a good step, we need it everywhere else.",

Therefore, I believe that Binance will seek to gain the government's trust by submitting to the regulations related to KYC and AML.",
