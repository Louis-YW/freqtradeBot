  "content": "Football is back and so are the punters. I was checking my Twitter when I came across this tweet by a very popular, self-acclaimed sports lover and a serial winner in Football Betting. In his tweet, he promised to make millionaires out of his followers this season. What caught my attention though was the advice to his followers. He wrote:Choose 2 reliable punters and ignore others.Donâ€™t be a Gambler be a calculative winner.I'll add the last advice which as seen on his profileDonâ€™t play games you donâ€™t understand.Winning requires strategies that would work effectively and efficiently. I believe some users on this forum are looking to win big this season from their betting. My question to you is, can you kindly share your online football betting strategies to beat the bookies this season?Source",

But the football forum I once joined is full of punters who could look at teams who are winning against another. Somehow these punters can give clues. But you're right, it's best that you know the game like a fan so you are not just watching to gamble.",

Every little bit helps. The more luck points you got, the better winning chances youâ€™ll have.Without luck, any other strategy is worthless. After you boost your luck stats, you may even try using martingale. It will probably work this time. :d",

You'll agree with me one day when you use all the strategies you can think of but at the end of the day you see Arsenal beating Bayern Munich 3 to nil ðŸ˜‚ what's more painful than seeing small odds being trash by bigger odds? All I'm trying to say is that strategy doesn't play out always. Gamble what you can afford to lose. If it favor you then fine and if it backfire then you won't be regretting.",

It remains my best and favourite sport even when it comes to sports betting. My strategy remains as it has always been which is - keep your betting slips short & simple so you have a better chance at winning when you stake a good amount rather than betting on many games and expecting to be lucky with all, you can yes...but you reduce your chances at winning.",

Same with Basketball today, since GSW wins almost all the time, people bet on this team without analysis of opponent team. Call it a strategy still.

Although even with such small coefficients there are surprises, constant monitoring of the form of the clubs can reduce them to a minimum.For a smaller stake, a combination of up to 3-4 events often served me very well, where I bet exclusively on the options - both teams score a goal or a combined total of goals in handball or basketball. I proved to myself that it's not just a matter of luck, but also how well you can assess the current state of the clubs playing against each other, and that you need to increase your chances of winning as much as possible by betting on as few matches as possible.",

My question to you is, can you kindly share your online football betting strategies to beat the bookies this season?My winning strategy in football has always been good though so many bettors find it difficult to believe even after letting them know the best way to win big. In sports betting (football) Rollover has been my favorite way to win because I take calculated risks then I accumulate my odds with big teams especially when they are on top of the league with good form and less injury crisis and fatigue. For example, I select one big team from each league may be up to five teams then I can decide to get 3odd from the five big teams depending on the option I want to choose then stake with any amount I want to stake with.Note, options like direct home or away win is a red flag to me during my roll over so I either go with a handicap or play on goals when the big teams are playing against the underdogs or small teams with big odds. You can choose the home team to score one goal in the halftime or home team to score 1.5 goals full-time in a match involving a big team and a smaller team depending on the form of the teams.",

Teams play more conservatively and tactically to avoid making errors. All of which contribute to lower point totals. This trend could apply to NFL, MLB, NBA and european football. Another strategy is watch for polarization between home and road games. Some teams do better on the road. They have less distractions and less pressure not playing in front of their family and friends in a home game. Which translates to better performance.Some sports gambling strategy derives from observation and perception. There are patterns that emerge. Which can be consistent over time.",
