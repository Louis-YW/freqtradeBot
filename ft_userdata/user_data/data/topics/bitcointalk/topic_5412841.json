It's a superimposed solution for a problem that didn't exist in the first place so you might want to be less pompous when marketing it.this is not limited to a low poly file but any objects and if the devs deliver on the whitepaper features this could extend to any physical object with a fixed shape, fingerprints, face recognition, sounds etc.I agree those technologies have existed for a long time but in my opinion all in silo. With this technology you can scan a real life object and bring this into digital format on the 3DP blockchain. Due to some scanning being involved you would also not have any copycats in theory. Currently bringing objects into the metaverse is limited to you designing it yourself on a software or purchasing it. Think about this application you purchased a beautiful painting whilst on holiday. You now scan this painting and put it on the 3DP blockchain. You import into the metaverse and anyone who tries to upload this painting will get blocked due to the similarity.I think the application would be above just NFTs. I mean you have a lot of traffic in the metaverse and I think it would only be natural to have a highway for real life objects into the metaverse. In my opinion this highway will be 3DPass.I don't think it is a superimposed problem. Humans like to flex their wealth and I think it would reasonable to assume that if the metaverse takes off that people would want to also flaunt their real life assets on the metaverse with the assurance of not having any duplicates. One challenge which hasn't been solved yet from the project is the proof of ownership since in theory any who scans something first would be the owner.I added the ANN thread to make it transparent. What I really want to emphasise is that I discovered this project from the ANN and have been fascinated by it since then.",

Anyway, the project is superb and having additional features could be a game changer for this too. first of all thanks for constructive feedback and please post your suggestions in the ANN thread. I know the devs see this as a community driven project and any proposal get's a response either on the ANN thread or active discord community. A feature that I proposed for the recognition of 2D drawings will be included in the future. The other possibility would be to develop any ideas into a dApp to generate those additional features. NFT is the way to grab everyones attention but my thoughts are that I see this tech as more of a highway from the real world into the digital world. Just look at the amount of hype with the metaverse and if there was a tech that could be the gatekeeper of this highway with respect to originality etc. Currently for the ecosystem I have only ever thought about sales but maybe there is something I am overseeing.",

Why not add your expertise as a community driven project to increase the security from such cheap duplicates? I encourage you to directly interact with the devs in the ANN thread or in Discord they are very responsive.I know that when I’m currently mining I get a few rejects because the shape I’m trying to add to the blockchain already exists. I guess it would be impossible to stop people from remodeling but the catch should be to force them to make a significant enough change that it is easy to spot with the naked eye. This would also be one of the first things I would try to see how much alteration I need for it to get accepted on the 3DPass blockchain as an original. For example if I have a baguette and cut it in half would it differentiate the full and half size Version.Also think about simple 2D items/drawings the recognition algorithmi should work quite well here.",

Of course anyone can try and generate a 3D file but humans love Shortcuts and if you have an app that can do this for you the majority of people would use this.This is more than an NFT gimmick as this is just one application but another application as stated in the whitepaper is “ Password, recoverable by means of scanning the object”Imagine having a particular item of extreme importance that only you know plus your fingerprint being your password. This would mean that only you can recover it and it would be difficult for anyone to hack since you probably don‘t even need to write it down to remember. Just have to make sure the item doesn‘t get thrown away.I think with a bit of creativity the application will be much more than just NFTs. Just to add I still think the 3DPass NFTs will be the next evolution for NFTs in general with respect to uniqueness and not having copycats on the 3DPass blockchain due to the recognition algorithm.",

You would need whole new approach.My thinking on the ownership topic is that you have the option for a multi Hash ID consisting of multiple items.The whitepaper quotes the following “ • Hash 1 = object shape + weight + clarity• Hash 2 = 1st object shape + 2nd object shape + owners iris scan • Hash 3 = object shape + weight + owner’s fingerprint “So yes maybe someone has the copy but I’m guessing the original could come with an additional certificate etc.Similar to how 2 factor authentication works but maybe now 3 or 4 factor authentication.You could also develop dApps/websites as an authenticity check etc since we are talking about a permissionless coin. The framework is there to develop the required ecosystem around it potentially?Feel free to join the discord or the ANN thread and share your concerns or other feedback.",
