      "body": "Mh experience with the halving is that there's a whole bunch of marketing around it while in reality the impact on real life transactions with Bitcoin isn't that large. At least for a while we're going to realize that any potential positive impact might've been priced in. And then maybe after a few months only then large buyers might feel the impact on OTC markets. This halving comes at a time.whetr mining has been happening at an industrial scale. So these mibers have probably found ways to offload their BTC long before the halving and have taken into account it's impact on their profitability. The increase in price that happened prior to the halving probably allows them to continue mining for longer in profit but who knows for how long. More centralization in mining could eventually lead to a bigger drive to offload BTC faster too. Which might mean that probably might even go down after the halving.",

No one will have been able to predict that we have an ATH before the halving.This Bitcoin halving is different - institutional investors, and others. Therefore the belief of price increase after the halving is merely speculation. Bitcoin Runes which is being launched on the Block 840,000, following the Bitcoin halving is one of the causes for this increase in transaction fee. This is rationale is what I read from this article on coingecko. This is my first experience of the halving since the runes are responsible for this and it bothers me that in the next halving there are going to be others similar to runes that cause high transaction fees because of whatever they'll be minting.",

      "body": "Before halving the price increases because of the expectation in the market of the Bitcoin Halving hoping that it is going to be a huge trigger for the Bullrun, then the market is going to drop most of the time in the Bitcoin halving itself, I guess it is just because a lot of smart traders is already taking profit from the price increase before the halving they are already expecting for the market price to pump on Halving so a lot of traders are already ready to exit at that time. It wasn't really a trap when the market price dropped I guess, since its also an opportunity for a lot of traders to make a profit or enter the market again.Halving doesn't necessarily mean the price is going to increase, in theory since it will affect the supply it should have the price increase effect considering there might be a huge delay in its effect, wait for the network and market to stabilize at least to see its effects. I remember there might be some huge selling on Bitcoin as well due to the mining taking profit, also we could expect a lot of miners is not going to be able to make a profit on it, so they might stop mining and sell some Bitcoin or probably make some return to continue operating.",

Actually i have been able to see or witness that 2-4th cycle halving with Bitcoin on which i could say that there's nothing something new.It is really just that people are really that anticipating for these following things in regarding on such event;1. Extreme dump/correction2. Sudden news fundamentals3. Total random movementI dont really see something that interesting on Bitcoin halving but one things for sure that this is the moment on which that bull run is near.Basing up into those previous cycles we would really be able to shoot up into the moon after 6-8 month post halving period. We dont really just that know on when it would happen on this 4th cycle of halving. We might be seeing another different scenario because of that ETF involvement integration? Lets see!",

It is very difficult for individuals to predict about the exit timing of bull season and nobody knows that how higher Bitcoin will go even they don't know that when price will elevates so higher to give them profit.",

I speak from my own past experiences watching and waiting for the halving's effect.  Some years, yes we've seen glorious bull runs follow halvings, yes.  But other times, alas, prices stagnated or even sank defying the hopeful forecasts and  who can claim to read the markets fickle mind? Wise souls speak in possibilities, not absolutes.  Neither euphoric dreamers nor scheming salesmen can promise what this halving will bring.  The future holds mystery, as always.  We mere mortals can but watch, wait and tend our courage as events unfold.Come what may, Bitcoin remains a grand experiment - halvings and all!",

      "body": "I think this pattern is still the same with the previous halving. First, after the halving, bitcoin will make a dump, and surely some investors will sell their holdings, which might cause a more dump in the market. But don't worry because after that dump, bitcoin will show a very good market movement, and I hope it touches $80k in the market. If the bitcoin price is more powerful, maybe it will reach $100k. Who knows? But anyway, lets wait to see what will happen now after the halving. I do hope it goes on because I'm planning to sell some of my holdings to invest in other projects, but still, the amount that will be left in my holdings is huge, so it's fine. How about the others? What will you do after this halving? This dump is a good opportunity to buy more bitcoin. It is risky, but we know how bitcoin proves itself, so we can just wait for the price to skyrocket again.",

Historical data says that each cycle is unique and has different conditions from the previous one. Therefore, do not expect a change to occur within 4 months. Perhaps the price explosion will be rapid, such that it occurs before the end of the year, or it may be slow, such that it extends to 2026, but in any case, we are supposed to break $100,000 by 2025.

So far it has never been a deception, what increases my confidence regards this current halving event as well. Many people are concerned and worried prices aren't rising so much yet, but we have to keep in mind halving's effects aren't overnight. It may take some weeks and few months until we see consistent progress.The only regret I have regards halvings is that I always wait too long until cashing out my profits, so once I see the bull run is already over and I have to wait for another cycle in order to cash out my Bitcoins into solid profits. In 2021, for an example, I though 69,000$ wasn't the limit, besides believing Bitcoin would remain expensive like that from that moment on. I was wrong, but now I hope to not repeat the same mistake in this bull run of 2024.",

Bitcoin price movement momentum after the halving or before the halving is uncertain. I once read information related to this when a member shared it on the forum, but unfortunately, I forgot about the thread.There is no specific time frame to see bull run momentum after the halving occurs. but many believe the market scheme will not be much different. what is certain is that it could come sooner or later. but what we see is that the decline that occurred was not that significant before the halving or even after the halving occurred. we are shown Bitcoin is quite strong for now. there may also be an effect of the recent increase in transaction fees.",

It seems you are talking about the price here OP and you are really precise that we will talk about the exact day of the Bitcoin block halving, as even in previous Bitcoin halvings of Bitcoin, nothing really important events or dumps/pumps during the exact day of Bitcoin block halving so for me, it's kinda a normal day.

I guess this is the most speculated halving ever. A lot of people's eyes on it and companies as well. We were assuming that Bitcoin will behave just like how it behaved previously, but the history has changed. Bitcoin broke the record and breaked it's previous ATH before the halving. I don't know if that ever happened before. We are at pre-bull run at this moment and I hope we will make another ATH this year.",
