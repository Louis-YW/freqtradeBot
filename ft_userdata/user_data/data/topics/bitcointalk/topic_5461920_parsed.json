      "body": "This another great thread that will surely be helpful for people who were looking for no KYC exchanges especially after Kucoin made it mandatory, as you said better use the exchanges more cautiously and better with a minimum deposit amount for a while which can help to mitigate the unnecessary confusion about their trust level.Has anyone been using Bitget regularly for trading purposes?Even though they there exists for years it only came to the spotlight after mysterious newbies are shilling for the exchange across the bitcoin talk in different topics, which kinda created a bad impression.",

The exchange regularly performs its functions, deposits and withdrawals of funds are credited there absolutely in the regular mode. Trade also goes without any claims. All the exchanges that are in this encyclopedia have been personally checked by me, also for financial relations.Your list = Your rules. As long as you monitor this CEXs and update the list, the choice is yours, but adding links or comments will help the user to form a general idea before searching.Quote from: Ratimov on August 03, 2023, 02:18:38 PMI now have 7 absolutely working OKX accounts and the limits have not been cut anywhere.Honestly, my experience with them is very biased, so I'm going to be a little harsh with them.Quote from: Oshosondy on August 03, 2023, 02:30:39 PMOn Huobi global, I was unable to trade derivatives until I was verified, although I was able to trade on their spot market.

Damn straight, and I think Kucoin was the last straw for a lot of people who want to transact on a strictly non-KYC exchange--and I give you props for researching all of this, Ratimov.How small, obscure, and/or shady are you going to get with this list?  There are exchanges like Yobit that have been KYC-less for years but aren't used by more savvy members who've been around long enough to know what the problems are.  And there are some oddball ones like Xeggex, Exchange-Assets, TradeOgre, and others that seem to cater to those who want to trade the shittiest of shitcoins and yet don't seem to have that many complaints.All of those instant exchanges are useful in some cases as well, though I don't know which ones are honeypots and which are legit.  Good luck, man!Edit:QuoteThe order of the list is based on coinmarketcap dataAh I missed that at first.  If you're only including exchanges included on CMC, you'll be missing a bunch.  I did notice SouthXchange wasn't included on your other page, and to my knowledge they aren't a KYC exchange and are listed on CMC.  Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.",

Between September 1 and October 1, users who have not completed level 1 KYC verification will still be able to deposit, withdraw, and trade normally.After October 1, users who have not yet completed level 1 KYC verification will only be able to withdraw, cancel orders, redeem subscriptions, and close positions, being restricted from creating new trading orders. Ensure you complete level 1 KYC verification as soon as possible.   Bitget team made several new changes for withdrawal limit too, both for KYC and non-KYC users. see full detail in their announcement article. https://www.bitget.com/support/articles/360053002431",

However, I contacted support yesterday, and they told me that until October 1st you can use the exchange without KYC with a daily limit of $20,000, so I see absolutely no point in removing this exchange from the list now.User will only be able to withdraw fund and trading will be restricted. This mean that only users having already fund will not loss their fund and can withdraw it without KYC but no usecase for new users because just depositing and withdraw make no sense If we cannot do any trade.",

I do not know if I am right or wrong but I noticed this when I an downloaded app with VPN. I use my email on play store and google knows the country that I am from. I noticed that because the default currency on the app is my local currency. If a countries government, the exchange and the app store like google can work together for something like this to happen, we can expect that.Another exampleMuum wallet will set your local currency as the default fiat currencyJust right now, I set VPN (paid VPN) to UK and I downloaded Muun wallet from google play store, I created a wallet and I check the local currency, I saw my local currency.I am not saying you should use Muun wallet because I do not know if it is good, I am just using it to tell you how those governments, app stores and the app you are using have much information about you from google.",
