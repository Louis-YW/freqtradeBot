  "content": "BTC users and linking them to their BTC addresses, violating the privacy of these users, according to a blog post from pseudonymous Bitcoin app developer 0xB10C. The entity has been active since March 2018, and its IP addresses have shown up on several public posts from Bitcoin node operators over the past several years.0xB10C is the developer of several Bitcoin analytics websites, including Mempool.observer and Transactionfee.info. They have also been awarded a Bitcoin developer grant from Brink.dev in the past.0xB10C calls the entity “LinkingLion” because the IP addresses associated with it pass through LionLink network’s colocation data center. However, ARIN and RIPE registry information reveal that this company is probably not the originator of the messages, according to 0xB10C.The entity uses a range of 812 different IP addresses to open connections with Bitcoin full nodes that are visible on the network (also called “listening nodes”). Once it opens a connection, the entity asks the node which version of the Bitcoin software it is using. However, when the node responds with a version number and message stating that it has understood the request, the entity closes its connection about 85% of the time without responding.According to the post, this behavior may indicate that the entity is trying to determine if a particular node can be reached at a particular IP address.Anyone know about this?",

      "body": "You should reference the original article from 0xB10C: LinkingLion: An entity linking Bitcoin transactions to IPs? Do dandelions help against lions?The Summarise:QuoteTo summarize, an entity frequently opens connections from multiple IP ranges to many nodes on the Bitcoin network. Some characteristics, like the fake user agents and the block heights that increase precisely every 10 minutes, confirm that the connections do not originate from some misconfigured Bitcoin node but are custom clients. About 20% of the connections are used to listen to transaction announcements, allowing the entity to link newly broadcast transactions to IP addresses. The same IP addresses connect to nodes on the Monero network too.Only a few details about the entity are known. The same IP ranges have been making connections since 2018 in some capacity. It’s unclear if the IP ranges are maybe endpoints of a VPN service. Similarly, if the entity is a single entity or a group of legal entities is unknown. The behavior could indicate financial motives. A possibility is a blockchain analysis company that wants to enrich its product with additional data. A short-term solution might be a banlist or reporting the entity’s behavior. Solving the root problem requires deeper changes to the P2P logic in bitcoin.Anyone who runs nodes can see whether LinkingLion is connected or not by running:Code:$ bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep -E '162.218.65|209.222.240|91.198.115|2604:d500:4:1'Quote from: CryptoSable on March 30, 2023, 03:03:58 AMviolating the privacy of these usersAnyone who have done bitcoin transaction without using their own node should expect that the transaction can be tracked, even without this LinkingLion thing. The solution for the users themselves is to simply run their own node, and currently, also using the mitigation ways as stated in the article to block the alleged LinkingLions' motive.",

Maybe it will be helpful but this will also be a chaos for those people who only eant their identity hidden. Government can't use this method as mentioned that it was a violation of privacy even they don't try to show it to public. This is one of the pros but the one I consider cons is that once their system is hacked, it's possible that those data might leak. There's many events that have the same scenario just like this. For example Facebook was sued for the same situation where the CEO of Facebook ( Mark Zuckerberg ) was in court. Recently I've also seen the TikTok CEO also having the same situation which he had to defend the privacy data of it's users.",

There are sites that have been doing it for years. THERE ARE OR WERE A FEW THINGS ON GITHUB THAT WOULD DO THIS. All nodes can find out about all other nodes. That is how BTC works.Part of me wants to report this thread, another wants it to stay up to fight FUD so there is real info out there.-Dave",
