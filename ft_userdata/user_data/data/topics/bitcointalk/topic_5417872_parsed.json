  "content": "Cratos($CRTS) is a V2E (Vote To Earn) cryptocurrency designed to facilitate citizen participation in the CRATOS mobile app, a real-time live vote platform, where users can generate a vote topic in her/his preference, and other users can participate in the vote. The demographic data will display immediately after voting. Users on the app can earn Cratos tokens based on their activities.Cratos DAO has been launched few days ago. The first proposal has been posted and is available for a vote. It would be a big step toward a community-oriented project.You can check it here.snapshot.org/#/cratos.ethBACKGROUNDWith Cratos token holders, Cratos will gradually become a fully decentralized organization. In other words, it is a community-owned/managed decentralized organization.We believe that there has been enough time to have sufficient holders from Cratos app users, token holders, etc and start operating DAO.Simply, DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization where a token holder can post any proposal regarding Cratos project and other holders can participate in a vote. The vote right is proportional to the amount of the Cratos token that an individual holds at the time of snapshot.At the initial stage of DAO, the Cratos team will be active to post a proposal to guide you on how it can be operated. And the team will strive to work on developing the project in the prospect of technology, ecosystem and business.In addition, DAO will enable us to have our community members become a part of the management team in a decentralized way.In the future, we will be implementing the auto-executable proposal so that at the end of the proposal, the proposal would be executed when it is approved by the community.",
