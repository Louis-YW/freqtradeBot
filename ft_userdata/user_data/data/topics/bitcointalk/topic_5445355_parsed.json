If all you do with your hardware wallet is receive coins and tokens then this is not for you, but if you have connect your hardware wallet to make some transactions before, please go back and revoke your wallet allowance. Visit https://revoke.cash and insert your wallet address, you don't need to connect your wallet for this check, make sure your wallet says No Allowance all through, if it says Unlimited Allowance that's dangerous, pls connect your wallet and revoke.

      "body": "If I understood correctly, then what is called \"wallet allowance\" has to do exclusively with tokens and NTFs, but that does not mean that someone can hack the hardware wallet in the literal sense to somehow get hold of your seed and empty all your accounts. This matter has nothing to do with hacking the wallet, but with the stupid permissions you give to individual apps that you have installed on the same device.",

The user needs to learn how to safely handle their devices.They can also connect their Ledger hardware wallet to their full node on bitcoincore for added security.- Jay -",

If all you do with your hardware wallet is receive coins and tokens then this is not for you, but if you have connect your hardware wallet to make some transactions before, please go back and revoke your wallet allowance. This is nonsense, and I never saw a single case of hardware wallet being hacked remotely, it's almost impossible to happen, especially in scenario you described.Someone can potentially hack your hardware wallet only if they take it away from you, and that is questionable if you have good security practice with passphrases and multisig setup.Holding coins in hot wallet is never safe, and shitcoins are mostly worthless waste of time and I wouldn't buy hardware wallet for them, but only for bitcoin.",

      "body": "I do not think, that hardware wallet can be hacked and never heard about that.First of all, for any potential hacking attempt - also via Web - hardware wallet must be in Windows, Linux, BSD, Solaris Operation System. But hardware wallets are not in popular computer OS formats - in Windows, Linux, BSD, and Solaris OS, so hacker can not use/make any software. For example, Ledger hardware wallet use custom BOLOS OS. ( https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/our-custom-operating-system-bolos ). Second - if hardware wallet do not have OS - hacker need manufacturer software for hardware wallet firmware. But of course, hackers do not have specific manufacturer software for wallet firmware.So hardware wallets are safe. Most popular are - Ledger https://www.ledger.com/ and Trezor https://trezor.io/.",

      "body": "Inserting cryptocurrency addresses, especially those containing funds, is rather a dangerous move because the website may collect it, associate it with your IP address, and share this information with third parties, including criminals and law enforcement agencies. If they manage to find out who those funds belong to, they can come and knock on your door, attack you with 5$ wrench, make you unlock the device, and take away your precious hardware wallet. That would be a more realistic scenario than someone hacking your hardware wallet remotely because you forgot to revoke access from some cryptocurrency applications. These can only manipulate the information stored on the blockchain or in smart contracts, but it is infeasible for them to steal information stored offline inside a secure chip.",

So what's the point of buying a hardware wallet like Trezor if it can still be hacked just like a software wallet?",

Nothing we have is safe, be it online wallet or hardware wallet, until we keep our wallet password safe. If you saved the hardware wallet but did not keep the seed phrase safe then your wallet will have no value. So everything we do needs a safe haven. And whenever we can create a safe haven, everything will be safe for us.",

And to be honest, OP I did not know there was an easy way to hack it. Maybe your information isn‚Äôt completely accurate. How you can you hack a wallet when it is unconnected to the internet ? And what‚Äôs the point of getting it if it‚Äôs not safe?In my opinion, if you keep your private key and password in a safe place, then it will be pretty difficult to get hacked .¬† Moreover, there are more safe ways and secure such as bitcoincore, Electrum. For me, I would prefer saving my crypto in hardware wallet like Trezor, Ledger, safepal and Ellipal tiran than online or software wallets. It is too risky to keep all your balance in them to be honest. And again never share your private key to anyone and your password must be strong and saved in a safe place too.",
