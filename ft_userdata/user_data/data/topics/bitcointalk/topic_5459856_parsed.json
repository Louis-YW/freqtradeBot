The signature code is no different from someone wearing a company's cap in their head and waking up and doing their day-to-day business. Just by wearing that cap alone and people seeing it, you are already creating awareness.Â But the signature space is not just for advertising casinos or other projects; it can also be used for personal write-ups, where you can add anything you want about anything you want people to know about providing that it don't have a phishing link on it and nothing against the forum rules can be finds on them.",

      "body": "The explanation above is correct and I also agree with the signature is not all about promoting companies to attract people to the company but also other things like giving warning to other forum members, promoting a charity or whatever you want to write in your signature space. Well, crypto casinos starting a signature campaign here in the forum is what as you have reasoned with which is to attract gamblers and signatures are displayed here in the forum with each post a forum member made except on boards that doesn't allow signatures to display.",

It it is that I don't understand your sentences. From the time being though i am not regular because of my work, signature space is for advertisement whether you insert personal information there, you are advertising the texts be a link or writing, you are advertising the project. The signature space is meant for advertisement and the avatar also is meant for advertisement as well. There was a time I wanted to advertise a project free in the signature space but I could not because I was a newbie and I think that was early this year.",

As far as I know, there are crypto casino signature campaigns that let their participants include their personal referral link to the casino in the signature they wear.",

Some people come to this forum without creating an account, and on their visit, they could just read through some comments, and if by chance they come across the signature that members are putting on, they might feel tempted to just click it, which can take them to the platform. So, those signatures you see are not only resized images; they also have links in them. Some people can just be browsing on the search engine, and they can stubble unto the BTT forum; that's the essence of the signature; it's not only for members of the forum.",

Where,The signatures carries unique codes or links that redirects you to the site while, the avatar is just some eye catchy icon or logo of the site. Both plays roles in ensuring patronage for the site and in most cases, its been heping many projects. The contest comes in, in what the projects have got to offer.",

So, you can open a thread there and share the details of your website; monthly visitors, niche and audience. If a company finds it suitable for their products they can hit you up.",

Promotion to increase activity / buying and selling within the companyMost companies carry out promotions for this purpose2. Promotion so that the brand is always known and becomes a habit for everyoneBig companies do this, like google, youtube, facebook, and twitter. Even though almost everyone already knows their brand, they always advertise so that their brand becomes a habitWhat's more interesting than the signature campaign is peeking into the wallets of the participants...",

Already other forum members gave you much informative replies and hope you got your answer. I want to add something like Signature campaigns are not only to promote a website ads or links but also their main features In a short or why they should be choosed. In this forum we all are basically related to crypto and that's why it's the most perfect place to ad crypto or gambling related projects. But you can surely put any other links what you want if it maintain forum rules. Quote from: Nwada001 on July 14, 2023, 10:11:55 PMYou are reasoning correctly based on how I understood your statement. The signature code is no different from someone wearing a company's cap in their head and waking up and doing their day-to-day business. Just by wearing that cap alone and people seeing it, you are already creating awareness.I find similarities with Avatar what is like wearing a company's cap and promote their logo or website. But Signature code promotes more information than a cap about the project like their main feature and obviously some useful links. So it is like wearing a Company's T-shirt and the perfect signature campaign indicates both Avatar and Signature code though avatar isn't not mandatory in every time.",

Because basically forum members who have applied to a signature campaign, and are accepted into the signature campaign. They are tasked with implementing the advertisement for the company that is holding the signature campaign, and are assigned to write quality posts, the number of which is determined according to the rules of the signature campaign.QuoteWhen someone starts a signature campaign for an online crypto casino, the goal is to attract people to the casino through the signature, am I reasoning correctly?Yes, all of that is true. Because as I explained above, the signature campaign in this BTT forum is for advertising a company or project, using written media or posts (discussions) by BTT members who are accepted in the campaign as a form of advertising or promotion.",
