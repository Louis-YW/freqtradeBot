I learnt my lesson although I was not asking for sponsorship instead I was inviting people to join a campaign. By the way, if by accident you get temp ban then Poker Payer will red tag you for getting banned, he started this new trend. Hopefully this piece of information will alert you to keep your account safe for getting banned and the receive a red tag by Poker Player.Quoteinstead thanked me for giving you the idea to start your own Games and Rounds threadI need to confirm you that, it was not your idea. When a project starts working with me, I give them a detailed promotion plan (exclusive for my clients). So the idea was already there and it was only the time to be executed. Have you seen Sinbad launches their price perdition regularly? If you were posting one before them then I guess you would say that they got the idea from you and to thank you. Like I said, the plan is already in place. There will be many in the future you will see they and my other clients will execute. It's one of the additional responsibility I show for my clients, not just stop it only by managing the signature campaign.For the record 4CryptoBet informed me that you offered them to sponsor the lottery. First I said yeah as him to title sponsor it and post a banner of 4CryptoBet. Then I asked them instead of sponsoring your event they can post one for themselves.So I hope this response from me gave you some important idea and warning.1. You could be reported for sending unsolicited PM for advertising. Even since I do not stand along with you, if I was enemy minded to you then I would suggest them secretly to report your PM so that I feel better to see you ban. No, I am not that kind. 2. If you were reported and banned accidentally then Poker Player would tag you for that. By not getting banned you saved your trust page from a red tag. Again do not send unsolicited pms.3. It was not your idea at all, there are no need to feel something was taken from you. No, it was not. When I get a campaign, I give my clients a long term promotion planning and this topic and other you see from my clients are part of that marketing strategy.",

The \"decent\" thing to do is to speak about this on a private level, we didn't harm, or disrespect you in any kind of way . We are new casino aiming to grow and blossom on this forum and you're publicly bad mouthing, and for what? We do not owe you any explanations regarding our business decisions. But for all those interested, we have hosted this event on our socials a few times already (check out our Twitter page), and as our campaign manager stated, we also discussed different promotional ideas for the brand long before you contacted us. We actually were considering sponsoring your event as well. But we were still discussing the details. We are a business and we receieve many proposals. Please think carefully before you make such a move next time. Good luck to you.",
