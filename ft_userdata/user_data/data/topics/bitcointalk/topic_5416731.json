Buying and selling accounts were highly discouraged on the forum, perhaps DT members will put a negative tag on your account because of this.It is forum rule #18 [ https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0 ].",

Eh? For what reason, is there a bet/reward for it? Or what benefits it will give for you or to your friend?Having an old account doesn't mean you have broader knowledge regarding bitcoin/crypto (you can learn now and brag it to anyone). It doesn't mean you're the original owner too (well, you are here for that reason too). But yeah, you can be called OG's as old members. Well, can't help it, anyone have their reasons. Friendly advice, just don't let anyone know or else that account will be ruined.",

If you know someone that has that wants to sell or give away an old one they dont use. Please send me a message.Then correct your Subject (topic). QuoteWant old Bitcoin account  There is different between Bitcoin account and bitcointalk account. Â Bitcoin account is also known as bitcoin wallet which is like the normal wallet we used in keeping or storing cash, but bitcoin account is for online storing of fund or coins.While bitcointalk account is the bitcoin forum account here which is used to discuss the development, projects, and others activities on bitcoin so if you are looking for bitcoin account, it is not possible unless you can get it from your best friend that he or she is not using it again. But if you are looking for old Bitcointalk account, people have given you the options to choose. Either you buy a copper member or you post quality post to rank up. Though you might see someone selling it but it is not the best.",

It is great that you are trying to use an old account. I can provide an old account which has been created in 2009 the username of the account is 420-420 and the password is the same as the username. Please send me tips for the account to my wallet.Do you not think it is one kind of crime instead of fun??",

Lying to your friends isn't.Anyway, the proper way to prove ownership of Bitcoin is by signing a message from an address that was funded a long time ago. Many of them are leaked, so there you can find great new ways to lie to your friends.Or just go full retard and claim you're Satoshi, some idiots get quite famous doing this.",
