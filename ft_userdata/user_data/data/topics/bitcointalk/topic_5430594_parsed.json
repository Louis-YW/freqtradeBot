Despite this we are still growing strong and thriving. I dont think most traders are still strong or survived üòÅ. Even the institutions got rekt like 3AC, Celcius, etc. But yeah, BTC will make a comeback anyways.Quote from: alastantiger on December 20, 2022, 04:57:21 PMAs you reflect on your trading journey so far as the year comes to an end, what did you do that so significantly enhanced your trading that you wished you could have done it earlier?I learnt that the TA guys are full of nonsense, fundamentals are more important than technicals. And the \"funding rates strategy\" kept on scamming traders since 60k, (negative = long, positive=short). Now I always follow main twitter accounts like elon musk, CZ, saylor, etc. Their actions on twitter move the markets and liquidates short term traders pretty fast if they just follow TA lol. And avoid trading during FOMC meetings or CPI data announcements.",

      "body": "It is certainly true that the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, has experienced significant volatility and a bear market this year. However, it is important to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is influenced by a variety of factors, including regulatory developments, market sentiment, and the general economic climate, all of which can impact the price. Depending on what type of trader you are, this can be a good thing. For some traders, a bear market can present opportunities to buy crypto at lower prices with the expectation that the prices will eventually recover. In other words, even though most traders would not wish to experience a bear market while they are trading, they can actually still benefit from them.That being said, it is important to prepare yourself for a brand new year in the cryptocurrency world by learning how market trends affect the price of your favorite coins. If you know what you're doing and plan accordingly, even the toughest bear markets can provide opportunities to buy low and sell high.",

But here it is\"Trade your plan, not your PnL\"I know it is tempting to see the percentage you gain upon executing the trade, however if a trader based his decision on the profit/loss he sees on the screen, then there is a chance you will miss an opportunity or suffer a significant loss. Perhaps try turning off the PnL indicator?",

Currently, bitcoin is still stagnant at $16k-$17k and trying to recover, if there is no external disturbance from FUD and other negative sentiments it might continue to increase.",

We can still learn a lot from the current situation because market conditions have not changed for the better and we can start investing in bitcoins if we find it difficult to trade as usual. It may be more profitable because you don't need to analyse too much and only focus on buying bitcoin at low prices. But remember to control greed because it will be bad if we forget to control it.",

This way I got chances to double my trading capital. If I am capable of predicting the ATH earlier than I might have got chances to triple my capital.Bitcoin trading needs lots of knowledge and right decision making on accurate timing.
