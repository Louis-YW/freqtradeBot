However, due to certain technical issues, the listing of the second largest meme coin by market cap has so far been postponed. The exchange promised to list Shiba Inu \"very soon.\"Well a new listing on an exchange is always a good thing in general, but i really doubt that this news will have any impact on the price of Shiba Inu. I mean Shiba Inu is a top 20 coin in terms of marketcap (i don't know why it has such high market cap but it is how it is) and therefore it is already listed on the biggest exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Huobi, Kraken, Kucoin, Gate.io and so on, so the news that it will be also listed on an exchange that i have never heard of before is really nothing special anymore. I don't know about the regulations in the phillipines but maybe that could not legally buy Shiba Inu before because they had to use other exchanges from other countries to do that?",

TBH, people use this exchange for converting their Bitcoin to fiat including me because it's easy and very convenient to use but considered a wallet or store your asset in a long term, never.",

Coins.ph is the most popular wallet in the country, its just like Revolut or Coinbase in US. I use to like it since it's easy to use and cash out crypto. The company however plays trick after every bullrun because they suspend withdrawals or prevent you from converting your BTC to local currency.",
