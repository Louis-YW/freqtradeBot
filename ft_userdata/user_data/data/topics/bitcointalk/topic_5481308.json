  "content": "Happy New Year and Welcome to 2024 guys, How are you doing? I hope you all are doing fine at your respective geographical locations. Alright. So there is this update that came into my mind recently, which I thought it will be of great value if I share it among this community of Bitcoin lovers, and that is \"How to generate a Bitcoin Transaction Statement\".

Hence, that brought the need why I came up with this thread, as a step-by-step guide to help whoever wishes to know how to generate a Bitcoin statement of account, showing all inflow and outflow of funds, same way it's been done with in our traditional banking system as a legal entity which could be used in the court of law if in case you happened to be mistakenly accused and been asked to provide a proof of your source of income, then it could be generated as a proof to show how you genuinely earn the money through your participation on our forum weekly signature campaign payment, or elsewhere. Because though in this part of the world where I come from, it's sad that people have this ideology that if a person is seen to be living a good financially free life and yet not have a physical job, that he/she is either into internet fraud (i.e Yahoo boy), of which most cases when investigated always end as false, as we have got digital skill whereby someone could be making huge money weekly while still at the comfort of his home e.g bitcointalk, digital marketing, affiliate marketing, e.t.c.

I would say the reason why something like this isn’t popular among bitcoin users is because many people do not have need for it. You see the reason why when we use bank accounts the others request for our bank statements is simply because they can’t access it since it is conceal to only you but bitcoin transactions are stored on public blockchain where everyone can see it as such if i need to see the transaction history of your address I will just request for it and check every transactions that had happened there. No need to print a statement and even if I need the statement too I will just do it myself. This is why it is not popular and the reason why you don’t know of it this years",

Literally was just about to say \"just take the transaction hash and screenshot it if you feel the need to\" until you showed us a really good way for you to generate transaction receipts that are (I would assume) legally binding. But honestly this is exceptionally helpful especially for people who would like to take out loans and perhaps even buy using fiat but couldn't prove that they are earning or capable of paying because most of their finances are in the crypto world. I had a few moments where the bank wouldn't even honor my loan request cause they think I can't pay for my shit, all because I couldn't present them transaction receipts that are legally binding.

I wonder from other people point of view, which one has less chance to expose/spread our pseudonymity? Using TXID and Signed Message or Transaction Statement? Yeah, this is helpful for people/projects that pay their employees in crypto, for people who would need to present a statement of account/transaction statements for loans and other financial hooblah, the likes. I can see this being more useful as we get more people onboard in the crypto craze, which will eventually render every company liable to pay their employees in crypto if they wish to, as well as marketplaces and brands that would need to present their buyers with a transaction receipt towards their purchases. All of these will take some time to be really useful but it's better to be prepared than actually just implement something like this when the whole world's already asking for it.",

Exactly with the QR code showing like this the blurring of the Bitcoin wallet address is just waste because just a scan of the code the address will show up. But I like the way the Op demonstrated the steps. It is very easy to understand. But before statement of an account is issue, there must be a dispute between two parties and Bitcoin transaction is not like that of fiat bank transaction that there is transaction failure. I have not encountered any transaction issue with Bitcoin. Though we don't know what will happen in the future so this steps can help by then.",
