I followed this simple guide: https://snapcraft.io/install/bitcoin-core/raspbian.My raspberry uses a micro sd as main memory, so I have no enough space. I mounted an external disk with enough space to store all the data.The question here is: how can I configure Core in order to use that external disk to save all the information?Note that I don't have a GUI, I connect to my raspberry using ssh.Thanks in advance.Best Regards,SS",

But if you don't know the basics of file operations (like mv), you should probably learn that before using ssh.",
