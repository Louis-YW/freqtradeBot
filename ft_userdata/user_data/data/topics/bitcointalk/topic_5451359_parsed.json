  "content": "apple made trillions and become wealthiest company, ARM made barely a few hundres millions, not even a billion, that is how distorted market is.ARM design the chip, thus it can be said it is an inventor, a scientist who invent useful thing that benefit everybody else, much like Newton Isaac. Apple simply license their IP and made trillions dollar, simply from rent free profit, apple do not invent the cpu, they might be modifying the design in house, modifying is not too be confused with inventing, modifying is same as we modding a game rom, and change a little bit of the code inside them, repacking it into a brand new product and fooling everybody else we invent the new game. Apple also do not invent anything else that is that is housed inside the phone itself, not even the lighting cable port, camera, nor the battery that power the phone. What apple indeed did invent on the phone is the apple logo, because that is the only thing they can be proud of themselves. The ios is also just a linux kernal derived from the android, so that is not invented. But, finally question, do you want to be engineers, who is breadwinner for everybody else, and become very poor, may be get a little famous from your hardwork, but too bad apple would become as famous as wb the oracle of the omaha, who is well known to the entire world of academia, due to all the money he has, very high caliber, and infleunce he could get.",

      "body": "If the chip manufacturers entered a voluntary licensing agreement, are they the supposed victims just because they licensed to a company that happen to make a large profit disproportional to what they receive in the agreement? Apple outsources a lot of their components, they're not doing all the R&D in house and they aren't the only silicon valley company that does this. If Apple did not create a vessel for ARM chips, would ARM be in the business of manufacturing consumer electronics and turn out the same profit Apple did? Highly unlikely.",

Nowadays social media is really important for many people, people trying to become the most beautiful/handsome in order to get recognition by other people. Steve is also clever since he can explain his product in simple and easy to understand for every people.Although there are many companies which offer better products than Apple, but majority of people already recognize Apple and not really care with other brands.",

It looks nice and functional, but one of the biggest deal breakers in my opinion is the fact Apple won't let their costumers to stick a micro SD card into the smarthphones they bought for thousands for dollars.  Seriously, it is so shameless. Because it is something they could do so easily like most of the phone makers do, but no. They chose the path of restricting their hardware to increase the chances of people buying a new phone because the storage capacity.  No idea how anyone could defend those anti costumer measures...",

Everything was presented under the guise of \"this has never happened before on the market\" and \"these devices are not available to ordinary people, this is an elite product\" In fact, this is an \"artificially created product value\", or rather a brand. Indeed, from the point of view of TECHNOLOGY, you will not be able to name a single moment in Apple's products that would actually be NEW or completely developed within the company! Under all the \"cool\" and \"unique\" names of technologies are ordinary solutions from other companies that simply supply their own developments to Apple.By the way, let me remind you about \"manufacturability\" and \"unique quality\" - remind me when and how did support for the bluetooth protocol appear in iPhones? Just read even the official bug reports - how many primitive flaws and bugs are there!?And there are many such moments, including about the reliability of the devices themselves. But this data is not public, because. these service centers are generally closed to the public, and the owners, who consider themselves to be such \"elites\", are not ready to admit that they own an ordinary device that they were sold for x3 of the market price",

[1] apple updatesThanks for the reference (unfortunately, I cannot read it right now),  but I assume it is rather a new term of their service or they misuse the term of \"software support\" in order to do whatever they want to their client's products. For example, I remember a cases when Apple was caught/admitted slowing down devices through software updates, so their batteries would last longer without a replacement. Obviously, a slow device could prompt people to ditch their phone and buy a new one. Which as convenient for Apple. That could have happened before their started to offer their maintenance programs, tho. It was many years ago.",

I have zero doubt apple would have every capacity to build everything from ground up all by themselves, they have the expertise to make computer notably on Mac, but they rather outsource their know-how on someone else, did everybody forget computer was used to be geeky product, nobody would want to spend money on computer notably all the poor guy around, when you try to sell computer to them, they would call you scammer quickly and leaving you humiliated?

I had always got called scammer by people when I try to sell them some mlm product which is indeed great, because I know it is difficult to convince people to accept product and spend the money on it, people are stingy and they would always readily to call us scammer to effectively dismiss any salesman.I would say apple product is not a snake oil product.
