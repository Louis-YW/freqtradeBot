  "content": "NOTE: This post is a work in progress and has not been finished yet. First I need to create some ordinals before I can give detailed information about the inscription process. <I cannot create any ordinals until I get back home.>An ordinal is an NFT that exists on the Bitcoin blockchain.Ordinals are made using the software that is available here: https://github.com/casey/ordContrary to popular belief, you can inscribe any content as an Ordinal, and not just multimedia. This can open up a huge number of possibilities, such as selling books in PDF or ePUB format, hosting single-page websites and pastebins, submit proof that you were the first to do something, and maybe even doing anonymous forum posts as well.InstallingThere are binaries for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, which you can download here: https://github.com/casey/ord/releasesOne-click install (puts the binary in $HOME/bin/ folder - it is not in the $PATH by default so if that makes you uncomfortable then just put it in /usr/local/bin):Code:curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsLS https://ordinals.com/install.sh | bash -sCreating a walletFirst you need to have a mainnet Bitcoin Core node running, with txindex=1 in your configuration and that accepts RPC connections. It must use cookie authentication; I could not find a way to make it work with username/password authentication.To create a wallet, you must issue the command ord wallet create (assumes ord is already in the system path).Output:Code:{\"mnemonic\": \"abc def ghi jkl mno pqr stu vwx zya bcd efg hij\"}The mnemonic will have twelve words that form the seed phrase (and look nothing like this example, which was for demonstration purposes only).Creating an inscriptionWORK IN PROGRESSRun ord wallet inscribe FILE_PATH. It will index the blockchain on the first run so be prepared to wait for a few hours (this is independent of Bitcoin Core's block verification process) before your inscription is done. You might want to send funds as soon as the operation starts as it will take a while.Sending inscriptionsWORK IN PROGRESSThere is currently no marketplace for sending and receiving inscriptions online, so you need to use ord for that as well.Run ord wallet send and ord wallet receive respectively.Receiving inscriptionsUse ord wallet receive to generate an address with which you can receive inscriptions on. You can also fund the address so that you can use it to pay transaction fees.Example output:Code:{  \"address\": \"bc1pzefp3s70edy6339ueuys064z9gcw74vgyemgm9d8rlgq42typagsnwycyt\"}If ord is not workingIn case of any error, first you should check your Bitcoin Core node and make sure it is responsive - restart it if necessary.If you are unable to index ord at all, delete the database file at ~/.local/share/ord/index.redb (on Linux - On Windows it's probably inside the AppData/Roaming folder - someone please correct me if this is not true) and possible use a different version of ord and try again.Other tutorials about ordinalsWORK IN PROGRESS - feel free to recommend other pages and threads here.SuggestionsPlease post them below.",

I actually don't mind the questions being non-technical as there's a lot to learn about these things and Dev subboard already has a technical thread about ordinal theory.Anyway:It's been abut 3 hours since I started the inscription, however the block indexing is only 40% done.",

I was not successful. I checked Bitcoin Core's debugging output for any hints, and indeed a wallet rescan happened (I do not know which wallet but it's got to be the `ord` wallet since it's the only wallet I even have on Core), but there is no record of RPC calls made anywhere.Maybe I will just file a bug report.EDIT: I downgraded to ord version 0.4.2 and deleted the ord database at ~/.local/share/ord/index.redb and it looks like I can index it again. Just waiting to see whether it actually finishes this time.  EDIT2: It's stuck again at block #325000....EDIT3: It resumed after 15 minutes. But it doesn't matter anymore because I accidentally Ctrl-C'd the program and must start over",

Is running ord so hardware intensive? Can you give us a few details on the machine you are using to do so? Sure. I restarted the ord indexing yesterday, and it's around block 380,000 now. So at least it is making some progress.Hardware is nothing fancy, the CPU is a \"Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E31240 @ 3.30GHz\" with 8 threads and 16GB of memory attached. My load average is around 4.0, which tells me that it's using 4 threads for indexing.Maybe the problem was that there is so little logging done initially that it could be thought the program was stuck.",
