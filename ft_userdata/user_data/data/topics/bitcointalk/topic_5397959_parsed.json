  "content": "I was shaking my head and laughing very hard when, according to the article, the priest asked are you gambling? and Rojas told him it's crypto hehehehehehe.In any case, I am very skeptical because this article appears to be an advertisment paid for by the Swiss rehab mentioned for cryptoaddicts. Also, they charge $90,000 per week to the people who lost everything in crypto? What will they tell you to battle the addiction? Trade stocks and bonds?The old cravings sometimes creep up on Stevie Rojas and work on his nerves and start to hijack his brain. But he says that he’s kicked the habit — that he’s quit cryptocurrencies cold turkey. A lot of people get into crypto. Rojas did, and more: He says he got hooked on it. Rojas is an entrepreneur in his early 30s, and he began experimenting with cryptocurrencies for all the usual reasons: boredom, curiosity, fear of missing out. He started with Bitcoin and discovered he liked the rush.Rojas became — his word — an “addict.”And so one day last year Rojas knelt in the darkened confessional of a Roman Catholic church in Manila, where he lives. He broke down and prayed for help.Are you gambling? the priest asked.It’s crypto, Rojas told him.Is it really possible to be addicted to cryptocurrency? The idea is contentious, but it isn’t far-fetched — particularly to the lucrative addiction-treatment industry. From a $90,000-a-week Swiss clinic to relatively inexpensive teletherapies, crypto, of all things, has come to rehab.Read in full https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-04-22/can-you-be-addicted-to-crypto-trading-expensive-rehab-treatments-emerge",

Or it can be that unstoppable thirst for gossips in the neighborhood or in social media. Now, of course, cryptocurrency can be addicting too...that is why in life we have to learn the concept of moderation. Now, if I would be paying $90,000 just to reign on my crypto addiction, I better use that money to learn on crypto trading from a good mentor so I can be successful. By the way, I love that this story happened in Manila.",

Shitcoin or pump and dump coin have really high volatility, now Bitcoin's price -10% and many people were panic, take a look with so called decentralized Terra the price goes decrease -45%. If I bought Terra yesterday, I will feel headache to see my portfolio decrease almost 50% in a single day.",

What can a priest do if no one understands or is harmed for any reason especially in crypto space? What is needed to solve this is proper education which can give you proper solution. Driving car without knowing and joining crypto without understanding both are same where only result destroy.",

It is simply the uncontrollable urge to do or engage in an activity that could harm and cause other negative consequences. People who are addicted to cryptocurrency cannot control urge to buying or selling cryptocurrency. They are constantly trying to stay updated on price changes in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They do this by constantly observing charts. And they spend their whole of their day reading crypto news or any other means of informing themselves of potential price action. There is simply an obsessive compulsion with cryptocurrency  such that it interferes with their activities of daily living or ability to adjust to and participate in relationships with their family, friends or colleagues at work. So yes it is possible to be addicted to cryptocurrency.",

Money is the solution to the 99% of the problems in the world and cryptocurrency is just money. Stupid people will always come up with stupid business ideas to find even stupider people as their customers. This is probably one prime example of auch stupidity.  Less than 10% of human population earns beyond 90k annually so it's a pure non-sense!",

There are difference also between investing and trading, some people can also invest at the wrong time. Trading can be gambling, especially the beginners that just started to trade, they do not know what to do and how to avoid losses and make profit instead, but they trade in a way they lose all their money as they become addicted to it, addiction can be in trading while also people should not invest at the wrong time and wrong coin because it can be a maximum loss that might lead to panic sell. Do not forget that some people do not invest in bitcoin but altcoin which is most risky and can lead to loss, there are investment that are also gambling, which depends on the success of an altcoin which might be shitcoin andbecome dead.",

So, in one way or the other people can be used as a means of earning. When someone is frustrated of massive loss, these service providers will initiate that he's into addiction and suggest the rehab program. This is completely a fraud and for users who wants to a rehab for trading addiction can get free service if you're located in specific countries.Addicted to crypto?

Very possible mate, anything that takes much of your time is an addiction to you, but i will like to categorize addiction into two basic class, \"wrong and good addiction\" if what takes your prescious time in cryptocurrency is really worth it, pays you, educate you, improves your knowledge, and be of help to you then it really worth it, the second one is if you only form nuisance around crypto circles, no one benefits from you and you neither benefited from what took your time in cryptocurrency, then i think its just a waste of time and energy.",
