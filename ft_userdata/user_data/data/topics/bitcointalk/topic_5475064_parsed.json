Both are created with the free Chevereto Software, it's nothing new, but we respect its high performance.Imgiu is currently entering the market but you can be sure that we will move quite quickly and that we will offer a very efficient service. Regarding our policy, there is really no precise restriction, but we must comply with GDPR, CPRA, etc. And the specified age range is the most common, considering for example that Imgbb requests to be at least 18 years old.",

We appreciate your interest in our imgiu.com project and we value your comments. We recognize that the claim of being voted #1 in the world may raise doubts, especially considering our short time on the market. The reference to being voted number 1 is based on our expectations and aspirations for the project, as well as the quality and focus we are committed to offering our users. However, we understand that the formulation of that statement may have been perceived as misleading.We want to clarify that we have not conducted a public vote or formal recognition yet due to our recent foray into this field.

We value transparency and integrity in our communication, so we will review our marketing strategy to ensure it accurately reflects our real achievements and attributes.

Your images are kept safe and secure But you still collect information according to your privacy policyThe 100 MB limit refers to the total size per shared image transfer. This means that the sum of all the image files you share in a single transfer should not exceed 100 MB.Importantly, the storage space on our service is unlimited, allowing you to keep and manage your images without restrictions on quantity.Quote from: Husires on November 23, 2023, 06:37:43 AMwebsite template reminds me of ChipMixer, they are very similar.QuoteImgiu prioritizes the privacy and security of your images.

We appreciate your feedback and are committed to improving and being honest in our representations to our community.In short, there is no survey conducted and you just make it appear as if there is, so it falls to deceptive marketing, claiming to be number one when you're not I don't see any transparency because you're lying and I don't see any integrity because you claim something that you're not.Why not just take out the claim and work on your reputation instead of starting out lying to the people.Anyway, the Bitcointalk forum has its official image hosting site but yours could be an alternative though there may be other choices.",
