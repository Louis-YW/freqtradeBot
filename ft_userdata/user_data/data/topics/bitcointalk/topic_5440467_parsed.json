  "content": "Hello,I'm thinking about investing in a project called Movn.And I've just had a look at their polygon scan herehttps://polygonscan.com/token/0x6d802ac662b898622f7a13e1f4cb1a50c7085b6e#balancesAnd there is something that I don't understand.(I'm a crypto noob)The first wallet called \"Movn: Deployer\"has 99.79% of tokens.Considering its name, I assume that it's the wallet of the project team.But is it common that a wallet has so many tokens ?Should it be a warning flag ?To me, I don't understand how a project can be sustainable if a single wallet has so many tokens.Because usually, the team only has around 20% of tokens, overall.Thanks for your assistance !",

If you are still interested in this project after finding out these details, the blame could just be on you. There are so much more projects that are worth investing in.",

      "body": "The token is relatively new and hasn't got enough exposure so far as it seems. As per CoinMarketCap stats of the token, they got a total supply of about 1 Billion tokens while the self-reported circulating supply is only 2 Million so far. So the deployer account holding the tokens must be providing liquidity for their listing at Uniswap and as it seems, they probably didn't conduct an initial coin offering.That all being said, I don't guarantee that the token is worth investing in and I don't really vouch for it. All I said above is only what I could find about the project and what they are doing at the moment. I think it's better if you follow their social channels and follow them closely to see how they go and then decide for yourself. You could also some reviews about it if you can find some using Google.",

Most likely that this token has already been abandoned by its developers and there's a little chance that it may recover.And that little chance is like a miracle to happen but just like any other projects, you shouldn't expect anything from it anymore.",

As you know teams usually only keep 20% of the coins in their tokenomics. Plus, why even bother with this, there are a lot better projects you can probably invest in, and most of them have at the very least better token distribution than this, which didn't even seem to try and even setup the project and give it to their investors. If it was new though then I reckon they're still setting stuff up. They probably have a discord/telegram you can ask around.",

When the supply is small, if they succeed in selling half of the available tokens, the market capacity for that currency will rise insanely, and therefore they will pump large liquidity into the market and withdraw completely.Therefore, the possibility of selling at a good price is very small because the differentiation is fast. They are currencies that start at a low price that increases gradually and then suddenly rises madly and dies quickly.",

While this market has allowed the average person to become an investor not everything is perfect, and the OP is a great example of this, I took a look at the coin and it has a volume of less than 500 dollars, which is pathetic as anyone with a few hundred dollars could manipulate this coin if they wanted, so if any newbie out there bothers to read this then do not invest in coins like this, if you do you will lose your money and you will never get it back.",

Imagine, the developer have so much token on their hand, they can easily manipulate its value and of course it looks like they don’t want someone to invest on them and they just want to stay in control. Don’t ever invest on a project that the developer owns so much token regardless of its purpose.",

Having a full control over their token is not a good one and that’s why there’s no trading volume because investors are not interested about this project, they created this one without understanding the risk of having a huge holdings with their own token. Avoid this at all cost, this kind of project is not worth it and yes there’s no more progress for this token, its too risky to buy.",
