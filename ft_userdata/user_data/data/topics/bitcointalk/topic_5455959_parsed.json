  "content": "Dear All,First, of foremost, we would like to thank you for contributing to the project by suggesting great names and wonderful logo designs in the past couple of days.Following the recent announcement, we have received many brand candidates from you. After long hours of researching and reviewing the candidate names, the CORE Committee has decided to choose “CATENA Chain” as the new brand replacement for the CORE Multichain project.CATENA is already the project’s blockchain layer and is an important part of the project.In the next few weeks, we will start revealing the new websites and products following the rebranding process.Once again, on behalf of the Team and the Committee, we thank you for your continued support.TOGETHER WE GROWCATENA Explore:https://catenascan.com/Twitter:https://twitter.com/Catena_NetworkTelegram:https://t.me/CatenaOfficialCMCX CoinCATENA Network",

      "body": "####################################CATENA is a PoS blockchain 3.0 framework focused on Interoperability, Scalability, and Usability.CATENA is Multi-Chain the main goal is a Cryptographic Object Resource Engine.####################################With CATENA, you can expect lightning-fast transactions at an incredible speed of 50,000 per second, thanks to its advanced technology. Blocks will be validated in just 2 seconds, offering outstanding efficiency.Moreover, CATENA has a unique Delegated Proof of Stake (Dpos) system that enables users to delegate authority to network nodes, maximizing their benefits and decentralizing the network.And that's not all. CATENA also allows for interoperability, which means it can easily connect and exchange data with other blockchains, expanding the possibilities for what can be built on top of it.####################################As CATENA is intended to be a multi-layer blockchain and a layer 0 blockchains , we are developing all necessary tools and SDKs for developers to create their own blockchains with limitless use cases. They can be used for whatever the programmer wants, whether it's data validation, digital currency wrapping, minting cryptocurrencies, or building blockchains.The following engines are the building blocks of a fully scalable and secure blockchain: Cryptography Engine, Consensus Engine, State Engine, Randomizer Engine, Tokenizer Engine, and State Sync Engine.####################################CATENA has all of these consensus mechanisms (Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated proof of stake (DPoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), Accelerated Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (APBFT), Central AI consensus protocol) built into its consensus engine, but the main consensus of CATENA is a modified version of DPoS that team calls Practical Proof of Stake.####################################CATENA Network’s block time is 2 seconds. A transaction can take from milliseconds to a maximum of 2 seconds to be finalized.####################################CMCX is a native coin of the CATENA project and it can be used for voting, validators, and nominators.####################################There will be a total of 24 Validator Nodes, 4 of which will be Project Managed, and 20 will be community owned.At this stage, the first 8 Nodes will be activated: ⁃ 4 NODES: Managed by the CATENA ⁃ 2 NODES (Dedicated): For Individuals or Organizations  ⁃ 2 NODES (Delegate): Shared between usersHere are the requirement and information for being granted a Validator position:There are going to be TWO types of Validators: 1️⃣Dedicated  ⁃ Min. Period: 2 Years ⁃ Rewards:  • Staking APY: 65% • Block Reward: 64 CMCX/Block • Percentage of Transaction Fees ⁃ Renewable for 1 Year upon requirement fulfillment  ⁃ Unlocking Period (Node replacement): 3 weeks ⁃ An online interview might be required. 2️⃣Delegate  Min. Period: 1 Year ⁃ Rewards:  • Staking APY: 57% • Block Reward: 64 CMCX/Block (Shared between the delegators) • Percentage of Transaction Fees ⁃ Renewable for every 90 days ⁃ No Unlocking periodThe application procedure is as follows: - Register in the Validator Portal,- Fill in all the required information,- Wallet address: • For Full Node Validator applications Min. 6.4 Million of CMCX balance; • For Delegators applications Min. 100,000 CMCX balance (subject to change).*NOTE1: These procedures and requirements are for the first 4 Validators.*NOTE2: Other nodes such as Observers, Defenders, etc., will be revealed after the Mainnet’s full launch.*NOTE3: Approved users will be granted limited access to the Mainnet prior to the full launch.####################################CATENA Project is constructed over three layers; ORIGO, CATENA & AURA. Each layer is designed perfectly to get the job done.-ORIGO is the network layer. It is the brain of the system. It handles the formation of the blocks in the blockchain.-CATENA is the blockchain layer and is built on the network layer. This is where the actual blocks form and newly formed blocks are appended.-AURA is the application layer; this is where the DApps and smart contracts are built.####################################The 18 Billion CMCX Coin in the CATENAnetwork, had to be minted at the genesis of the blockchain.It is important to know that CMCX is a deflationary coin, meaning, instead of minting the coins from the first, and increasing them, the maximum supply is minted from the beginning and will be decreased/deflated gradually during burning phases.####################################",

      "body": "Regarding the Catena Explorer, we would like to address a few significant points. The launch of a hybrid network accompanied by an Explorer capable of reading two simultaneous data sources, namely the EVM compatible and the Native network, at a remarkable speed of 50,000 TPS with a 2-second block-time, is a highly intricate task. It is worth noting that many well-known projects have attempted such a feat, but we are proud to be at the forefront of this pioneering effort. Our Explorer represents a new generation of Explorers, serving as the foundation for the Universal Block Explorer.As we progress on our journey, we anticipate the unique features of the Catena Blockchain to continue expanding the network's applications, unlocking new possibilities and opportunities.💠TOGETHER WE GROW💠",
