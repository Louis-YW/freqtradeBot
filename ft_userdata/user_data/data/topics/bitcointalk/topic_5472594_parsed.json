So, when I'm committed or likely to stay on one exchange that's when I try to use anything that's about them like their app version but just as you, it's always Binance for me.Quote from: arhipova on November 02, 2023, 03:37:36 PMThere are lot of features on this app that are useful to users like one can convert one coin to another with single click without any charges. I'd assume the others are also the same like this or if they have a fee, they're just minimal.",

Regarding the other features, I believe Binance also has the best to offer. Since it is the biggest crypto exchange in the world it has an enormous budget to innovate and not be left behind by its competitors. The good thing about Binance is it continues to work in getting more permits from many countries around the world and hopefully, my government will be one of them in the near future.",

There are lot of features on this app that are useful to users like one can convert one coin to another with single click without any charges. International usage experience, binance is the easiest for me to use. Apart from Binance Exchange, I also use local exchanges for trading. The local exchange that I like the most is tokocrypto. There are many local exchange options available and registered under government regulations because my country only allows crypto as a commodity asset, but the exchanges I mentioned have the ease of use that I feel.Both require users to complete KYC to be able to trade.Tokocrypto makes it easy because it provides IDR pairs. If Binance doesn't have a BTC/IDR pair, it only provides a BTC/BIDR pair.",

The majority of the applications that are on the market now are quite easy to use and the factors for me are the markets that the exchange has or what coin it has—something to that sense. Having fees and easy to use are quite different things to compare. One app could have the easiest interface but have a fee. The other one, you could have no fee but it's complicated to trade. I think I would choose the easier interface. Anyway, have you decided aside from Binance OP?",

There are lot of features on this app that are useful to users like one can convert one coin to another with single click without any charges. I find Bybit more easy to use rather than Binance app due to its much easier to understand functions. Binance turns out to become more complex after their addition of bunch of trading tools that is already complex for users. The P2P on Bybit have zero fee promo and provides much better rate on my currency that’s why I preferred this app since I feel convenience on bybit compared to binance. Plus the fact that Binance is consistently being target by US government makes me hesitate to use it more often. The nightmare leave by FTX makes me automatically avoid any exchanges that has conflict.",

They are not related at all, I think your expectations rarely come true.I heard that Mexc still has a zero fee trading offer. I don't use this exchange, so I don't have any experience to share.

There are lot of features on this app that are useful to users like one can convert one coin to another with single click without any charges. Binance and Kucoin support the trading of crypto to fiat through P2P trade and that's the main reason I trade with them. I've used the mobile version as well as the web version and the experience is not bad. The Binance and Kucoin mobile apps are easy to use and both have cool features like bot trading but I find the design of the Kucoin app more attractive. Though I had to discontinue trading with Kucoin following the introduction of compulsory KYC.",

And it's true that they're consuming that much or it's just that I usually install them to test out on my old phone.Anyway, I understand that because they need to maintain what's in the app through continuous updates and upgrades. @OP if you want no charges, only a few of them do that but are those centavos of charge per trade do hurt you?",

When it comes to centralized exchanges, Binance truly dominates. Even the user interface for trading is very beginner-friendly. Binance's mobile app is suitable for all users, from beginners to expert traders.Binance's current reputation is very convincing for many crypto users, and the amount of assets entrusted to Binance is also very high.I use a local exchange app called Tokocrypto, which is also connected to Binance. Tokocrypto, up to now, has proven to be easier for me to use when buying and selling BTC for FIAT especially IDR.",

I don't think they will change it based on the minimum wage of each region, so your best bet is just to use other exchanges if that is a problem for you.
