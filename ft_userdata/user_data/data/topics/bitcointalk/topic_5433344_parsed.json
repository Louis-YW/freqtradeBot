And I don't think that marketplace can help him. He isn't selling/trading or what but he just needs a help to pull out his money out Brave so I think this > https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0 board could help him better.Quote from: Jawhead999 on January 07, 2023, 09:15:44 AMDon't get tricked by @OP, he was asking for $17 but he want to giving away $9 for free, it mean small money is really important for him.That's a different topic and this one here is also different plus I don't think he is giving away free money here. As he said, he only needs a Gemini account to withdraw his stuck BAT and then he might reward the person who will do this task.Quote from: LoyceV on January 08, 2023, 10:44:38 AMYou can use FixedFloat.com to exchange BATERC20 to something more useful, but you'll need to consolidate them in one wallet first.That's a good exchange platform but I don't think it's possible for him for now to send the BAT directly to that site but he first needs to withdraw it to Gemini (I think Uphold can also work) and once the token is in there, that would be the time that he can send it to a crypto exchange or to any crypto wallets.",
