It's the First Cryptocurrency Exchange with Zero-Fee Trading and Zero-Fee withdrawal on BRISE and Bitgert Tokens and some other selected coins.So marketing will start with the Bitgert community.We also have a plan for a DEX parallel exchange in 2023, as well as a launchpad, and many other unique feature and services.A roadmap is in the making.",
