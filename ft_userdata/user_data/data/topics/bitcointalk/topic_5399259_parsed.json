  "content": "Cryptops is a decentralized exchange that enables the trading of crypto currency option derivativesCryptops is a new DEX that was designed to be easy for new users who want to trade crypto option derivatives on blockchain.In short Cryptops is a direct access layer 1 blockchain with an on-chain order book that uses layer 2 components to provide a verifiable crypto options derivatives market. The trades close on average in 3 seconds and is able to handle 1000+ transactions per second.For improved security there are no browser wallet plugins, smart contracts or protocols that have a history of being hacked and losing millions. Just straight forward direct access to the assets/tokens that reference the on blockchain option derivatives.Cryptops is an open publicly available blockchain that anyone can use to create their own option derivatives market for any crypto currency they desire. Cryptops will be creating an options derivatives side chain for BTC at the launch of the blockchain. I am willing to help anyone interested in launching an option derivatives market for any crypto of their choice, just send me a message.Some of the innovative advantages the Cryptops DEX has to offer include:You are able to generate a secure account on an air gapped computer then save the CryptopsTerm wallet/trade app to your computer and trade without your keys ever needing to leave your premises.You can run your own Cryptops node with the CryptopsTerm wallet/trade app and get 0 ms access time to the on blockchain order book, again with your keys ever never needing to leaving your premises.Cryptops has the best most secure staking rewards model and staking is possible without needing to run a node or anything like that. In Cryptops you can earn staking rewards on coins that are held in a cold storage wallet that was created on an air gapped computer. The rewards are automatically paid out weekly to your configured hot wallet address using a built-in blockchain mechanism.COE is the native coin on the Cryptops blockchain that provides a weekly distribution of ALL network fees plus 1% inflation to all qualified accounts. The tokenomics of the Cryptops blockchain is clear transparent and easily understood. The Cryptops blockchain uses the COE utility coin to provide for a verifiable fair and honest options market for crypto currencies directly on a layer 1 decentralized distributed blockchain. The Cryptops project has been in research and development for over 4 years now. Cryptops is a fork of the upstream Stellar code base. A major difference from the upstream Stellar code is the total quantity of 1 billion native coins (COE). Other major changes include the 1% interest and transaction fee sharing to qualified accounts on the Cryptops blockchain as well as the network starting date of January 2018.Cryptops test networkThe test network for the Cryptops blockchain is running on 8 nodes in random data centers around the world and has been up for about 3 years and is over 15 million ledgers deep. The API server for the Cryptops test network can be found at: https://horizon-testnet.cryptops.exchangeCryptops main networkThe main network was brought up on 12 nodes running in random data centers around the world just a few months ago and is already over a million blocks deep.

      "body": "Cryptops is making available an ICO of the native layer 1 utility coin called COE. The amount being offered is the interest that has accrued during the research and development phase of the project. The time period for the interest starts with the beginning of research and development on the Cryptops blockchain that started in January 2018 until now. This accrued interest of COE will be sold to secure the production launch of the BTC option derivatives that will be placed directly on the Cryptops blockchain. The COE ICO amount was obtained by collecting the 1% Cryptops blockchain inflation from both the remainder and build challenges accounts shown in the distribution document at https://cryptops.exchange/download/Distribution.pdf. Details of the Cryptops COE ICO.ICO Amount: 41,500,000 COEICO Price: 0.000005 to 0.0000549 BTCICO Price Levels: 500ICO Minimum Purchase: 0.001 BTCICO Start Date: 9-28-2022ICO End Date: When public BTC options are launched.The Cryptops COE ICO has now begun! Cryptops COE can be purchased using the direct BTC to COE bridge. The ICO price will start at 0.000005 and increase to 0.000055 BTC per 1 COE using 500 incremental price levels. This gives a price increase of 10 satoshis for each of the 500 levels.All that is needed to purchase COE is to send BTC to the address indicated. There are no browser plugins that need to be installed to access a third party blockchain. The purchase process is made simple using the direct BTC to COE bridge.",
