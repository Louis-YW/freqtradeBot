  "content": "Never think of using cryptocurrencies as your only source of income; always have Alternatives for it, if really you don't want to endup in nothing. See what happens to my friends for making crypto as their only source of income. When my friends started cryptocurrency few years ago, they seriously engaged in trading, but I knew nothing about trading then, I was just learning from them, during this last bull run, some of my friends that started trading, decided to quit there job just because they believe the money they are making from trading is sufficient for them and they don’t have to be stressing themselves going to office everyday since they can make enough money from cryptocurrency without going out. I advised them not to quit but they didn’t listen to me, now that we are in bear market, all of them have been frustrated since they are not making money from cryptocurrency and they already left their job and is not really easily for them to secure a new job, currently coins are down and this is the best opportunity to buy more coin but unfortunately for them they are selling the coins the already bought to keep for long term just to take care of themselves.making cryptocurrency your only source of income is a bad idea, you should be expecting money just from one source, is a really bad idea, most people can’t really hold there coins because cryptocurrency is their only source of income, which whenever they are in need of money they endup selling the coins which they purchase to hold for a long period of time, but if you are having other sources of income whenever you are in need of emergency money, you won’t sell your coins, you can get money from those other sources of income you are having. So even if you are into cryptocurrency fully, I believe you should have other business which you will be running to support your cryptocurrency investment, and with that you will be financially stable, if you are holding a coin you will be able to overlook it for long period of time without selling because you don't only depend on it for survival. My advise to all newbies is that when we join crypto space, don’t quit your job just because of the amount you are making from cryptocurrency, we should always try our possible best to have another source of income so that whenever things goes wrong we will always have backup.Always remember that Rabbits are always having 3 holes in the Bush to escape Incase you blow smoke for him to suffocate him and make him Run out...",

We should not rely on a single source of income especially in cryptocurrency because of its unpredictability due to high volatility movement.Just ask this to yourself or to your friend \"what makes you think you can survive in crypto space?\" Especially if your knowledge is too limited to trading only, there are people who did this, some did great while some didn't make it the same as what happened to your friend.Trading is not for everybody.",

There are no scientific rules that control price movement and therefore all decisions will be based on speculation, as it is an unproductive sector. Whenever you win money, it means that someone else lost it for you to win.I do not expect that there are women who can live their lives depending on gambling as a main activity, and therefore trading is not useful as a main source of income.",

I say that the cryptocurrency market is very erratic price fluctuations that the market will not be stable.",

No. That is how cryptocurrecies are too, because you trade a coin or token, that does not mean that you are into crypto business or investment.Because you invest in crypto, that does not mean you should quit your job, but trading can give that wrong thinking, thinking you are making money daily or in short time, that you do not need any job again, but that is wrong, most traders are not good traders, they are only lucky with bull market, when the bear market come, they will lose more. You can long and make money during bull, short and make money during bear, it depend on how lucky and good you are, but it is not good to rely on trading, be it forex, crypto, stocks, and others like gold, crude oil and others. This is not about cryptocurrecies, but about trading. But also not good to quit job for trading.",

Crypto trading is like a double-edged sword, on the one hand it can provide huge profits while on the other hand it can also be a scary hole.The great volatility of crypto certainly makes us worried and at the same time very happy on the one hand. Because if crypto prices go up very high, we can get very big profits. In addition to offering profits, crypto assets of course provide losses that can be considered very large. If you miscalculate, instead of the profit you get, you will reap the multiplied loss.That's the reason Crypto is not a place to hang out for a living, besides trading crypto you also have to have a job in the real world.",

After all, if crypto investments are your only source of income, I can almost guarantee that you're looking for ways to get a loan for your personal upkeep. However, if you have your own funds, you can simply keep an eye on your crypto portfolio or take advantage of the current bear market to invest more. However, never quit or leave your work to depend fully on cryptocurrency.",

But still, relying on the only source of income is not a good idea when the need for money is greater than ever.The market becomes unprofitable during bearish, most people say it's true. But if your friends have sufficient skills and funds, then I believe they can still profit from price volatility too. The thing is, not everyone will be able to make a profit in the market in every market trend, be it bullish or bearish. It's also not a good idea to be patient in a primary job that only earns $50-$100 per month as inflation will keep them only working and the wages are just enough to cover the day's expenses.",

On the other hand, if they are a professional trader and when I mean professional trader, they are earning more than they are losing then maybe they can make it as their income source.TBH, I almost did what your friends did but I didn't continue because I choose to remain on my regular job because it pays me my monthly bills.

Some of the most successful hodlers are people who have other sources of income. You can't expect to be a successful hodler when cryptocurrency is only what you do and base your survival on. It is even advised normally that having one source of income, be it crypto or any other means is strongly discouraged. After securing one source of income, the goal should be to secure another and not become satisfied with just one. IMO, three sources of income should be the least that somebody should have. For the employees, there is no job security, apart from your salary job and investment in crypto, you should strive to have another or more incase you get dropped from your salary job, so you do not become directly dependent on the cryptocurrency you have for your survival.",
