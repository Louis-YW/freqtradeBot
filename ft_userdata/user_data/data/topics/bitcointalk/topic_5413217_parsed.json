(as have many pretend early adopters have done before)if you are talking about a game where people traded \"a currency\" .. that would probably be \"second life\" using a currency called linden dollars which was traded inside and outside of the game pre bitcoin(and nothing to do with bitcoin)",

Can you tell me what is the reason you buy Bitcoin at that time? I doubt any person has the intention to buy Bitcoin at that time. Don't tell me you buy Bitcoin for investment purposes at that time! By the way, you said that you have no knowledge about Bitcoin. So, how can you be brave to purchase Bitcoin?I think it is nonsense!! It is impossible that someone purchases Bitcoin if he has no knowledge of it.",

AND!!!! speak to the guys who asked me to do thisSorry, your story doesn't make any sense and doesn't line up with reality.  You're welcome to believe or claim whatever silly story you like, but if you aren't open to accepting that your memory of the event might be a bit inaccurate after over a decade, then you're going to have trouble getting anywhere with your search.Quote from: LostNfound on September 12, 2022, 03:39:30 AMHow's the data of mined coins transferred? It isn't. If you're actually interested in something that happened in early 2009 then there are 2 likely possibillities:1. You installed Bitcoin-Qt on your computer, copied a bitcoin address from the BitcoinQt software and sent that address to the person you were talking to. They then created a bitcoin transaction, sending some bitcoin to your BitcoinQT wallet (a few tens-of-thousands of bitcoin at that time if you got a fair deal for that $10, which would be more than half a Billion dollars worth today). You would then have seen the balance show up in your BitcoinQT.2. Some scammers convinced you to send them some money.  They claimed that you now owned some bitcoin, but either you just believed what they said, or they created a website that showed a fake bitcoin balance and tricked you into loading up that web page and believing whatever nonsense they had put on it.ORMaybe.  Just maybe. If you're not just completely making up a story.  You're thinking of late 2009, or early 2010, or perhaps even 2011 or 2012.Perhaps a few more details of what you were aware of about bitcoin at the time would help cement the reality in your mind?  Did those gamers happen to have told you about the Bitcoin Pizza transaction?  Did they tell you about the alpaca socks?  Did they tell you anything about Satoshi?  What did they say to convince you that Bitcoin actually existed, that it was worth what they were asking you to pay for it, and that they weren't just scammers that were going to run off with your money?",
