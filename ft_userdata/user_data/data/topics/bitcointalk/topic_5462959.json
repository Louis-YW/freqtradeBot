The potential to make good gain out of an asset without losing its initial value proves the worth of the asset and this is exactly what bitcoin is as a good store of value .That's true, most of the Bitcoin users invest in Bitcoin only to get prosperous life because of that investment and there is nothing wrong in such mentality as we all know that many people have earned fortunes when they have invested in Bitcoin in its early days. The thing may be different for the ones who are investing in Bitcoin at its current price mark as only those may be financially free who could spend at least hundred's of thousands in it. I agree with the fact that many people underestimate the importance of Bitcoin when it comes to its true nature. Bitcoin is actually an asset that can be considered as a store of value and it doesn't bear any other expenses for the ones who have bought it other than the transaction fees. In that sense we can consider Bitcoin as a great source of value and it can be grabbed without much expenses. Now a days the exchanges have made it easier for us to convert Bitcoin to any other currency with much expenses, but still with those exchanges we are loosing the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin with which it was made. But, if we ignore the fact of decentralization then it's a child's play to convert Bitcoin to any other crypto currency or even fiat without much fees or charges.",

Differentiating real estate and Bitcoin as investments are way off IMHO. Both are good investments, you don't need maintenance to maintain the Bitcoins that you're holding.Unlike in real estate, you have to and it's physically present.Quote from: Y3shot on August 11, 2023, 07:27:01 PMBitcoin is a store of value,  it can converted from one currency to another without losing any value.  Their are other physical form in which people can consider to be a better way to store their assets,  but getting it done it can take expenses that will make the asset lose value.

No doubt that it is the best store value that I currently have.",

In other words, to enter this category, the item acquired should, over time, either be worth the same or more. This had been an arguement for so long and the reason why financial institutions hardly consider Bitcoin as money.  At some point, Bitcoin is a good store of value but at in another point, it became poor store of value, once every cycle when the market transitioned to a bear market, the time when Bitcoin greatly lost it price value.",

Just consider a single day Internet gets down don't you think it will cost us the loss of Billions?Now consider for a moment the crisis like a war between two major nations it will destroy digital assets in my view and there we need a commodity recognized globally because in a war situation most of the stability depends on natural resources and assets like Gold, Bitcoin is volatile by nature it can be a good store of value but not in the crisis times. There is one more positive point a War like situation takes time to develop its not like you sleep by investing in Bitcoin as your money is safe and wake up and see we are in a War age haha so you can take an exit according to the developments.My point is there are vulnerabilities with a mare chance but anything is possible.

Most users accept Bitcoin for investment purposes mainly, as happened in the early days of Bitcoin, and few of them use Bitcoin for normal business. But we must not forget that this is one of the most important reasons that contributed to raising awareness of Bitcoin and Blockchain in general. Also, there is a significant percentage of users who adopt Bitcoin in their business, especially those who work as freelancers on the Internet.We should also not forget that in the early years of Bitcoin, the use of Bitcoin in suspicious activities on the dark web contributed to spreading awareness of it in the same way that it is happening today with investment purposes.",
