However, Binance had an alternative solution:“We suggest using the P2P service so that you can continue to use Binance comfortably.”The crypto exchange utilized the occasion to inform users that P2P services allow users to exchange crypto and fiat currencies directly with other users without needing a middle-person like banks.The definition for P2P service is correct, but is Binance not a middle-person as used in the their definition? If the definition is correct, that means all centralized exchanges are not P2P exchanges because if no middle man is involved, P2P should be decentralized or directly between two people.",

      "body": "I agree with your point. P2P by definition usually refers to a decentralized platform. In Binance's \"P2P\" service, Binance is acting as a middleman because the cryptocurrency is transferred within their platform - from the seller's Binance wallet to the buyer's Binance wallet. Binance's team also acts as the intermediary in case of a dispute.A true P2P platform would be something like the Bisq network.",

It is also a lie, but Binance are well known to outright lie and scam their users in order to make more profits, so no real surprises there.Binance P2P is not peer to peer. It is peer to Binance and Binance to peer. Binance is a (un)trusted middle man, who has complete control over your trade, can spy on everything you do, takes custody of your coins, and can censor your transactions. You have zero security, zero privacy, and zero sovereignty. Literally the only thing that is different to regular Binance is the way in which your buy or sell order is matched up. If some regulator decides that they want Binance to shut down their P2P platform, they will do it in a heartbeat, and good luck getting back any coins you have on the platform at the time.If you actually want to trade peer to peer and stop middlemen from arbitrarily preventing your trades or seizing your coins, then use an actually peer to peer exchange like Bisq or AgoraDesk. Binance P2P is a scam.",

With this, how is Binance's peer-to-peer transaction a real peer-to-peer transaction? Secondly, a peer-to-peer transaction doesn't simply mean there isn't a middleman; it more importantly means there is no third party that is powerful enough to censor and approve transactions. It means anybody could transact with anybody. With Binance, however, not only do transactions pass through a middleman, the middleman also screens P2P users themselves. Censorship is rather worse, therefore; it's on a different level. They not only get to decide whether a transaction should proceed or not, they also get to decide whether a current Binance user itself could transact peer-to-peer or not.",

      "body": "To understand how P2P can work in the proper manner; • The one selling bitcoins has their personal, non custodian wallets linked up to their account (which was opened without the need for KYC).• They are matched up to a seller or chose a pair from the available sell orders,• Buyer and seller discuss payment option to go with and decide on the most convenient,• Seller creates a smart contact transaction which releases the funds to the buyer's wallet once seller receives the fiat payment.Some exchanges could tweak some actions, but that's the general idea. What binance does is just another form of regular centralized transaction with Binance mediating between buyer and seller and holding the funds at every point during the trade.It's all a marketing prop, just like coinbase custodian wallet imitation.",

That man Cz is one of the problems of this industry, people think he's some savior (second Satoshi) and wants the best interest of the industry but that's a complete lie. I won't be surprised if it turns out CZ was a Chinese undercover agent sent by the Chinese government to conquer the cryptocurrency industry and what better way to do that then through an exchange that can detect what people sees and invest in.Trust wallet was open source before it got acquired by Binance even their P2P isn't decentralized. P2P has to do with decentralization and Binance is centralized therefore Binance can't be offering a P2P exchange. There's nothing wrong with using Binance to only trade but do note, whenever you're doing that you're selling your private information to them (this happens with all centralized platforms like Facebook etc) as they monitor some other activities that's beyond just trading on their exchange which can be sold to third parties (advertisement parties) which target ads at you when you use other platforms.",

      "body": "AFAIK, The term \"middleman\" refers to any intermediary that sits between two parties in a transaction.  In a P2P network, there is typically no middleman involved, as the nodes communicate directly with one another and this can provide a number of benefits, such as increased privacy and security, as well as reduced costs and greater scalability.In my own understanding, the centralized exchange that offers p2p and the decentralized p2p exchange is totally different. In a centralized P2P network, there is typically a central server or authority that controls the network and facilitates communication between nodes. Nodes in the network communicate with each other through this central server or authority, which acts as a middleman. While on the decentralized p2p, there's no central authority or server that controls the network but instead, nodes in the network communicate directly with each other, without the need for a middleman.  Each node in the network is equal and has the same level of control and authority as all other nodes. I think not all p2p exchanges are created equal, there are always pros and cons to each of them, and about CZ, there's a hidden agenda for all of these and one of our suspects could be the marketing which possibly gains benefits from his exchange which is very obvious.",

Without any bias this is a game changer which brings crypto closer to our communities... I think the key issue is the definition of P2P being unclear, especially after more and more \"escrow\" service start their own exchange service. You can argue that the way they work is very different from what we usually refer to as P2P on this forum, even if they use multi-sig as a means to protect user funds. KYC is one of the clear differences. Whether you agree that their business model is still P2P or not is the key debate here.Quote from: Macadonian on March 06, 2023, 12:09:52 AMThe person you trade with could be but that is why you only trade with trustworthy people. When you use p2p exchanges they could be collecting data on you and the person that you are trading with. IMO It is better to never use personal data especially if you can avoid it. Trading with a 'trustworthy' person is still risky, not necessarily because they will scam you, but because they might sell your info behind your back. No one can prove this, so it is better to be paranoid. Still better than using a third party that clearly collects both of your data though. CMIIW.",
