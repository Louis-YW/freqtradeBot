  "content": "Just a couple of days back, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das made some strong statements against cryptocurrencies in general,Quotecrypto should be banned, given its no underlying value in the market. Just like every asset, every financial product comes with some underlying value, hence the value of crypto is totally based on the make-believe factor.QuoteCrypto is a form of gambling without any underlying value and is nothing but a 100 percent speculation world.QuoteCrypto is not a financial product but pure gambling, and called for an outright ban on it.As the union budget of 2023 is approaching, do you think it will make the Finance ministry take some strict decisions against cryptocurrency in India? I am worried to be honest!News ref: https://www.indiatoday.in/cryptocurrency/story/rbi-gov-calls-for-an-outright-ban-on-cryptocurrency-as-union-budget-2023-approaches-2322146-2023-01-16",

As central election is scheduled to happen in 2024 the government would not be willing to hurt any community. Already they have succeeded in reducing traffic to indian exchange. Most crypto investers and traders are already using international exchanges.  This year would be safe and if any bad decision has to come it will happen after the election.",

But Modi is not really dependent on the votes of educated youths. So I am not sure if the government will wait for that long. I am pretty worried and eagerly waiting for the budget on 1st Feb. I am sure some sort of indication will be there. But let's hope nothing bad will happen!

I hope all years are safe from the evil eyes of the government! But there are some specific reasons why the Indian government is not very positive about cryptocurrency. The committee they formed to study and suggest about crypto a couple of years back, they came back with the same suggestion to ban and also proposed punitive actions against crypto users. Now the RBI governor! Even though he is a puppet of the government, still his position is an impactful one.",
