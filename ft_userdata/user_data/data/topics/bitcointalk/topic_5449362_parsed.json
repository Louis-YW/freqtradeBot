Don’t fall for their trick of accepting bitcoin, they are trash and a scam.If they don’t like you for whatever reason, they will confiscate your balance and literally steal your domains! That’s right, never seen before. Just read their TOS they literally write there that they can confiscate your money and domains FOR WHATEVER REASON AND WITHOUT NOTICE!This is totally unbelievable. Also they seem to be buying TrustPilot reviews, I was reading their positive feedback and looks like all fake, the only real like comments are actually the negative ones. What a joke.OrangeWebsite.com is a total scam! Stay away!",

Also they seem to be buying TrustPilot reviews, I was reading their positive feedback and looks like all fake, the only real like comments are actually the negative ones. What a joke.This is suspicious activity in the future. If any site has zero negative evaluations, this is a sign of avoidance, and negative evaluations are the only indicator of the classification of sites.Overall, thank you for the warning, and if there is any evidence of scam, please attach it.",

Never, never use the same registry for both hosting and domain. It should always be with two different companies. In case of any migration or change of provider, in such cases, things can get complicated very easily. Especially when we are talking about such small and relatively unknown services.",
