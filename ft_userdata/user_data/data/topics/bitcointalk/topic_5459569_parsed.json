  "content": "I've been running my own bitcoin node for a while now and got curious about how one would solo mine to their own node which is what i assumed was the norm back in the day and is the most decentralized for the network but everyone now uses pools even for solo mining. I even recently bought an old crappy S9 from eBay to play around with this idea but when i check solo.ckpool.org i saw that the reason it exists is because you cant mine to your own bitcoin core node. Why is this? is mining to your own node some lost art and how do these pools do it? like how else would they get the mining work anywhere else but the node? could someone please explain this to me?",

It'd be ironic if the official release of a Bitcoin client didn't have a solo-mining option.Open your Bitcoin Core console and type “generatetoaddress <nblocks> <address> <maxtries>”.Example:Code:generatetoaddress 1 tb1qm87j39792m2afwduss7hfwqg3xxrrz2tz8yxrw 2000000000You won't be able to solve a block, because the difficulty is incredibly high for an average solo-miner. Try creating your own hard fork of Bitcoin and then use that for solo-mining, just to see that you're allowed to do that.Here you will find a topic related to your question :Solo mining using Bitcoin Core wallet Here the list of topics related on solo mining I made some months ago, you will find some links to self-hosted solo pools, and solo mining in general if you are interested in this subject :[MEGA TOPIC] SOLO MININGI think all these resources will give you an opportunity to do more researches and to understand the pro and coins of each solution possible",

      "body": "The main issue of solo mining really just comes down to the fact that the odds of someone just running an old miner or two miners of finding a block is just about zero. Not saying that you can't get lucky, it's just that at doing it this way you are more or less just playing the lottery. Joining a pool at least you have somewhat regular payouts. Solo mine, and you may never see anything.The other issue also becomes mining to your own node means you have to make sure that you've got enough performance on the machine running it that it could keep up with everything and an Internet bandwidth that if you do find a block it doesn't get orphaned because some other pool found it but your block didn't propagate.People who have been running pools for years could tell you all the pitfalls of doing it. Drive issues, communications issues, and hosts of other things. For the one or two percent (or less) that solo pools will charge if you do find a block you are probably better off just giving up those small amounts if you do happen to find a block then loosing the entire thing because you made a configuration mistake.-Dave",

You cannot use GBT with Bitcoin Core because most of the mining clients are affected by the change in the coinbase data in Bitcoin Core when using Bitcoin Core with GBT. Run BFGMiner with stratum port flag, and specify a port for your ASICs to connect to. If they're on the same network, then you should be able to connect the S9 to your BFGminer with a proxy. There's plenty of tutorials online for this.Otherwise, running it on Testnet is a better idea.",

Bitcoin core does not have the stratum server that miners require. You need some additional software -- just build and run ckpool on your node. It was recently updated for this exact purpose. https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool-solo/src/solobtc/good luck!",

Stratum is a low latency and bandwidth protocol that is used to connect your ASICs to a server which is why it gets recommended more than any other protocol. Antminer doesn't support GBT as well, only Stratum. Your best chance is to run a stratum proxy, which can be done with BFGMiner.",

Every block found on the network is found by a single small miner, many people mined individually and managed to find blocks, some did that with USB sticks that don't mine faster than a few gigahashes per second, besides, we don't know OP' hashrate, he could be mining with 10EH worth of hashrate, so his chances of finding blocks mining to his node are a lot larger than the changes of couple mining pools combined.The only drawback of mining to your own node would be the reliability aspect, mining isn't just about getting lucky and hitting a block, you need to stay constantly synced with other nodes, and you need to have a very fast connection to other nodes (especially the mining ones), block downloading, processing, and prorogation are very sensitive and there is zero room for error, it's plain stupid to risk losing blocks by mining to a node that runs on an old laptop sitting in the garage hooked up to your not so reliable 10mbps ADSL.",

There's also concern with internet connection which leads to slower block propagation.Quote from: Cryptovip Expert on July 16, 2023, 11:53:48 PMMining pools handle the distribution of mining work to individual miners within the pool. They provide the necessary instructions for miners to solve complex mathematical problems and validate transactions. While the mining pool handles the work distribution, each miner still connects to their own Bitcoin node for blockchain synchronization and validation of the mined blocks.Wrong, miner who connect to pool doesn't need to run their own node since pool use Stratum protocol.Quote from: Cryptovip Expert on July 16, 2023, 11:53:48 PMBy connecting to a pool, you can still maintain the benefits of decentralization while actively participating in the mining process.Also wrong, it brings centralization concern where pool could perform passive attack such as intentionally exclude certain transaction.[1] https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.13.0#removal-of-internal-miner",
