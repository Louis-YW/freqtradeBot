  "content": "My colleague at work in the same department with me has being passing through some fiat banking issues. According to him he has an account at Guarantee Trust Bank,which he only deposits into the account, so that whenever there is an emergency he can fall back on this saving account. Dickson said for two years now he hasn't collected money from this account. Recently he had an emergency that needs serious attention so he used his ATM card of this account to make a withdrawal at the nearest POS point close to him,he was debited of $150 converted from my local currency without getting the cash. Dickson said he made a transfer of $200 immediately to the account of Mr Teddy Jones,the transaction was confirmed but Mr Teddy didn't receive the money until the next day afternoon due to network issues. Dickson said he contacted his bank and complained but they said he should be patient that they are working on it.The next day Dickson went to his bank,the customer care said the $200 he transferred will reflect ASAP,but the $150 which was debited at the POS point will be reversed within one month time. This was how Dickson could not purchase the land the land he wanted to buy with the  money. The land cost $400 for one-quarter plot,but he could make a deposit of $200 and pay the balance in a month time based on the agreement between him and the owner of the land.According to Dickson he made sure he purchases the land that was why he made those two transactions of $350,which only the transfer reflected the next day afternoon 2hrs after coming from the bank,due to centralization. The next  while Dickson was at the bank, unknown to him,another buyer came with the sum of $300 cash for the same land. Mr Teddy due to his urgent need for money to take care of his sick dad,immediately sold the land to this new buyer since he hasn't seen any alert from Dickson my colleague. Dickson said he called Mr Teddy when he got home but he heard the shocking news that the land has been sold to someone else,he got so sad and disappointed at his bank. He came to me after he couldn't purchase the land,though he has been telling me about having issues with his bank but he didn't tell me what he needed the money for. I have taught and given him the basic of bitcoin several times,he even loves the initiative. Last week,he asked me how can he buy bitcoin and I asked him why is he asking, he told me he wants to give bitcoin a trial as a means of keeping his saving,that will it be safe for him and have easy access to his bitcoin whenever he wants and I told him Yes.Yesterday Dickson came to me during break and said he is ready to buy bitcoin and I was astonished on his motivation, I advised him not to rush into it but should only use the money he doesn't really need or saving to have a holdings and not money needed urgently. I asked him how much does he wants to start with he told me.     First of all I guided him on how to download a binance app which he did,and then directed him on how to create and exchange account. I also guided him how to link his bank account to his binance wallet,which he was able to deposit some amount in his wallet and bought his bitcoin directly with our local currency. I made him understand that his bitcoin holdings needs to be secure from hackers by telling him he needs to create an offline wallet which he can generate his keys himself he was confused. Although I directed him on creating an electrum online wallet which I showed him how to transfer his bitcoin to his electrum wallet and advised him never to show or disclose his private keys to anyone and how to keep it safe. Today I introduced and told him about bitcointalk.org and advised him to register so that he can learn more on his bitcoin holdings. I congratulate Dickson for taking a bold step on bitcoin. This is one of my achievement in spreading the awareness of bitcoin in my locality so far",

      "body": "It's a bit difficult to understand your story, but I understand your point. Dickson didn't get his own money which he had kept in the bank for two years. He can withdraw it whenever he wants but because the bank doesn't work on holidays or there is a network repair that causes all transactions to be delayed. This is an old problem that has often happened in banks and if there is a disruption to the network, users will feel the impact directly as Dickson experienced.And maybe this is what finally convinced Dickson to start using bitcoin as his savings and it seems he has realized the weaknesses of the banking system and it happens everywhere, not just in his place. You've given basic lessons on how to use bitcoin, from creating a BTC wallet. Next, you can teach him how to use BTC as an investment so he can start it himself and ask you more questions or in this forum. Hopefully, he will learn more about how to use BTC properly to take advantage of investing in BTC.",

      "body": "If i am correct OP your friend hasn't made a withdrawal from this account for like 2 years now and then he went straight to withdraw $150 immediately using a point of sale (POS) if that so then he made a mistake because one thing I notice with banks over here in Nigeria (I could detect its Nigeria from your story)  is that once a particular account left off for more than a year then they advice you come into the banking hall to make your first withdrawal using withdrawal slip its kinda of their way of staying away from scams (according to them)  and concerning the amount debited, didn't the POS attendant received an alert?  Because banks can be cunning sometimes they might later reverse the money to the recipient.Although it was a great thing bringing your friend into bitcoin, I welcome him to the freedom of money but please advice him not to invest that same money he wants to use to acquire the land because he might sometimes need it urgently just like you narrated and probably the market might be all red that time.  Quote from: glendall on October 20, 2022, 12:46:14 PMyour story is very confusing for this bank problem, if you use an atm machine if the receipt comes out automatically the funds you send will definitely come in. He didn't use the bank ATM but a Point of sale machine and even if the receipt was out then the funds must have been transferred to the account registered in the POS machine/device",

Some persons find the story confusing, I mean due to delay of his transactions by banking network he couldn't get what he wanted with his money because of third party centralized system. He got all his money later. Assuming it was bitcoin he was using or had a bitcoin holdings, it could have saved him from not buying the land,that was why decided to have a bitcoin holdings.I hope you are now more clear with my writing",

Hopefully another opportunity will present itself and then there will be no delay. Since you are like a mentor to him in the crypt space, you should point him to the place where he can gain all the basic knowledge regarding how it works. It is no longer news that bank can not be 100% reliable especially in times when you need them the most. i wish him good luck in his crypto journey and hope some day he will also mentor someone else into the community.",

This was how Dickson could not purchase the land the land he wanted to buy with the  money.  Your story may be true, but it sounds too overcooked. Correct me if I am wrong, but I have encountered a same similar challenge with failed transactions at POS & ATM centers, and when the complain is conveyed to the bank either via their customer care line or physically visit, the reply is usually, \"fill that form (they tell you the name of the form to fill), after filling and submitting it, they tell you to wait for seven working days and not one month''. Even if it turns out that maybe due to some delay it extends to one month, they usually do not tell you to wait one month\".Secondly, your friend probably could not purchase the land because it was not meant for him, it is always good to look at the positive sides of things. If he still wants to get a land, with patience, he can still get a good land that he will get without stress.Quote from: Frankolala on October 19, 2022, 12:11:31 PM Dickson said for two years now he hasn't collected money from this account. This shows that your friend is disciplined and can turn out to be a good HODLER. It is a good thing that you have shown him a better way to keep money he can do without for long term.I hope your friend who you said you have introduced here to this forum, will get to read through this thread and possibly make an indication that he is the Dickson that is the subject character of our discuss.",

In short, this is the most likely thing you can do if you really want to make people aware about bitcoin in your community.I haven't had many bad experiences with the bank and its services, but it actually now makes me a little distrustful of it as a very worthwhile place to keep money. Of course I think you need to think about how money works for you rather than you forever working for money, and if this mindset starts to exist then I believe investing is the way out.

But when you have to deal with some system failures and delays of crediting of your own money, they'll just tell you to be patient and wait until it's reflected on your account. We can't do with that system of theirs if they're slow in times of need of their customers. It is to be expected in most banks since they've got most of their transactions slow if it's coming from a transfer to another bank and that's usually what happens. And much worse if the transfer comes from offshore. By the way, with that pricing of land there, it's cheap to be honest. Where are you from OP?",

I have had such an experience and it was rectified in four working days. QuoteSecondly, your friend probably could not purchase the land because it was not meant for him, it is always good to look at the positive sides of things. If he still wants to get land, with patience, he can still get good land that he will get without stress.The young man just lost an opportunity to buy a land maybe at a give away price because of this annoying transaction challenges of conventional banks.. It is true that another opportunity would come but he just lost one.Most people from the developed world might not understand how terrible the financial system in Africa is. In Africa, you would suffer to deposit your money, suffer to withdraw it, and suffer to rectify any transaction issue. That is why Nigerians are embracing bitcoin because of its flexibility and accessibility. I also hope you told your friend that centralized platforms are not the best to HODL Bitcoin. You did a good job because there is joy when one person joins the bitcoin space and he could be a medium to attract more people to bitoin.",

This is a amount which is deducted from the account but beneficiary do not get it for some reason. Since this transaction was done at POS let’s say it failed at terminal itself but since the account info was read by system it deducts the amount but failed to respond the query to other party. This is very common issue with the banking. Mostly this happens with Credit cards a lot. This amount so called pending authorisation is usually credited back in a 45 days window.
