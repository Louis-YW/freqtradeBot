      "body": "Very nice that there is such a big scene of people modding this wallet and creating accessories for it. If I have the opportunity I will definitely try to create a high quality casing for a wallet like this to be able to offer it at a competitive price point to other mainstream wallets. Because so far not really any hardware wallet I know does qualify what I consider a well built case. Well built will for me especially include some kind of moisture and water protection.People may ask why this is necessary but most of those people are relatively new to the crypto world. After 10 years and many destroyed USB Sticks with wallet.dat files on them you will get more cautiousÂ  What would maybe be possible would be fill the case with Silikone. Does someone has experience with that?",

Not necessarily anything malicious directed towards Bitcoin wallets, but even at the ridiculously low price points that you could find and online there are still a ton of counterfeits out there. I'm assuming that they are just cheap knockoffs being passed off as the less cheap real thing. But in the end you don't have a verifiable source of where some of these chips came from or even who did what at the factory when they were assembled.Why anyone would create a pirate / clone M5 stack is beyond me, but they are out there -Dave",

I think otherwise the profit would be to small. Is there a good way to see if a chip is real or counterfeit?Yes & no.If you buy from them: https://shop.m5stack.com/ you can probably assume it's real. And I would think the ones coming out of their approved resellers are also real.Beyond that, I don't think you can. A tech I know bought a bunch from them and when he needed more went to what he thought was a reputable site since at the time M5 had no stock. When one died and he sent it back to M5 it came back as not made by us. Looking at them side by side they were the same. Even in the same packing. Their attitude was we sell them and so do these people, getting it elsewhere you are on your own.So, yes people will clone a $25 thing. Might not even be for evil reasons, just something cheap to make with a good profit margin. There are even youtube videos about people selling counterfeit IC chips in the $3 range so.....Â  Â https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12u_hBkHB88-Dave",

Also keep in mind that compromising device like this would not just be about compromising a hardware Bitcoin wallet, it would be about compromising thousands of IoT things that could be anywhere doing anything giving who knows whom access to who knows what.Getting some Bitcoin out of the deal would just be a bonus, but how many people would buy some like the field tech I know, and then hook these devices up to whatever and have no clue that they're not original hardware. They look like it, they act like it, but they're not. So who the heck knows what is embedded deep down inside. Could be nothing and these were just cheap knockoffs that they were selling , or they could have some vicious code buried somewhere. Personally I'm going with the benign theory and people are just out to make a buck. But why risk it, which is why I and then you pointed out that anybody getting these should only be buying them from m5stack.com or their approved suppliers. -Dave",

But now that I think about it, this fear can be easily bypassed.. the more hardware wallets launch and the more complicated these things get, the more I start loving the idea of a traditional cold storage wallet by transforming old devices into the cold storage. Itâ€™s not as convenient as a device like Ledger, but it gets the job done better than any other such device in my opinion. Why even bother purchasing possibly counterfeit boards and all if maybe thereâ€™s a pre-Bitcoin era laptop out there in the attic laying down & waiting for you to give it life again?",

Just create a seed and some adresses offline and store them securely on a metal plate. Then completely reset the device that you use for creating those informations. Simply store 80% off your bitcoin on those adresses and never worry about anything again. With 20% still liquid you should usually not worry about having to move the other 80% regularly.Most hardware wallets also have the disadvantage that they are pretty expensive and if you plan to buy multiple ones then you will mess up your profits pretty big.",
