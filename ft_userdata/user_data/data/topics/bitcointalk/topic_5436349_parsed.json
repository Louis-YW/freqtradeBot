  "content": "Somehow, the announcement from 1inch Network of its hardware wallet was left without due attention of the community, which I will try to fix.  Link to this news in their ANN's thread. Device Features:- 2.7\" E-Ink touch screen.- Corning Gorilla Glass 6.- Steel frame.- Airgapped.- The ability to store several seed phrases at once.- Any buttons or connectors are missing.- Built-in Li-Po battery.- Wireless charger.- Waterproof.- Thickness - 4 mm.- Weight - 70 grams.The estimated launch time for the product is Q4 2023.Article on their blog - https://blog.1inch.io/introducing-the-1inch-hardware-wallet-47e2a2a8d5a0Article on cointelegraph - https://cointelegraph.com/news/1inch-launches-proprietary-hardware-wallet-as-self-custody-trend-growsWhat will be your opinion about this device? Let's discuss what you like and don't like about 1inch Network hardware wallet.P.S. It seems that a new trend in HW design is emerging and now most devices will look about the same (with similar functionality). Remember Ledger Stax.",

      "body": "Looks cool, but no button might be a bit troublesome if the screen is prone to failure. I'd wait for further reviews that test how reliable the screen is since I've seen a few posts about LED failure on multiple HW devices this past few days. Personally, I want a USB-C just in case the battery dies, so I can still use it with my laptop/phone.At the end of the day, we need more testing. Q4 is still far away. It is their first product too, so we'll see. Hopefully, they don't cheap out and make it so expensive that it no longer looks appealing for somebody that wants alternatives from Trezor/Ledger.Quote from: m2017 on January 22, 2023, 12:25:10 PMIt seems that a new trend in HW design is emerging and now most devices will look about the same (with similar functionality). Remember Ledger Stax.I can see the similarity. Not really surprising new products will try to imitate the design since Ledger is one of the popular manufacturers. It is hard to tell if the product is designed after or before Stax was announced though. More competition is good anyway, I don't mind a similar-looking device if the features, security, etc are competitive.",

The local board and the main section differ in the reading audience and therefore, I considered it not superfluous to add information about 1inch hardware wallet here.I appreciate your opinion and attitude towards this device model, but I am sure that this device will have many fans. Good or bad, not for me to decide.The manufacturer has stated that it is creating a device similar to the old iPhone models. Even the color scheme of devices copies this. Also, there will be a limited edition with pink and gold plating, as stated by the manufacturer.Yes, that's right, the $99 price tag looks high, but iPhones are also guilty of this. I think that the visual appeal of the device can overpower the frugality of buyers.It is necessary to wait for information about what the source code will be.Personally, I have an opinion that it will be a beautiful and expensive toy that doesn't perform the functions of a hardware wallet very well in terms of security. The manufacturer creates its first device and may not yet have the relevant experience, just as you said, unknown components (secure elements) and the source code is questionable.",

I think that the visual appeal of the device can overpower the frugality of buyers.It is difficult to compare them to iPhone which definitely has more reputation to back up their price. It is probably fairer to compare to similar HW from another company. Selling a product that is $50 cheaper when the competitor is priced at $200 and has more reputation is not that appealing, at least for me.

People should wait and see how 1inch handles the launch, whether the product is reliable or not etc before buying it, even if it becomes cheaper in the end. Personally, I'd use my old phone/laptop/live OS to store my crypto instead of buying this at launch.",

Ledger has been on the cryptomarket for many years, while the 1inch is only just taking its first steps. 1inch is already in a catch-up position, but it is not known who will dominate among the HW manufacturers in 5-10 years. This business is such that always need to develop, keep up with the new needs of users and offer them in a timely manner. Sometimes, newcomers manage to better understand the desires of customers and this allows them to get ahead. I don't know if this will be the case with 1inch.On the other hand, no revolutionary idea is complete without many dead ends. Perhaps such devices will serve as a foundation for new and fresh ideas.",
