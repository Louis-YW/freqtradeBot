Feeling like a Swiss bank-vault in the hand, coming in a 32 grams. This 2020 specimen of an original rainbow layered variant of the 2020 LEALANA monero series. The face of this coin shimmers and refracts light, unlike the standard coins issued within this series. Being one of the first three-hundred coins where RAINBOW layering has been applied by LEALANA. Crisp lines and Hawaiian aesthetics meet in a dashing compliment. Provoking feelings of security, durability and robustness. This coin has been encapsulated by the highly esteemed grading agency Professional Coin Grading Services located in Newport Beach California. On the obverse of the instrument can be noted an illustrious and highly complex holographic foil. A large M for monero can be noted shimmering hypnotically within the light. The hologram features several points of holographic refraction as well as dynamic points of tension and dissemination. Exuding an air of sophisticated calculation and cryptographic calibration.

Coin numbers in a particular set will be of the same random number.\" and that the maker charged 350$ extra to let you select numbers. Or... as more you buy as larger is the premium. Should be vice versa.",
