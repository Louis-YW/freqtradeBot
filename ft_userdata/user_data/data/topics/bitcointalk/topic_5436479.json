This player is only 18 years old and starting to gain the trust to play in Real Valladolid's main squad, since then he has been able to attract interest from several clubs including Arsenal. Not only Arsenal but even Liverpool had already taken an interest in this young player. Arsenal need a stock of right-backs to back up their main players. And their effort I think is good because it prioritizes young players, it's good because young players like this can be a future asset for a club.He is too young for having a nice spot on a professional team like that. However, he maybe a good investment for a future purpose. 18 year old is very young compare to other players.
