My question here is: 1.

Could there be able possible way of recovering from such an incident? Can those fee be returned to the person by the miners? Or let him just consider everything as his lose and live with it. It’s really disheartening to read such a story, as this could really be a big lose to the sender as this is worth more than half a million dollars.",

This is definitely the obvious reason, Maybe he might have decided to use use 19satoshi and the rate was actually on bitcoin and ended been a bitcoin. This is seriously a costly mistake and could happen to anybody not just someone lacking knowledge Because I don’t believe just a random user could actually have all this bitcoin in their possession if they weren’t knowledgeable Quote2.

Yes there is possibility of getting a return from a the miner, they have been reports before of cases like this. Hopefully if the story trends and it is mined by a reputable miner and they wish to return then they could to the sending address. But if they don’t we can’t actually blame them.

I don’t see this as a mere error which could just occur any how, can this even happen? Or are their wallets which are programmed to make such a mistake on their own, because all the wallets which I have used before users I have never come across fees which are higher than the transacted amount, unless the sender is the person who will use their hand to increase the fee by itself, maybe that’s where this error can come in.",

This could only work if the pool had internally included the transaction in their block. However, I find it unlikely in this case because the transaction was publicly broadcast, so F2Pool would have no way of knowing who will mine that block. Besides, Chun Wang from F2Pool already stated that he will put these 20 BTC on hold for now and wait three days for the owner to claim them.",

I don't think that there are some ways to recover the money... At least with this legal status of cryptocurrencies and under these circumstances of money loss. Also, this transaction could be vital for him (to pay for something urgent).",

It is just amazing to see  this kind of error happening all because this happens to be Paxos. Well, am hoping they are learning this big lesson and let's see if the miner or the miner pool will eventually return such a huge amount for a single transaction.",

I believe this to be a costly mistake by the sender. It is possible that the sender probably might not be in a stable state of mind because I see no reason why such an amount would go in for such a transaction with fees much lower than it is.On the aspect of returning the transaction fee, I think that is under probability because it would be assumed by the miner that the sender wanted the transaction to scale up much faster so therefore decided to increase the fee. To think of the miner returning the fee I don't think that would be feasible. Of it truly happens that such mistake is coming from paxos,  I doubt if the miner would agree because exchange has so far ripped many people of their assets and when it happens like this the reverse is always the case. This is likely a 50/50 scenario for both parties.",

Firstly, it's possible that the individual who mistakenly set the fees made an error during the customization process. Occasionally, UI bugs can also be responsible for such errors, although instances where the UI fails to accurately register user input are rare. Aside from these two reasons, other possibilities seem to have a very low likelihood, perhaps around 0.01%.As for the prospects of recovery, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, in the past, there was a more surprising event where an 80BTC fee was paid, and there were recovery options offered. I don't have extensive knowledge of that specific case, so I recommend conducting a thorough investigation to ensure there's no plagiarism involved when discussing this incident.",

The mistake was on PayPal's side. They're in contact with the miner and it's possible Paxos will get it back, or at least most of it.
