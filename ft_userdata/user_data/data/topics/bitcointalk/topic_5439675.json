      "body": "OP, based on what MK4 said, when do you really decide that the price is low enough to buy? Let's take, for example, a coin that is trading at $100. Would you rush to buy it when it goes from $100 to $80? or when it drops to $50, please be more concise. When the price is low, how can you tell if that's the bottom of the token? is really not that easy to tell, mate. Perhaps if you are looking at investing in crypto for the short term, it isn't really favorable to my friends who have tried it; I don't know about others. Last year, I bought a coin that cost me $90 from one CEX because I thought the coin's value could not fall below what it was when I bought it, but today, the coin's value has gone from $90 to $20+Quote from: Solokan on February 13, 2023, 06:58:45 AMI want to ask everyone?what do you think causes people to behave like that, namely always buying at high prices,? but when the price is cheap he doesn't want to?How will you know when it's too cheap to buy? For altcoins, what happens after you buy the bottom and it cannot go up again and the team disappears? If it's a token or coin that the team is solidly behind with good intentions to add value to the coin, it doesn't matter if you buy high or low because the coin will definitely appreciate as time proceeds.",

A person could've bought bitcoin at sub $1000 prices in 2017; it then rallied to $3000+ in Q3 — which some people would deem \"expensive\" because of the rise; but then the price continued to rally up to the 2017 high of almost 20k. You could've easily missed this run of you had the mindset of \"not buying at high prices\" — as OP is portraying.",

For example in a bull market when new ATH keeps going higher, you'll be fine buying on previous ATH. Conversely, buying cheap can destroy you in a bear market where new ATL keeps going lower. Your previous ATL buy can be the new resistance or worse, the new ATH.A very fine example of people getting rekt because buying low is when LUNA (now LUNC) collapsed. At that time, $1 seemed dirt cheap and yet the price went to $0.0001.",

The best time to buy any coin is when the price is low, but if you are a long term investor you can buy Bitcoin at anytime (high or low), and if you are patient enough, you'd still accrue ROI in the long term.

If they're investing because it's in the news then it's likely the price has done a lot better than whatever the journalist that wrote that article expected. If it's because more people are discussing it or something then it's likely the price has done the same too.I'm guessing there are a lot of people that ride crypto bull runs and then sit on the sidelines once it drops off and they've had their last sale just waiting for a better opportunity to buy. There may be arguments most cryptos become more secure as they're rising too (there's more people watching them too see if there's vulnerabilities and normally more miners as well).",

So I'dn't gonna laugh at anyone buying bitcoins in any market situation.The OP basically invoking an asset to buy from the dip. He believes that one should buy when the price of a coin is going down and stop when the price of that coin is going up. These words are very familiar among investors. Every investor may be well aware of these factors but sometimes the erratic behavior of the market makes it difficult to make quick decisions. Because the crypto market is volatile and when the market is bullish, the price of almost all coins increases at a huge rate and how sustainable that increase which is unknown to everyone. If everyone knew then they would neither buy high nor sell low. It mainly depends on the market situation.",

With a consistent strategy like dollar cost averaging (DCA), you will not need to worry about the if the prices of bitcoins ae high or low when you are about to buy.

The same method also implies long-term investing, which many are not ready for because they do not want to keep their money in something they do not even understand and consider risky.What you say about the amounts that someone buys is absolutely correct, because buying 1 BTC for $16k and buying it for $24k is definitely a big difference, but buying $100 worth of BTC in the same price range is not exactly something that most people will profit from. Are there still people who think they have to buy 1 BTC? Oh yes, they really exist - because the number 1 for most of them is something just a little higher than zero, and 0.00100000 BTC doesn't look like an attractive amount on the account.",
