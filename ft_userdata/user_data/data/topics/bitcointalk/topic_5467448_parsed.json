      "body": "Which exactly chip model did you replace?Possibly the chip you are trying to use might not be compatible, faulty, or become damaged during the replacement process. If you have an extra chip try to replace it again. But this time I recommend that you avoid applying excessive heat to the chip because chips are sensitive if you apply too much heat you are killing it.",

      "body": "Do you have any pictures of the chip you changed on the control board? and how did you know it was indeed that chip that needed replacing? fixing a miner CB is no easy task, anyone who attempts that needs to be highly skilled and know what they are doing, the fact that you are asking this question makes me think you are just trying to learn, and I hope that is the case because fixing a control board of an old miner that is worth less than $100 like the T15 is a waste of time and energy.",
