  "content": "I randomly saw this on the internet, where they recommended that having your SIM card passworded is one of the best security measures to prevent scammers from stealing your funds, especially if it is the SIM card you have used in registering with your bank. For instance, if you lose your phone and someone tries to gain access to your bank app or anything else, they would need the password you have set to do it successfully.Some comments:Comment 1QuoteIf you are using @myaccessbank, double wahala. I learned the hard way. The useless bank told me I should be happy they did not obtain loan on my behalf. He shock meComment 2Quote@It happened to me last year, my phone was stolen, My MTN sim has a password but I forgot to password my Glo sim which is link to my Children's account with Access bank, the perpetrator collected 28k in one of the account . Through wallet transfer without ATM ¬†CardComment 3QuoteMine too was access bank. They used my SIM to obtain a loan from Access Bank and a loan app. They bought airtime as they wanted.Access Bank is still dragging me till today for the loan repayment.Comment 4QuoteMine was A√ßcess bank too and Opay. Went to lodge a complaint at the bank and was told there's nothing they can do. That the person activated USSD on my sim. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Okay, what will now happen to my money that was withdrawn? She say, \"I'm sorry\" sorry for what again?Comment 5QuoteAswear you are lucky... I fell victim of this on the 21st of September it wasn't funny a loan of 300k was taken with my account ¬†@myaccessbank una no go d!e well. Your bank shall be liquidated very soonThere is an explanation on how to go about with putting the password.For Android smartphone: Open Settings,Go to Security and More SettingsTap on the SIM card lock optionSwitch on lock SIM card and enter the default PIN Then change pin to your preferred pinI am not sure about the default PIN; you can search the internet for it. Please be very careful; your SIM may get locked if you forget your PIN, and you would need to call their customer agents for your PUK.A solution I found for this issue is to use an eSIM, but who wants to go through this stress?There is a lot of information and personal experiences from other users shared on this thread - https://twitter.com/sledge_baba/status/1732790175846060158",

      "body": "I think we have discussed about this on this local board some months ago, but I am unable to find the topic. I am referring to a topic that educate how to avoid your money from being stolen on Opay, Kuda and banks.But emphasizing on how pin lock is very important makes this thread useful. Quote from: Davidvictorson on December 16, 2023, 04:28:52 PMA solution I found out for this issue is to use an eSIM but who wants to go through this stress?There is nothing hard in esim activation, but most phones are not supporting it. The phones that I know are supporting it are those most expensive phones that are two or more times expensive than midrange phones. Phones like Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, iPhone 15 Pro Max and Google Pixel 8 et cetera.",

      "body": "Cases of getting access to people's funds in the event of missing ¬†phones have become very rampant and a lot of people have ¬†their tales to share. Their was a time a friends phone was stolen from him on his way to night class and before he got to the night class all his funds have been taken away and when we went to be bank in the morning to look for help they didn't tell us anything reasonable at all, as a matter of fact, they could not even dictate the the account that the money was sent into.We are obviously in a situation where we are at our own mercy and our security is totally our own business , if you don't take your security seriously you will loose all your funds and no one will do any stuff about it.For me, I no de carry my security play oh, I de put password for almost anywhere when I know say an outsider fit get access to oh! Lass lass wetin be the worse case scenario if I put password for my sim? Is I not just blocking my sim and I guess that's way better than losing my funds.",

      "body": "This is interesting, but let‚Äôs also not forget that if you have your phone misplaced or stolen by a scammer, and if the phone is not locked and the scammer happens to have access to the phone without having to switch this phone off, this pin to some point might be a little useless as they can send, receive, and do whatever they want to without having to input any PIN code for authorization in the sim, unless they have to put the sim on another phone or the phone went off in their hand. If not for the main time, if the phone is not on passcode, the sim might be on PIN code, but they don‚Äôt lock in an instance unless I miss this feature.¬†Another thing I will also like to remind us of is that if you are an old SIM card owner, it should be interesting for you to go check your SIM card park fiat and get to confirm if the puk of the sim is safe and sound because if you are by chance to forget the pin you set and the sim is locked, it‚Äôs only the puk that can be used to unlock it unless you have to visit the nearest network provider's office.¬†And for those who bought a new sim from the roadside, before setting up the pin, always try to use a code irrespective of the network provider to get your puk from the sim first because what's written in most of the sim parks all these agents give now are not the original sim puk; they even use hands to write your sim mobile number on the paper for you. We should also practice safety while trying to protect our funds from being stolen.",
