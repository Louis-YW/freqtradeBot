In other words, if you tracked the index over the past years, you will get any pattern, or are you trying to be optimistic?The resistance barrier at 25K has been tested several times, and I am sure that it is now weaker than ever, but is demand sufficient to overcome this resistance? The coming days will answer, but if we are not able to break this barrier during the next 10 days, then it is likely that we will return to test the support level at 21K.",

It's going to take a while again until we see it.We're just 2 years away from the last and highest price that bitcoin has reached. The factor of halving is huge and that's why I'm saying that we might not see that by eoy. But nobody knows if something interesting happens by this eoy.",

We need to see how this weekly candle closes because if we engulf then it’s not looking good. We are going down mostly due to the high inflation numbers and people are worried about a 50bps hike in March. I think most people knew that another rate hike wasn’t off the table and we all knew that rates wouldn’t be cut in 2023 anyways.",

Normally technical analysis brings out patterns over many more weeks. In such a short term there is so much volatility which can be due to a variety of causes that it is difficult to draw conclusions. Such a rise was moderated the next day and now we are practically the same.What it does look like is that unless there is a catastrophe we are going to go up gradually. It seems that the worst is over. The rubbish and excessive leverage have been cleaned up, we are gradually approaching halving (there is still a year and a bit left) and we are still at a very cheap level if we look at it from a historical perspective, so I think it will be normal to go up little by little, with ups and downs, but with an upward trend in the medium term.",

Is this Whale manipulation or Bear market is over and we might see a new ATH by end of this year?None of what you said. Ok the market is up 11%. Is there any significant thing to that? I mean is it the first time we saw Bitcoin go up that price in a week? We've seen more Bitcoin's price increased way higher than that in the past months to years. Why does people have think of market manipulation or bear market is over or whatever it is if the market just went up 11% for a \"WEEK\". Remember it's a week not a day. We've seen Bitcoin going up more than 11% for a single day only, and yet there are people who are thinking negatively just because of what happened this week.  Amazing!!!Well, Bitcoin failed to surpass the $25,000 price again, and now sitting at the $24,000 range (nearly going below $24,000). Nothing new with regards to it's recent price movement. Just a regular price spike that's all. Don't think too much from it like it didn't happen in the past.",

Is this Whale manipulation or Bear market is over and we might see a new ATH by end of this year?It is possible that the price will drop below 25k but that shouldn't be the problem because it will still rise up and gradually, the price will rise from time to time. From history 11% rise in a week is nothing compared to 11% in a day. Bitcoin price shoots up within a twinkle of the eye and you will be amazed about the how this happened.From bitcoin history there must be a halving before the price gets to ATH,which we haven't experience yet. We are expecting bitcoin halving by next year,and halving comes earlier than expected, we might experience it ending of this year. Therefore bitcoin will hit its ATH at 2025 maybe at the first quarter of that year or later in 2025. Be patient with your investment and gradually cyclic movement will repeat itself.",

Whatever is happening now, my friend, is because there are investors positioned for the future.        Most people also know that as the value of bitcoin increases, others also follow that increase their value in the market, and these cryptos will not allow themselves to not follow bitcoin especially if they are included in the top altcoins.",

Is this Whale manipulation or Bear market is over and we might see a new ATH by end of this year?I don't think that the increase and correction in the Bitcoin price now is Whale manipulation, nor do I think that the Bear market is over so I won't make predictions for a new ATH at the end of this year. Because indeed Bitcoin still needs a bigger recovery this year so a new ATH might not happen immediately this year in Bitcoin.",
