Purchase copper membership is very important because posting images for your ANN thread will have an interest to others. I rushed to open your site as you have said and I quickly go to the TOS for the sensitive terms, it is quite long and it should also good if you will include FAQs for the frequent question for the users. However, this is what I have found in TOS and if you are in this country this gambling casino is not our place to play.(If you are physically located in Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada or Washington, the Russian Federation, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, as well as the Indian States Assam, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Telingana, Nagaland you cannot fund your wallet or play for cryptocurrencies)",

Feel free to check my portfolio from my profile page.By the way, welcome to the forum.This is truly not a regular gambling site that we can see in this forum. Reading how it is being played, I am curious if there will be players that will indeed be interested on this long-term.For free entrance, they are offering BAN prize, I believe new players will join on this one.Checking their contests, some are already playing this game. However, they may not have players from the forum yet.If they are not ready to hold sig campaign, offering reward for valid and valuable feedback is a great start, which they are holding now.",

Have some promotions as well, it can be a big help for this project. They have a very nice UI design and I love it. But I am not familiar with fantasy sports. I have seen fiat casinos advertised fantasy football supper picks, I don't know if it's same here.I'll visit the site help or FAQs to read more. What do you offer $10 for, are you running any kind of review campaign?If you can take the suggestion given above to get copper membership and have a good Ann thread design, it will be nice.Congratulations and welcome to the forum",

I’m new to fantasy sports as well still have no experience with this and upon visiting the site, its good to see the instructions. Though my concern is that, how much is the minimum deposit and withdrawal, and if there’s a KYC on this site before you play or withdraw?",

Quote from: goaldigger on November 19, 2022, 09:30:02 PMhow much is the minimum deposit and withdrawal, The minimum deposit is 0.005 BTC and the Minimum withdrawal is 0.001 BTC, I don't know why too much minimum deposit than a withdrawal, Usually another gambling site establishes withdrawals higher than the deposit.Quote from: goaldigger on November 19, 2022, 09:30:02 PMand if there’s a KYC on this site before you play or withdraw.I didn't find KYC is mandatory on  term , but I find it necessary, so when they find out if you (maybe) withdraw with big money or any special situations where need you to send the ID card or passport just to verify is real you.",

Btw those avatars or is it mascots look stunning not forgetting the cryptos they represent means the platform supports several crypto coins and players are spoiled for choice. The main product of the platform I believe is \"drafts\" and I see there are several pools both paid and free which is a big plus but I would like to see the popular leagues of football(soccer) added there which should also help grow your customer base. All in all great product DraftApes, looking forward to being a regular here",
