  "content": "This is the weekly timeframe of the BTC/USDTPrice don't go straight line, as a trader we should expect a bounce or a retracement after a great momentum. As you can see, the last 3 weeks of BTC/USDT was really good and finally, the price already hit the major resistance, It only means that the supply there are so high and the price already exhausted where we can expect that the price may go down up to its major support in around $19,000 to $20,000. The Major resistance is so strong at around $24,000 to $25,000. The BTC should consolidate more for the price have strong momentum to breakout.Is it bad or is it good? Even though that the price will finally retrace, it only means a good movement for BTC because it will only confirm that we are already in bullish. The chart of bitcoin is now creating higher highs and finally it will create a higher low. We should keep in mind that having a good risk management can help us to entry better and avoid cutting huge losses. Expect a red days in these coming days",

Does it looks good or bad? It depends on your view of the price. If you are a trader, then speculation and the change in the price means profits. If you are an investor, then the price increase is good for you.",

Although I agree with your point that we should see some sort of a correction to fall between 20k-21k range once more before flying harder, the fundamentals are going to decide the technicals. We will know soon. For me 25.2k area is where if the price goes, there is no stopping back upto 32k.",

Today I check the daily candle stick, it is showing a pattern that bitcoin may also rise to $25000 before the retracement, but analyses can be wrong.",

So unless something significant happens to the world economy again, it is highly unlikely to see any kind of major drops.Whether things are going to be good or bad depends on how healthy the trends from now on are going to be like. A healthy rise where the investors start coming back slowly and buy bitcoin before it shoots up is a good thing but panic buys where price shoots up and creates high volatility is never good.",

      "body": "It’s so early to conclude on this outcome because the current week is not yet over and we don’t if this week candle is a doji or not to confirm retracement. Using Bollinger Bands on the weekly timeframe chart shows the current price is sitting on the upper limit of the Bands meaning it’s either will break out above to break the current downward channel or a retracement will happened like what stated on your TA. But still it’s too early and needs a confirmation this weekend.Bitcoin usually make a strong move during weekends since this rally started. I don’t believe too on straight line when it comes to chart but the current rally is not the typical pump and hype buy can always occur anytime whenever traders feels that the current setback is a perfect opportunity to enter in Bitcoin.",

The resistance levels around 21,000 couldn't stop price to jump to 23,000 and now we have seen a little stop at 23,000.Hence, I think the next coming week is going to determine if the price level of 23k will be a strong resistance to push price down for a bull correction before the next move but for now, I'm going to stay and watch until the new week to avoid being trapped on the weekend because it is always funny during the weekend.",

The Major resistance is so strong at around $24,000 to $25,000. The BTC should consolidate more for the price have strong momentum to breakout.But, we have not tested around $23,700 levels for only once which means in my opinion, we can expect bitcoin market to keep trying to penetrate $24k to $25k levels before making a retracement. Yeah, it might be too early to expect for a retracement. Hopefully we are still in the middle of a short term bullish wave which may extend up to $27k levels in coming days.Quote from: DevilSlayer on January 27, 2023, 05:52:46 AMIs it bad or is it good?

We may not have bitcoin to break $20k levels; so we may keep buying around $21k-$20k levels.",

Be careful because price may dump in these following days.  Nice analysis, I’m waiting for this retracement around 25K area before I short since it’s the known strong resistance but 24K grows to become much stronger resistance which means those who put sell order on 25K level reposition a little bit lower that result for this strong resistance.I know that this retracement is healthy but I’m worried about the short position number. The current number of short position on Bitfinex is still very low while the price is already correcting which means this correction is due to retail traders taking profit already. There’s might be a chance that the support will break once this bear get the opportunity to control the trend by injecting huge volume of short position once again.

The market so far doesn't seem to want to see a retracement, but I also wouldn't expect it to break out of the <$25k bottom any time soon. Which leaves it doing what it has been doing for a bit now - just hovering in the $22k/23k/24k range.

Does this mean that it is already bearish? The answer is No! I expected that the price will resist in this area many times because it is a major resistance where the possibility of resisting in that area is high. Why the movement of the bitcoin in weekly timeframe is considered as good? The answer is because of the consolidation. The current price of the bitcoin is moving inside the box where it building a momentum upwards. It can be a good sign that there's something is cooking. We can only be invalidated if the Major support will not hold. Expect a bull run if the price of the bitcoin breakouts in the Major Resistance especially in $25,000.",
