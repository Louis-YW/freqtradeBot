I have been deducted over $200 before because of the funding fee of a shit coin on the future market.I just tried to trade a shit coin on an exchange with $250, 1x short position USDⓈ-M Futures. The funding fee credit or debit would be in some minutes to this time.Quote[xxxxxxxx] USDⓈ-M Futures Funding Fee NotificationThe UNFIUSDT position in your Binance USDⓈ-M Futures account (************) will be charged a funding fee at 2023-09-04 08:00:00 (UTC+0). The expected funding rate is -0.726%, and you will be charged a fee of 2.05262334 USDT.If I close the position before the time stated, the exchange will not deduct anything?I think the fee will not be deducted if I close the position before the next 8 hours began. What do you think?",

If you close your position before the next funding time, you will not be charged the funding fee. However, keep in mind that there may be other fees associated with closing your position, such as trading fees.",

What do you think?OP with the statement Yes you won't be charged the Funding fees if you do exit before the time interval, you need to know that fees work differently on every platform there can be slightly different terms and conditions on every platform, as bid-ask spread does. So fully ensure how much a trade is costing you in terms of the fees all you need to do is go through the platform fees structure documentation. Becasue it is highly possible when you close the trade you will be charged the trading fees and if not may be there is another possibility that you've been already charged the trade fees when you open the position.I don't know why but Paltofrm does such things",

So, if buyers push the perpetual contract up in price something has to be introduced to push the price against the spot price again.Here, perpetuals are designed so the short sellers are getting paid (by long takers paying the funding rate) to take a position to push the price down again toward the spot price.Here, traders who are going to take a short position anyway can take advantage of getting paid by taking a short position.",

But if the market situation still allows for more profits then I think letting the 8 hour fee be deducted is no problem. Because it will be replaced by the profits from our positions which are still open and continue to make profits. But if it is in unprofitable position then I will close it immediately.On Binance I prefer to use fees with BNB. So trading costs become cheaper.",

If altcoin pump very well, I noticed many of them later get dumped. But they are generally a risky trading asset. When I am trading such altcoins, it is like I am gambling because there are many that do not follow bitcoin price.Quote from: logfiles on September 04, 2023, 10:47:23 PMFunding fee is deducted only every 8 hours or 1 hour (I remember an exchange that would charge hourly, but it was a few years back). Which exchange is that? I am using more than 5 exchanges and all of them have 8 hours range funding rate.Quote from: adaseb on September 05, 2023, 04:31:22 AMYou can’t make any money this way. Believe me I tried. What will happen is the funding rate will be near identical on all the exchanges.I have seen a funding rate of 2% before. I was deducted $222 dollars that day. Although, I noticed that I made a profit of almost the same amount too which makes me not to gain or lose. I was using leverage that time, the story was not good but filled with losses because of high leverage.Quote from: cryptocointrade.com on September 05, 2023, 06:26:54 AMHere, traders who are going to take a short position anyway can take advantage of getting paid by taking a short position.That depends on the funding rate. If it is negative, funding fee would be deducted from those that short as in the example in the OP.",

You would need to pay fees to open and close the trades twice on both exchanges. In volatile situations, the funding rates of different shitcoin perpetual contracts in different exchanges can get abnormal, especially exchanges with not so good liquidity. It's possible to make profits if it goes over 1% and the trader is using high leverage, but of course there is a thin line between making profits and lossesQuote from: Oshosondy on September 05, 2023, 07:59:06 AMWhich exchange is that?

Things change in a flash.I did not mean a trader must predict a next funding rate and try to get profit from funding rate on exchange. It is only very minor profit and traders should only take it if they can have both a draw for their position closing and minor profit from funding rate at the same time.They close their current positions because feeling risk if they let those positions open longer. So it is good if with risk management for their positions, they can still have minor profit from funding rate which is not their main concern.",
