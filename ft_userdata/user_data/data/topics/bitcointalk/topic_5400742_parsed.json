  "content": "PrologueSo, a month ago, I was trying to find out which hardware wallet should I buy. My conditions were simple; it had to be open-source and I had to make the purchase in the most private way possible. My only option was to buy BitBox 1, but it happens to be old, deprecated and their developers aren't known for being privacy seekers, which really underwhelmed me. My only choice was to purchase a hardware wallet outside my country using a poste restante, which I didn't want to do for personal reasons. But, then dkbit98 suggested something I hadn't thought of; do the job with a Pi.Quote from: dkbit98 on April 29, 2022, 09:47:23 AMI don't know if you want to use hardware wallet just for Bitcoin or for other shitcoins, but if it's only for good old BTC than you can buy Raspberry Pi zero locally and make your own SeedSigner signing device.And so I did. I bought a RPi Zero, a camera, a little screen and a few other stuff, and built a SeedSigner; an air-gapped hardware wallet signing device, which takes security into the next level.  Disclaimer: There's no affiliation with SeedSigner and this thread isn't sponsored. I just bought it and share my thoughts.Review In summary:Pros:Open source, github page: https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsignerAir-gappedRelatively cheap ($50~$100)Separation between private key storage and signingCan be bought anonymously (without KYC, AOPP etc.)Cons:Little hard setupExperimental software; the project is, well from what I can judge, in an early stageWorks only with BlueWallet, Nunchuk, Sparrow, Specter DesktopIt's forcing you to generate the entropy yourselfAlright, let's begin.SeedSigner aims to give a solution to one problem; the cost and complexity of multi-sig usage. However, at the same time, it can be used for single-sig setups, lowering the cost of your \"hot\" storage as well. There's nothing saved inside the SD card, besides your settings which is optional, therefore there's less danger for funds' loss. When you shut down SeedSigner, it erases the seeds; they're meant to be kept temporarily in memory and you have to import the seed on each startup. And that's basically one of the features that makes SeedSigner differentiate. This has the following advantage: You can have the device on plain sight (don't, but you get the idea). As far as I understand, this is implemented to reduce the risk of money loss. For cold storage, create the QR code and find a good hiding spot. For daily transactions, you can just insert it into your drawer etc., without minding much.For quick imports, use QR scanning:Unfortunately, you can't create a new seed with an internal RNG. SeedSigner somewhat forces you to generate the entropy yourself. Either with a picture or dice rolls.   I get the spirit of \"trust none!\", but that's just wrong. It should allow you to generate random entropy, even with a warning. Furthermore, it gives a false sense of security. If you don't test the dice is decently fair, then you shouldn't generate a wallet. Period. Quoting a forum legendary is needed here:Quote from: nullius on March 26, 2021, 05:05:11 AMCoders who make their own ad hoc randomness schemes are like kids playing with matches.Hashing a picture can also be problematic, see thread: Turn photos into Bitcoin wallets. So, here's a feedback: Include /dev/urandom. Simple. Do it for those who want to avoid this fuss.This is how they justify it:One thing I also don't understand is how the rolls are 50/99 exactly. Doesn't each give 1.66 bits of entropy on average?  These are the features:Quote from: https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsignerFeature Highlights:Calculate word 12/24 of a BIP39 seed phraseCreate a 24-word BIP39 seed phrase with 99 dice rollsCreate a 24-word BIP39 seed phrase by taking a digital photoTemporarily store up to 3 seed phrases while device is poweredGuided interface to manually create a SeedQR for instant input (demo video here)BIP39 passphrase / word 25 supportNative Segwit Multisig XPUB generation w/ QR displayScan and parse transaction data from animated QR codesSign transactions & transfer XPUB data using animated QR codes (demo video here)Live preview during photo-to-seed and QR scanning UXOptimized seed word entry interfaceSupport for Bitcoin Mainnet & TestnetSupport for custom user-defined derivation pathsOn-demand receive address verificationUser-configurable QR code display densityResponsive, event-driven user interfaceOne thing I've forgotten to say is that, besides open-source, the code is also easy to read. It's 100% written in Python, and there aren't many files to check. It doesn't take more than an hour. The src/seedsigner/models is what's all about.How to use itThese are the steps to spend money:Create a seed.Export the master public key with a QR code.Import the master public key to a wallet software. (From the available, I prefer Sparrow*)Create a transaction.Export the PSBT in QR code from your computer's screen.Scan the QR code from SeedSigner.Sign the transaction from Seed Signer.Export the signed transaction in QR code.Scan the QR code from your computer.Broadcast the signed transactionTa-da! Transaction signed in the air!  *Sparrow is a wallet I'd never used, as I put Electrum above others, but I'll have to admit it's good. Perhaps even better than Electrum. The reason you can't use Electrum (at least not easily) is because it doesn't support animated QR codes, which is the way SeedSigner exports xpub keys and signs transactions. That's because the screen isn't big enough. No, these cool, freshly 3D printed mined bitcoins in the images above aren't included in the SeedSigner Kit.",

      "body": "Excellent review.In all honesty I feel the idea is a lot better than the execution.  I had considered conducting this experiment myself but decided against it feeling it's not as safe, secure, or functional as an air-gapped Pi (or other PC) running an open-source OS such as Ubuntu.  My main concern with the setup is that you have to keep your seed phrases accessible or pull them out of hiding once in a while, which exposes them to significantly more risk than is necessary.  Conversely, an air-gapped PC can store your seeds relatively safely behind strong encryption, and multiple layers of encryption can be implemented.  Once you're seeds are paired with wallets they never need to be exposed again.Theft of loss of SeedSigner appears to pose slightly less risk, assuming the seed is thoroughly purged from the system.  I haven't audited the code, but I assume the seed is stored in ram while the device is in use.  If the OS uses swap files to store the seed it can retain the information unless it's overwritten with random bits as the device is being powered down.  I don't know about you, but none of that would really ease my concerns if the device was stolen.  Again, a thoroughly encrypted OS is likely to buy you more time to discover the loss of the device and move your funds.One benefit to the experiment, however is that if you tire of it you have all you need to convert it into an air-gapped PC (with the exception that I would want a bigger screen.)All in all, it looks like a really fun project whether you use it to manage funds or not.",

(This may go without saying, but it's not a best practice to trust a private key generated by a bitcoin storage device that does not incorporate some kind of user input into the process.)It turns out that the simplest, easiest, and perhaps best way to capture entropic data is via the randomness inherent in the movements of the physical world that surrounds us. ~snip~",

The issue with this (besides the slight argument from authority) is that it's a little bit like the issue of 'n-th generation PoS blockchain' - if you're building sophisticated, fancy stuff on top of a bad foundation, you won't get the best results and will always be restricted by the limits of your foundation. PRNG is only pseudo-random and doesn't use any 'real' source of entropy; just algorithms that try to get as close as possible to that. Sure, they're well researched and gradually improved in decades of research, but they remain 'pseudo'-random.Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generatorA [PRNG] is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers. The PRNG-generated sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined by an initial value, called the PRNG's seed [...].Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generatorA [...] true random number generator (TRNG) is a device that generates random numbers from a physical process, rather than by means of an algorithm. Such devices are often based on microscopic phenomena that generate low-level, statistically random \"noise\" signals, such as thermal noise, the photoelectric effect, involving a beam splitter, and other quantum phenomena. These stochastic processes are, in theory, completely unpredictable for as long as an equation governing such phenomena is unknown or uncomputable, and the theory's assertions of unpredictability are subject to experimental test. This is in contrast to the paradigm of pseudo-random number generation commonly implemented in computer programs.",

Some may have more 'sensors' or other ways to acquire external noise. It should also be kept in mind that a big challenge of hardware entropy is digitizing an analog entropy source without 'moulding' it in a certain way that introduces a bias, which would detrimentally affect the entropy.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on June 05, 2022, 11:18:50 AMQuote from: n0nce on June 05, 2022, 09:58:23 AMSure, they're well researched and gradually improved in decades of research, but they remain 'pseudo'-random.Does this make them more susceptible to a brute-force attack? I'm trying to understand what's the weakness of pseudo-randomness, but I feel like beating a dead horse.To be honest, I don't think a state-of-the-art PRNG (especially if it does use external sources of entropy as you described) will be realistically easier to attack (think of stuff like a hundred years instead of 200 and numbers like this, if not higher). Even though it might be off by magnitudes from a true randomness source, today's software randomness is usually good enough for all practical scenarios.If /dev/urandom really incorporates what I'd call true randomness and doesn't degrade its entropy too much, it means it's trying to get more and more similar (or even become) a TRNG in the long run. This again shows that on paper, a TRNG is always better; it's just that it's not always feasible or practical to implement in off-the-shelf devices. Even an outdated, seed-based PRNG is enough for most (read: non-cryptographic) use-cases, like generating random bytes for something.By the way, a quick web search revealed, that apparently, /dev/random is better for cryptograhpy.Quote from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3690273/did-i-understand-dev-urandom/33471611#33471611/dev/urandom is best used when:You just want a large file with random data for some kind of testing.You are using the dd command to wipe data off a disk by replacing it with random data.Almost everywhere else where you don’t have a really good reason to use /dev/random instead./dev/random is likely to be the better choice when:Randomness is critical to the security of cryptography in your application – one-time pads, key generation.Actually, this seems like pretty sensible advice before generating a seed from /dev/random or /dev/urandom:Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev/randomThe current amount of entropy and the size of the Linux kernel entropy pool, both measured in bits, are available in /proc/sys/kernel/random/ and can be displayed by the command cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail and cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/poolsize respectively.",

The one I have does the job nevertheless. No, I don't have a 3D printer.Dude, you can print the case anywhere you want in your local area for few bucks  I am sure you can find bunch of ads from people and services who are offering 3d printing services, most I know are 3d designers or just owners of 3d printers.They don't even know what they are printing when I order it from them, it's dirt cheap and I don't have to wait more than few hours or a day for delivery.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on June 05, 2022, 09:40:40 AMSeriously though, why isn't an RNG generating true random results, and if it isn't, which opens up a philosophical question, why does the TRNG, indeed, generate true randomness? To be precise, urandom is a Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CSPRNG), and to be honest, I'm a complete noob when it comes to this field, but I somewhat agree with this perspective. It's simple math, and if you are not mathematician you can't understand it easily.Companies wouldn't waste millions of dollars to achieve true randomness if gameboy, nintendo or raspberry pi was able to achieve this.Research this subject deeper to understand it better, key point is if something can be reproduced or not.",
