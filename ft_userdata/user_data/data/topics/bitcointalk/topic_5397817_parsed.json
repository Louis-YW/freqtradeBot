  "content": "The origin of every Political history has either a transition from traditional background or religious ground due to claimed roles gods and religious norms plays in the governance of societies. A good example is the Yoruba pre-colonial political system that evolved from the Yoruba traditional Political system.Politics in religion simply means the practice of politics in the religious institution. Religion in this sense, I mean an all inclusive denomination that has to do with the believe on supernatural powers.Specifically, the Christain religion has given account of it's own history on the origin of politics which related it to the Jews and Roman trado-political system. The Bible said, the first system of politics or government was a theological system where God ruled through an indirect system, example was the role played by Samuel during David's reign as king of Isreal.The second transition was the monarchical system where a king rule in royalty as being guided by the traditional ethics. At this point, there was a conflict on who to control government between the church or those who control the state in Rome, as the church still strived to control the Politics and governance of the state. Religion finally lost its strong hold on the Roman state at the end of the Wesphelia convention of 1645.Let me stop here but, anticipate the next content which is RELIGION IN POLITICS.",
