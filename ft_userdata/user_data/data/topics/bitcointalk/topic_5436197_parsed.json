Or in my mind how can a 18 year old girl take several *BBCs in? What has become of this world really. IMHO both powerslap and gang bang are unacceptable practices.*= big black cocks. lol.",

Slapping someone who cannot even defend themselves, that is just giving a concussion. There will be seriously injured people from this new sport. Definitely I can give it time until someone suffers a major brain injury. I am sickened that people would actually watch and why is this even legal in a country like the US.",

Iâ€™m very surprised to see Dana White involved in something like this, I suppose he is the money man though & he will go where the money is.I really hope this sport is stopped soon, before there is a life changing brain injury.",
