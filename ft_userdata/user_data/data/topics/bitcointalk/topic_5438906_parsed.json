  "content": "You need to accumulate DCA like you buying everyday with 2-5$ each coin.You pick the 5-7 top coins and everytime when there is bigger price swing to up you sell like 85-90% so 15%-10% left and repeat.Main mistake about DCA IS that people don't sell when there is huge price swing.If you want to be wealthy like whales you do Same they never sell all their coins when they want to make Money then they just sell 85-90% tiny bit always left in the wallet.But most retail traders make mistake they sell all but u dont need to sell all.Also they dont sell when price swing up a lot they still hold.For example SOL went to 12$ now it's over 20$ so off course you should sell like 85-90% of your coins.This way you can make cash flow always and you hold assets and only sell some % to make profit.Instead of futures trading i been doing DCA accumulating coins i Lost with futures so all the futures loss i gained with this stradgey back.With this method i dont need Even anymore the futures trading.Remember DCA daily when Market goes a lot down then buy with bigger money off course but don't forget to sell when prices Are from the lows up 70-90% then you get more cash more profit to accumulate Even more and more that's why the rich get richer and whales get richer becouse they accumulate by time like this and they hodle their coins their assets and they dollar Cost averaging down and they buy Even more when prices going deep down.And that's what is the secret of wealth",

      "body": "There's really no one strategy that will work on every asset. While that could work on short to mid-term trades, if you're long-term bullish on a certain asset, why do you necessarily need to sell at a 85-90% increase; especially in bull markets? That's one way to get left in the sidelines.",

      "body": "I agree with your DCA approach to the cryptocurrency market. It is a clever strategy for accumulating assets over time and making a profit in the process. The key to success with DCA is patience, discipline, and having a strategy for when to sell. By selling a part of your assets when prices are high, you may produce cash flow and have more money available to purchase further holdings when prices decline.However, every market has its ups and downs, and every individual has their own strengths or abilities to manage varying circumstances. I have seen several individuals get wealthy via futures trading. Therefore, constantly anticipate the unexpected and don't be hesitant to change your plan as necessary.",

It's a very subjective thing. Something might work for me and not for you and that's in general. That's why you may see it as the main mistake that others are doing but in reality, they really have no intention of selling because from their perspective this is what they do.DCA to have more holdings which is they're considering for the long term.",
