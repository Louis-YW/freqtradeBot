  "content": "Hello My Indian friends! I am from your neighboring country Bangladesh. Not sure if this is the right board to ask such questions. I have always had a dream of visiting India since my childhood. Recently I planned to visit Sikkim. I heard that Dollar/INR rate is worst at the border exchanges. Also, Bank doesn't give a reasonable rate sometimes. I was wondering where I can sell my Bitcoin for INR. I use Binance in Bangladesh, sell my Bitcoin for Bangladeshi taka, and receive my money in my Mobile Banking account. I heard that PayTM is one of India's Mobile banking payment methods. Is it possible for a tourist to open a Paytm account while visiting India? Can I cash my Bitcoin there? Which local exchanger accept Bitcoin for INR in India? Also, What payment method will be best for me? I have no idea about it and looking for help from you guys. Since I am planning to visit India, I may need further help to choose Sim cards and other things.Cheers!",

      "body": "I am not sure whether travellers from Bangladesh are now being allowed to use PPI(Prepaid Payment Instruments) wallets. They are the easiest way to convert foreign currency to INR. It is just mobile wallet which provides UPI based transactions. Tourist from G20 countries were allowed to use this service and it can be done at the airport itself. About converting Bitcoin to INR. You can do it but you would need an Indian Bank account. If you have any relatives in West Bengal then you can use Kucoin P2P service. Upto 2BTC transaction can be done without KYC. The risk here is that a lot of P2P based scams are being reported in India lately. In such case the bank account gets frozen, which becomes a big problem as it takes time to unfreeze it. It is better if you convert you Bitcoin in Bangladesh and then come to India. Convert Bangladeshi taka either in Bangladesh or at an Indian airport. Do remember INR 2000 denomination is no longer a valid currency in India. If someone gives you that denomination either in India or Bangladesh while converting then do not accept it.",

Tourists from G20 countries were allowed to use this service and it can be done at the airport itself.  Thanks for the info. I just searched for the G-20 Country list and saw Bangladesh is not on that list. Tourists from Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Turkiye, France, Argentina, United Kingdom, Brazil, China, Japan, Germany, Italy, Canada and South Africa are eligible for this service. In case, Anyone from those countries searching for this may find it helpful. QuoteAbout converting Bitcoin to INR. You can do it but you would need an Indian Bank account.

Unfortunately, I don't have relatives in India. But I have some friends that I made online. I am not sure if they will take such a risk for me. Moreover, I don't think I should ask them to do something like this for me when they haven't met me yet. I wish I could use mobile Banking features there as tourists use sim cards.

Do remember INR 2000 denomination is no longer a valid currency in India. If someone gives you that denomination either in India or Bangladesh while converting then do not accept it.  This is my only option since other options are inappropriate. Yes, I know about the 2000 denomination. We have some tourist groups, and they update us on those things. We used to get visas in 3 working days. But it's taking more than a few weeks for now. I want to say something about using mobile banking accounts. India is one of the largest countries and has beautiful places that attract tourists to visit India. It would be good If the Indian government could give a facility for the tourist to use mobile banking like Paytm. They may put some restrictions. We can buy a Sim card using the Passport, and mobile banking should be the same. They can put some limitations like you cannot cash out more than 10K INR/day or similar would help if they see any security risks. That's just my opinion. I don't know what they think about it.

I will surely DM you if I need help.",

Foreign tourist can open Bank account. They are called NRO accounts, wherein you can only deposit and withdraw INR. I am not sure you would qualify for it. These accounts are mainly used by foreigners who come to India and work here. Some tourist stay for a period of time as they want to visit every location in India. They also are advised to open NRO accounts. You can search the web for more details. In the end it all depends on how long you plan to stay in India.",
