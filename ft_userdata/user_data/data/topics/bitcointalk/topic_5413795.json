There should be a group of miners who mine outside of regulations, government control and do their jobs under a real type of decentralization. It would be head shaking to witness bitcoin become a decentralized coin under the control of a centralized government hehehehe.",

Fidelity holds very little crypto on behalf of their customers, when compared to other holders. Although this does conform with an ongoing problem with major investment fund companies (such as BlackRock) that try to use their holdings of their customer's shares in order to advance their own political/social agenda. The problem in this case is that no investment company has the influence over bitcoin's development that investment companies have over most public corporations. I suspect that the next step in this campaign is to trying to get congress to implement regulations over mining.",

I also speculate that much of illegal cryptomining will occur in third world countries where it would be easier to tap electric lines and steal electricity.Three crypto miner sites in Argentina were caught last week by the country's tax and customs policy agency, the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (AFIP).Upon investigation, authorities identified a taxpayer that had imported mining equipment using a company of which he was partner.

That doesn't make the tools evil or good.  A bank robber driving a getaway car doesn't mean cars are evil. Ditto a gun or bitcoin. People can be killed with things that are \"all natural and organic\" and people can be saved or killed by various medicines (see e.g. Michael Jackson).
