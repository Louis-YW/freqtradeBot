I wish to welcome you to the forum, which is the largest Bitcoin community on the face of the planet.Secondly, I wish to let you know that to be successful in life, one has to be intentional about it, ready to learn and take action on what has been learned. While to be wealthy, one has to inculcate the habit of investing, no matter how small one may be earning, while to live a happy life, one has to be in good relationships with others. And all these are achievable only if you plan and take action.",

Find a passion and grow with it, It could be trading, investing, mining, shilling, management, farming, designing and many other things you can do for crypto projects. A developer as well won't be far from the picture. Be good with what you do, focus more on the development and in due time your skills will speak volume and your earnings will be boundless.",

If you want to be successful in life as an investor, you need to identify the risks associated with investing first. Especially you cannot invest directly as a fresher. Before investing, you need to know about crypto concept, market, coin popularity, development etc. If you suddenly invest in a scam project, you will face huge losses. So before investing you need to understand various strategic steps.",
