  "content": "Jamie Dimon spoke in front of the senate and congress to talk about the banking industy and it appears bitcoin was mentioned. According to him, bitcoin should be closed down and it is only good for moneylaundering, tax evasion and hiding transactions. This is always their argument hehehehee. In any case, do they feel threatened? It appears that they do not like competition on their moneylaundering, tax evasion and off the books transactions operations that they do for their rich clients hehehe. It is okay for them if the rich do this, however, if given this type freedom to the poor, they will say this is evil.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says he would close down Bitcoin and crypto if he were the US Government. Speaking to senators today, the JPMorgan CEO said “I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc.” He points out an argument made by Sen. Elizabeth Warren that its true use is to aid criminals, including drug traffickers, and those in tax avoidance, due to its instant, near-anonymous transactions.“If I were the government I’d close it down,” Dimon concludes about Bitcoin and crypto as a whole. Jamie Dimon has been vocal in his opposition to Bitcoin especially, saying in the past that Bitcoin was “a fraud.” The top cryptocurrency has been leading the charge of a surge for multiple crypto on the current market over the past month, with SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs on the verge of becoming a reality.Read in full https://watcher.guru/news/jamie-dimon-would-close-down-bitcoin-if-he-were-in-government",

There's mixers and privacy coins like Monero out there so it's weird that they're attacking bitcoin when there are other ways those criminals can funnel their money and fiat is still the favorite of these criminals to use so what are they doing about that? There's still a lot of money laundering operations out there and they can't do a damn about it and instead they talk about bitcoin and why it's an evil thing that they have to get rid of.",

That the citizens of that country can't anymore buy, sell, use Bitcoin? How powerful can a government ban on Bitcoin truly is? Does that mean no citizen can run the Bitcoin network anymore? Or that citizens can no longer keep their savings or store their wealth in Bitcoin? Does that even mean Bitcoin-related businesses are completely eradicated? The answer is no. Again, and literally, no government, however powerful it may be, can shut down Bitcoin.",

It seems he hasn't changed his stance regarding Bitcoin; it appears that he really perceives Bitcoin as a significant threat to the banking industry. Bitcoin exists as an alternative currency, not to replace fiat, why would he want to keep promoting a fiat that is susceptible to hyperinflation and subject to government control through potentially corrupt practices?With Bitcoin, even though it's decentralized, it can be regulated, and the government could still benefit from it.

I don't know why politicians find it very comfortable to denigrate some innovations they don't like and paint it black for the public domain.Truth is, with or without Bitcoin his fellow politicians in leadership positions are best known for their behaviour which is corrupt practices, syphoning of funds and the misappropriation of funds meant to carry out the allocated project. Bitcoin has not been a case of syphoning funds like he said, however People can decide to store there syphoned funds in the bank or any of the crypto currency and that is solely their decision to take.",

The way you said it I agree 100%. There are some differences, in the case of old-school, stone-age Warren Buffet, he simply said \"I do not invest in anything I do not understand\". Jamie Dimon, on the other hand is more like an angry idiot, and it is good he doesn't have too much power.",

Obviously, he does not know any better with such a simple case.I recently found out from the graph on this thread that the Bitcoin obituaries for a person exist, specifically for this case. I thought it just exists in the general case as some of us may already hear with https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/. Generally, a person deemed to have high influence always has media attention for such controversies. This case is an example, any media or influential person will likely be against the tool that empowers individuals. So I expect many such high-profile people will do the same, and the media will try to gather that attention for their own motives.",
