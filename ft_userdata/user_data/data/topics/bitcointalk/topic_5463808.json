No one is forcing anyone to make a deposit, personally I got a free spin on the wheel and I'm glad that I was able to spin it (absolutely free). Withdrawal is also available without a deposit, which is great. I hope this is not money laundering.",

This account suddenly woke up from long inactivity and accidentally post here with their positive experience on this roulette? Your website overall details looks like the typical scammy casino that offers too good to be true rewards. There's a lot of many roulette games here that turns into scam after receiving few deposits. Your use of shill accounts is one of the sign of the typical scammer here.",

This is a forum and you should know that people tend to give their opinions here. The thing is, we really do think that you're promoting shady and you could try better the next time.

This is an ANN thread and it‚Äôs odd to see someone use mirror link compared to the official site since you are introducing new casino here which doesn‚Äôt know your official website. Provide official link and mirror site at the same time if you are telling the truth. Sounds like you are the OP of this thread too.",

I don't know about the site, but if you really think that the site is legit and you're trying to promote a legit service then do it in a natural way like other genuine sites are doing. I don't think anyone was dissatisfied because of not getting paid for this topic, but most of the users have found your way as a scammer's way. The scammers mostly control many new accounts and when they post their threads then they use those accounts to bump the thread in a way like you did. If you think you and the site you're trying to promote is legit and genuine then go with the normal marketing route by launching a signature campaign or something similar to get positive exposure.The ones who have said that your site is a scam are some of the most reputable members of this forum, and I must say that they have spent a lot of time on the forum and can someone something fishy easily. I still say that if you think that your site is legit then go with the traditional way for promoting on this forum. If you're not familiar with this forum's marketing then you should look at others that which ways they are using for marketing of their sites. I must say that your marketing way is very suspicious and anyone who has been on this forum would most probably consider it as a scam.",

If you trust the site that much and you don't need any review from any one you can take it down here maybe take it to your person channel, maybe family group where you will be in charge and then every one can use the site because it was advertise by you.",
