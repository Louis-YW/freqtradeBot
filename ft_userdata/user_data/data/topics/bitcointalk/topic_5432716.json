Less experienced will try to time the market and buy the bottom (which is impossible anyway unless you are very lucky) which usually results in paying more (speaking from personal experience btw) while in reality its best to start buying now, and eventually use DCA so you are not so affected with price volatility and more importantly you get the habit of buying bitcoin.",

Looking at charts you might think that the right time to buy is before the halving, but while history does repeat itself sometimes, it's definitely not 100% the same.Seriously, just accept that you can't accurately time the bottom and just DCA if you're bullish for the long-term.",

So yeah, whey not start this year with a good plan on how to stock up and accumulate Bitcoin in preparation for the next bull run in 2024. Maybe you can do DCA or buy when you have the money.Of course it's not going to be very easy to accumulate as this is more of a mental test for everyone to buy and hold it for a long time. Or at least for the next 12-15 months before the actual halving. But we should start somewhere else if we wanted to take advantage of the market and get that x amount of profits in the future. And there are estimates and predictions that the price in the next bull run is in the conservative 6 digits.",

      "body": "If we talk about what you expect halving, the best time to buy can be called not only today but also, generically, \"yesterday.\" By sticking to the DCA, you deprive yourself of many nerve impulses and experience less excitement, as you will adhere to a strictly verified investment strategy at a certain time, completely ignoring the current price of bitcoin. In addition, the earlier you start investing, the more you can get in the end, since most likely, beginners cannot immediately invest significant amounts.But the important point should be how consistently you can stick to your plan.",

We won't be able to determine which market price would it be its lowest or highest; the market itself is unpredictable. So simply invest once you are ready; to endure the market behavior, and to accept that profit won't come in an instant. Indeed the anticipated year would be on 2024, but that won't guarantee that thie year would be nothing. You may still try to analyze the market whether there will be a good price to invest and ofcourse, your willingness to be patient through ups and downs in this industry. Never compare your progress to others; just mind your own 'coz we have different capabilities as investors.",

Looking on the monthly chart clearly show as that we are already on the bottom of the last bull cycle so doing a DCA from this price is good choice if you want to a position in Bitcoin.",

As we anticipate another Bitcoin halving, when is the right to buy in and stock up Bitcoin in order not to be left behind in the next bull market?I have seen or heard different speculations about the price of Bitcoin. But from my few years of experience dealing with the currency it is clear that it is unpredictable. A single positive news can lead to the rise in its price and vice versa. I think the best advice would be to keep buying every time you have the money to invest. It is good to have a plan and stick to it regardless of how the market turns-out. Most people that are waiting to buy Bitcoin when the price drops very low either ended up not buying or had to buy at a very high price. Buying Bitcoin anytime you have the opportunity or funds is the best time to buy it.",

You can't know when the bear market will end but maybe you can sense an end or see a glimmer, the advice I can give you is to accumulate now that we are very low.",

We all know that bitcoin is down now and most people are accumulating bitcoin now, if you are expecting more dip before you will buy, you might not see the dip and if you buy now and you are expecting pump, it might still dip more. But now that bitcoin price is down, if you are planning to hold, then If you buy now, it's not really a bad idea(just my opinion).",

Then what makes you doubt that now is the time? 2023 should be a year worth buying for your long-term investment, but if you're still unsure about the possibility of another dip then do DCA.So if you never buy in 2022, then do so throughout 2023. It's a wise choice, but still use your funds wisely and always buy an amount you can afford to lose. One more thing, withdraw all those bitcoin to your wallet where you have full control over them.",

The simple reason being that for a coin that once rose to $69k but it's currently trading at $16k+ is a giveaway. Anyone who's still dilly-dallying on whether to buy or not isn't doing themselves any good at all. I would rather DCA on Bitcoin than keep expecting that price will crash more and hit bottom and then miss out of buying it. So, OP should buy now and don't foot drag on it.",

As we anticipate another Bitcoin halving, when is the right to buy in and stock up Bitcoin in order not to be left behind in the next bull market?Bitcoin is at it's lowest price for the last 2years (2021 & 2022) so now is the best time to buy, we mightn't know if the price will fall further so if you aren't comfortable holding through another dip then you can dollars cost average your investment so if it dips further you have some spare funds to buy again although it doesn't matter when you're investing for the long time.You should note though that the bull market isn't coming in 2024 as from history the bull market starts fully one year later after the halving of Bitcoin reward, therefore we shouldn't be over expected of positive outcome in 2024 instead our attention should be turned to 2025 as from history we're to be expecting a massive rally in the market in this year.This means we have about 1 year left to accumulate bitcoin until the bull market is fully activated. This is just my observation from history and the market might or mightn't follow same pattern so best we invest now and wait instead of missing out on another opportunity to make good return on investment.",
