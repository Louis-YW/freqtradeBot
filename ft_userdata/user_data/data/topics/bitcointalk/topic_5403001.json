  "content": "I've had a balance of about 1.5 Bitcoin on my Ledger Nano S for years. But today, I connected it, and was shocked to see a balance of over 3 Bitcoin appear on my screen (all the other coins on my Ledger show the correct balances). I checked to see if any Bitcoin was recently deposited into my account from some unknown address, and aside from the small deposits that I've been making from purchases on Coinbase (~$200 each), there hasn't been any. Figuring this had to be a glitch, I logged off, restarted my desktop, and connected my Ledger, again..... and again it showed a balance of over 3 BTC. What's going on here? What concerns me is that this glitch (?) can also go the other way, and show a balance that's lower than my original amount, or even zero, the next time I connect it. I'm seriously doubting the reliability of my digital wallet now. FYI: When I attempted to log on the first time today (before I discovered 3 BTC in my wallet), my Ledger froze up. I had to unplug it and plug it in again before I was able to connect. Can this have something to do with it?",

Either you or Ledger, that's forcing you to use its server AFAIK, is the one to blame for. Did you, by any chance, copy the address with the 1.5 BTC and imported it somehow twice? No, so it's either Ledger's front-end or back-end.",

But then, if it's a glitch why did it happen to only Bitcoin in that wallet as you said other cryptos there in your Ledger had their right balances. Sometime last year, Trust Wallet had a glitch and every crypto in my wallet (it wasn't just with me. I confirmed from friends who also experienced same while it was happening) went haywire and values surged out of proportion. It affected all cryptos in my TW, not singling out any. This is where I doubt if it's just a glitch. It could be something more. You've to take necessary safety measure to forestall any hack.",

I used to have this issue all the time with Ledger.  Not showing full balance or showing more than I actually had.  And when the latter happened, it was typically showing exactly double instead of the real amount.I therefore suspect it is a problem with their software as well.  My question is, how do you check your balance via a Blockchain Explorer?  I do not remember Live having any option to show used addresses.  My advice is to check your balance with Electrum instead, it provides a much more accurate description of what your wallet truly looks like.-Regards,PrivacyG",

You can always stay informed about the changes here.How often do you use your Ledger and Ledger Live? They often release updates. I would say two times a month. If you aren't using it that often, it's quite possible that a new update was released in the meantime. You can see what version you have installed in the settings. I think the correct tab is \"About\". Just click on the gear icon and you will find it after a while.Whenever you are in doubt about your balance, just connect your Ledger with Electrum and you should see the correct info. But you need to close Ledger Live before connecting to Electrum and make sure the BTC app is open when you are setting up your Electrum wallet. Don't worry about your seed, you don't need to enter it, nor does Electrum have access to your private keys. And if your history/recent transaction tab doesn't show any incoming 1.5 BTC transaction, it's just a server bug.",

In my opinion, it is easier and faster to check the balance with something like Blockchain explorer as already suggested by Welsh, by copy-pasting Bitcoin address than downloading Electrum wallet and checking the signature of it for authenticity and then importing seed-phrase. If an user uses Ledger Live, then the probability that he has Electrum wallet preinstalled is very low. I'm talking about less action. This is important, as the user starts to get worried when he sees a change in the balance, especially if it is down. Therefore, the sooner he checks the address, the calmer he will be if he makes sure that everything is ok with bitcoin balance.",

Is it possible to make a fatal mistake here?As far as I am concerned, there are no known vulnerabilities in the connection between a Ledger or Trezor and Electrum that makes it possible for a perpetrator to steal coins.  Since neither Ledger or Trezor communicate private keys or the seed to external devices ever, your balance is theoretically always safe.In theory, you could plug your Trezor or Ledger into the most malware and spyware filled computer and your balance will be intact.  That is, as long as the user continues to carefully checks all the information their Hardware Wallet displays when verifying and signing a transaction.  What a compromised Electrum may do is make the user make mistakes such as writing down the seed into the compromised Electrum, accepting a transaction on their Hardware Wallet to the wrong address et cetera.  Long story short, having a safe wallet does not make for an excuse for laziness and carelessness.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Like PrivacyG mentioned above, there shouldn't be a way for you to compromise your Bitcoin because hardware wallets were designed not to be affected by malware. Even if you downloaded a fake wallet, it can't get to your private keys or seed unless you get tricked into typing it in somewhere. If the fake Electrum wallet can send Bitcoin to an address of your choice, you should in theory be able to use it. Still, that doesn't mean one should care less about security because they have a hardware wallet where the keys can't be touched. A fake wallet could come with other types of malware that could make your system unsafe. Keylogging software, for example.",
