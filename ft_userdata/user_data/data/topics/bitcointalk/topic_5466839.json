  "content": "Hello dear Bitcoin Talk;I opened an account just to tell all the world how Stake.com scammed me and has Casino Guru in this. I am known inside the gambling community since many years; ( crypto most ) such that even Rollbit.com invited me with no deposit 3330 USD bonus, which Stake.com provided them probably. But as you can imagine I am / was a high roller. Years later im in debt to loan sharks, down in rock bottom but still believe in the digital gold and trying to turn my life back. Anyways nice meeting you all and going back to the topic;I am and was a degenerate gambler for many years; met with Stake.com, and that was my game to play. I owned a SINGLE KYC-D ( Level 2 with ID) account at the time of writing which was named : tetaeridanus.I occasionally excluded myself for 24 hours and then went back on gambling hence the addiction of gambling. Stake.com support and also my VIP Host knew my gambling addiction to depths. Anyways on 20 November 2022 ,after the self exclusion from casino games' cooldown ended; as normal procedure Stake Support mailed me to ask if I want to continue self exclusion and how long; I replied them as: PERMANENTLY. Then I got a confirmation mail that said I will be permanently banned from playing casino games on Stake.com. That was it ; I was free from gambling for months knowing I can only bet on sports now and won't be able to play scam Stake.com originals.Months past and I said ; lemme deposit 30-40K on Stake.com and bet on sports; I saw that they limited my betting limits; so I betted 20K on few matches and had 20K balance; and was tilted; so I went on and tried if casino games are working because it was always a go to when I lost my sports bets. I went to stake originals blackjack and tried a small bet; guess what happened; blackjack was working ; I binged a degenerate run and lost all of my 22K balance in 3 minutes. I was devastated and I couldn't understand what happened. I knew I would lose that money because I am an addict and I couldn't stop myself. That's why I asked exclusion from casino games permanently; which stake.com offers to its customers and by the licensing law they should abide it.I opened a thread on casino guru however stake.com responded as new accounts were created after tetaeridanus and bla bla bla bla. Never responded to this claim and even said exclusion was reversable by the customer. Which is a load of bullshit; I never mailed them to unexlcude myself not even on asked on live support. I went on live support and my vip host and asked for assistance; they closed my account permanently. I want my hard earned 18-22K back; I want you forum to help your fellow dude maybe get to Eddie to make things right. I am deep neck in debt to loan sharks and banks. I don't want Stake.com to cover up this like nothing. In my Bet History and Email you can see easily how I was not supposed to play Blackjack at the time of the loss. I hope I found the true place to help me.Proof:Confirmation Mail;https://imgur.com/k6pTThEBet Archive and Account Proof:https://imgur.com/HWhc2Fghttps://imgur.com/FPxsJEphttps://imgur.com/rp0hMwGhttps://imgur.com/Enedy4nhttps://imgur.com/YnCOLXII hope you all are having a good one.Tetaeridanus.Edit: Quotation",

Admitting that you are a degenerate gambler and that you owe money to sharks before accusing a reputable forum casino doesn't help your case.

The problem is this is not any other site but Stake.com. The problem is I never freerolled or anything. The moment I found out and lost is 2 minutes. I didn't deposit more and tried to trick or scam the casino. I immedietly went to live support and told what happened. They told me I have uncontrollable behavior , due to that my account is self excluded immedietly. They don't accept the unlawful act or neither adressed anything. I have the mail's from casino guru if you want I can send you; between the casino guru and stake.com.In both responses from the community ; I have seen that many people are lying and doing other stuff here. Keep in mind I am a new member and the last thing in this situation I want is to be looked upon with prejudice at first start. I have the emails, bet archives every proof you guys need for me to show. I want a honest look here. Thank you.Tetaeridanus.",

Ask yourself why. Quote from: tetaeridanus on September 15, 2023, 10:14:52 AM...you are here telling me about a scammer who is lying on forum. What I'm telling you is that degenerate gamblers are widely known for cheating even their mother to keep betting but seeing as you didn't like me telling you the truth don't expect me to respond any further in this thread.On the stake side, it sounds fishy that it allows you to exclude yourself from the casino and not from sports betting, and that it doesn't work properly allowing you to bet in the casino, too. This is not the first case we have heard of on the forum. It is a thing that should not happen and if they let it happen, they should pay for it. But on the other hand, for you to say that you have had three previous stake accounts, all self-excluded, and I don't care if they were not KYC, is like someone who bangs his head against the wall and blames the wall.",

So, to put it out chronologically, you created mrperun on 24 April 2021, asked for permanent self exclusion at one point, granted and got your account disabled, and then, with that older account considered inactive, created set2323 on 30 July 2021, realized your addiction is kicking back in, and asked for self exclusion, and they complied.

This is the most ignorant comment I have seen in any forum; You have been in few forums then. And insulting people is not going to help your case. In fact this thread has very few replies so far. Ask yourself why. Quote from: tetaeridanus on September 15, 2023, 10:14:52 AM...you are here telling me about a scammer who is lying on forum. What I'm telling you is that degenerate gamblers are widely known for cheating even their mother to keep betting but seeing as you didn't like me telling you the truth don't expect me to respond any further in this thread.On the stake side, it sounds fishy that it allows you to exclude yourself from the casino and not from sports betting, and that it doesn't work properly allowing you to bet in the casino, too. This is not the first case we have heard of on the forum. It is a thing that should not happen and if they let it happen, they should pay for it. But on the other hand, for you to say that you have had three previous stake accounts, all self-excluded, and I don't care if they were not KYC, is like someone who bangs his head against the wall and blames the wall.  I insulted who? I came to this forum for people's opinion not about previous cases that happened here. I don't need for your words about gambling addiction; I am getting treatment for this matter and don't give a single damn about you leaving or not. You basically came here to look down on a newbie and threw some ignorance, I don't need you to reply or anything, who said reply here? You saying I got few replies etc, so what? Is my life over lol, I guess you guys want to stay blind on how stake scams people, I don't care if you reply or don't. Why so personal? What kind of problems are you facing in your life to act so rude against people?",

So, to put it out chronologically, you created mrperun on 24 April 2021, asked for permanent self exclusion at one point, granted and got your account disabled, and then, with that older account considered inactive, created set2323 on 30 July 2021, realized your addiction is kicking back in, and asked for self exclusion, and they complied. Same thing happened to account fishermansj and tetaeridanus?Hello sir, I am getting only bullied here and like the other poster said I never insulted anybody I don't understand the hate on me. I can send you documents everything you want about the case. Yes they have been excluded before, the fact that I have been outlining un kyc is they let me open new account because they weren't doing kyc procedures while I was depositing 100.000s. Casinos should have their exclusion policies strict to have these licenses. However it seems like they don't care and thinks that I and people like me will shut up. I won't shut up until everyone knows the truth. For the other replier,Between all the bad and rude comments, I want to thank you that you believe I deserve my refund and you support the right even though you have been rude to me.Ps: I don't understand why I need to get more replies? I am trying to share my experience, If you don't want to see the truth. Don't support me, tell me I am a degenerate. You don't know me, I wouldn't tell that I have a gambling problem If i wanted, I wanted to introduce myself here, not to get so many hate from a fellow member.Tetaeridanus.Quote from: Beparanf on September 16, 2023, 11:34:21 AMYou using your previous Self-exclusion as an insurance to your loss bet.

This is the most ridiculous thing I have read here since, Are you fucking kidding me? If I did that, am i an idiot to not deposit more and try to win more? Do you know the timeline of the events? No I don't need to fucking control myself when there is a self exclusion intact in the account. I don't use my previous self exclusion. You don't even read the post correctly. This account should have been self excluded, which was confirmed by email of stake themselves. Self exclusion is made for problem gamblers like me. I hope you go and get some simple empathy skills before accusing me of imaginary acts in your delusions. At the end you say a judge will understand, I don't care if you do or not. All of you are supporters of stake here. Don't worry I will be leaving your forum soon. Being respectful is wrong against people like you.edit: I am paying respect and saying sorry for Don Pedro. I can see why people can get so angry at this forum with so many ignorant people with payrolls spitting nonesense. edit: Duelbitz person, look at when I lost this bet and the start date of this thread. edit: I think there is a misunderstanding here; I don't use previous self exclusion as excuse. I AM self excluded while this is happening on the account tetaeridanus. If like you said, it was previous; you would be correct.",

I won't shut up until everyone knows the truth.[snipped the rest to maintain relevance]edit: I think there is a misunderstanding here; I don't use previous self exclusion as excuse. I AM self excluded while this is happening on the account tetaeridanus. If like you said, it was previous; you would be correct.I want to begin that I am not against you or trying to support Stake, I am trying to always be neutral and see from as many perspective as I can. On this matter and from the point established above, I'm afraid I have to give you a pill that'll be quite hard to swallow, namely... Casino Guru has a right stance and understanding on this matter.Their final ruling [which didn't favor you] was,Quote[...]The protection for self-excluded players, that detects them closely after registration or does not allow future registration, is a key part of proper self-exclusion. If the player informs the casino about the gambling problem. The account should be closed asap, and the player should not be allowed to create an account with the same or similar credentials. That is the acceptable minimum that can be done. Based on the information provided by the casino team, all the accounts you created contained different information filled in as credentials. Therefore, the block could not work properly, and they could not prohibit your gameplay. More specifically, only dates of birth used in the first and disputed accounts were the same. The rest was slightly adjusted or completely different. [...]Granted, their explanation could probably be a bit hard to understand, and from the postscript you added through edit, I take it that you probably understood them wrongly.If I may try to better explain the situation, your self-exclusion on tetaeridanus didn't take full effect and prevent you from betting on casino is because you permanently self-exclude your other accounts before. It is a two pronged situation.The casino should take the self-exclusion and give their best to protect you by immediately closing your account and prevent any credential related to that account from opening other accounts in the future. This means, from the \"inside\", the existing account were \"bricked\" by rendered unable to place any bet, and at the same time, from the \"outside\", the owner should not be able to create another account with the same credentials.If I may throw a wild guess, their registration prevention probably try to read and stop you by reading the \"analog\" data like email address, username, name, DoB, nationality, and the likes, while their self-exclusion prevention within the account itself utilize parameters a platform usually use to detect multi-acc like your IP, screen resolution, geolocation, device data, etc.This is how the self-exclusion work and the keypoint that CG tried to explain [I marked in blue] and how they honor the responsible gaming duty: by blacklisting the credentials to prevent future re-registration and bricking the account at the same time.But, because you use other credentials to create other accounts, these \"external\" attempts to protect you through self-exclusion by denying you to create another accounts are bypassed because their database didn't match the newly inputted entry with the old ones that's on their exclusion list. This explains why you could create three [or four] other accounts from the first one you created and submitted self-exclusion.Now, focusing and applying this on the tetaeridanus account, as I previously mentioned, it's a two pronged situation.From the \"outside\", they can't prevent you from creating another account because you use different credential from fishermansj [your latest one prior to tetaeridanus], their system to automatically reject your account trying to sign up were bypassed by these differences on database. While from the \"inside\", or the second prong, the why your self exclusion for tetaeridanus were not effective by taking the self exclusion permanently, is because their system which responsible to \"brick\" your account read different data, thus crashed with each other.Previously, for instance, they detected the entries [IP address, screen resolution, browser version, etc.] belonged to mrperun, or ready2323, and has to be denied, yet at the same time, these entries were belonged to fishermansj, and at some point, were yet to request self-exclusion, thus the database crashed. Same thing happened with tetaeridanus. They read that the entries are for ready2323, or other accounts, yet it also belonged to the newly created account under the name tetaeridanus that's yet to request self-exclusion, and they crashed again. And this is why the permanent self-exclusion couldn't lock itself on its place.Of course this is only a hypothesis I get from reading the narratives of your case from the available resources [the casino guru's description and yours here]. I hope you can understand what I am trying to explain here.",

Hope you finally come to truths with yourself at the end about this case.I will try this again.I can't stress this enough that I am in no way benefited from this case, at all. I am not in bed with Stake, I am not on their payroll, I am in no way affiliated with them, there is literally zero benefit for me on whatever outcome we get from this case, so I \"couldn't care less\" if Stake is the one who is wrong here or you understood them wrongly. What I do care is simply a resolution is reached on this case, no matter whose side it is. And currently all I can do is giving the narrative from what I understand to help you attain another point of view and/or to understand what happened more clearly.Yes, I wrote the \"second prong\" part based on my assumption, that the permanent exclusion can't lock itself on tetaeridanus due to the \"crash\" on their database, but the part of \"first prong\", the external prevention is what casino guru found out after they thoroughly read Stake's explanation. So that part is an established fact.I can understand if you won't accept this explanation-with-partial-assumption of mine, and I'm really sorry that you're in your current situation [not the addiction, I was talking about your family and your debt]. I believe this is where we part ways? I'll wish you a good luck and hope you can get out of this tunnel [not abyss or hole, tunnel, you just need to keep going, one step at a time] you're currently in.",
