  "content": "Hi.My altcoin project is Bitcoin Essence. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3108135.0 http://www.bitcoinessence.orghttp://www.bitcoinessence.infohttps://github.com/BitcoinEssence/bitcoinessenceProblems what I think now is1.As github shows, current version is 0.16.32. And as explorer site shows, it stops at 2019, and not updated yet, because no one is mining. I tried but mining command [setgenerate true] from daemon core disappears, so can't. 3. Explorer site shows coin supply is over 2,100,000,000. Which is the number originally I set at source code.I don't know why and how to remove it. Maybe because this coin hacked once before.So I want developer who can update this source code to newest stable bitcoin/litecoin version, remove hacked coins, chains, so that mining can start again. And I just start mine myself from VPS server where the main coin source and core daemon is running now. and as ongoing future partners, who can support to maintain this coin healthy and share the coin for legit profit to your work. Please contact me. Telegram : @wsxdrfvEmail : wsxdrfv@hanmail.netDirect personal message via this forum. Thank you.",
