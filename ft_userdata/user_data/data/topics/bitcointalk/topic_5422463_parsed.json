I am sure the current controllers of FTX are sure that these sets of persons have the capacity to manage the mess created by led executives Sam Bankman-Fried and they have promised to tidy up the mess. John Ray, Kathryn Schultea, Mary Cilia and Raj Perubhatla are charging very high because they have the capacity to manage FTX until it comes back to life. This task is not an easy one therefore, they need to be well payed so that they can be motivated to do their jobs.",

The salary of a CEO in big companies is incredible high, and I believe it is justified  Those companies have a revenue of billions per year, and a CEO decision will affect billions of usd https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-highest-paid-ceos/?leadSource=uverify%20wallCoinbase CEO for example receives about 280 million per year.",

He is an insolvency professional, and speaking of professional he's the guy that managed to get back billions in Enron's bankruptcy, one of the largest in the US and the whole world, he's in charge of finding billions and he's getting paid around 2.5 million while only SBF's penthouse was priced at 40 million.It might sound much but it's way below what some CEOs of companies that have no trouble and are running smoothly are getting, some even 10x times for 1/10 of the job.And speaking of damage being done and getting over if that would have been the same with MtGox a lot of them would have simply lost their coins while with the trustee appointed, despite him changing $200k a month they are still looking at a profit in $ terms.",

The only chance for FTX to make it back is to solve all those insolvency issue then relaunch the whole thing with a brand new name. I'd love to see him try though, but I doubt that anyone would be able to solve anything at this point. I cant remember exactly but was there any exchanges that make it back after they were 'hacked / having insolvency' issue? ( both are pretty similar, they have no funds left ) I guess there was none",

( both are pretty similar, they have no funds left ) I guess there was noneThis would be the first if ever they would really be able to solve out but basing up on my experience and awareness for several years here on crypto space then i didnt see anything related to this.I do agree on the word that this is really good as dead, theres no way that they could revive it our or make it just like there's nothing happened.No matter how many times they would really be doing a rebranding but still the trust that had been broken out cant really be turned back.Once the community or public does have that kind of impressions which is negative or had already lost their trust then theres no way on getting it back even if they had able to fixed it out.",

There's a reason he was appointed at this point in time, perhaps he has a past good reputation in managing such crisis.FTX already fucked up anyway.",

Parag was CEO of twitter for more than 12 months and was unable to implement anything more cutting edge than an edit button which is trivial technology and code. CEOs of other big tech corporations also have not done much to innovate or progress their industry. The efforts of some like Mark Zuckenberg (multiverse) also stand out. There is a question of whether CEOs are deliver value equal to what they're paid, which could be in dispute atm.When Bill Gates was acting CEO of microsoft he admitted that the only thing he did was read and answer emails all day. The job doesn't require specialized knowledge or skillset in most cases. And I would guess if most knew what their job entailed they wouldn't think that it was deserving of $10,000 an hour salary along with the considerable incentives and golden parachute arrangements they enjoy in their contracts.",
