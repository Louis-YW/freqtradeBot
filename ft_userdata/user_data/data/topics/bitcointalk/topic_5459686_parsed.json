But first move this to scam accusations of reputation where it could be given the attention that it deserved. With more detailed information OP has already posted on BC.GAME's ann thread and this can be seen here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5088875.msg62418180#msg62418180 and in his historic post, and the OP also opened a scam accusation last month and it can be seen here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5456655.msg62418291#msg62418291 and from what I could read, the OP deposited 2000 USDT and won in 2 games and managed to withdraw more than 1700 USDT and when he tried to withdraw a larger amount the second time, the casino asked him to kyc, but there was no option for him to kyc at the casino and the OP complained about this and after a few days he sent all the documents and has been waiting for many days for his documents to be approved and his account to be verified so he can withdraw and I could also read that there was a delay in the kyc ordeal but I don't know if it was a long delay, then it's strange that the casino doesn't say anything, at least they should say what else they want the OP to do, if the documents have a problem for at least OP to correct itstaying silent and ignoring OP is not a good way unless OP is not telling the whole story well, from what I saw from their ann thread most people have no problem with the casino and the casino has a signature campaign running So that means they communicate with the manager, so it's hard to imagine that they would scam or steal from someone to get a bad reputation.OP, send PM to the casino representative here on the forum:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2503677and explain your problem, he doesn't enter the forum constantly, but I still think it's worth sending a pm",

For them to keep silent without letting you know what they have concluded about your access to withdrawal sucks.

OP has created an accusation thread, here, this piece of information has well been pointed out by Slow death on post #5 and repeated by Beparanf on post #7.OP, there's no need to create multiple threads [I understand this one is moved from Gambling section to Scam Accusations, but still] as it'll confuses anyone following the development of the case by having to go back and forth between threads to keep themselves updated with the development of the case. I'll try PMing their representative to revisit your other thread. Though their last online date was ten days ago, they'll still bound to get online and hopefully notice my PM. Meanwhile, please lock this one immediately so all of us can stay focused in one thread.For added context for anyone curious, BC.GAME had replied on the other thread as follows:Quote from: BC.GAME on June 28, 2023, 07:43:36 AMHello. Please contact our live support. They are pretty fast to respond and are available 24/7. We can't discuss individual account related issues on a public forum due to our privacy policy.
