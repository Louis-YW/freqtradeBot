I saw your previous posts and I personally don't think that is enough to convince people to start your new crypto project. Also, I don't think you need to spam on multiple boards just to attract interest, focus on one thread so you won't be called a spammer. Who knows, potential investors might be turned off from the way you posts.",

When someone is on the brink of failure, it's only a matter of time before they snap. The potential partner will look at this as if this gambling operation of yours will be the source of funds for your rent. Affiliate marketing experience and SEO skills take time before they work and in crypto casinos, they invest more in the reputation and not on whether the casino ranks above the searches because its what matters the most.",

From my findings, most casinos that do it successfully are already working casinos with good reputations. An example is Bustadice, and Yolodice (before they shut down).",

Determining the plan depends primarily on the skills and experiences that you possess.If you do not have money to start your own project, you need partners to support you with money, but you first need to convince them that you have sufficient skill and experience to implement profitable projects.Otherwise, you can search for existing projects and offer your services in exchange for money by promoting these projects or presenting some new ideas.",

The guy has an idea and doesn't need righteous critique.No, I think you are wrong. Every potential investor should analyze each proposal and then give their opinion based on their analysis. The fact of the matter is this... the guy lost his own coins, so potential investors will question his ability to secure their coins. OP, do not have enough money to pay his next rent, so how will investors be reimbursed, if something goes wrong with this project. The fact that he is renting is also a problem, because that says he owns no fixed property (asset) that can be sold to reimburse people. We also know Telegram is a scammers paradise, so only giving one communication option through a platform like Telegram are also questionable. (Most legit businessmen have a transparent social media presence, where people can put a face to a real identity)  Due diligence and questioning of people's intentions are just part of the whole process to fund projects like this.    Go watch the Series \"Shark Tank\" and you will see how this works.",
