  "content": "QuoteThe Federal Trade Commission has ordered Mastercard to start providing competing payment networks with the information they need to process debit card payments. In a proposed enforcement action announced on Friday, the FTC said Mastercard had allegedly violated a provision of the Dodd-Frank act known as the Durbin Amendment by prohibiting merchants from routing transactions over alternative networks.The action targets “tokenization,” the technology that underpins mobile payment applications like Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. When you go to make a debit or credit card purchase with your phone’s mobile wallet, the software substitutes sensitive information, including the primary number associated with your account, with a separate set of single-use “tokens.” Mastercard and Visa say the practice prevents fraud since tokens contain no exploitable information when they’re in transit. It’s only when they arrive at Mastercard or Visa’s servers, and they’re mapped back to their original account holder, that they point to someone.According to the FTC, Mastercard has historically stopped competing networks from accessing its token vault. That means whenever consumers decided to pay with a mobile wallet, merchants had to route the transactions over Mastercard (or Visa) and pay the company's transactions fees, which are typically higher than that of its competitors. The Durbin Amendment calls for banks to support two competing payment networks on all debit cards. It was a provision Congress introduced to promote competition among networks. The FTC didn’t say if it reached a similar agreement with Visa.“While we are taking these steps to bring this matter to a close, there should be no question that tokenized transactions provide an increased level of protection to both consumers and merchants,” Mastercard spokesperson Seth Eisen told Bloomberg. “This focus on security guides our efforts in a highly competitive market and provides the incentive for us to continue investing in innovations that promote the peace of mind every person expects.” Eisen added Mastercard would “continue to work to update our processes to comply with the consent order and provide even greater choice.”The FTC plans to collect comments from the public before voting to finalize the order against Mastercard.https://www.yahoo.com/now/ftc-orders-mastercard-open-debit-transactions-competing-payment-networks-234358951.html....It seems that mastercard is open to modifying its native tokenized transaction network to offer access to 3rd parties. While neither blockchain and open source software are mentioned here. Perhaps this poses a financial opportunity for mastercard to use free open source software to blockchain its way to interoperability with 3rd parties.It seems visa could also soon announce a similar precedent. Although, I think visa might already have similar arrangements with banks like JP Morgan with whom they are partners. Mastercard by contrast might lack that type of partnership based support, which would allow for it to be included in the type of arrangements visa has with state sponsored projects like foodstamps. Big sweeping changes on the horizon, it seems.",

      "body": "This is quite surprising as I'd've expected banks to be on good terms with mastercard and visa considering they provide so many of their transactions and probably a lot of their profit (from credit cards and overdraft payments that are easier to get into of you're using a card or a phone to pay).Given this is on mobile wallets specifically, I don't understand why there wouldn't be an incentive for Google and Apple to launch their own systems or provide additional services (like a version of \"open banking\" that includes contactless where you can currently link bank accounts in the UK if you prefer the interface of one mobile banking system or want a better way of getting an overview of your funds - not sure if this is a thing anywhere else though).I do think it's only a matter of time before Google and Apple launch their own cards in order to get more user information (for free).",

It would take more than this, but it is a good start to force those companies to stop anti competitive actions.My guess would be that both Mastercard and Visa would be involved in the operation and creation of the USD-CBDC, otherwise it could indeed end both companies and I do not think they will move deeper into crypto, despise these actions by the government which take them off their comfort zone. If Visa/MC want to stay on top they will first try to offer better services and the same quality of those competitors that will benefit from the access to the token system, if they cannot then may try to turn to crypto and expand even more their businesses in this market. That is my opinion, at least.",

Which makes me think that they join teir forces, will create fud, and lobby against such a system and fight like hell for their own survival. Next time i read a negative article about dangeres of CBDC, i will be thinking that this might be paid fud from Visa/Mastercard",

I think they finally know how important crypto is and don't wanna left behind when crypto become more mainstream. Or at least they don't want to destroyed by crypto hahaha.",
