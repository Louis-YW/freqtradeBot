It is absurd to let others influence and set a stand for the XRP category when you should have known better about it.When you say you are confused, you should elaborate what is the point of your concern, instead of blindly letting others dictate your decision.",

We could say XRP coins are shares of the company which created them, so you as an investor acquire those shares in form of assets or securities expecting future profits through the sale of the coins or through staking them for passive income, that could be compared to the regular payments shareholders receive from the companies they hold assets in traditional markets.",

The simple reason is that it has a company backing it up so they closely control it's supply in the market. So it has less volatility and also they are focused on cross border payment business where they have already got multiple clients. XRP is very centralized in nature and not comparable with bitcoin in any way. So I won't consider it as an asset.",

As a newbie in the crypto space, don't consider Altcoins, Bitcoin is safe to invest if you know you don't want to loss money in Altcoins. The OP does not refer \"security\" as it seems you define it. The word security in finance, refers to something that can be traded and produce gains to a company (e.g, stocks).",

So it's a bit complicated for some crypto enthusiast as it involved legality already, so the better approach is just to way for the official documents and how this case will turn out later.I will stir away from watching youtube though, each and every influence has it's narrative for it.https://cointelegraph.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-for-beginners/the-sec-vs-ripple-lawsuit-everything-you-need-to-know",

This is the reason why I said it because XRP is centralized which is why it is a security where they can stop all transactions just like what happen with binance and an asset because of low transaction fees and very the same as other cryptocurrency. I may be wrong about all of it so feel free to correct my mistakes. I always use XRP when I transfer from an exchange to my wallet before I sell it to fiat and also when I deposit to a casino that accept XRP.",
