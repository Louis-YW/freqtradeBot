Although bitcoin is an asset and a great store of value but its volatility usually means needs to be careful what they bring into it. There’s no specific amount too small or big that can’t be invested in it but the problem is can you stay like years without panicking over that amount or is that amount not meant for something way too serious. The amount meant to be invested is any amount that can be more less abandon able by the investor except maybe a sever emergency crisis the reason been that no one can tell you exactly when the bearish period might arrive and when they not be.",

Depending on your economic situation and given the right amount to invest, you should not compare with others. Invest only the money you can lose, that's our investment motto. You should not borrow or use your daily spending money to invest, as there is no guarantee that your bitcoin investment will yield the return your plan. If you don't have too much money to invest then start with the minimum amount and can accumulate slowly, Bitcoin is long term so don't be afraid to miss the opportunity and rush to invest.",

In some extent many just venture into investment without knowing the guidelines, I think that's what makes some of the investors run out patients and panic whenever bitcoin is having bearish exercise, the wing investors make a profit during bitcoin  investment is during a long term investment and it happens that bitcoin experiences bullish market.
