This is one of the best news I have read so far, creating a Telegram wallet and exchange for cryptocurrencies will have an impact on the crypto market in general. Where Telegram is one of the most downloaded applications by users in the world for the year 2022 and has more than 700 million active users, so it is one of the most popular applications and its involvement in blockchain technology will attract millions of users to engage in investing and trading cryptocurrencies, and Telegram may become one of the best worthy competitors for the Binance platform in the future and for other exchanges, I am very excited to try out Telegram's new decentralized developments and features.",

As a messaging app, it's one of the most used in the world and we still have no idea if its plan of having its own wallet and exchange will be liked by most of its users. Maybe, or not. But if it's going to show something good about it and it's not going to be asking for KYC then for sure that many users will start using and exchanging there, as most of the exchanges are like that in the beginning.",

Telegram itself has its name auction and i think the creation of new wallet or exchange site will be related to the this kind of service. I meant telegram wants to facilitate its users to did transactions and the users will be able to converting their tokens that acquired from selling their users name instantly to the stable token or something else else like bitcoin. I think that the main purpose for the creation of wallet must be that. i don't think telegram has a big ambition to become a big thing like binance for sure.",

If he decided to create his own exchange and cryptocurrency, that will be appreciated and interesting for his project to join other competitive crypto projects in the market since everyone has the freedom to create there own coin if it will not pose a threat to investors.

There are many good wallets already so we do not really need this, now if they are planning to release their own centralized exchange we do not really need them either as it is not as if we are lacking in that aspect as well.The interesting part will be if they actually develop their own decentralized exchange, more than the technology itself the popularity of telegram could draw many traders to use it and bring a lot of volume to it, which has been the main weakness of decentralized exchanges compared to their centralized counterparts.",

I have high doubts about this.It's merely an app, it provides a platform for people to use, and people use it for what purpose is human behavior? You can't blame them. Telegram is not the only place scammers operate, you can find them on Facebook, twitter, and even on the discord you are using. Scammers are less active on discord because it is simply not as popular as Twitter or Telegram. If the telegram is really useless as you say, the projects have ignored it instead of using it as an official communication channel to connect with investors.",

The fact that scamming and bot problem in telegram has only grown makes me think how much effort they will put in this then. Decentralization in context of all of this seems to echo just lack of responsibility when things turn bad just like in telegram.However, if they would pull this off maybe they have thought of something others haven't. Telegram has the best GUI in chatting programs out there. It's sleek and intuitive and useful. Minimalistic as IRC, just easier to use. So i am hoping this exchange would be designed to be as intuitive as telegram. Because that would rise crypto adoption. Sadly the amount of scammers in telegram too.And what comes to binance... I don't see any decentralized service as a rival to them.",

However, its long-term vision is to create an entirely new decentralized exchange app ecosystem, making it a potential rival to Binance or other centralized exchanges. In that sense, it may not be a direct rival but rather a catalyst for disruption in the cryptocurrency exchange industry.",
