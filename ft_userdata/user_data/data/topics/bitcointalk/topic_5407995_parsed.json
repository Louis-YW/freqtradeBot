Sometimes you will experience a loss or profit and that is also uncertain, it can be achieved in a short time or in the long term. So when you ask this question to the forum it is funny, because even if there is a coin that gives profit in a short time it is usually a scam coin and if you want to invest in a scam coin, please ask another forum.",

Theres also many recommendation of tokens that can give profit but for me its a risky choice. If you want to earn something without incurred much losses then choose stablecoin, there are some platform which can stake those and earn a stable profit. Not much but its not that risky compared to trading. When it comes to trading my personal preferences are those rising L1 projects that can stand and compete with eth.  Feel free to choose those.",

I see this is as a wrong move knowing that you're just starting.Be patient OP. Investing in crypto and getting profit will take time. Most of the investors who are asking short term profits are losing their money in the end. Yes there are some who are gaining profits for a shorter time but that is a huge gamble for them and they might lose their money if things doesn't go their way. If you're mindset is short term profits, you will make wrong decisions that might affect your journey as an investor as you might lose money more often. Try to research, watch, learn first and then invest if you have knowledge.Anyway to answer you OP, you want to invest into a token that will give you profit in a shorter amount of time? Invest into coins that has low market cap as they are more prone to pump and dump. Like I said, shorter time = higher risk and there is a high chance that you might get scammed and lose all of your capital in one wrong decision.",

If you are having intention to invest in the token and you shall not expect to get instant profit from there. You must also aware that if the fact that earning profit from doing investment in the crypto was not easy. It's better if you stick with top coins in the market. Remember bitcoin can get correction anytime. It seems like crypto is starting to get a big traction again after months of bearish trend. Try to hodl yourself to invest when crypto market was on the bullish trend.",

Don't invest if you are not affordable for loss.Be aware of risk of your investment. About investment risk, tokens have more risks than coins. Because tokens don't have their own blockchains. All transactions are on a blockchain they did not own. So the price of that token will rely on their products and that chain. They can control their products but they can not control that chain.About risk of coins, Bitcoin has less risk, altcoins have more risks.",

If bitcoin goes up, all other cryptocurrencies go up too. Vice-versa.So it is better to invest with long-term plan and wait for the next 2-3 years as it is expected that bitcoin hit its all-time high after halving and your token will also touch new heights if it is a good project.",

You can buy any token today and get even 1000% profit tomorrow, and vice versa. I don't think the people on this forum can help you with the questions you ask.Maybe you can change your question to make more sense, like:1. Which tokens have the potential to go up in the current metaverse or Web 3.0 hype?2. As a beginner, which token or coin is good for me? with low or high volatility?",

Cryptocurrency is not an easy place to make money in a short time, you should give up that mindset if you want to make money in this market.not necessarily generate coin memes now what else is going on bear season, beginners like this should know the basics of the material don't think about quick profits. shitcoin coin is not very good for now most of the founders just walk away with people's money. which is certainly my advice is better to wait for bitcoin to bottom price 10k-12k and buy BNB,ETH,BTC which I think this will be good for long-term investment, and minimal risk",
