Or a different IP/Household? Because if you violate this condition, you will definitely find that your accounts have been blocked or suspended from the site, and any balances you have will be frozen. The number of this rule is 7.1.10.2[1] https://www.cloudbet.com/en/help/terms?section=72-securityIf you have not already violated this rule and your account has been blocked by mistake, you can join their channel on Discord and go to the help section, as they are active there other than on Twitter and the Bitcointalk forum, Hopefully, you will provide them with meaningful proof for them to look into and resolve your case, and I hope you will tell us what happened to you in the end.",

I wish they would care.QuoteIf they did, they would be active in the forum answering to different issues in their thread. Even if the casino ended up scamming you. You will have an explanation from them why they blocked your account or why it's been under review for five months. QuoteI would love OP to post more details about the case with enough evidence that can get us to tag and create a flag against cloudbet's profile here in the forum, at least if everything checks out and is true.As OP said, He cannot access his account anymore. He didn't take any screenshots before. It's been five months, and now he forgets how much his balance was. BTW, Cloudbet has more active scam accusations. Cloudbet.com scam - Closed account after having no balance,CLOUDBET IS SCAM! STOLE ME 0.92BTC DEPOSIT+WIN,Cloudbet - Asked for verification and blocked account.I remember Icopress ran their signature campaign. Not sure if he has any contact details for cloudbet that op can contact. Edit: Hahmpuz Managed their Campaign as well.",

If muratkarabag is not withholding anything from us, it all looks very strange to say the least. Well, this is showing irresponsibility to their players who have played there and this is how they treated them. All casinos don't like it if their player keeps winning. But, they should understand that house always wins in the end and they should remain fair. Cloudbet has solved all of their previous scam accusations while they were around this forum. But, unfortunately, they did not come to this forum for a couple of months now. When a player waits for his account review for more than five months they keep sending an automatic replay, this is not acceptable. Every player from this forum and outside of this forum should stay away from Cloudbet until resolving their issue.",

If muratkarabag is not withholding anything from us, it all looks very strange to say the least. Based on the reply on him, it's all about \"integrity investigation\". I haven't heard such investigation type that's said to be integral that's taking a lot of time and it's a lot of hassle for the player. I've heard investigations that has been done a week or two and even for 1 month but this is something else. Well, we can't do anything on it but just to give the support the idea that op is already exhausted and waited a lot.I guess there's a way for it to be expedited and that's why he has to go to their thread and make them informed that it's quite unusual for the process to go that long.",

Even if they discover any infringement by this user, it has taken too long to handle. If this client have broken or disobeyed the terms and conditions, then the management should tell him his offense and stop delaying the customer. I have high regards for Cloudbet and I am sure this issue will be sorted out accordingly. But one of the features of a reputable gambling firms is their ability to handle customers issues promptly and I think Cloudbet will consider this and save thier reputation.",
