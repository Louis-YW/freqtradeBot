We probably are, but media is not what it used to be during those years, they have learn not to be as realistic/fatalistic as they used to be back then by introducing the ideas of complete destruction into the minds of the regular citizens. So, far fewer people is interested on having a nuclear-proof bunker in their basement. The mainstream media may believe that the more they talk about nuclear extinction, they closest people will push themselves to it or take it as a fact. I am not sure whether that is true or not. The only thing in this matter I take as a fact is News and information media not being completely about important facts anyone but new version of the opium for the masses, regardless of their political position. Left or right.",

When US leaders break their agreement to not expand Nato, but then do it anyway... and at he great expense of Russia dismantling the USSR in trade, Putin is being stretched beyond his breaking point to NOT use nukes.",

I am reading he's a sex offender with some military background.See Tucker Carlson's interview with Colonel Douglas Macgregor: https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1693761723230990509The Russian military is depleted and if this turns into a 10 year plus war of attrition, there remains incentive by Russia to deploy nuclear weapons at some point. Putin is maniacal to do so as it's military has rather embarrassed itself as of late. NATO won't be getting involved regardless of what happens but for further military aid. They will not deploy nukes of their own by all accounts.",

Technology with weapons have come a long way and the nuclear weapons of the future won’t have the same radioactive footprint for decades like the weapons of the past. You are right but also you are partially wrong when you comment on the destructive capability of nuclear weapons nowadays.  The first nuclear weapons had a design flaw and left behind a considerable amount of radioactive fallout over the enemy's ground. Now nuclear weapons have the option to use hydrogen as fuel; the biggest example being the Tzar bomb developed by the soviet Union, for scientific reasons. Those destructive devices leave almost no fallout, but their destructive power is immense, so I feel it would be inaccurate to say in the future nuclear weaponry will less dangerous. In reality, they would be able to sweep an entire nation and its people in matter of hours. Another reason to advocate for peace and against nuclear proliferation around the world.",

(Related: Nuclear-armed nations are expanding and modernizing their nuclear arsenals in anticipation of a potential global power conflict.)Yuri Borisov, current head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, announced the deployment of the Satan II missiles, but refused to divulge any other details such as where they were stationed.Russia first started threatening to use the Satan II ICBMs against Ukraine in the first months of the special military operation in Ukraine in 2022. Putin said the Satan II would \"reliably ensure the security of Russia from external threats and make those who, in the heat of aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country, think twice.\"At around the same time, the Kremlin claimed that it had successfully tested the Satan II ICBM and then noted that it should be ready for combat deployment by the end of 2022.In February, another Satan II warhead was tested while President Joe Biden visited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. The test was apparently unsuccessful, but following the test Putin announced that the new ICBMs would go on combat duty in Russia this year.Satan II can strike targets almost anywhere in the world...",

If a war continues, some states have different threats. Russia sometimes threatens to use nuclear deterrence at some point, but maybe they won't.it is  part of world politics When any country goes to use nuclear weapons, other countries will not sit back, so those who will use them have fear and those who will be used have the means, so they say it will be used If not, I don't think so, but the way the global situation is going may be of use very soonFinally, I want to say that the world has seen such a terrible war before in 1945, so we don't want to look ahead because when a country is attacked by a nuclear attack, the neighboring countries will not sit back, then the whole world will go to war And World War III will create conditions that will affect the world for hundreds of years, so we don't want world peace.",
