It already went up a lot and I wouldn't be surprised if a massive correction happens before it hits above $100 or even $150k. However, maybe btc will be going for $100k without corrections. It is just, I can't tell what's going to happen by looking at this chart. It would be only wishful thinking. If you are heavily loaded on btc, you'll only see rainbows in this chart. If you don't own any btc, you'll only see corrections. Since you are not a TA expert (which is a great thing), I just summarized TA for you. so you don't need to waste your time on it.",

TA is based on statistics and probabilities, not certainties or feelings. Sure a giant asteroid can hit the earth tomorrow and void my prediction, but that is not likely. Maybe nuclear war will break out between Israel and Iran,maybe the sun will blow up tomorrow, or the zombie apocalypse will kill us all. If you want to live your life in such fear then you shouldn't be in bitcoin or any other kind of investment.",

Due to the large volume of bitcoin trades daily it will definitely take something huge for someone to sell and cause a dump, bitcoin doesn’t seems to have such Whales impact, even institutions that sell off and cause dip do not do it directly with their coins but they announce this sales before it happens and the community then react to the news which causes either pump or dump, so it is not directly the whale sell off",

When that cross happens, it is a confirmation of market top and if you have yet taken profit previously, it's time for you to wait for a double top, a bounce to take profit and exit the market if you don't want to hold through two bearish years.",

The Trump pump is being witnessed hehehe.Under US law, a new president cannot fire the SEC chairman if he has done nothing wrong, but with the new administration putting so much pressure on Gary to resign, that will happen. There's been a lot of reporting, and I think it's largely true, Gary will be stepping down in the early days of Trump's presidency. A clearer proof of this is that US exchanges like Kraken and Robinhood have also started relisting altcoins like XRP, ADA...these are altcoins that the SEC has accused of being securities and asked exchanges to delist them. Gary will likely step down and a more crypto-friendly SEC will emerge under Trump.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/11/13/robinhood-adds-sol-pepe-ada-xrp-following-trump-victory/",
