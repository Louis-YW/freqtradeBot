If the callback address has a forward address, another 1% (0.0000495 BTC) is deducted from 0.00495 BTC + the TX Fee (0.00003 BTC). The merchant will receive at his personal address 0.0048705 BTC. Withdraw network fees are changed, we will try to keep them as low as possible.About the stats, as we are a new payment gateway on the market, the numbers are different and at this moment displayed stats are for marketing only. You don't have to believe them.We have added to our tasks to add more features about overpaid or underpaid invoices.Have a great day!",
