      "body": "Taproot intended outcomes are amazing, no discussion. But the unintended consequence, unfortunately washes all the gains away.Complex transactions would be more efficient, therefore would cost less fees and less block space. Now what we see is block space (which is a scarce resource) been wasted with things not related to the higher intentions presented here: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfQuoteA purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.Once we had worried about block size, had year long fights around it, wanted as much people as possible to be able to have their own nodes, be able to have a copy of the blockchain and validate transactions by themselves. One of the biggest bragging differences from Bitcoin to Eth was that nobody can run a Full Node of the Shitcoin, but with very low investmant can have a Full Node of Bitcoin.Now with this NFT/Ordinal thing the gains of Taproot are gone, actually is flooding the blockchain with non-transaction/signature/script-to-spend-utxo data, opened an attack vector, people cannot transact anything lower than 20 USD anymore... Lots of problems.I don't care with what people spend their money on, but Bitcoin project has a purpose, very well described in the white-paper and in all its history, and the purpose was never to be a P2P cloud storage for people's shitcoins and drawing.Greatness is scarce in the world and Bitcoin came to rescue that. If this is an unintentional consequence, something should be done to rescue the greatness of Bitcoin, otherwise it will risk to become just a ETH competitor with a prettier story.",

Fee spikes aren't fun especially for some Lightning use cases and many of us don't like how people are using the limited block space currently. But a game of whack-a-mole with blunt tools such as policy rules and especially consensus rules is ineffective at best and harmful at worst. You may not like this use case but assuming you embark on a game of whack-a-mole what's to stop a group of people popping up in a year declaring their opposition to your use case and trying to prevent your use case? Consensus rules are set and the rest is left to the market.I'm not even that bothered by the fee spikes - more by the storing of trash data on the blockchain. But at the same time, I would be very uncomfortable with with unilaterally deciding what is an acceptable use case. I am vehemently opposed to censorship when it is performed by centralized exchanges, blockchain analysis companies, the odd mining pool, and so on. Why should I be happy with censorship in this case, even if it is blocking a use case I think is worthless?",

I mention Grin's technology because it's very poor choice to store data. For example, someone attempt to store Mimblewimble whitepaper on Grin blockchain[1]. But it turns out the data is scattered randomly and the script needed to re-organize scattered data is much bigger than data itself[2].Quote from: Carlton Banks on May 09, 2023, 10:40:03 PMI expect the experts are right on this one though: there will always be ways to embed arbitrary data into cryptocurrency transactions, so finding the some \"best\" way to mitigate it is the true answerI agree on that. But so far there's no serious attempt to find \"best\" way to make people less interested to store arbitrary data on cryptocurrency blockchain.[1] https://github.com/NicolasFlamel1/MimbleWimble-Coin-Arbitrary-Data-Storage[2] https://forum.grin.mw/t/public-transaction-data-is-a-huge-risk-vector/10426/13",

You don’t have to be a genius to see that the network will be blocked by transactions.While i'm in favor for increasing block size limit, i wouldn't want to see bigger block just to see block mostly filled with BRC-20 or ORC-20 transaction. And FYI,1. Bigger block size limit doesn't always mean faster transaction time due to 10 minute block time.2. Bigger block means faster blockchain size growth and higher requirement to full node.Quote from: vapourminer on May 10, 2023, 03:00:31 PMQuote from: hZti on May 10, 2023, 02:23:31 PM--snip--you dont have to be a genius to see the downsides of \"larger block size\" eitherjust hit up bcash_lol or bsv for your large block storage needs pleaseThose coin has low market cap/popularity not only because reckless block size increase though.
