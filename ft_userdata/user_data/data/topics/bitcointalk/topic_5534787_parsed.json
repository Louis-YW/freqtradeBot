      "body": "It's a confusing time - digital asset stockpile, national bitcoin reserve, the executive order, plus all the fluff on social media platforms...lots of posts and media out there propagating overstated things that simply aren't true about the recent news. Lots of noise to sift through...TLDR:Digital asset stockpile includes bitcoin and altcoins, national bitcoin reserve just includes bitcoin, both of which currently only represent what the US own and will not sell. Nothing about buying yet. Extended summary:Without overstating anything, here is my understanding in the context of your post and in a bit more expanded summary: The digital assets stockpile and the national bitcoin reserve are two different things...it includes (afaik) what the US Government already hold and the recent executive order makes it official as the national reserve and stockpile (what they will not sell). They can sell existing things to buy Bitcoin/other digital assets (including gold reserves or other assets), though nothing currently permits taxpayer money/any budget that costs the tax payer money to be used to buy Bitcoin or digital assets. The proposal to be kept an eye on is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve legislation by Senator Lummis which is not expected to pass for some time (according to some members, could still be years away). This would permit the government to allocate budget to buying Bitcoin (specifically up to 200,000 BTC per year).If something above needs correcting, please directly quote what is incorrect and correct it (for the sake of clearly understanding what is wrong with the current summary and to be able to easily improve it)!",

It sounds to me like Pi coin (or whatever it is) will be the chosen altcoin currency for the US reserve.Â  Of course, I'm being sarcastic. But looking at what Trump has been doing these past few months, I guess no one will be surprised by his decisions.",

I believe it took a reminder from one of the aids before he even remembered to add bitcoin and ethereum. Maybe he is calmer now after being spoken to be his associates, the reason they have now gone back to bitcoin. We shall see in the coming days or weeks what will actually make it to the crypto reserve because there is still so much confusion about the whole thing.",

I think it is market manipulation.he did say that those altcoins are to be part of the reserve it could be market manipulation but if it is it is not working very well hence why i do not think it is but we will see if trump does not fulfill his promises then it is market manipulation what he is doing now",

Trump originally said it was a \"crypto reserve\" consisting of 5 cryptocurrencies, but on Friday he used an executive order to launch a \"bitcoin reserve\" consisting of bitcoins they already had that were seized from criminals. But it can't be called a national reserve because the government can't invest in it regularly. So I'm a bit confused by this myself, and see it more as a political game and manipulation by Trump.",

But moving further, Trump and the whitehouse are also looking or considering taking Altcoins in the top 6 or 7 according to their marketcap ranking and making a strategic reserve of this alts as well, this has not been concluded, it was only a suggestion or idea which I believe, Trump and his government as well as the whitehouse are still discussing about to arrive at a final decision.There was not any market manipulation, the only issue is that alot of people fail to verify informations themselves before making a decision, they tend to listen and depend on media which twist information at times.",

So instead of jumping to conclusions, why not wait for the final publication to see if altcoins are actually included or if itâs just Bitcoin?",

However, would he really go to the extent of hosting a crypto summit and including Bitcoin in the discussion if he had no interest in it? If he had no real intention, perhaps he would have remained silent, allowing us to realize on our own that we had been used and dumped. Maybe you're right, he could just be manipulating the market. Still, let's give him some time to make a solid decision so we can truly understand his intentions for the crypto community. If he is merely playing with our intellect, or are we the ones expecting everything to happen too quickly?",

I mean I reckon Bitcoin was always the priority especially since they had all those confiscated Bitcoin that they had and haven't sold/released into the market yet. Assuming that Trump is speaking the truth, other alts would probably be a followup on the reserve when they decide how Bitcoin does as one. Especially since they aren't doing any plans of buying crypto yet, only those confiscated, so yeah. The amount they have (idrk how much they have) might also be a factor in stopping them from immediately including alts in the nationa reserve.",

So I won't be surprised if the altcoins are dropped from his plan of national reserve. Because there were a couple of altcoins in his plan earlier. However, if these have been dropped, that makes sense too! Bitcoin is the biggest cryptocurrency as per the market size so I don't think any other cryptos are needed in reality.",

For me, there is nothing like confusion with the United States Bitcoin reserve policy because it avoids all confusion that the president decides to focus on Bitcoin alone instead of spreading their focus and that will lead to the confusion that you mentioned, the United States president is Smart enough not to have mentioned altcoins join the crypto reserve because of the risk that comes with coins aside from Bitcoin, so let no one speak about confusion in all of this since it a clear case of smart national reserve.",

The US government isn't actually blind to all these things so they should be able to tell that a long term currency is suitable for a reserve.This could probably be another news to tear up FOMO in the altcoin market that will anchor a massive manipulation.",
