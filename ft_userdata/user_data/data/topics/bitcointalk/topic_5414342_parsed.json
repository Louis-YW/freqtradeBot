I think they have lots of spam backlinks which is why their website was being deindexed from Google SERP.So not worth becoming a referral unless you are trying to promote their token?Plus their token is not well-known and it doesn't have any announcement here on the forum.",

Anyway I will try a free plan and will find out if I want to use premium and become a referral. Go for that trial option first, and see if the site really works for their purpose. Having that plan for your trades can be a big help though but I won’t suggest to spend that much on a not popular site, I mean there’s a lot of ways now to learn if you just want it and you can have that without spending any.",

Instead of paying directly and getting a signal alone, you can now get a token here which you can hold or trade. If this works out well then your income will be doubled because you can earn from their token while you can also earn from the signals that they are giving.Service like this are still there because there are still people who can't learn on their own but they like to depend on other's ability. There are some who can learn on their own but they aren't confident enough. I expect services like this will continue to grow, now that crypto adoption is also getting bigger.",
