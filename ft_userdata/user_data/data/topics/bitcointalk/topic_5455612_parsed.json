There mentioned several crypto faucets such as Free Cash, Idle Empire, Cointiply, Trust Dice, Roller Coin and Crypto Faucet.I have used some of them and yes, They give you some crypto but its not really free.As you mentioned they gave us several tasks to complete.And if you're asking if it's worth it, I think it's the same as Airdrop, CMIIW.  In my experience it's quite worth it if we like the task they give us. Like Trust Dice and Roller Coin which tells us to play games or Idle Empire which gives us the task of filling out surveys and playing some games there.",

The strange thing is that two of the most popular faucets here are arranged late, so I do not know what was arranged.Finally, although the platform provided a lot of good information, now the faucets are a waste of time, as you can earn a lot if you work hard in that time by developing your skills instead of getting free coins (nothing good is free)so ya you can get some coins using some faucets listed above but you are wasting your time.",

For one person, earning cryptocurrencies worth a few or a dozen or so dollars will be attractive, and for others it will not. The article you linked seems to be a good source. There are several websites presented there, which have been operating for quite a long time and are still solvent.",

Your time is worth even more than collecting some tokens that are not even worth with some pennies. That article was not telling you about how to make your time even worthed by collecting it. There is a better way than it. Participating in the bounties are much more reliable at this moment.",

After so much research, I got to know that there are many websites called crypto faucets which reward users with crypto for performing several tasks on their platform. In general i would say that faucets are definitely not worth it, at least in my opinion. With most faucets you can usually claim like once per day and every claim is worth only a few cents at max most of the times even only fractions of cents. So you would need to claim from the faucet for probably a few weeks or even months until you have a few dollars on your wallet. If you are coming from a 3rd world country, then this could maybe still be attractive to you, but for the most people i would guess it is just a waste of time.Of course there is also the possibility, that those coins that you get from a faucet will do a x1000 or even more in a few years so those few cents could be a few hundred dollars then, but that chance is slim to none of course.",

BCT use to be a good place to earn decent amount of money from Bounties before but now it is increasingly becoming difficult to enter, find quality and rewarding bounty.",

It probably costs you more to run your computer just to click the Claim button than the amount you receive when you claim it.The time you spend doing faucet claiming can be SO much better spent doing other things. Things like offering services for money and investing it in BTC. Hell, open a lemonade stand and you get more money lol.Also keep in mind many faucets are only temporarily active & existing. Some of them used to allow you to create an account & add up sats until a minimum threshold for withdrawal but the withdrawal never happened because the site closed before anyone could reach it. Worth keeping that in mind.",

Faucets are good for newbies just to know that this is possible to earn and they'll have a glance and a way of earning a few of these cryptos.

Honestly, it will lose your bright day thinking of it and waiting for nothing. It is very simple, if you use your time wisely, better spend it learning to trade rather than finding faucets and joining airdrop in order to earn free coins.

These tasks, although they are easy to do, the time you will spend completing them will often be more important and more valuable than the tokens you will get.

Unfortunately, this is no longer possible, and most of the faucets give free new currencies that have no value at the present time, and you will have to wait for the currency project to succeed and reach the trading platforms in order to be able to exchange it.
