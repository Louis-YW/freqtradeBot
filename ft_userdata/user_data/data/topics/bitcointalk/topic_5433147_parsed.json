      "body": "In gambling that I can be able to analyse, I go for just few ones like sport, I prefer football and table tennis. There are other ones but I prefer those two, especially football which I spend more of my money that I can afford to lose on. I am a busy type but I like casinos too, the one that I prefer more is roulette. I like playing chess, but I can not gamble with my neighbors or friends, there should be some sites that may support chess, but I have not checked that before. What I just noticed is that I have fun with football, table tennis and roulette. If I see any betting site that support chess, I may try it to see how it is, but not likely that I may like it, it depends on the outcome and how fun it is.",

So, if there was a site where you could bet on checkers or chess would you go for it?When I was still a little boy, if I'm not mistaken during the height of chess in the mid to late 80's, it was huge in every country. So I would see parents of my friends, their uncles and everyone in the neighborhood will sit down and have this sort of chess tournament that will start late morning that will go up to the afternoon and evening and all they do is play chess and bet against each other. I'm seeing this kind of setting in the last couple of years though, but not sure if money is involved or just friendly matches in between. So yeah, why not? I would bet on it, but I wouldn't play, I know how to play it but I don't like the pressures of it, hehehe.",

Some schools organise such as the end of year curricular activities where students are levied/ contribute finance for the end of the year party and they enter for any of the games including chess to compete with each other or one another as the case may be. To compete is of course a kind of gambling because there is something at stake and the price won by the winner is to show better performance. So chess gambling is not strange and people will find it easy to also bet on line and it will involve different options with the king, Queen etc.",

So far I'm yet t0 see an official casino preceding bets for games like this but speaking as an avid chess enthusiast since time immemorial, it would do the chess community great service if it could get all the popularity it could. As it stands today chess is far from a dying sport, I would even argue that it will outlive every known sport and game in existence. But the utter lack of public attention and acclaim is saddening sometimes, especially considering how great the game is and how high-level yet beginner friendly it could be.",

Whew, I missed my trophies but nowhere to be found now due to several house moves.Back to the topic, I'm sure chess matches are being listed by some bookies. I'm not just sure if there's a regular listing since if I'm not mistaken, chess competitions don't have regular matches like a season in any sport.
