I think it is over and the fact it is not as popular as mining from what I have seen in the Chia and Burst coins before is they are not as easy to maintain as the GPU rigs,with hard disk you make a process called as plotting/bursting and that needs a powerful workstation or CPU server in order to support let's say like 12-24 big HDD as they consume computer resources while when you build a mining rig the CPU stays idle once the GPU bat file has started the mining process.Staking is bad yes but you have alternative coins to mine still with GPU like ETC,ETHW (this one I believe to become the best of all of them,it is Ethereum Pow which is a continuation of old Ethereum) and RVN,ERGO and a couple of others,so that is why HDD mining is not as popular and very few people take the time to deal with it.",

I mine with HDD since 2017 and i made around 10 ETH in this time with only 30tb - but i had luck in the past mining BHD at the start and sneaked some Blocks - sold this BHD for 8 ETH  I never bought any HDD for mining, but i have some laying around and waiting for the next HDD coin",

HDD mining would be so resource-intensive (on the CPU side), that only large datacenters would be able to afford maintenance costs. I think HDD mining encourages greater centralization over the Blockchain, than it's the case with GPU mining. At least, it's not as bad as staking. There doesn't seem to be any news surrounding Chia or Burst coin anyways, so it's likely HDD mining will become dead in the future. Most miners are looking to make a quick buck, so they would go for the PoW algorithm that gives them the best bang for their buck. GPUs and ASICs are all there is to make a return on your investment in no time. Who knows what the next big thing in the mining industry will be? Just my thoughts",

According to HDD miners, the payback of a hard drive in mining is now much better than that of miners on video cards. When the CHIA cost $1,500, the miners bought the equipment, but now the CHIA costs $30. The NDD mining farm has a big plus in terms of low energy consumption, but the profit is also very low now.",

What relevant projects are being made?Unfortunately it was only hype, and the chart says all:...This usually happens when a new coin is launched. Hype spreads like crazy, pumping the cryptocurrency's price to the moon. But after a few months, you will see prices going down due to loss of interest among the general public. It happened with Zcash when it traded well above $1.3k per coin, only to go all the way down to less than $50. What makes you think Chia would be any different? It seems to me that HDD mining's popularity is declining, when there are a lot of coins which can be mined via the use of ASICs and GPUs.As far as I know, both Chia and Burst are the only coins in existence which can be mined with a HDD. I guess that's why there's not a lot of interest in mining them. If only developers made more HDD-mineable coins things would've been different. Not only HDDs are more accessible than GPUs or ASIC, but they're cheaper too (depending on the type of HDD, of course). At least, the two coins (Chia and Burst) are still alive. Who knows if someone decides to create a new fork out of these projects to revive the hype? Just my thoughts",
