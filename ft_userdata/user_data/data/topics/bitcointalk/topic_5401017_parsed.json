For altcoins, I don't think so but for Bitcoin, of course we've seen it up until now and it's been tremendous progress as long as Bitcoin's history is accepted by the state.Despite the volatility of the crypto market today, it is clear that in the future people will have to learn more than crypto can easily pull the trigger and break. If we look at Shitcoin just being a pile of trash that has no purpose to achieve a decentralized, unlimited, anonymous, store of value, and freedom of transactions as well as the spearhead of a legal tender. After all, every year shitcoins will always be there to destroy the market.So with a simple conclusion, people will get tired and realize that only bitcoin never messes with the volatility in the market.",

People are using crypto for 3 purposes, currency, utility and investment. I get that crypto investors are in it to make money, the problem is the market got ruined by the pump and dump scam and social media influences, that everyone started expecting a quick 10x return instead of 10-15% a year. So some potential investments that could have funded some interesting projects instead were blown on pyramid scams into the pocket of \"influencers\".I'm genuinely hoping that the market gets cleaned up and we will see 95% of coins just disappear, but suspect that won't happen until SEC/FBI jumps in and starts jailing the pump and dump fraudsters. And being a crypto enthusiast government getting involved is literally last thing we want to see. Nano is one of few cryptos that could be used as a genuine currency, they have Point-of-sale software which is pretty impressive. Unfortunately, the \"investors\" aren't interested in Nano, since the ROI just isn't there. On the other hand Ethereum network which is absolute poison, has been broadly adopted for all kinds of useless projects.",
