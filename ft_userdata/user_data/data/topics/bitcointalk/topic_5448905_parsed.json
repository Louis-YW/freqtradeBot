HeavyHash is unique because it can be mined on OPUs (that is, optical processing units), which excel in some areas compared to GPUs/CPUs. The OPUs are developed by PoWx, a non-profit dedicated to developing PoW cryptography compatible with ultra-energy efficient optical computing.The PoWx website can be found here: https://www.powx.org/The official optical bitcoin site is hosted here: https://www.opticalbitcoin.org/You may read the oPoW whitepaper here: https://assets.pubpub.org/xi9h9rps/01581688887859.pdfThe GitHub organization: https://github.com/powx-orgThe oBTC-core is found here: https://github.com/PoWx-Org/obtc-coreLooking forward to working with you, cheers ðŸ¥‚",
