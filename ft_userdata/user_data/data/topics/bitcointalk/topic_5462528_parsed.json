  "content": "We all wish life was easier, but it's not so we've got to make do with what we have.The degree you want, the career you want, and the business you dream to have won't come easy. I'm of the notion that life doesn't want you to succeed. If you run away from every obstacle then you will never achieve your goal.I keep seeing forum members make complaints about not getting merits and all. It will be very hypocritical of me to say we shouldn't care about merit and ranking up, but your desire to rank up should lead you in the right direction. The goal is to learn and grow, then make meaningful contributions that can grow other forum members. It's not going to be easy, and it will take time, but it will be worth it in the end. This doesn't only apply to the forum but to every aspect of life.Take a business for example. The goal of a business is to make a profit but you can't make a profit if certain things are not done right. If you just pursue profit without thinking about other factors, your business will fail.If your product/service is top-notch, your marketing, packaging, and distribution are done right along with other factors, you will make a profit.The same thing applies to every aspect of life. A degree, career, or anything at all. If your first encounter with crypto was a scam altcoin, it doesn't mean you should wash your hand off of crypto. If you're still interested in it, learn from that bad situation and gain more experience from it. If you previously made an investment in Bitcoin and you lost, it doesn't mean you should give up on Bitcoin; learn from it and re-evaluate your decision. So don't think Bitcoin and Bitcointalk are any different from life. You may look at a forum member with legendary rank and you want to achieve that, it's good that that motivates you, but you have to know that they didn't just achieve that overnight. They learned, grew, improved themselves, and improved others to get to that level.Whatever you want, work hard and smart for it because it won't be handed to you on a platter.",

      "body": "I doubt this topic belongs in this thread but you have made a point though. And i can't agree more with you. Nothing in the world is easy even crypto itself seems to be so easy and a lot of people think (All we have to sit in front of laptop/mobile to make money). But in reality a person at start can not manage to sit for 4 to 8 hours in front of devices. Then these types of persons leave the industry or that work by complaining the work is not suitable for them. Actually what you are trying to do here is motivating new comers to not to leave this platform because many people do leave this platform for many factors.Overall, we should also support them like we were supported when we were new, my local community members really motivated me encouraged me and cared about me in many ways that i can not think of. So, whenever a newbie came in our local community or even in any board i when see there post i also try to encourage them Because nothin is easy for anybody everybody have to make efforts to achieve something and that how economy works too. So we have to be hardworking but at the same time smart worker too.",

If we do pertain about the forum ranks then before merit system had been applied then it is really just that easy to level up or rank up but on the time that merit was implemented then this is where those new comes or members would really be struggling on ranking their accounts which if you wont really be that doing your best to be contributive into this forum then you wont really be getting any merits at all.",

It is not easy to form a consistent attitude in pursuing what you want because there is a level of boredom when you don't get it. Conversely, excessive expectations can cause a person to experience a level of saturation and eventually have to stop. Doing something is not easy and we need to see a way to achieve it and most importantly don't think too much about big targets and do it in a relaxed manner by continuing to gain knowledge, slowly we will arrive at the target we want.Everyone's abilities are certainly different, but everyone can achieve their desires in their own way. Get to know your own abilities, continue to increase knowledge by reading and stay optimistic by maintaining consistency, that's how we will draw conclusions about what we want to pursue.",

If you're a man and you don't have money or any other sources of income, people will think you're useless and even some of your family members will think you're lazy because you didn't go to work or find something that will put money in your pocket. As a man or person who is willing to improve his life or build something that will make him happy in the future, you must try and never give up on everything you are witnessing because to succeed in life, you will encounter many things that you could never have imagined in your life.There are many people in the forum today who, when asked how long they were in the forum before getting to the stage or the rank they are today, are unable to explain it because they were patients for a very long time before getting there. Attending the forum is not something that you think you start getting when you come, like merit or start making it in. So, my recommendation to every new member of the forum or any member of the forum who is grumbling about how to acquire merit or he or she wants to rank is to bear in mind that everything in the forum is to be patient and even investing is to have patience, Patience is the best key for everyone in life.",

If anyone has this idea in mind then Its very hard to achieve this goal as all work to be done here for getting Merit and rankup. Bitcointalk is place to learn many things about BTC and crypto and if anyone has good posting quality, habits of helping other and at the same time warns about crypto scam and also discussion on new technology then i think newbie can become  more useful members then old members. I agree that comparing with old users whose awarded free Merit its hard for newbie to rankup but everything is possible with hardwork and i hope one has all above quality then he will rankup more quickly then old users.",

People who are rich already have what they need, and even their children today have the money to go anywhere in this world where they wish to study. They have enough resources to sponsor them in order to go there, and that is why even after school they use what they have to get what they want, which is a job. And the poor ones who use their lives to struggle, as if they will kill themselves, you will see them yet to be employed.Unlike the poor ones or those with less privilege, these people are struggling every day to get what they want; some of them are even in school, and they are sponsoring themselves.

Therefore, it is a normal drive for use to desire more and consequently as long as we are seeking or asking for more, that is where we would feel the struggles or that life is hard. On my end, I'd prefer experiencing this feeling simply because it means I am doing something in order to earn or for situations to be better. We have to acfept the fact that struggles aand hardships are necessary. What's not is to end up struggling in an unending manner because that would simply mean you are doing something wrong which is why problems are still there.",
