  "content": "Hi, BTC holder. today is 2024.12.13As I have known BTC around November 2012, which has been 12 years. I am very happy to see it success.But now I see crisis. Quantum computing will definitely destroy BTC's HASH algorithm. Just a matter of time.TRY to Analyze and Solve this crisis from a philosophical perspective:1. Anti-quantum encryption algorithm is essentially the fragile self-comfort spirit of human beings. This self-comfort method has failed countless times in human history. We now choose it and will fail eventually, because we are just ordinary humans, like other humans in past thousands of years.2. Even in Quantum computing day comes. BTC is not completely useless. It has proved the progressiveness of decentralized world be like. Most importantly, it has planted an indelible seed of hope in human society.3. So BTC should take advantage of the current prosperity to quickly enter the quantum computing industry and first develop quan-BTC(1-to-1 mapping) that embraces quantum computing.For me, i am asking ppl here, for embrace quantum computing, don't reject it. Just like 12 years ago, i embraced cryptocurrency, but not rejected.In the name of god, i swear that this letter is for the good of BTC!",

      "body": "I don't think you need to make a new thread if your point is to encourage people to switch to a resistant algorithm. Dozens of threads exist already, talking more or less the same thing. Besides, what do you mean by a quantum resistant algorithm being fragile? Do you know how it works already? Not to mention, the recent quantum computing breakthrough is far from cracking most encryption. I'm more worried that my bank account will be wiped than my wallet balance will be drained.",
