The fork is still remain a big questions. To be honest if ethereum core developers didn't wanna do that by forking the blockchain to releasing another coin but POW is unhealthy caused by collution between the miners.",

But the important point here is will the system continue to work in a healthy way after these bifurcations? Or will block resolutions be achieved successfully? These are important questions. But as I always say, vitalik is a very intelligent person and I think he thought about the problems and difficulties of such studies. As a result, there is a plan to change the system and I think that he has taken the necessary measures for the project to work both in the short term and in the long term.The value of the entire Ethereum ecosystem lies in the fact that the best developers in the world have gathered here.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428589.msg59562224#msg59562224More than 100,000 developers work in the entire ecosystem. Even bitcoin doesn't have that many developers. But it will be an interesting event.",
