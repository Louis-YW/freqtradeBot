In fact it is just a digital crypto version of fiat currencies which will remain centralized and devalued by inflation. I believe the reason central banks are going for CBDC is because it will be easier to track and control citizens' funds. It's an efficient tool against money evasion.",

I don't know if I'm going weird or I'm in order.In the crypto,  anything that goes up must surely come down, I don't know if this will apply to dollar because dollar is very much over bought and the ending result might not be funny to the world economy.",

In other words, if history has shown us anything, it is that the global economy is cyclical and far more complex than many people think.This event will happen at some point in the near future, and it will lead to a financial crisis that changes the world and The next few years are likely to be very volatile, and it will be more important than ever for people to plan for the worst.I think the key to dealing with a volatile market is to be prepared for what might happen next and knowing how your assets will handle it.",

And they are expecting the fed to slightly lower interest rates also. However this is not good if inflation prints are still high. Here in Canada we are getting expensive gas prices again even crude oil is down.Housing is a problem because rents are high. Way too many new landlords out there who are renting out or AirBNB and this is what is causing this housing shortage and increased rents. And there is food prices. You got no choice but to buy food so this affects everyone. Not looking good honestly.",

In other places things are normal meaning they have the same inflation they had before without it changing or some currencies actually went up. Russian Ruble is a good example that has been soaring and last I checked it had reached a 5 year high.As for CBDC, I don't see how that's any different though. Their price is the same as the local fiat the country has not something different. Not to mention that if the banks aren't observed well enough, they could actually be increasing the liquidity (print more money than they should) and cause more inflation so these currencies dump even more.",

The US dollar is getting weaker, but the trade balance of the USA is still negative.Maybe this is due to the US dollar being a more of global currency, rather than a national currency.There are many factors, that determine the value of the fiat currencies. We can't explain the movements on the fiat currency markets with the interest rate hikes only.

Many countries already turned down USD as they reserve, and soon many will do this as well. CBDC is a good option for the government to stay control, because if they lose control over their people, they will collapse badly. Strengthening of individual currency is not going to be from cbdc. The government of different countries that are introducing that are doing so to try and hold to their currency, to try to regulate it and monitoring but they are failing in the total aim of preserving the value of the currency when they still allow the dollar in flow of the currency for use in the country. The dollar is now determining the value of the local currency, this is the problem for some of those countries but their government not recognizing that. However, I have read some countries have strict rule against the use of dollar or exchange of it or where it will be seen except when necessary. In such countries, the use of dollar is strictly for international purposes and not to be found with individuals in homes or government officials.",

It's actually rather damaging to America in the long run to have a surging dollar because it makes their exports less attractive to overseas buyers in future.
