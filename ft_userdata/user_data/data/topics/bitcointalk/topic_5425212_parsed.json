Not sure who made them, but I'm sure a bit of googling around would help. The counterparty burn was for trading BTC for XCP, so yeah, more coins gone... So yes, you are effectively \"burning\" coins when you send to addresses liek that, or say, the Genesis block... It may be \"trackable\", but the coins are effectively lost, and gone forever as unspendable.  https://seekingalpha.com/article/4082979-how-much-bitcoin-lost-forever",

This address \"has unreachable spending condition due to RIPEMD-160\" ? Could you elaborate please because I read this topic about this address and I didn't find a post telling that.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418492_Counselor said \"no one knows its key, and it may well be that such a key does not exist at all\" but he's not affirmative.Quote from: _Counselor on October 27, 2022, 11:54:29 AMThis address - 1111111111111111111114oLvT2, created from RIPE160 hash with all zero bits \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"Because there is no known attacks on ripe160, it is nearly impossible that someone found such input, that will produce that hash, even if you do not take into account double hashing when generating an address.To get this address, you have to find a such EC point, that will produce such SHA256 hash, which in turn will produce 160 zero-bits RIPEMD.So, 1111111111111111111114oLvT2 is valid BTC address, but no one knows its key, and it may well be that such a key does not exist at all.",

      "body": "You've mixed things up there ETFbitcoin.The address 1111111111111111111114oLvT2 is spendable. This address is generated from a RIPEMD-160 output of 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000. If you put 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 in to step 3 on this page, it will output the address 1111111111111111111114oLvT2. So, if someone could find the private key which generates the public key which results in the RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)) being 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, they could spend those coins. It's very unlikely, yes, but the coins are still spendable.The quote of mine you have linked to above was discussing this \"address\": https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/s-272edf45031dd498e7b3ae89e11ff21b. If you click \"Additional info\" and then \"Op\" on the left, you will see the locking script is as followsCode:OP_DUP OP_HASH160 0 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGTo be able to spend these coins, someone would need to find the private key which generates the public key which results in the RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)) being 0. Because RIPEMD-160 always outputs a 20 byte number, it will never output 0, and so these coins are provably unspendable.",
