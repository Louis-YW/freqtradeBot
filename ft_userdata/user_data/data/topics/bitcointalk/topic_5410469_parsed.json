Can anyone assist me and guide me step by step to import my Bitcoin Address ? Thank you for your help. I also agree with Charles-Tim: it's easier and safer to just create a new wallet into Bitcoin Core and send the funds there. If you use minimum fee (1 sat/vbyte) it will most probably be processed this week-end (maybe even today).I will add that it's not only that Bitcoin Core cannot use the seed, it's also that since it was user with a web service, I would not consider it that safe.Plus:* if you have big amount of funds, you may want to buy a hardware wallet for safety* keep in mind that Bitcoin Core needs to download the whole blockchain (450 GB) and by default it also stores it (you can prune it, but that can come with other surprises like the need to re-download everything when you change wallet); this means time and resources you have to be prepared for.* you will have to keep backup of your bitcoin core wallet.dat file* if you think that bitcoin core is not the best option for you, maybe you take a look at SPV wallets (simple wallets) that don't need so much resources (they connect to external servers, they also use seed so the backup is easier) like Electrum or Sparrow.",

FIRST STEPBackup seed phrases on https://www.blockchain.com/ (skip this step if you have already backed it up).- Login to https://www.blockchain.com/, then at the account, go to \"Security\" settings.- In \"Secret Private Key Recovery Phrase\", click \"Backup\", then click \"View Secret Private Key Recovery Phrase\".- Save the recovery phrase.SECOND STEPConvert BIP39 mnemonic phrases to private keys.- Download bip39-standalone.html (standalone offline version) here:https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39#standalone-offline-version- Then TURN OFF INTERNET ACCESS.- Open the file \"beep39-standalone.html\" (offline).- In the \"BIP39 Mnemonic\" column, fill in the recovery phrase obtained from https://www.blockchain.com/.- Scroll to the bottom. In \"Derived Addresses\", save the Private Key of the Bitcoin address you created on https://www.blockchain.com/.- Close the \"beep39-standalone.html\" file and re-enable internet access.THIRD STEPImport the Private key to Bitcoin Core.- Run Bitcoin Core, then open \"Console\" via the \"Window\" menu.Quote from: Husna QA on February 04, 2020, 01:07:28 PM- In the input field type: importprivkey \"privkey\" (the contents of the private key previously obtained from \"beep39-standalone.html\" ).

Can anyone assist me and guide me step by step to import my Bitcoin Address ? Aside from individual private keys (above), can also import the \"master private key\" to import the whole wallet while keeping the HD feature.For that, you'll need to create a blank \"descriptor wallet\" and import a descriptor made from your backup phrase's master private key.Here are the steps:Follow Husna QA's instructions up to the point when you paste your backup phrase to iancoleman's BIP39 tool.But instead of going through the private keys, copy the \"BIP32 Root Key\" instead, should start with \"xprv\".Generate a Parent Descriptor using that master key by following this format:For your wallet with legacy Bitcoin Addresses: \"pkh(xprv...........nFG3cCzejXfUUzMWehii19K/44'/0'/0'/0/*)\"For your wallet with SegWit Bitcoin Addresses: \"wpkh(xprv...........nFG3cCzejXfUUzMWehii19K/84'/0'/0'/0/*)\"Open Bitcoin Core and create a new wallet and tick the options \"Descriptor Wallet\" and \"Blank Wallet\", the other option should be unchecked.Open the console (Window->Console) and use the command \"getdescriptorinfo\" followed by the descriptor that you created, take note of the \"checksum\" among the results.Now select the correct wallet in the drop-down menu above the console and import the descriptor using this format (example):importdescriptors \"[{\\\"desc\\\": \\\"pkh(xprv8ZgxM...your descriptor..Wehii19K/44'/0'/0'/0/*)#checksum\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"0\\\",\\\"active\\\": true,\\\"internal\\\": false,\\\"range\\\": [0,999]}]\"(your descriptor starts from pkh and ends before the checksum)(replace the \"#checksum\" with the checksum from the result of getdescriptorwallet)Wait for it to finish the rescan and your funds should appear.Note: Since this will only import a descriptor for receiving addresses, your wallet won't be able to create transactions if it needs a change.To fix that, you should import a descriptor for change addresses or manually indicate a change address when sending bitcoins.It's also recommended to use a blank wallet since this will deactivate the current active parent descriptor (but will not delete/replace) if imported to an existing descriptor wallet.Lastly: Just like what's been suggested by others, it's still best to just send the funds to your Bitcoin Core wallet .",

      "body": "I don't know exactly what your reasons are, but if you plan on making a offline wallet with Bitcoin Core, don't import the private keys like above, since those private keys have already touched the internet, and potentially been exposed. I'm not sure how Blockchain.com store their private keys either, so they may well have been compromised from the beginning. I'd honestly whatever way you want to go about it, just generate a new wallet, pay the fee to send the transaction, and be at ease that you've generated that wallet securely, rather than relying on maybes from Blockchain.com's side.

Like you said it's a web wallet any device with a wallet generated by seed online is always vulnerable to any online hacking/hijacking attacks. In both Blockchain and Bitcoin core wallets if your device is connected to the internet there are still possibilities that all of your private keys can be hacked/hijacked that is why a Hardware wallet was built to avoid such vulnerabilities. Or if you don't have a budget to have a hardware wallet then having an offline/cold wallet is the best option just make sure never connected your device to the internet and the wallet must be generated on the same offline device.",

      "body": "Hi, do you think Bitcoin core is not secure? I am having difficulties finding that answer. Example: A dedicated computer that 99,99% of the time is off. This computer has only one purpose, to keep a full node of btc and also has created 2 wallet #1 and #2.

Extracting from disk this file has been tested successful.  Firewall has only one \"allow\" that is btc core everything else is blocked. And ofc both wallets are encrypted. So why a ledger USB is consider more secure then BTC core?On this scenario there is a second computer also with btc core and also full node. This computer is always online (also has firewall that block everything except core btc). The purpose of this computer is to use the \"importprivkey\" of the wallet #2 that was created on this first computer so it can \"receive\" btc and then \"send\" them to wallet #1.

Why this method do not restore the wallet and the address (public) on computer #2?Thank you in advanced. Descriptor wallets do not support importprivkey command.If you want to import a single private key to a descriptor wallet, you should use importdescriptor command instead.For P2SH-SegWit, the descriptor should be in this format (with sample RegTest prvKey):Code:sh(wpkh(cT7NyuTsgPtTBF91g1vbdzRJ4C1KHffKJpMXExTYjmJTRHcBMJfE))To import it using importdescriptor command, it should be in this format:Code:importdescriptors \"[{\\\"desc\\\": \\\"sh(wpkh(cT7NyuTsgPtTBF91g1vbdzRJ4C1KHffKJpMXExTYjmJTRHcBMJfE))#fjl3gf6p\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\": 0,\\\"label\\\": \\\"address #2\\\"}]\"\"#fjl3gf6p\" is the checksum which you can get from getdescriptorinfo command, e.g.:Code:getdescriptorinfo \"sh(wpkh(cT7NyuTsgPtTBF91g1vbdzRJ4C1KHffKJpMXExTYjmJTRHcBMJfE))\"For non-descriptor wallets, all three address types will be derived from the imported private key, including P2SH-SegWit.Try to add a label to see if it's actually not imported (e.g.: importprivkey \"prbvKey\" \"address #2\");In case the P2SH-SegWit address is different, you may be importing the wrong prvKey.BTW, although there's a conversation here about how to import to Bitcoin Core, the question is quite off-topic.I'd suggest you to create a new topic in case you need a follow-up to your question.",
