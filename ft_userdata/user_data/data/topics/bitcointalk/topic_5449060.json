No doubt Bitcoin is modern technology need and it is fastest way to send your money all over the world with very low fee. if we take as a asset then it is most profitable than any other asset. if we talk about security then it is most secure because of its pure decentralization. In most countries despite of banned the number of investors are much greater than gold.comparing Bitcoin with fiat or giving any priority to each one over other is not looking good and i saw many reply from senior member and avoid comparing both. Bitcoin is so useful and now it's very difficult to imagine world without btc but we cannot used is mean of payment for our daily buy sell cost. fiat is very easy to use it for daily transaction purpose and everybody can use it easily without internet connection. There are more reason which related to economics subject, we cannot deny fiat importance",

I know that banks are closed in most countries this weekend, but that doesn't mean their digital apps aren't working, they can use those to transfer funds easily. I agree that Bitcoin is at another level and those banks or central authorities can not control it. In fact in such times use of Bitcoin will increase, but not so much because bank account holders can still access their funds by using those digital wallets.It's true that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is at another level, and its use is simple and secure, but like other financial systems it's also prone to social engineering. Those who aren't well aware of the blockchain and Bitcoin in general, and they start using it without gaining proper knowledge about it, can still lose their money. And, nobody can recover the lost money for those newbies. It's a must to have proper knowledge about Bitcoin before using it.",

However, this alone does not contribute significantly to the adoption of Bitcoin because it cannot be directly used in many places where it is needed. To enhance the adoption of Bitcoin, we require more direct integration, such as accepting Bitcoin globally in supermarkets, allowing people to utilize their Bitcoin for their necessities. Unless Bitcoin can be used directly wherever required, whether on weekends or weekdays, it will not make any difference.",

It's one of the pillars of a good government. Nevertheless, at least we have a good alternative now in BTC, we have total control of it. Unlike if our money is in the bank, it will take some time before we can withdraw it and not anytime, it's close in weekends and even if we use ATM it has limitations on how much we can withdraw.",

Bank branches are closed but the banking network is up 24/7. Isn't it the case in your country? If not, you live in a country with a primitive banking system. Is your banking transaction stuck because of a bank branch closure? Were you not able to use your debit/credit card? Were you not able to withdraw money from the ATM machines? If the answer is no, the banking system in your country needs an overhaul. It's not always wise to bash a century-old system on which the economy relies. Every system has limitations and also has positive sides to it. In fiat, you do not pay a transaction fee, even when using a debit card, the receiver pays a fee. In bitcoin, the sender pays the fee and the receiver receives it in full. So even bitcoin has its own issues and benefits. Fiat and crypto, both are needed. A seamless integration between these two, will only help the economy at large.",

I mean that's a big difference on cryptocurrencies since the Bitcoin market is up 24/7 compared to banks and stocks, But I guess it wasn't really a big deal and it can be both an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time. Probably for some daily traders, it's a good thing since they can trade whenever they want to, but at the same time having a 24/7 market means your gonna need to monitor the market 24/7 at the same time if you really want to increase your chance for profit.I would pick bitcoin for a lot of reasons's not just because it's open 24/7, I invested and still accumulating bitcoin for profit in the future, Bitcoin for me is the best investment that anyone could buy.",
