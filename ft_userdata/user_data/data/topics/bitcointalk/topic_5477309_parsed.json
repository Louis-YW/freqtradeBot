You certainly won't find them here on the clearnet. People are so skeptical about such sites as they are getting seized more than often by authorities who might have infiltrated a number of them as well as investigations keep growing deeper. But since the shutdown of Silk Road, there have been a number of alternatives which have also been seized time and again.",

That's why there are still lot of alternatives of silk roads, idk the specific name and onion URL though.Just be safe because that's what every authority are targeting, well, with your status i knew you already such thing.",
