Seeing it on such a channel actually excited me, knowing that it was going to be watched by the masses. Though on Al-Jazeera it's about 47 mins which means some info might have been trimmed off.The Others I think I haven't watched. I might get some time to watch them as well.",

I used to search for the likes of these on Netflix and it seemed there wasn't much. I'm glad that you bring up this topic once more. I'm amazed even the story of Cryptopia has its own documentary. I might prioritize this one because I was a user and I still have funds stuck in there. It's just now that I realize I've never really known the reasons behind its collapse.",

Last year Netflix had release a documentary: Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King. It was on Gerald Cotten the founder ofÂ  QuadrigaCX cryptocurrency exchange. Many here might not have heard about this guy and how this exchange was the reason a lot of investors lost thier funds. This incidentÂ  gave a major boost to Not your Keys, Not your Coins slogan.",
