Don't get tricked with the high interest they're offering, your token price will keep drop and it's make yield farming isn't worth it.",

      "body": "If you're looking for short-term gain, the obvious answer would be the bull market. If you're looking for a long-term investment opportunity, I'd suggest looking for alternatives since the risk/opportunity ratio is quite skewed toward screwing you. Most of the time the tokens you farm are mintable, which means the rate of inflation is going to cut down your profit if there is any left for you. At least that's my experience with farming some tokens in BSC pools. The risk is many. Smart contract hacks, scam pools, some weird exploits that get discovered when your token was locked, etc. Compared to other alternatives like mining or swing trading, I'd say that the uncertainty is higher in the sense that most of those factors are not under your control. Personally, I don't think a booming yield market is the only sign that the bull market is happening, but of course, you can use it as one of its signs since the market has changed a bit compared to the past. At the end of the day, it is highly speculative (more than swing trading I'd say), so I don't recommend it unless you're doing it for short term for whatever reason.",

Cause I had some on ftm blockchain and I could remove it anytime without locking my tokens. There is such risk on yield farming but APR could somehow remedy that. Its a risky one but if the price of the farm tokens matured or increased then youll benefit within it. Sometime its quite low on rewards, due to increasing poolers but it will compensate on a long run.",

      "body": "When you mention yield farming are you talking about AMM (adding funds to liquidity pools and making money out of that from things like fees and slippage) or are you talking about other defi products that get offered.If it's the first, then I'd say now was probably the best time to start doing it and if you're ever going to make a profit, the time to invest would be at the lows of a bear market. You need to remember to claim your yield often enough though as the price of the token will start to fall as the return goes up (especially if there isn't new money in the space). This is more problematic when investing in coins said to \"innovate\" imo as they're going to do that for some time and then will likely gets its market cap diluted by the next innovation.",

It's like that you just have to monitor and choose what you think is going to be profitable because they're just like all of a sudden becomes profitable and then when people starts to gather and starts investing and also do yield farming then rates are decreasing.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 01, 2023, 09:06:39 AMMy second question is what risks comes with Yield farming?I'm sure you've heard of rug pull then that's one of the risk that it has.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 01, 2023, 09:06:39 AMI have once heard from a popular figure in crypto space that the beginning of a bull market is when staking and yield farming makes sense but how true?

Don't get tricked with the high interest they're offering, your token price will keep drop and it's make yield farming isn't worth it.Well said, unfortunately this is mostly accurate. There is not a viable service yet that is decentralized and mathematically viable, in the way that you don't have \"winners\" and \"losers\". Yield farming should not have winners and losers, everyone who is involved should be able to yield the expected APR without being exposed to permanently devaluing tokens. Fluctuations are normal, though this is usually not the case with yield farmers. If you are yield farming, treat it like a game and I am sure you will succeed more than trusting a singular service.",

Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 01, 2023, 09:06:39 AMA bearish market or a bullish market? It doesn't matter a lot but bullish market will give only more liquidity and users but I'm not sure if this gonna be significant. If you only wanna start and then you can try it during bearish market.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 01, 2023, 09:06:39 AMMy second question is what risks comes with Yield farming? The risks came when the yield farming tokens has limited liquidity. Yield farming token has very big or even non sense APR which lead to the dump of token in the market. That being said that if your token may worth nothing in the future.

I haven't done this before. Staking actually make sense but not for yield farming with non sense APR like thousands percent of APR/APY.",

Enter bear market, that when you realize that most are just scams with no long term goals.Tip: make as much profit as you can in the bull market and exit before everything implodes",

      "body": "As you mentioned, yield farming can be very lucrative if done correctly. As for when a newbie should start yield farming, it really depends on your personal risk tolerance and understanding of the market. Some people might recommend waiting until the market is bullish, while others might say to start during a bearish market to get better returns. Ultimately, it's up to you to do your research and decide what makes the most sense for your situation.I think, yield farming is not without its risks, and it's important to be aware of them before you start. Some of the main risks include impermanent loss, smart contract vulnerabilities, and market volatility. However, if you do your due diligence and choose a reputable DEFI platform, these risks can be minimized.While it's true that a bull market can lead to higher returns, it's important to remember that there are no guarantees in the crypto market. It's always a good idea to do your research and make informed decisions based on your own risk tolerance and understanding of the market.",

      "body": "In my opinion, it would be scarier if you entered yield farming on a bull market. based on an experience I lost a lot because deposited in some yield and stake platforms on DeFi Universe. A single token would be fine but the usually smart contract will lock your token in the amount of time. and if you using liquidity farm the pain is real I deposit 100$ tokens and now worth less than 5$. So the conclusion is you can take a look projects who doing well in a bear market even if the price is not performing well. and maybe invest some of it so when the bull comes up the price might already hit x5 or x10",

      "body": "In my opinion, an ideal crypto payment gateway should have certain features such as low transaction fees, fast transaction times, and support for multiple cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it should have strong security measures in place to protect both the user and the payment network. In terms of user experience, it should be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with clear instructions on how to use it.Then, about yield farming. I think that a newbie should start yield farming during a bullish market. This is because during a bullish market, the prices of cryptocurrencies are generally higher, which means that the rewards for yield farming are also higher. However, it is important to do thorough research on the DEFI platform, understand the risks involved, and start with a small amount before committing a larger sum of money.",
