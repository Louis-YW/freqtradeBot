(one world currency dystopia)what will/should happen is scale BITCOINand have subnetworks(plural) as NICHE services for small service offerings of multiple feature/functions.. but using subnetworks yet to even be made from scratch(learning from LN mistakes)right now we are in the same economic joke punchline as \"why is there no cure for cancer\". where the punch line is \"why would scientists cure cancer and then do themselves out of a job, when they can instead keep developing new problems to keep asking for fresh sets of investment funding pots.the \"please be patient\" and years later flaws get public, is just the advert they use to ask for more R&D funding for the next project repeating the same flaws",

Since early 2023, it started to fall dramatically and I remembered about a report on weakness and security hole in Lightning Network. Don't remember publishing time of that news but from the chart, it can be some time from July to September 2023.https://txstats.com/d/000000012/lightning-network?orgId=1&from=now-7y&to=nowQuoteMost people are still transacting on-chain, despite the fact that sometimes network fees increase to undesirable levels due to the Ordinals hype. The L2 scaling solution promised to boost mainstream adoption for BTC with its ultra-low fees and blazing-fast speeds. It's still flawed, despite being established for a few years now.Biggest challenge from Lightning Network for users is they have to spend on-chain fee to open a Lightning Network channel, before they can use LN off-chain.QuoteWhat do you think? Is the LN a failure? If not, why?I don't consider LN is a failure. It actually has good adoption and not only for Lightning Network but look back, news about LN in 2017, 2018 and after actually helped Bitcoin adoption too.It is not perfect, not great success but not a failure for LN or for Bitcoin.",

Cryptocurrencies are mostly used as an investment, and if you have an investment, which you therefore expect to be worth more in the future, and a fiat currency, which you know depreciates, which one are you going to spend to pay for a coffee? Leaving aside the scalability problems that in a hypothetical future in which everyone would want to pay for coffees with Bitcoin there would be, since the channels have to be opened in the main chain.And stablecoins have come to be used instead of paying for coffees to lock in profits and/or avoid volatility. So you buy a shitcoin that makes you a 50x and pass it to stable coin just in case the price goes down as fast as it has risen.",

Maybe...just needs time? nah LN wont function better even if you plugged in an alarm clock or patiently waited 1,2,4,8,16,1000 more years.. it needs to go back to scratch and start again learning from its own mistakes.. i guess you mean \"time machine\" not just \"time\"as for the other issues you dont understand:their own units are called Msats.. which are several more decimals deeper per unit than a sat/bitcoin. thus not the same as bitcoinLN does not need actual bitcoin locked.. even thor turbo(bitrefills) proudly presents its instant channel creations. this is done by opening channels with msat balance which is NOT using real UTXO references, but instead uses a different channel policy of 'temp-id' many people can open channels with no balance just so they can be connected with another partner who offers inbound balance.. inbound balance that has not been locked at the channel creation side of the inbound balance provider..even if they did us a UTXO peg reference:there is no LN network wide audit to ensure channel users have balance thats actually pegged from bitcoin network UTXO and nothing stops channel creators using the same UTXO over multiple channels LN is not even a network that requires the bitcoin network. LN can bridge/peg to different currencies, so dont pretend its a \"bitcoin layer\". its a completely separate network that is not locked to be a sole function advantage to bitcointhe devs of those promoting their involvement of LN are highly funded/sponsored. so asking people to tip them/donate to them wont speed things upif you look at how many millions things like bitfinex/river financial have sponsored devs purely for LN development. the answer is then not to ask people to pay devs. they are paid enough but have ADMITTED LN HAS FLAWS EVEN THEY CANT FIXwhat needs to happen is BITCOIN needs to scale, and new (from scratch) subnetworks created that learn from LN mistakes",

Op you really pointed out good observation that need great attention, but I can't necessary tag it failure for now. my opinion towards it, is for the team to come up with more advert creating more awareness over the exchange, possibly check and see if there is any unfavorable condition in their platform that is coursing their initial plan of building the exchange not actualizing.Alternatively given more time can be an option, but is tide down to first seen if they have time frame on how the exchange supposed to have gone which failed with that they can't restrategize by checking the actual course of not meeting their target at the specific time schedule.",

Iâ€™d like to use btcâ€™s main layer for anything and If I canâ€™t do that because of the high fees, Iâ€™ll be going to the next best project which has cheap and fast transactions. I think crypto loses its purpose if it loses its decentralization aspect. LN is fine if you donâ€™t want to move away from btc but it is also like using centralized bank apps as long as you donâ€™t own your own LN node and in my experience people who use LN usually donâ€™t own a node. It is because they use LN for its low tx fees and creating a LN node ainâ€™t come cheap. It is a paradox.",

Most people think that LN is not a failure, but to me, something that has been around for a long time but is still not widely used is a failure. Until now, not many investors know and appreciate it, they are not even interested in it. If that's not failure, then what is? In addition, talking about the development of L2 on the bitcoin blockchain, I think in the near future we will have more choices and LN is no longer the only choice. Many L2 projects are being invested by large funds and preparing to launch mainnet during this bull season. Let's wait and see which solution will be chosen and used by everyone.",
