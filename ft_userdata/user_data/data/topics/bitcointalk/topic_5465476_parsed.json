Our voiceover specialist will give your content the sonic charisma it deserves. From velvety smooth to energetic and upbeat, we've got voices that fit every niche and style.These days all these are taken by AI. Using AI you can write a script, you just need to ask it. Not sure about video but I personally have done myself with voice over. The way you are marketing it sounds like your voice over are AI generated. Showcase your portfolio, may be you will be able to get some attention.",

I used it recently as an aide with a short film, whilst it was pretty helpful it kept suggesting very out of character, or out of context dialog or actions - despite being pre-trained with character bios, over arching story, meanings etc, it was still going against all of this occasionally.Flexclip may be good to generate your standard 'stock footage' films - anything else, I wouldn't count on it. Again, it all depends on whom is commissioning the work, if you want something that truly reflects your brand in terms of style, you may want specifics to be followed. For example, you may want it shot on 16mm to have the vintage film look along with a certain colour palette which will be curated by the set designer, costume, prop designer and DoP.Additionally voice overs are still without nuance or emotion, there is a lack of emphasis with delivery. Whilst it can work with your standard socials/reel advert delivery, for anything beyond that with a higher production value - you'll want a professional performer. Do you really think the AI voice you linked sounds good? I personally hate these, and will instantly skip over any ad/content that has these, they sound horrible.",
