Altcoins are the one bleeding in this kind of scenario and its due to btc. Also consider those whom going out into fiat and add those panic sellers on the reason and definitely experience a nightmare on global scale. Seeing it below 1trillion is really worse, and we can see stocks also declining means theres something wrong with the system and not just bitcoin alone.",

If you are DCAing, I don't think buying Bitcoin today or next 3 days will be big matter for your consideration.https://dcabtc.com/",

In the long run yes because Bitcoin is deflationary and the demand is increasing. The current dip is due to the shit show happening behind the DeFi sector of crypto. This is the main disadvantage on running a ponzi on crypto and use bank to fund multiple DeFi project that is now collapsing.In theory, Bitcoin shouldn’t be affected by this recent bad news but since crypto investors are dumb to panic on every news that is not related to Bitcoin. Market dump to an insane level due to fear. I don’t suggest to buy now but Bitcoin is a good investment in general.",

The volatility is reasonable and it's just a fluctuation that happens in the market, and experienced investors tend to buy during market crashes like these, knowing that it can give them huge profits in the midterm and long term. However, it's always important to be prepared for FUD in the market. The recent dip in the Bitcoin price is due to the shit show happening behind the DeFi sector of crypto. Even though Bitcoin shouldn't be affected by this recent bad news, weak-handed investors tend to panic on every news that is only remotely related to Bitcoin, causing the market to dump.",

Cryptocurrencies are at the beginning of a new technological revolution and could potentially play an important role in the world economy in the future. However, as cryptocurrencies are still an immature industry, their prices can be uncertain.Therefore, when investing in cryptocurrencies, it is important to ignore short-term fluctuations and build a long-term investment strategy. Investors should understand the potential and risks of cryptocurrencies and build an investment strategy accordingly. Furthermore, investors can use risk management tools such as portfolio diversification and stop-loss strategies to manage their risks.",

For new potential investors, this moment is the right moment to invest in bitcoin because they can buy at a low price even though the price can drop deeper later. At the very least, those who can afford to buy at this price can get a feel for buying at a low price and hold onto it until the price goes up. And the increase in bitcoin prices is predicted to exceed $ 70k so if they can buy at the current price, they can get big profits depending on how many bitcoins they have. We are now at the end of the week, usually marked by a correction. Hopefully, this correction will not continue or the price can stabilize at the current price. Hopefully, the price doesn't drop any further.",

Bitcoin price drop is an opportunity for everyone, but those who are afraid should sell and leave the market, giving the opportunity to others. I don't want to give advice to anyone because this is a financial market, and you can't expect everyone to win.",

      "body": "Price drops = opportunityPrice goes up = opportunity as well.If the price of Bitcoin drops, it's the perfect time to buy some Bitcoins. I mean instead of you panicking out there because your investment had a paper loss, why not add more especially when the coin that you want to buy is Bitcoin. Instead of selling your holdings because of what you're seeing, do the opposite, and buy more Bitcoin. Most of the time, contrarians always win because they are always against the herd. They are against what most people are doing. They're doing the opposite of what most investors are doing. Now if price goes up, it's also an opportunity as well as we can sell our holdings and take some profits.Fluctuation = opportunity depending on where it will go. Whether it's upward or downward, fluctuation is always an opportunity.Quote from: FireDAOJackie_Z on March 10, 2023, 09:17:08 AMFor new potential investors, is this still a good time to invest in Bitcoin ?

If it gets to that price they will take the credit that belongs to another and probably make huge amount of money from it. This is the issue those who care currently face. You just need to find a way to get around this... If you say rain will fall Sat by 2pm and people start saying thesame thing, how do you make sure it rains exactly that time without copycats taking the credit? You make sure it fails to fall tommorow by 2pm to decredit the copycats and get it to fall another Saturday 2pm. Problem solved.",

The price correction occurred as it seeks to test the support level. According to my technical analysis, this level is about 17-18 thousand dollars.

Bitcoin price has always been affected by Fud from the collapse of exchanges or financial institutions due to the wrong understanding that bitcoin is different from other crptocurrency. The altcoins will drain down and some might can crash because bitcoin price is what these altcoins depends on for their rise and fall.I see the present price of bitcoin as an advantage to accumulate more coins and make sure you planned to hold for long,to enable you make profit from it. At every dump or pump of bitcoin price,it is an opportunity to exploit the crypto market. I wouldn't be surprise if the price dumps below this.",
