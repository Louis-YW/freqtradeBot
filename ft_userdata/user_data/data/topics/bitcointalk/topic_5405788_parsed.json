  "content": "Ultimatearcade.io is a new gaming site that you can earn tokens playing games. Anyone can visit the site and sign up to check it out, but if you PM me and sign up under my code, i'll get you 50 cents to test the game with.(It is not auto withdrawable, you must play with it.) If anyone is familiar with the old snake game, they have their own version.(This game is called cyber worms and the only game I have tested) Brief description belowCyber WormsThis game is where players enter an arena with a small snake that grows with every dot you cross over. You start with around a 100 count snake and can grow up to 10000. What you are trying to do in this game is make someone run into the side of your snake and kill them. Each kill you make earns you money in the game. You can leave the game at anytime and bank your money or you can keep playing to get more kills. WARNING if you make a kill and do not leave but then get killed, you lose the money you made. so it is best to make a kill and exit unless you're extremely good at the game.How to kill players1. Make a player run into the side of your snake2. If you have a bigger snake then your opponent you can run into them head on and winLeaving the gameIf you are playing on a desktop or laptop to leave the game you hold the escape button down for 2 seconds and will leave the game. If you are playing on your mobile device, you will see a button on the left that says leave game, just click it.Using boostWhen you are playing you will notice you can boost your snake making it speed up. Be careful using this as when you are using it, you lose points from your snake growing. Available game modes1. Practice lobby - This lobby is where you can test the game and improve your skill. Free to enter and occasionally there is free money to be won but it is rare.2. 20 cent lobby - This lobby you can win money in and it is against beginners mainly3. $1.50 lobby - This is for the more advanced players to take a chance at winning4. $5 lobby - This is for the big boys who feel they are unbeatable. The game has multiple options for crypto deposits(bitcoin coming soon I hope) There is a $100 max deposit per day limit. Users can pm me with questions and i'll answer the best I can. I'm not the owner so I suggest joining their discord.1st deposit is matched up to $20 I believeTwitter: https://twitter.com/utournamentggInstagram: https://instagram.com/ultimatetournament.ggDiscord: https://discord.gg/tournamentTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@ultimatetournament.ggTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/ultimatetournamentggDISCLAIMERI do not own this site, join their discord to get answers to questions you may have regarding gameplay, deposits, or withdrawals.",

So is what the tagline of the arcade \"Skills pay, luck doesn't.\"  This arcade deserve to have an Android app, which we could easily play on than on a desktop. If I find it good to play on android web browser, it should be great.",

Goodluck!I talk with some of the team in discord, they're pretty new and are adding games weekly. I found them through a streamer and we have an affiliate relationship currently. I know a couple people whom have gotten cashouts and so far no red flags have popped off. If that were to change I would cease promoting in this thread.

You can use a vpn but idk if it would still block you due to your phone number. FYI anyone making an account not under my link gets 0 upon signing up. You have to sign up under me for the 50 cents.I'm online if anyone wants to practice in the free lobby",

I wonder when. And the time out is another to beat.As I see and try already the game, You can only gain mass by eaiting those food(tiny particles) on the ground because you can not get other players food once you killed them so definitely you don't need other player to increase your size. Other players just give you the cash when you kill them. That is the difference of this games to the typical worm game.I might create again new account under Yahoo code. I didn't notice his terms that I need to use his code to get the 50 cents bonus to play.",

Of course having a bigger snake gives you advantages such as being able to circle your opponent and trap them, but you can beat a max snake with a min snake. You do gain some of your opponents mass when you defeat them as well. I don't know exactly what % but your snake does increase on a kill.",
