Right now there's not many wallet and exchange are support taproot address, so if you use taproot address and then send it to exchange that unsupported taproot address, your coins will gone. But there's no problem if you send and receive from native segwit, nested segwit and legacy address.",

Do they mean bech32 address?Hope someone can anser my question, thanks.Because someone has already answered, and I think the answer given by @jackg is also very correct. So on this occasion I just want to give a little extra through two references that I have read and looked at carefully which might also help you to understand more deeply about the thing you are asking about. Please open and read the two sites below because I can't parse everything herehttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asphttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32",
