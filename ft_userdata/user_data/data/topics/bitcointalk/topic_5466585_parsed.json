  "content": "I don't do this often but if my post can save a soul from making the wrong decision, it would be worth the effort. We're in September which is the period which Apple flood the market with their new toys and people make the mistakes of throwing away money every year on these items. Why would anyone buy something that'll be devalued in about 12 months time because around this time next year Apple will be releasing a new set of devices and an upgrade of what will be released this year. Instead of buying those devices now, you can use that money for something more reasonable by investing that money in Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin is low currently which is another reason to make use of this opportunity to invest in Bitcoin. Those that bought bitcoin and ignored the latest iphone during the period those previous model above (in the image) were launched have made a better financial decision and anybody thinking of getting the new iphone when you already have a perfectly working phone should rethink that decision and invest the money in buying Bitcoin. You'll be getting around BTC0.031 +/-  which will be worth more in the future than the amount you'll spend to buy it while that new Iphone will lose value in the next 12 months. if you really what to get something relating to apple then buy their stocks instead of the devices (that's another means of diversifying your portfolio, if you think you already have enough Bitcoin secured for the future).Just imagine the profits that would have been if those that bought the new iphone during the release date of those model above bought bitcoin instead. Avoid making same mistakes and choose bitcoin.",

      "body": "You're absolutely right, @brainboss. Many people tend to forget that these assets lose value over time. In some countries, these phones might be considered almost worthless, but in a place like Nigeria, they're seen as quite expensive and not a wise investment. Personally, I dislike seeing people who own such expensive devices yet lack any substantial assets like a job, a house, or investments. They walk around with something that could be the root of their financial troubles. Buying these products not only supports these companies but also means missing out on a valuable lifetime investment opportunity. My current phone works perfectly fine, and I don't see a reason to waste money on such items.",

They (iPad, Tesla) are not assets but liabilities and their values drop with time or even fall to nearly zero when they are outdated or technical broken.It is painful experience as with 1.25 BTC today, you can buy more than one iPad but your story is not different than laszlo bought 2 pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins.We can not know price of Bitcoin in future so if we use bitcoin to buy anything, consider we cash it out to fiat currency and spend that fiat amount for purchase. I don't want to reduce painful feeling but it is what I think the best I can do when I do it.",

      "body": "Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on September 12, 2023, 11:56:09 PMYou have given the right advice. Investing in Bitcoin is definitely better than buying an iPhone. Suppose someone in 2012 instead of buying an iPhone 4S bought an equivalent amount of Bitcoin, he can now buy thousands of iPhones with 162 BTC. In 2012, the price of an iPhone was 162 BTC, now it costs only 0.031 BTC to buy an iPhone. So those who want to buy an iPhone these days, it would be better if they invest in Bitcoin. Because currently the price of Bitcoin is also low, it is a good time to invest, it is expected that the price of Bitcoin can reach 100k in 2025. Now instead of buying an iPhone, if you buy Bitcoin with the same amount of money, you can earn the profit of buying 4 iPhones in 2025.",

      "body": "One of the reasons people waste their money to buy an iPhone is because the product looks luxurious and premium, iPhone users just want to look cool which makes their prestige a level higher than Android users, they just want to improve the quality of life because they have an iPhone in their hands. As attached in the picture, The iPhone will continue to be upgraded with the launch of new products which make old products increasingly lose their price.Behind their confidence in using the iPhone, it turns out there is something more valuable, if they buy Bitcoin and ignore the iPhone, they will get greater benefits. Bitcoin currently trading at a slightly lower price could be a reason for them to change their lifestyle to buy something more valuable than an iPhone. The iPhone will lose value, whereas buying Bitcoin when it is cheap has the potential to add value, a comparison like this should cross their minds.",

I agree, if someone needs a new smartphone because one of those new features is really needed for their job and they can more easily make money with it, or they lost their smartphone or at least they can justify that purchase then I do not see anything wrong with it.What is wrong is consumerism for consumerism’s sake, as the money that we earn each month is limited and such a purchase is simply a waste of money, money which could be used more effectively as the OP states by investing in bitcoin or other assets which reevaluate themselves over time.",

Avoid making same mistakes and choose bitcoin. Apple seems to have many loyal customers that will even borrow to get the latest model. I know these products have some unique features like high quality and durability but I don't think people should go the extra mile to own an upgraded version. Sometimes the difference between the new and the old version is just an ignorable feature. Eve Jobs the daughter of the co-founder of Apple once mocked the company for producing an iPhone 14 that is very similar to iPhone 13. But this is a sad reality in most developing nations where young people who are living in poverty will save funds to spend on luxuries like buying iPhones instead of investing in something profitable. And in most cases, their former iPhones are in good condition but they just want to experience the features of the upgraded version. Some of them use the easy buy option where they have to spread the payment with interest for months because they can't afford to pay cash. In this case, such a person might work for a whole year just to pay for a phone while he has no savings or investment. These phones are nothing liabilities because the price will keep depreciating over one. But putting a few dollars in Bitcoin might look like a waste now but the benefit might turn out massive in a few years.",

Nothing necessarily bad with spending money broskis. It's totally fine if:- You can use that thing to be more productive for your job/business- You only spend on things you want from time to time. Buying 'wants' from time to time is good as long as you live below your meansWhat is life if you cant enjoy your money from time to time?",

Besides buying a new device, it is much better to be able to invest money in something more profitable, the best of which is Bitcoin. The potential increase in the value of Bitcoin is much greater, especially in 2024 when the halving will occur. Believe me, it is much more worth it to invest in Bitcoin than buying a new iPhone.",

In the end we all use a mobile phone nowadays, the problem is having a low income always going into debt to buy the latest model to appear a status that you don't have. But it can also be reasonable to buy an iPhone but not the latest one, or a second-hand one, or a refurbished one. There are many options. Instead of spending $1,000 or more on the latest Iphone (15) you can still buy the 13 and refurbished, and for $400 or so you can have it. But as I said I like the message of not spending so much on junk and better to invest in bitcoin.",

I don't remember exactly how much Bitcoin I had to convert to fiat to buy the iPad, but of course when I kept it until now the value of Bitcoin is already higher than when I used it to buy that product.All electronic goods will decrease in value, if they are only used as a lifestyle, of course, it is very detrimental, but if it is to support work or business then it is actually not a problem, but often more people buy products from Apple just for lifestyle because that is what I see from people around me who use it, buy an iPad just to watch YouTube which can use a cheaper product.Selling our Bitcoin to buy Apple products is fine in my opinion, even though we will feel a loss when in the future the price of Bitcoin is higher than when we used it to buy the product, but providing compensation for ourselves is quite important so that we can be more enthusiastic about to collect Bitcoins for future profits.",

I could decide to buy the iPhone today because it definitely fits my budget and could also have some money to spare purchase bitcoin and that to Me is not bad because we definitely need smartphones and either iPhone or android’s they are expensive ones you just need to settle for the one that fits your budget and not going over the hills because of trend. Also we can’t be so certain that someone who buys a bitcoin now would be get a profit of like 4x in 2025 even though the possibility of a bull run is certain after halving we can predict any bitcoin price and it is better to just invest what one can lose and if the iPhone money is something you can’t lose then buy the phone to have rest of mind before you invest. Because investing in bitcoin with money one can’t lose causes market panic and forces some to sell early even when bitcoin is down",

The marketing experts at iPhone understand this and they are exploiting this part of human nature very well.
