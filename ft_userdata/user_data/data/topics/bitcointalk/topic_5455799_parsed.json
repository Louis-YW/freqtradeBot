And I am hoping to read my replies from your ops, even if anyone should choose Litecoin, then it shouldn't be for long-term bases.",

But can Litecoin outperform Bitcoin or is Litecoin dead in your opinion? I just took a quick look at coinmarketcap and coingecko and to me it looks like that Litecoin took a hit just as big as most other altcoins out there and Litecoin is also not really recovering fast or coming back stronger than all the other altcoins. In terms of outperforming bitcoin. I think that there will definitely be phases over a few days or even a few weeks where Litecoin can outperform bitcoin in terms of gains for example when we get into an alt-season again.Overall though i think that Litecoin is one of those altcoins from the very first years of cryptos that are still big but slowly but surely losing relevance. Litecoin is just not offering the same amount of functionality that Ethereum for example does.",

In a big bull run after Bitcoin halving, Litecoin will have good recover from its price in bear market.QuoteDefinitely not going to outperform bitcoin. But it can outperform other coins and is a better long term store as compared to many other shitcoins.It won't outperform Bitcoin but it is safer than shit meme tokens either ERC20, BSC or BRC20. Litecoin is a Proof of Work coin and it is safer than mintable tokens. If you don't invest in Litecoin but invest in shit meme tokens, ask yourself why. I think many newbies (not you) fall to meme tokens and ignore top Proof of Work coins like Litecoin.",

I don't think much about the litecoin issue, although there are some signals and accumulated before, and also understand why the ongoing event could cause many people to pour interest in it. However, honestly, litecoin has grown independently since its creation until now, it is still the same, expanding partnerships, accepting more payments, but comparing it with btc I don't think it's necessary because it doesn't deserve to be on par with btc. Some upcoming events may bring some hype around, but as we are in the crypto market, the mainstream is still dominated and influenced by the price of btc.",

It will not give impact to the price of litecoin. No, it is not. It is still one of the good options to invest out there and the gambling industry always adds Litecoin in their option for betting so it will not be dead as long as there is usage, demand, and supporters. Try betting for casino originals like Crash, you will still see a lot of gamblers who prefer using Litecoin than other shitty cryptocurrencies. I will still pick Litecoin over meme coins like Shiba or the new one in BRC-20. Somehow it's not created as a joke. From $88 to $89 in just hours, there's also a chance for those doing short-term trading to make money from this coin if they know how it's done. About the further developments, yes there is none but it doesn't mean it's not valuable.
