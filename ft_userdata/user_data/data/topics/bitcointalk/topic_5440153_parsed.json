Does that make Bitcoin centralized in a way?*It makes the development of Bitcoin somewhat centralized as even with just a bunch of guys taking care of that it's still not one single factor of decision, but that doesn't change the nature of Bitcoin at all. Cassandra is a distributed database, it was developed by Facebook, but it's still a decentralized database, the BitTorrent protocol was developed by Bram Cohen alone, the BitTorrent software has gone closed source but that doesn't make the protocol centralized in any way.How would completely decentralized development look like, with everyone free to create his own version of...oh wait!",

      "body": "It's pretty simple.  With influence, comes responsibility.  If people can see that developers are acting responsibly, they'll continue to use the code.  Bitcoin Core is essentially a product.  One that you don't have to buy, but a product nonetheless.  There is potential for competition, as anyone is free to take that code, modify it in any way they see fit and then publish that new code for others to use.  But it remains to be seen whether anyone else could create a rival product while still exhibiting the same standard of peer-review and diligence.  Smaller dev teams would likely lack the manpower to produce the save level of work, so it makes sense to coordinate efforts in one large dev team.  It's impossible to deny there's a natural incentive to cooperate, rather than try to compete.Decentralisation is a valid goal in many scenarios, but I'm not convinced software development is one of them.",

You still need to follow code rules set by those developers unless your implementation becomes the new standard version.",
