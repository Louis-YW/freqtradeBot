P2p trading may enhance your privacy but you need to totally understand there terms and condition because a small violation of it may lead to funds loss or an account being blocked.Since you want an item that has to do with cloth you should have made use of Purse where you can order an item through Amazon and I am sure the cloth you bought on quicksilver will be available on Amazon.",

You very well know that you breached the terms and conditions, and yet you continue calling the scammers.They asked you to send proof, which I believe you should if you want your money back. Anything short of that, you just fucked up.Next time try using much better p2p exchanges like Localcryptos, bisq or HodlHodl and not a shitty p2p exchange like Localbitcoins",

      "body": "Reading their terms would provably help you on your case as other said it to you and it doesn't mean that you do that before you they are shady for doing this action on you since maybe they see you do this multiple times and its time for them to take action since maybe you do violation in terms using their platform. I'm not localbitcoin user bit the only thing you can do now is to follow what instruction they ask to you so that you can withdraw your balances stuck on their platform.",
