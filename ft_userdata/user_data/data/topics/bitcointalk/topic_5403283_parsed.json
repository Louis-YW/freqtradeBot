  "content": "Hey there! Totally new to mining but a recent opportunity to purchase about 10,000 Amlogic S905s for next to nothing has got me thinking about it. I tried to find drivers, or any posts about this processor being used for mining but came up short (and the stuff I did find was quite confusing...). Thought I'd reach out on this forum to see if any expert is able to give his 2-cents on the opportunity, and whether or not it's worth taking a shot!Thanks a lot!",

As to can it be used to mine any altcoins aka shitcoins, don't know nor care considering this is the Bitcoin area of the Forum. Perhaps try asking in the altcoin areas.",
