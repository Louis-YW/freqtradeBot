But should casinos be forced to sponsor sites that deal with gambling addiction? No, they can not be forced to do so. What that is most important is for the gambling sites to have a link on their websites which will refer gamblers to sites that deals with gambling addiction. But all these may not help until a gambler realize that gambling is just nit a way if making money.",

Casino boldly disclosed that they are not source of profit which I believe they are open to introduce this kind of service with their player since they are obligated to do so as per the law. They offer too self-exclusion just to make gamblers stop playing with their casino.There’s a lot of cases which casino ended up paying a victim(ga,bling addict) when it comes to court battle because the judge considers mental stability of victims. This is why casino usually avoid problematic gambling as much as possible because they might cause problem with them.",

Gambling addicts hardly take money out of the gambling system because the money they make are usually given back when they continue gambling even after winning. I don't see how they will even give this idea of curing gambling addiction a second thought. The best they can do is to emphasize their caveat \"gamble responsibly \" that is already part of their terms and conditions",

Not to mention that all help mainly comes from the moral of your home.Please! Don't expect help from a casino or government, if you can, pay for professional assistance,  even if you think you don't need it.",

I would say they should actually sponsor them but it is not obligatory on them to do so. We have seen cigarettes companies warning people through advertisements that high consumption of it causes health issues and yet people still Smoke, I would say the casinos should also pick on this too",

But casinos having some links going to addiction assistance is pretty common already. Its sort of a standard warning that gambling is addictive and if you felt you are addicted to gambling, the casinos offer help. Maybe the guilt is there so they are trying to remind its clients they are also there to help.",

Giving free counseling and other support to people who are facing gambling disorders will help to reduce addiction. These platforms could help gamblers to have betting plans and strictly follow them. These casinos shouldn't only focus on how to stop or cure addiction but mechanisms should also be put in place to discourage becoming addicted to gambling. Maximum limits should be placed on accounts that are suspected that the owners might be becoming addicted.  I totally support that these casinos should sponsor these addiction preventive, control, and support websites.",

I remember one of the first gambling sites I registered on, they have all those articles but I have never bothered to read it before. Most gamblers will not read anything like that. I mean gambling sites will still continue to make money after all.",

If they did not want to deal with addicts and it was a thing of ethics for them, they would chose a different business.We all know that addicts are a large part of their market. They allow these people to play and you can see who's an addict by checking the account stats. If someone is online every day for hours, and/or plays until there's no money on his account, then comes back another day, keeps playing until he's at 0 and repeats the process, he's addicted. They could limit their access, or their deposits, but they won't. I guess it's better that they help addicts, but the best help would be to actively monitor players and block the ones that are doing the worse, but for the casinos it's business.",

You know casino should take part of the responsibility for this campaign because they are liable for that.let me use cigerarte for example, of a cigerarte, if you buy a cigerarte, you will see it down there that smokers are liable to die young and that advert is Courtesy of the cigerarte company because they are liable for that and in instructions by their various country policy. So if casino does that with laws of that nature holding them to do such I think there would be less of gambling addiction.I know some casinos would not want to take part in this type of campaign because they benefit heavily from it addicted gamblers so it would look as if they are fighting themselves and would not be part of it but if the government CV an pi to a law and a clause holding them to do so, o think they would have no choice but being a part of it or initiating theirs as well.",

But I wonder if the casinos would agree to this? Because I quite doubt that the casino can agree to this and is willing to spend some money to sponsor a site that deals with gambling addiction and healing, and isn't it the more someone is addicted to gambling, the more profit the casino will make?  And isn't sponsoring a site that deals with gambling addiction and recovery a loss for the casino because they will lose some of their loyal customers?And I suppose that the casino will assume and deny that this is not the casino's responsibility. Because after all the casino only offers a game that can provide sensation and pleasure, they only offer and do not force someone to play gambling in the casino that he has and then it's back to each person to decide whether or not to play gambling. \"No one really cares about everything that happens to us, including the problems of gambling addiction that we are facing. So pay attention and consider everything carefully before we really decide to play gambling.\"",

They should be making a contribution to an independent organizations and have very little say about how that money is utilized. It's a bit derogatory to be honest, seeing them using such safe gambling promotions during their advertising and just gives them a pretense to push their ads to a wider audience. It's a very devious and underhanded way of marketing that should be discouraged. An alternative might be they pay the government who then distribute it fairly and anonymously to such groups.",

But maybe for some charity works that they consider, it's good for them to have that support. We don't know what's in the mind of these casino management if they're up for this support or not. Since they're not a charity as we say and they are a business, they might not come along with this.Because one justification is that if they already have a self exclusion feature, that's more than enough for one to stop.",

It might not be known to us, but with the casinos making huge money and government somewhat putting pressures on them and work hand in hand, yeah there might a good way for the casinos to show their support.They've already have this kind of \"gambling responsible\" program or self-exclusion, I see this from online and traditional based casinos already.You can put it that way, it's kinda giving back to the community and help those who become addicted to gambling.
