  "content": "Node Install GuideThis is part of my Futurebit Apollo BTC Custom Linux install guide.See here for the prerequisites.I planned to just do a Debian version of my OpenSUSE Full Node install guide.However, it takes an incredibly long time to build and I got build errors, to the point where I got frustrated and would recommend to fetch the binaries from https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/. You can verify your download through the instructions on that webpage.More detailed instructions about PGP and signatures can be found on https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#linux-instructions.Keep in mind that I assume the node was already booted at least once off of the original microSD; hence, the NVMe and the Bitcoin data folder on it are already initialized. In case it's needed, I'll add instructions for how to work with a freshly initialized SSD in a later post in this thread.",

I linked both guides to the common 'base' guide on top of which either (or both) of the guides can be applied. Maybe the hyperlink is too small, but it's there. Quote from: n0nce on June 08, 2022, 01:54:40 AMSee here for the prerequisites.I am pretty sure Armbian has SELinux disabled by default.Quote from: n0nce on June 07, 2022, 07:57:30 PMI planned to use openSUSE, since I have had good experiences with it as a node OS. Unfortunately, the SBC used by Futurebit is an Orange Pi 4 which doesn't have great software support, so for best chances of success I stick with Armbian, which is what Futurebit ships (just an older version of it).Honestly, I would have preferred something a little 'more enterprise' like openSUSE (or CentOS, why not) - however availability of compiled operating systems for this SBC is severely limited. I could have compiled something myself, but these guides are aimed at people who bought the device as an 'all in one solution' (as I mentioned, it was advertised like that), but who to this day can only run Bitcoin Core without Electrum or Lightning on it (so rather useless besides 'help the network').",

It's a small utility to interact with Bitcoin Core (bitcoind). Sure; it's not strictly needed for Futurebit, since they use RPC directly, but it's such a small binary that they might as well leave it in and prevent users such headache.You could download the latest build and install bitcoin-cli from there:Code:cd /home/futurebitwget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-23.0/bitcoin-23.0-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gztar xvf bitcoin-23.0-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gzcd bitcoin-*/sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bin/bitcoin-cliLike the log file states, you can verify if it worked like this:Code:bitcoin-cli echo 'hello world'If it exits without errors and echoes back 'hello world', Lightning should start up as well.",

No authentication cookie could be found, and RPC password is not set.  See -rpcpassword and -stdinrpcpass.  Configuration file: (/home/futurebit/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)I'm thinking I don't actually have bitcoin-cli installed as when I entered the command sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bin/bitcoin-cli, the command line simply reloaded to the base user and nothing was communicated about installation.  I tried tweaking your instructions so that I was in the folder with bitcoin-cli:cd /home/futurebit/bitcoin-23.0/binsudo install bitcoin-cliBut I got the following error about suffixes, unsure of which one to use after reviewing the help install --help text (if this alternative would even work for installing bitcoin-cli):install: missing destination file operand after 'bitcoin-cli'Try 'install --help' for more information",
