Is there something big that's happening behind the scenes and no one wants to talk about it other than behind closed doors?Yes, Google, Amazon many other giants had to cut down costs, staff and more, but why crypto gambling sites? Aren't these growing now and replacing the failed traditional sites that take 3-4 business days to get the user paid?What's going on behind all these cuts and cuts ... is it something bigger? is Binance in trouble? just preparing for rainy days? or is it simply about profits?Is anyone else feeling like something is wrong here?",

With regards to stake cutting the bonuses, they can’t just do this for a long time when the numbers of players are declining or the result is not on their side, crypto companies also need to balance everything. There’s a something going on that we may not know, only those developers knows what is coming.",

I don't have any idea and I don't care.   About profits, it is a no-brainer that every business wanted it, the larger or bigger, the better.",

In case Curacao License will be busted, I think crypto casino will just a find new license provider to operate again globally. They will not gonna take the fall because they are customers by license provider and not affiliated on it. What’s exactly the bigger picture you are trying tell us?",

Curaçao is a regional financial center and a trans-shipment location for drugs and gold from South America. source: https://www.google.com/search?q=Curacao+being+investigated+for+money+laundering&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8I don't know if this has been on google for a long time or not, but it's not a good thing, it's definitely not a good thing. I don't know how other countries will see the licenses issued in Curacao as something of good reputation and respectability, probably some time from now the licenses issued by Curacao will not be accepted internationally as something serious and casinos will be forced to look for licenses issued in other countries considered serious by USA and European Union, for now everything is fine with the licenses issued by curacao, many countries still don't even have laws on cryptocurrencies, so they won't charge many things in relation to cryptocurrencies because they know that there is still a lack of laws",

So far the gambling industry is still good as ever and it will continue to be so, it's an industry that will not suffer much because there is a huge market.I don't know what these are behind the scenes but if there are, they will soon come out we have people in the media that loves to dig deep and bring it out to the public because it's big news when big industry players are involved.",

We aren't exactly privy to the details that big companies are having, especially if it was methods to combat their businesses going out of service due to say, a recession. We can't exactly assume it's Curacao failing AML policies since there's already a few answers here, mine included, that didn't really find any info about it.",

I really agree with what you said buddy.For now there are some big casinos that do something like that, In the beginning they easily and often give incentives to the users so they actually have more loyal users but when the casinos grow big so fast that they have a lot of loyal customers they stop or reduce budget spending for incentives so that you can reap more profits.I don't know if this kind of thing will continue to happen or not but in fact this is what is happening and maybe in the future it will give disappointment to users to make them look for other casino options out there that can provide more benefits.",

Know that gambling sites bonuses can be high when they need more users. That is why you will see casinos and other gambling sites that have just started, they do have higher bonuses. But Stake is not new again, their users are increasing, they may because of that reduce their bonuses. If you are relating it to an issue like bear market or exchange faliing or collapse, I think that is wrong.
