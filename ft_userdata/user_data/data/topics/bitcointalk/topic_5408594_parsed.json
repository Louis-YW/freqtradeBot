The entire page is read, all of the HTTP[ S ]:// links are extracted by regex up to the next slash (don't worry, HTML on regex is fine in this case, and then if there are any junked-up characters like M-DM-1, then it is definiely a punycode link and a bot can report it to moderators.To ease system load, it can periodically refresh \"most recent unread posts\" - but it has the disadvantage that it report the post if it comes from anybody. That means this post itself would also get reported to mods.",
