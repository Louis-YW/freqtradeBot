I think what you need to do is either you post this message on it's official ANN freebitco or send a personal message to it's forum representative Freebitco, as he will likely help facilitate you getting access to your account once again, only if you could prove that the account you gave above is actually yours.",

Can anybody help?user: reetupandey75Just follow what the above said, nothing can help you here except the Freebitco.in staff.Try to search first in your email account and check your spam or junk folder/inbox.Sometimes, password reset emails can end up in your spam or junk folder/inbox, and be sure to check these folders in your email account to see if the password reset email is there and make sure that you are entering the correct email address associated with your FreeBitco.in account if you've recently changed your email address, make sure you are entering the new one.",

He's very helpful he and he will get him sorted as soon as possible.",

Can anybody help?user: reetupandey75If you think that your account was hacked, the best way to find out is to check all your emails coming freebitcoin because there's always a notification for any changes on your account, and before a hacker can change your email and your password, you will receive a confirmation email and you have to click that for the changes to happen, you also need to implement 2FA before you can change your email.Freebitco.in has a very tight security the hacker needs to have access to your email and phone for 2FA for him to change your password and address.If you haven't received the password reset then address this issue to support but it's unlikely that your account was hacked I think the server is only late in sending email notifications",

Can anybody help?user: reetupandey75Why look for help here while there's no admin or mods are actively communicating anyone outside of their thread? Much better if you contact directly there support so that they can take some action on your account. Random people here cannot help your case but rather they can make those issue worst since instead they solve it they might scam your account and ask for another charge for fake helping to solve your account issues.",

      "body": "I doubt you couldn't access your account because it has been hacked. First, the hacker needs to have access your email to be able to change your account's password. Second, since you didn't receive the \"reset password\" email, this means the alleged hacker changed the email you used to register on freebitco.in with another one which is not possible unless you have activated 2fa.Try resetting your password multiple times and see if you will receive the email. Sometimes it could be a temporary technical issue which get solved by itself.",

But if you haven't received any confirmation or resetting of your account/email then everyone has already said it and it's best for you to contact them.And if someone here or in social media approaches you that they'll help you with your account. Verify it if they're actually part of the team or it's best to just do the conversation over their website.",
