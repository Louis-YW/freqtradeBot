I have valuable assets, even though at that time I bought them with very small amounts of money, around 100 dollars. and the reason that makes me happier is because I feel like I have savings, what is very unique is that the amount of money in bitcoin every day always fluctuates, so even if it goes down it doesn't make my mind anxious because it doesn't take long to go up again.",

I remember being too excited about it, I watch the market price most of the time and watch my investment go up and down. It's a mixed emotion since I know little about bitcoin during that time and I had to do my own research since I don't know anyone who knows about bitcoin during that time. As time goes by I found a group of people who shares the same interest and that group led me to this forum. Now I share my knowledge about cryptocurrency to those who are interested in it and those who are asking me questions about it.",

I would love to know!what if you provide information not only limited to bitcoin?excessive excitement will make people very hasty and so confident to search for information on all platforms like youtube don't eat click bait and your friends don't get a thorough understanding, so this is not an obstacle but if you are still buying bitcoins on the (local) market, of course there is a guide. This means that maybe you are just getting to know the fundamentals of bitcoin and it's like something that has liquidity can be made into anything. if he only goes along to buy bitcoin and doesn't know the purpose of owning bitcoin, I think he has the right to know what the potential and capabilities of bitcoin are. At first I had bitcoin like that and ended up on a scam site because I was tempted by ROI and apy.I hope beginners can minimize greed and ignorance.",

It was a great feeling that I have some BTC (in sats) for the first time. But during that time, I didn’t have my own non-custodial Bitcoin wallet and I instead received it to my centralised wallet. That time, I was not educated yet about the difference between the custodial and non-custodial wallet.But at least I did when I first purchased the Ledger Nano S. As of today, that’s where I have stored my Bitcoins and other assets so that it cannot get compromised or freezed.",

I would say the best time to talk new people into buying btc is when the price is relatively down. Not everyone can handle such a huge drop in price. OP always keep in touch with her and discuss the btc circles (bull and bear market) so she can be prepared for both period to avoid panic selling. I wish her good success.",

So far she now blames me for not reminding her to sell when BTC price was higher.",

At that moment, it seemed to me that I would definitely make a mistake at one of the stages and lose my money, although the amount was quite insignificant.  Losing even this I would take as a disaster, but fortunately, everything went well and I received some part of btc on my wallet. The first thing I experienced was a kind of delight that everything worked out and I was able to touch this technology. By the way, this feeling lasted for several days for sure. Now everything is perceived as easy and simple, but for the first time the sensations move from distrust, fear to admiration and delight, and also, the first purchase of bitcoin seems to be something incredibly difficult.It is better to try once than to regret a hundred times that you didn't do it because of fear. Everything will work out. There are a lot of guides on this topic on the internet.",

It is really hard to make money from shitcoins since they have no value at all. I would suggest that you try to reinvest your profit in bitcoin since you could earn more profit from it. Though your choice is to buy laptop accessories, it is not necessary right now. Instead, think more about how you can invest more in bitcoin so that your profit will be doubled. It is also good to buy it again now that the price is so low.",
