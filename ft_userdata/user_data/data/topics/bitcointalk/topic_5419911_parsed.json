Well this is a very good reason why it's not a smart idea to trust any exchanges even if they are the number 1 over other crypto exchanges.Do not leave your coins on any exchanges all in the name of ' you trust them ' ,this is business, trust nobody, CZ is good today but that's today, we are all humans and change is constant in our lives. If you have any fund of FTX it's better to withdraw, I heard the withdrawal was stopped but now it's open, be smart because the market can still go lower due to this commotion.",

There are certain reasons why people are leaving their funds there and one of it as you've mentioned is about trust.Another one main reason why they're leaving funds there is about convenience and as well as the benefits of having it there. Like if you hold BNB or FTT on their respective exchanges, you've got some benefits to have like discounts in makers fee, withdrawals fee and so on.But yeah, it all ends up into not trusting them with your hard earned money regardless of the reasons.",

To many reasons why not leave your funds on any of them even if how trusted they are and for us not to get any problems regarding on internal or external issues happening on exchange we should avoid to trust them 100% of our money.",

Not everyone visits Bitcoin discussion thread on this forum, some are into altcoins than Bitcoin so I don't see any reason not to create such a post in another thread for more people to be aware of.Some investors don't even know what's happening to FTX yet because they bought the coin and decide never to look back until the bull market is here which can take a year or two, this is a very bad plan because anything can happen to that project within that time frame. The reason why many leave coins on exchange is for trading purposes, I do trade on centralized exchanges too but when I quit for the day I move out all my profits and leave behind what im willing to lose if anything happen to the exchange.",

If the prices of your assets are going or the market collapses then it will affect you even if your coins are in your custody.In fact, having them on an exchange (although I don't recommend it), you will be able to exchange them faster before the prices fall more.Keeping your coins on centralized exchanges/services is not recommended because that way, technically, the coins are not yours and they can dissappear with the exchange all together at any moment.",

I definitely agree with your statement- though I am somehow guilty that I still keep my BTCs in our local exchange.Remember that despite that these exchanges claim that they have the security to keep hackers from infringing our privacy, they are still the number one target. The maximum security to guarantee the safety of your cryptos is to provide a hardware wallet and deposit your coins inside. Keeping them in an exchange is a disaster waiting to happen- though I am quite guilty with this issue since the convenience of putting your coins in an exchange is too helpful for me.",

Maybe later there will be a lot of things that change a little in the future. On the one hand, Binance is a top exchange and so is FTX. Regarding the storage of assets on exchange, it is never recommended to store assets on an exchange because this is very risky. Unless we use it for daily trading. What's more, if we want to store these coins for a fairly long period, then, it is not recommended to store them online.",
