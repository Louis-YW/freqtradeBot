Let them continue to enjoy the lone top spot until another country seizes the opportunity of hodling the store of value as a national asset and have their citizens spend it like their fiat then maybe we can see a comparison. Bitcoin adoption is driven by individuals, groups and institutions and it is doing very fine as it is but I guess that the adoption will increase faster if more countries will act like El Salvador.",

The country has stood firm even when some international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund tried to discourage it from continuing with its pro-Bitcoin policies. Central African Republic repelled its laws which made Bitcoin a legal tender because of external pressures. But El Salvador has kept accumulating Bitcoin and has no plans to sell. Nayib Bukele has said that the country sees Bitcoin as a long-term investment.¬† It is not also strange to see Nigeria on the list considering the youthful nature of the country's population and the devaluation of the Naira. Youths are mostly attracted to Bitcoin and a large percentage of the Nigerian population are youths. Citizens of the country are also using Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.",

Their Bitcoin adaptation is quite strong, legal tender means it would be used like their fiat currency. So till now, El Salvador is at the top as a Bitcoin supporter. Even the government is holding Bitcoin. I hope we will see more countries like El Salvador in the in the near future.",

To be honest, when they didn't accepted it yet as a legal tender there are other countries that were considered one before. Like Malta, Japan, other Asian countries too. But because of this action that El Salvador did, they were the first in the history that has become an actual country that has adopted it. Not to mention the other countries that became first crypto friendly countries. Central African Republic supposed to be the next one but they didn't continue it from happening. But soon, we will see some other countries that might also declare Bitcoin as their legal tender. It is only a matter of time but we should be happy that the number of countries that recognizes Bitcoin is increasing. Maybe sometime in the next months, there will be countries like UAE that will be more friendly to crypto because of the type of government and rules that they are setting.",

The reason is that the president of El Salvador realized that in addition to making bitcoin an alternative currency as a means of payment in buying and selling transactions, they also adopted bitcoin as an asset protector so it is very natural that many people end up searching for El Salvador on Google and are now number one.El Salvador understands the bitcoin era very well because Bitcoin is a future asset with a limited number of only 21 million. This system is also trusted for investment, independent custody. The best Bitcoin asset, the comparison of the number of bitcoins is only 21 million compared to the world's population, so the value we see now is still cheap. because bitcoin will be a rare asset in the future, bitcoin is also the safest, most practical and fastest asset across countries.",

Its simply based on Google Trend results, which is calculated by checking in which country people searched for keywod \"Bitcoin\" the most, relative to all other searches.

Values are calculated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is the location with the most popularity as a fraction of total searches in that location, a value of 50 indicates a location which is half as popular. A value of 0 indicates a location where there was not enough data for this term.Note: A higher value means a higher proportion of all queries, not a higher absolute query count. So a tiny country where 80% of the queries are for 'bananas' will get twice the score of a giant country where only 40% of the queries are for 'bananas'.",

If you have read my post after the one you quoted, I mentioned factors like poor planning and infrastructural deficit let me also add a high rate of illiteracy. The IMF criticized the policy but the main attack came from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC). This regional apex bank controls the financial system of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.¬† Immediately CAR made Bitcoin a legal tender BEAC issued a statement declaring the CAR‚Äôs adoption of the new cryptocurrency law ‚Äúnull and void‚Äù and in violation of the tenets of the regional bloc. It was reported that the country had to bow to the pressure of the regional central bank until they came up with a policy on cryptocurrency. A country that doesn't have full control over its financial policy will not be able to make independent decisions. QuoteOn 26 July the Central African Republic (CAR) froze the application of its law adopting bitcoin as an official currency alongside its local currency, the Central African CFA franc, until the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) issues regulations for cryptocurrency throughout the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).",
