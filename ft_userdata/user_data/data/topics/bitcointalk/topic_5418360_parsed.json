  "content": "This might be good on some sides of the argument and this might also be bad on the regulatory side, however, I am certain they did this more for the preperation of the future and the recovery of their economy than for regulating the cryptospace. The liquidity that the cryptospace might offer on the next bull market might be trillions more than what we had during 2020-2021.The UK’s economy has been declining. Citizens have been dealing with a slew of concurrent issues, ranging from inflationary concerns to the energy crisis. In the midst of all of this, Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation at the end of last week.Rishi Sunak has now taken over the position of Prime Minister. Sunak is pro-crypto, as he envisions making the UK a crypto innovation hub. Amidst this situation, lawmakers in the UK voted to recognize cryptocurrencies as regulated financial instruments and products.The vote was passed by the House of Commons, which is the Parliament’s lower house. The topic was discussed for a line-by-line reading of the proposed Financial Services and Markets Bill. The bill also discussed the inclusion of cryptocurrencies as regulated financial services, which was put forth by Andrew Griffith. The bill includes the regulatory details for the inclusion of stablecoins.“The substance here is to treat them [crypto] like other forms of financial assets and not to prefer them, but also to bring them within the scope of regulation for the first time,” Griffith, the financial services and city minister.Read in full https://watcher.guru/news/uk-votes-in-favor-of-recognizing-crypto-as-regulated-financial-instruments",

Their billions of liquidity and cashflow will certainly cause the new fomo of the new bull market. The average joe has never really moved the market. We are usually the dumping ground hehehehe.On NFTs, it appears not much people has understood that it is not only about the artwork. Much of it is about the idea, the community and the culture. It is very much similar to memes. But memes where you can make some money like altcoins hehe.@cr1776. Trading futures is for a different type of investor. They only want to profit on the volatility of the markets. They do not want to hold the assets.",

If you read \"The 2022 Crypto Crime Report\" by Chainalysis[2-3], DeFi has 1964% growth for money laundering.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20140925015823/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/revenue-and-customs-brief-9-2014-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies[2] https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-crypto-crime-report.html[3] https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/",

      "body": "@ETFbitcoin. Agreed. It is not very excitng news from the most religious of bitcoin maximalists that want bitcoin to be recognized as currency, however, for investors who are using bitcoin as an investment, this is certainly good news. It will help pump the price hehehe.On NFTs and Defi, if it has begun and if there is no clarity in regulations on NFTs, it will certainly only grow. With moneylaundering pumping the NFTspace, this will only become more attractive for investors. 2017 was the pump of ICOs, 2021 was the pump of Defi, I speculate 2024 will be the pump of NFTs.",
