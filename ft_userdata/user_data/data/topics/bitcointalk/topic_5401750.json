  "content": "I still don't know why people are making stake and pd look like the best dice sites when they are actually the worst.1. They do not give you loss back.2. The top high rollers are fake meaning you will never win first place Or the fake lotteries.Why are people hyping these useless sites when these sh*t things they do are obvious. And yes some clueless or paid supporters will come trying to refute this claim. And I will ignore them like I ignore plagues.  And for people talking about my bad rep , it was given to me my Dean Nolan of the number one scamming site betking. I told people he was a scam and the site will run with their money and some Id..ots like the ones attacking me here attacked me saying he was credible and the site is credible. Most of them where paid to do so. Today beking ran with millions of dollars people invested. I don't care if I get 1million bad reps from paid casino puppets, I will keep saying my sht as it is. Stake and pd are overated and worst sites in crypto gambling as for ignorant people talking about my negative trust, this is the reason for it. i warned people about dean and the scam site betking and his puppets came for me just as stake puppets are coming for me nowhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4751127.0",

      "body": "I would like to leave my vouch about this here.This sites are cutting every benefit that you would have for gambling long time there. So, if you are fresh meat, maybe you can get some rewards, but when you gamble for more time here, they will treat you like shit.Don't fall for this \"scam\" aka their marketing strategies XD- Also, i agree with OP, seems to me like all high rollers are fake, accounts made by the house to take over all the high prizes.Do i have proof? Ofc not, they hide all the data about it. You cant check even one of this high roller profiles, due their own restrictions.Besides all that, its your own option to trust in them or not.",

Every win will be canceled (and a bit more).\"Sacrifice\" is not the right term in YOUR OPINION.I also agree with the argumentation that there is alot of people that can gamble huge ammounts, but i cant see a reasonable argumment on how they can do it for long time. But not entering in this merit, i have problems with their transparency. Its a bit strange how insane ammounts of wagger are made to just catch \"small prizes\". And i say that because that situations repeats everyday on this site. If a rich person starts to gamble this way, they will get poor in no time. And just to remember, rich people are a small portion of our society.I have no problems with gambling sites, if they have transparency. Otherwise, atleast in my opinion, its just a sophisticated scam system.Also, if they hold all the data, they should be not responsible to prove their legitimacy?",

How they will do it? Only god can tell. Otherwise they can just sonegate taxes all the way saying \"whales\" won big amounts in their site.And i dont agree with fucking taxes, its just a example of how a site like that would contribute negatively to society.Ofc all sites operate for profit, but enterprises have transparency, you can sue them if you want, and they will you show you proof. Stake will not.Even in a libertarian society this kind of act would not be supported, this would be repressed until transparency would take place (or not, its just supositions). Dont take my comment as salty, please, i'm just trying to build an argument. If we people accept this kind of acting, everything will be acceptable in the future.If you accept this kind of act, you can be the next one. Remember that.",
