Will this work at all or will fail over time? Drop your ðŸ’¡.",

These things can still be manipulated (and most likely will be) and after everything that happened lately you have to be crazy to trust CEX, no matter the evidence they show.The only way to be sure that your crypto (read bitcoin) is safe is if its in your own non-custodial wallet.",

Drop your ðŸ’¡. It's a great advertising in order to keep people's trust in CEXs, not much else.But really, it's not that difficult to do business by handing over private keys to this or that entity, do some crap and, although the CEX shows healthy proof of reserves, those could belong, by contract, to somebody else.Also, of course, by doing this they can make their addresses targets for hackers - and I don't mean the bitcoin network here.So yes, it can easily fail. Take all the public info with a grain of salt and trust no one but yourself.",

      "body": "Proof of reserve do not eliminate that exchanges do not make you to fully control your asset that you have with them (the exchange), it is not even your coins and tokens on blockchain, it belongs to the exchanges, on blockchain. So it does not eliminate the account freezing, and deposit and withdrawal maintenance. It does not eliminate many inconveniences that you can experience on centralized exchanges.Although, I think it can help people that are trading to rely better on those exchanges, but not fully rely on the exchanges.But never leave your coins on exchanges, if you do not trade again for sometime, or if you have coins you are not using to trade, transfer them all from the exchange to a noncustodial wallet. Rikafip is very correct, what you can absolutely rely on is noncustodial wallet (but multisig, cold storage or combined), just because it is trustless, it is your own, you can fully control it.",

I have not read so much about it but but I was thinking that exchanges uses it to proof indirectly or maybe directly that if they are hacked, they can still be able to recompensate those that are affected? Or is it just a means to only just show the total amount of money the exchange has? I thought it is the total amount an exchange has in cold wallet?",

Audit is done via 3rd party to ensure that what they are claiming is actually true. As I said in my previous post, that can be manipulated as well so it shouldn't be used as an argument for storing your crypto on an exchange that provided that.",

      "body": "Proof of Reserve, Proof of Liquidity, or whatever nonsense they end up inventing shouldn't change the fact that people are using exchanges in the wrong way. Their use case is self-explanatory, just look at the name - exchange. If you insist on using a CEX then deposit to it, perform your exchange, and withdraw your coins from it and into a well-known non-custodial wallet. It's that simple and yet people fail to do it.Â  These platforms that have started providing \"proof\" are vultures taking advantage of the current situation and looking to eat up as much as they can while the streets are still filled with meat and blood. They have seen a chance to increase their customer base with those left unsatisfied by other centralized platforms and now they are showing off.",
