      "body": "Pretty poor argument. Bitcoin isn't really making computers more efficient for one. The development of miners is somewhat separate as they're doing it for a particular purpose. General computers which run our money system, and most other industries are what you'd consider general computers, which don't need the processing power or the hardware that a miner or a gaming machine would need. So, the effect of Bitcoin on advancement of technology, at least when comparing general/personal computers is negligible. However, BlackHatCoiner's argument is a little more compelling. No one's done the Math, because the data would be hard to collect, but it takes common sense to see how much our current mainstream currency is using to stay afloat. Especially, now we're making the move to digital money, rather than predominately physical money. Although, even the latter has some pretty harmful effects to the environment in itself.",

But first Bitcoin uses ASICS not regular computers, so it doesnt directly make computers better. But it also doesnt hurt to have more production sites that could produce computer parts around, just in case.Second, Bitcoin also uses its fair share of energy. But the economic incentives surrounding it, actually help to produce more cleaner forms of energy. Saving on energy wont work in general on the big scale, we need an abundance of energy for it to be cheap for everyone.The better argument would be to say that Bitcoin helps us to tackle the issue of energy scarcity, by subsidising the creation of new energy sites and providing a buyer for renewable energy 24/7. During peak demand it can also provide energy to the grid(means cheaper electricity for everyone close).   But also dont forget that emotional people are immune to rational arguments, so good luck convincing anyone.",

Handling many transactions and consuming less energy is easy when you’re centralized and no real achievement, because they’re even more inefficient at this than our legacy finance system.And it’s nice to have nice stats about scalability on paper, but it doesn’t matter when no one actually uses ur token, because it’s whole purpose is to serve some weird VCs and not actual people.

So Bitcoin is actually extremely inefficient between how much energy it consumes and how much utility to the world it provides. Utility is more complex than transactions per day. The banking industry processes 0 decentralised, immutable, permissionless transactions a day, so in this regard they don’t provide any censorship resistance to the world, while bitcoin does. And this just one of many factors that play into utility. Bitcoin can’t do everything at the same time, without having any limitations or time to grow. These two are also complete opposites with completely different use cases. Bitcoin is way more efficient than anything else for the job it’s supposed to do.",

The non bitcoin world often portays it as if bitcoin uses energy for no reason, but the truth is there’s no other way than this currently. If we want decentralized infrastructure we have to use energy.I think we should also point out the differences in centralized vs decentralized architecture, so people actually understand why it does this and why some limitations are there.",

It definitely is inefficient, that way, but its properties are much broader than that. It's far more efficient to move thousands of dollars oversea now more than ever. It's far more efficient to open a channel with your co-workers, and pay them that way, instantly, with zero fees. The fact that the world ignores these advantages, doesn't make it unfavorable.
