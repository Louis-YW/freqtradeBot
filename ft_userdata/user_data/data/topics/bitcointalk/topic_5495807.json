I strongly believe that any kind of involvement of non-crypto businesses into crypto market is harmful for the common people. It can be banks, stock exchanges, corporates etc. The banking system is corrupt to the core. So even if they provide custodian services to the crypto users, there's no guarantee that the privacy will be protected. Governments can not be trusted when it comes crypto matters!",

What are your thoughts on this.To veto a document doesn't mean to approve it but to disapprove it. This news or document shows that Joe Biden will not approve the legislation if it is presented to him as an approved bill from Congress for assent. This means that the government is not supporting banks to engage in crypto custody service. Except there a good regulations to guide banks as they offer such services, I think it will be risky to put cryptocurrencies in the custody of banks. Banks have a history of misusing customer's funds and I am disturbed that crypto deposits might be mismanaged by these banks.",

Man, banks are probably rolling in their suits and having tantrums like a baby because it will definitely be hurting them no matter what happens and I'm sure that things are going to be really bad for them if they don't contest this veto even under the table. I'm on Joe's side now, I'd love to see banks fail in their attempt to get into the cryptocurrency market.",

      "body": "I think that, unfortunately, has nothing to do with Bitcoin or any real risks related to cryptos and has more to do with what falls under which authorities and regulations. The SEC regulates assets, and assets aren't something people normally have in their bank accounts. What they have is currencies, so maybe if banks store cryptos for people, it can be misinterpreted as if cryptos are now currencies in the US. That, in turn, can have big tax implications because fiat currencies aren't subject to taxation, as they're not considered assets.I'm not saying that it's fair to limit banks like that, but I think there's a certain rationale behind such decisions.",

Money poured into cryptocurrencies is not invested in the traditional stock market, leaving the government without its taxes and its share. They have long wanted to regulate this area, but did not know how to do it, but it seems that now governments are systematically approaching this solution.Quote from: Sim_card on May 08, 2024, 11:03:43 PMIt did not just stop at there, the government also want to have their own piece of cake, by having the intention that  banks should be permitted to be in custody of cryptocurrency. This function is already performed by exchangers, but outside their jurisdiction. Requiring banks to be in custody cryptocurrencies is similar to moving cryptocurrencies to government-controlled banks and displacing money exchangers as service providers. It’s curious, will cryptocurrencies as “out-of-bank money” ultimately end up in banks?Quote from: Sim_card on May 08, 2024, 11:03:43 PMIs this another way in which Biden is thinking the government can be in control over the crpto space.It will certainly be easier to control cryptocurrencies in your own banks than in foreign exchangers.",

It is against this backdrop that US will find it tough and oftentimes difficult to make some decisions as if related to the global audience.

You can have your spot ETF but when you exchange it you will have to sell it for USD and transact in USD. You can't get your bitcoin from the ETF and use that bitcoin to transact, that wouldn't be fair, right? Trump said that he supports cryptocurrencies and won't ban so we can see a clear line between these two candidates. One wants to slow bitcoin down and the other wants to get bitcoiner's votes by praising it. I wouldn't trust any of them, but I would rather vote for Trump in this situation",
