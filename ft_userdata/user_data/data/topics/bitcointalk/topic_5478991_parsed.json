  "content": "Yes, it's the first coin ever created, but it's slow and expensive (unless you're using the lightning network which most people and businesses don't).How come Ripple which is the cheapest and one of the fastest ones - failed investors since 2018 and never reached back to the all time high of $3ish and those who believed in Ripple got 0 yields and a slap in the face, and yet this slow & expensive currency is the holy grail everyone is talking about?",

      "body": "While it's true that Bitcoin is slower and more expensive to use than some other cryptocurrencies, it has a number of advantages that make it the most popular choice for many people. First, Bitcoin is by far the most widely used and accepted cryptocurrency. It's supported by the largest network of merchants and exchanges, which makes it easier to use in everyday transactions. Second, Bitcoin has the most secure and robust blockchain technology, which makes it highly resistant to attack. Third, Bitcoin has the largest and most active development community, which is constantly working to improve the technology. And finally, Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage,......most brand recognition and is the most widely known and understood cryptocurrency. While these factors might not be enough to make Bitcoin the best choice for every situation, they do make it the top choice for many people. The slow transaction times and high fees can be overcome with the use of \"off-chain\" solutions, such as the Lightning Network, which allows for much faster and cheaper transactions. And the developers are working hard to improve Bitcoin's scalability so that it can process more transactions per second. So, while there are some valid criticisms of Bitcoin, it's important to consider the full picture before making a judgment......",

      "body": "Bitcoin is decentralized, unlike ripple that is completely centralized. But the reason ripple did not got to all-time-high might be because of the SEC lawsuit which has later been won. But if it is not centralized, there would not be such lawsuit.Bitcoin has more utility. It is well known than ripple. Bitcoin is an asset that can be used for investment and that is the reason bitcoin investors do not think more about the fee. The fee will also later become reduced than it is now.",

There are other networks that process tx's faster, but these tx's remain reversible for a very long time. But in the BTC network, one confirmation is as good as irreversible, and since blocks are found ~ 10 minutes on average, 10 minutes may be enough to get you that confirmation. Not instant, but it is secure.BTC is what it is because of its use cases, and you cannot begin to compare it with shitcoins. If you don't see a reason why you should use BTC, you can use the coins you feel are better, that's why it is a free market.",

While Bitcoin is purely decentralized, no one can stop it.Though the problem is the high fees and I think the Lightning Network was a great solution, but the problem is its adoption is not widespread.However, it doesn't matter now which is why it gained mainstream attention and is often considered a store of value when it has a slow and expensive transaction fee.As we saw, there are thousands of altcoins trying to alternate the Bitcoin network problem, but only Bitcoin truly gives security and has a decentralized nature.",

Since it is a decentralized currency, investing in it has no risk like centralized coins, but the full control of it is in the hands of the investor. Since Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, there are no SEC cases against it like there are other centralized coins. Moreover, it is equally accepted in any country of the world and its universality prevails in different countries of the world as other centralized coins do not. Bitcoin can reduce inflation, Bitcoin transactions are so secure that the identity of the transaction is not possible to identify, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency with no government, bank control over it, so no single person, entity, organization has control over its price. Since the supply of Bitcoin is finite, its supply will never change, just as the supply of paper money can be constantly increased. Bitcoin is the world's number one digital currency due to its multiple advantages.",

While using XRP might be a bit more convenient overall, there are other, more insecure threats that users face. Up until now, I believe the pure coin with enough fairness is still BTC. Its network is strong, and network manipulation is challenging.Comparing BTC to other cryptocurrencies is like comparing a Dad to a little kid. The Dad seems like a legacy, but he has better experience and perfection compared to the new kid who may look fresh but poses risks to users in various aspects.I still agree, BTC remains the #1 cryptocurrency.",

To create a coin with cheap transaction fees and instant transaction speed is not too difficult and almost all new altcoins also have this feature. But to create a highly secure and decentralized coin, almost no other coin can do that except bitcoin. So you shouldn't be surprised that bitcoin is slow and has high transaction fees but is still people's top choice.",

It makes it impossible for anyone to dollar cost average, which is the point of DCAing and putting in small amounts over a period of time.",

Plus, with its limited stash and decentralized vibe, it's got that sense of scarcity tht makes everyone so eager to atleast have a bitcoin.
