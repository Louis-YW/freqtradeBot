It’s the truth. However, we’re here to help assist with the application because applying requires more than just saying statements. You have to be professional and cohesive in your application. Hence why we help and provide our services. It helps your application have a higher chance at succeeding.We will vet your project and collect some information from you to ensure that you are in the best possible position for a successful listing.We can even offer to fast track your application too. We cannot gurantee a 100% successful listing but our success ratio sure is very high. And You guys on CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko yet? Or looking for a listing? (Takes on average 1-3 days per listing)I do accept your coin as payment!* I also offer a legal agreement if service isn’t provided you can take legal action. *How it works:We have connection in CMC. They can't bypass the typical listing requirements, but the service we provide is an expedited application and resubmission to get in front of a listing manager instead of  waiting in the queue like all the other tokens. When tokens apply they get sent to the back of the queue and then they're at the mercy of the normal wait time. If you are missing information or if it's denied you won't know until you've waited all that time and then you start the process again..The quickest we've listed with this connect is about 2 hours, average being 2-3 days, of course there are some outliers (depending on the performance of the token; usual \"dead\" tokens wait longer)",

Please beware of spoofed emails, fake social accounts, or individuals requesting listing fees. Anyone asking you to pay a fee or tip for getting your project listed on CoinMarketCap is definitely not sanctioned to do so. We also do not sanction any listing service to assist in the listing application of any cryptoasset project or exchange. While we gladly accept donations, attempting to bribe us in the hopes of influencing the outcome of your request will not work. CoinMarketCap reserves the right to exercise its sole discretion to blacklist any project that pays for listings services or attempts to bribe CMC employees.https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043659351-Listings-CriteriaAnd You never mentioned escrowing and that escrowing should be done by a reputable escrow here in Bitcointalk and not anywhere else if you cannot offer this then your offer is fake and people should be careful about your service.",
