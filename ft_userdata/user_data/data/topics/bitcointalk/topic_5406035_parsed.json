The hacker utilized a reentrancy vulnerability, a known exploit in smart contracts using Solidity in the Omni Protocol,For an attack, the hacker used NFTs from a collection called Doodles, he deposited NFTs and took wrapped Ethereum as collateral, then utilized a malicious callback function to frontrun buying more Doodle NFTs before liquidating his loan position.Once the position was closed, the collateral was returned back to the attacker, so he had a remaining amount of borrowed money to buy even more NFTs, then the hacker used the newly acquired NFTs to borrow, even more, WETH, and could withdraw the loan before Omni's smart contract recognized the loan.The hack drained more than 1,300 ETH from the protocol, however, Omni said that none of the customer funds were affected, as the platform uses its fund in a test mode since it's still considered a beta.",

Thousands of ethereum have been stolen through the NFTs network and this is raising a lot of concern most especially among the investor, so newcomers can be warned.",

A lot has happened this year from Luna to cel and blok we have this same story. It is sad and I strongly believe that is why the market is strongly bearish this year. However, thank God customers funds are not affected.",

So, the one thing you should be aware is not the \"decentralized\" but the platform and security of smart-contract. Even you're carefully choosing the platform.You cannot test the security & smart-contract by your self, since we don't have any knowledge.",

I am wondering who will use this platform when it has been hacked during the beta test? Although they are saying none of the customer funds were affected but the customer will be afraid now. Behind most hack, someone from the inside is involved who knows better about codes. So they should investigate it deeply and increase security protocol.",

I think that these hacking attacks are done together with the team. Because I've been trading in the cryptocurrency market for years and when things are getting better, hacks like this never happen. But when projects start to lose money, such incidents come to light.",

But if it is true then good for them, but still if this hacks makes the newsroom, someone should have lost their ETH already.

Problem now in this time are those hackers were able to exploit such weak code and security. Its on the part of the platform why this happened. Maybe they are careless and dont put much attention on the security aspect of their own platform. Well newbies will become victim if they dont study first what they are going or investing through.",

Luckily no one got their money stolen except Omni which is they really need to tighten its security and hire some expert to block those hackers from infiltrating their system. This might just be some easy matters to them but for the investors, this is an indication that they don't deserve their trust they really need to fix their system first before they fully open their product to the investors.",

I will not believe if the users will still feel confidence to use the platform anymore. I meant if you must also aware that if 1,4 millions USD were a lot. So, what will be happening with this platform then? The team is the party who knows about the truth.
