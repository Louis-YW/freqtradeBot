Having many online wallet doesn’t prevent much of a thing moreover it could be on a same laptop or phone so when this device is compromised either through phishing, then almost all the wallets on will be compromised too. Also The more seed phrases you have the more you store them in less secure places since you might consider to store them in different locations. Just stick to one each of the wallets and avoid storing much funds on online wallets",

So these two I have. Thing is they are not wallet but devices to access wallet without exposing the private key. In that sense you can create as many wallets as you want. A HD wallet will generate unlimited number of addresses for you. So when you are talking about how many wallets, it does not make sense to me.But if you ask how many device in other words hardware wallet, then I have two. One as a backup in case the current one does not function like a damaged button, broken display.",

One advantage of having multiple online wallets is to protect privacy right? The average user doesn't have in mind that one wallet but multiple addresses are not proper protection of privacy if they cross spent UTXO consisting of several addresses within the wallet. I guess it depends on the user's needs or requirements. Still though when you install an Electrum client you can of course have multiple wallets. Perhaps the \"numerous online wallets\" as @OP termed it is a bit misleading here? With Electrum you can easily manage several wallets with countless addresses if you need to.",

I guess it depends on the user's needs or requirements. Even if that's the purpose, there is no need to have numerous wallets. A few number of wallets should be enough. There's a disadvantage too. In the case you have multiple wallets, you have to keep multiple keys and that's difficult if you want to keep each of the keys in a separate safe location. As OP is referring to private key and not a seed phrase, maybe, he/she doesn't know that it's possible to use a HD wallet and have numerous addresses all generated from a seed phrase.",

It seems that Luke didn't use hardware wallet nor a proper cold storage (ie completely offline).So a proper cold storage (if you know what you're doing) or a hardware wallet should do. Then you cannot really get hacked.You can make smaller transactions also with one wallet. Nowadays a (HD) wallet can have many addresses and you can use them wisely with the right wallet software.Of course, I also think that if somebody has really big money in bitcoin then multiple wallets (most probably hardware wallets) may not be a too bad idea.I think I've read in the news of a family that has a big number of wallets spread all over the world, exactly for this reason.However, that one cold storage - multiple online wallets (probably watch only?) - thing doesn't make sense to me, but I may be missing/misunderstanding something there.",

Electrum is a non-custodial wallet, wallets are either custodial or non-custodial, it is cryptocurrencies and services that are either centralized or decentralized. Electrum is not a 'cold storage' wallet, it depends on how you use it, if you use it on your phone for internet activities, then it is a hot wallet, but if you set it up offline using two devices then it is a cold storage because the device that carries your keys would forever be offline and be used for signing transactions, while the other device would be for watching only and broadcasting transactions.
