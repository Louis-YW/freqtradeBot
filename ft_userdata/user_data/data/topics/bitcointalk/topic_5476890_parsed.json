Everyone wants to drive big cars and live expensive lifestyle without looking for ways to acquiring that wealth legitimately. What amazes me most about this guys that are involved in cyber crime is that they spend a good quality of time trying to brainwash the victim into falling prey for them but will not be reasonable enough to know that if they had out in that same energy into quality business or skill, within some years to come, they will become extremely good at the chosen field.The government and parents also have obvious role to play in contributing or reducing the high rate of cyber criminals we have in a society. If a parent give the adequate training a child needs right from a tender age, he will grow to becoming a responsible adult or youth. Another issue is that most parents just throw their children off into the higher institution without meeting up with the financial demands that comes with it, as a student you can do much work that isn't done remotely and I situation where you find people around you doing it, it's very common that you will join them in the act.The 70% statistic is very accurate because while I was in school a hiluge number of my course mate where directly or indirectly involved in this cyber crime.",

When I actually saw this news I was really amazed that the government can really come out to spit such rubbish on the air. They really believe that any young made Nigerian is into yahoo or fraud that is really bad for them. If seen a lot of Nigerian youth who are into businesses making it big on a daily basics. They neither depend on the government nor fraud and these youths are able to take good care of their family giving them a good life. So why would they be so fats forward to conclude that all Nigerian students are into fraud. Over there in the university, students struggle to pay their fees, buy material and survive without the government empowering anyone. There are many opportunity that students engage themselves with. Yahoo isn't the only thing students are into. Im not saying students don't do it but majority of them are into content creation, coding, cryptocurrency and lot of others. Well I'm really ashamed of the Nigeria government. they should wise up and think of better ways to solve the problems in the country, rather than pointing fingers and accusing the youths for their failures. If they had provided jobs for the youths, maybe there won't be much of the fraud we hear of today.",

He is a bloody liar. How did he get to the conclusion? How did he carry out his research. I hate these people. Why didn't he say 7 out of 10 Nigerian politicians are thieves.

EFCC are the loudest when it comes to the youths but when it comes to the real thieves that are destroying the country, they have no power. The former minister of Aviation that rented an aircraft from Ethiopia to act as Nigeria Air after collecting huge sum of money is walking free. They have no power to arrest him.

And that is why in several occasions the EFCC is mistaking some people for fraud just because of the money they are getting but once you clean and they don't have anything against you then they will let you go and if the government can even encourage people then the attention of people will go to were they are making money at tech and others need to be encouraged.

For the EFCC chairman to have highlighted that 7 out of 10 Nigerian students are involved in cyber related crimes is a figure that should ordinarily hurt any well meaning young Nigerian. These are not small percentages and I don't think the numbers are looking at decreasing anytime.I can tell that the reason why many students are involved in this cyber crimes boils down to the economic crisis currently experienced by the country. Families are falling into economic issues everyday and only a few are coming out of poverty. Over 30% of our population is gone below the poverty line and the poverty rate has only been increaseing by the year. Last year, it was calculated at over 80-90 million people.Could it also be that the government is encouraging these young people by not encouraging them to learn digital skills as an alternative to the over bloated government jobs. In this regard, I will advise the government to concentrate more on the digital skills across the 36 states of Nigeria to bolster their productivity and reduce these crime rates. These skills should be infused in our educational curriculum from start.",

This is not something to be proud of because it means that 70% of Nigerian students are into cyber crime which I think it is not true entirely when deeper analysis is done about it. We know that the rate of cyber crime within Nigerians and especially student is increasing but I don’t think it has gotten to that level that he said already. We know this moment are hard times and the economy is not friendly to everyone. Settling for cyber fraud shouldn’t be the last resort for any Nigerian. How can this be averted in the country and what are the possible solutions to stop students from involving in such criminal activities.https://www.instagram.com/p/C0gaCP0s5MJ/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==Before the Man came out to make such statement publicly, they must have made adequate research. The rate at which Nigerian students not just students but the Youths are involved in cyber crime is really alarming. But it will be very good for him to brief the president about how bad the situation is in the country, so that drastic measures will be put in place to reduce this high trend in cyber crime in the country. It's not enough to make statistics and releasing figures. You have to do something to engage those youths in something meaningful that will make them stop the act of fraud. You can't tell someone to stop what is giving him/her food when there is nothing on ground for the person to keep surving on when he/she drops the act you frown at.",

Nigerian that is involve in cyber crime they learnt it from another country and that is why we don't need to blame them that much, what we are suppose to be saying right now is to know how we can advice our people to stop fraudulent act, but not by using efcc to arrest them and after everything the efcc officers will still encouraging to continue so that they can enriched themselves..the thing is that Nigerian youths is giving our country bad name which not supposed, and every one outside the country may be thinking that we maybe all Nigerian youths are scam",

      "body": "In the case of Nigerians youths who gets involved with cyber crimes the 70% per cent analysis by the EFCC is quiet correct because from my knowledge about this case efcc has over 50 professors who are analysts and economists that knows how to make good assumptions. when they say 70% they are absolutely correct. I'm not always interested in news about the rate of cyber crime in this country because they left them no option when the youth role models a fraudster what do you expect his follows to do. infact the country as a whole is into fraud but in diverse ways. just because yours isn't casted doesn't mean you are not included. politicians are even involved with this cyber crime, for those of you who live in port Harcourt I know a politician who has a HK around egbelu axis so this cyber crime is so broad that I don't blame the youths but they too are accountable for there actions.",
