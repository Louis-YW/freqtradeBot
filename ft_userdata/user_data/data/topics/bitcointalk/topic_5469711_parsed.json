It is said that everyone has a secret they’re keeping from someone, just pray it doesn’t break you when you hear it. I am not supporting those pranksters for what they do to relationships, but it is better couples don’t take part in it since they won’t stop the prank as long as it is not regulated yet, and I don’t think they force people to take part in such prank activity with them.Quote from: Hewlet on October 09, 2023, 06:44:08 AMEntertainment is not bad, as a matter of fact I enjoy watching them alot but when you ridicule or take advantage of the ignorance of others just to create your content, it becomes a problem.I don’t know much about the entertainment industry but I think most of this stuffs are not under any regulations, so those pranksters have no limit to the type of content they create as long as it will give them money. The only time I see this comedians or pranksters been arrested are when they imitate some government officials and showcase the negative part of their work and share it to the public which is not a good illustration of what such government officials depicts, that is when they are been cautioned, warn or arrested.",
