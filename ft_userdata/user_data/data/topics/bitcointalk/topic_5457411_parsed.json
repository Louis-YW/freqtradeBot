  "content": "I'm looking to get your insights on the evolution of the Lightning Network over the past couple of years. As someone who hasn't used it in a while, I'm curious to know how it has matured and evolved during this time.Back when I last used it, the Lightning Network was still in its early stages, with a lot of potential but also many challenges to overcome. I remember there were concerns about liquidity, routing, and the overall user experience. I could poke stuff and break it, but I wouldn't understand why it broke in the first place. So, for those of you who have been actively using or following the Lightning Network, I'd love to hear your thoughts. How has the network evolved? Have there been significant improvements in terms of scalability, speed, and fees? How about the user experience - has it become more user-friendly?Also, I'm interested in any new applications or use cases that have emerged as a result of these developments. Are there any standout projects or initiatives that you think are worth highlighting?I'm looking for a new project to participate in or conjure up something new all around and want to go back into LNAre we still on #reckless or has that image faded?",

But unfortunately they are discontinuing the Lightning Network and BlueWallet in the future will only support its own custody solution. Are you not switching to Electrum Wallet's LN network? Electrum is also my Wallet of Choice at the moment. In regards to exchanges that support Lightning Network, this list might help.

That's because Phoenix Wallet will ask for a lot of fees when it sees payments to regular Bitcoin Network addresses.Have you not tried other LN Wallets such as Eclair Mobile with a development that is finalized Eclair is also built by the same developer as Phoenix which is the first Bitcoin Lightning Network Mobile Wallet launched on the market. There are still several other wallets that are non-custodial such as Breez, ZAP etc.",

But in their blog, BlueWallet suggested to use PhoenixWallet for LN transactions as a replacement. So perhaps try that.Personally, I have the app downloaded but I don't have the time to use it yet. 90% of my Lightning usage is making a deposit to BetPlay.io to play Craps. No time for losing my precious coins now, the price is going up. Hahaha.",
