  "content": "Hello,Bitskins.com that is a very known CSGO skins marketplace just updated their platform this month. They increased the affiliate revenue on this version, but when they migrated the existent accounts they can't migrate the affiliates.I had over 22.000 affiliates, that gave me over $30.000 since 2016... and on last months I was getting around $400 from it (monthly).With the new affiliate revenue I would get 4x this amount.They state they simply can't migrate the old affiliate information. Is there anything else I can do to fight for it?Thanks",

It sounds like it's not the first time I've read something similar on the forum and it seems to me that there's little you can do. It's a shame, I can imagine how you must feel, because it's a lot of money you could be receiving now, and passively.",

      "body": "Thanks guys!This is their answer:QuoteUnfortunately it’s not possible to get back old affiliates, The affiliate program has been reset for all users in other words the terms are same for all users and we can’t make any exceptions. Feel free to share your new link if you wish to do so. Kind regards,The BitSkins TeamI got over 22.000 affiliates because I was owner of a popular csgo \"twin\" site in the beginning of it (back if 2015) and it was promoted through my site/referral.I contacted them in discord aswell, I still got nothing. I tried to get a compensation or an explanations about why was it discontinued, and I was denied again.When they announced bitskins 2.0 they didnt even stated that the old affiliates wouldn't be migrated (they omitted it): https://blog.bitskins.com/bitskins-2-0-is-finally-here/It is very strange because they say this on Discord:\"More than half of affi users were broken, didn't give any cut to person who invited them.\" (https://i.imgur.com/5J7Arq6.png)I asked to review my past incomes, they found nothing wrong.Also I tried to explain I'm probably the user with most affiliates and they told me this:\"You weren’t even top 100 on bitskins \" (https://i.imgur.com/U6PdLGR.png)I don't believe it. It were needed over 2.200.000 users registered under 100 other affiliate accounts... I don't believe it. And on Discord there is no one complaining about it but me...",

From the biggest players (Amazon) to stores with 3 users.You really have 2 options.1) Deal with it and see how much you can rebuild.

In which case I'm sure somewhere buried in the T&C it gives them the right to perma ban you.Sorry could not give you better advice, but I have seen this before with a lot of people & businesses I deal with and the affiliate looses 99% of the time.-Dave",

As you said, their house, their rules and building from scratch is the only choice.The only thing that comes to mind as a counter answer is that this time they are promoting some of the competing services more, and leaving Bitskins on the sidelines. From their side, I wouldn't really ignore the wishes of someone who brought 22k new users to the platform.Maybe the departure of a loyal promoter will force them to try to find a satisfactory solution.",

They control the terms just be thankful that it gave you $30k already.Since you have your website and you are good at recruiting you can accumulate more referrals the key to affiliate marketing is diversification so the money keeps coming in.",

Sadly, you cannot do something about it when their decision is final. Since you replied that you tried contacting them but to no avail, I hope that you find the time to rebuild those affiliates and maybe even suggest to them some scheme to rebuild the broken affiliates. Maybe if the current accounts have a way to know that it came from the referral of your site and not just a random registrant, it can be fixed or something.",

You can start building everything from scratch, but there is not guarantee that nothing similar won't happen again in future.

I expect current ToS you quoted added about when they reset their affiliate system. Changing ToS without notice isn't allowed on certain country[2]. But, i except the chance OP to win on court remain low.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20160426122033/https://bitskins.com/tos[2] https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2007/07/court-says-no-to-changing-terms-of-service-without-notification/The same archived version of ToS says something about amendment of agreements, which might give them a counterargumentQuoteAmendmentsBitSkins may amend this Agreement or any section of this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time. Each such amendment (i) will be communicated to you at least 30 days before its coming into force; (ii) set out the new section only, or an amended section along with the section as it read formerly; (iii) set out the date the amendment comes into force; and (iv) if the amendment entails an increase in your obligations or a reduction in BitSkins’ obligations, give you the right to refuse any amendment and terminate this Agreement without cost, penalty or cancellation indemnity by sending BitSkins a notice to that effect no later than 30 days after the amendment comes into force. In order to send such a notice, click on the “I Do Not Agree” when the amendment is communicated to you. Refusing an amendment entails the termination of this Agreement, the automatic deactivation of your account and denial of access to the Service.The question is if OP or all the users have been receiving notifications 30 days before the said amendments are done like I have seen with other big services. If they did and OP just clicked on \"Agree\" then that's unfortunate for him. He may just have to let it go.",

I do not see any other thing that happened but they systematically migrated in order to achieve this. They must have benefited from the number of referrals you have given them over the years and they feel that they have paid enough for your efforts and decide to start a new system. I don't think you have anything much to do. It is either you forget about the company and move on or you start a new referral business in the new site, in few years time they'll also do same.",
