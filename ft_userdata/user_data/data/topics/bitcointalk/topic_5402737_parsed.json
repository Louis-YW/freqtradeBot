I understand this is the next shitcoin where you are trying to spread and fantasize about profits. Right from the name Digigame, I envisioned a plagiarized product that copied the idea and arrived late with a tendency to exaggerate. So keep that opportunity to yourself, or you can erase it from your mind with a deceptive thought about the messaging in this market.",

Why would you do that when you can get paid to launch on Candle Chain and receive a token grant? And if you're launching a DApp, Fantom for example also gives FTM tokens to high TVL projects on their chain. If you are creating a project, you should do it on a chain that wants you there and appreciates you.",

First, I will check your project properly and do some re-searching if the text used are plagiarized and if the image used are stolen from the internet. Next would be studying the potential of the project if it's worthy to invest on it or not.Quote from: Vijjuxtra on July 12, 2022, 08:56:48 AM if we were was to make scam we would never had showed our intentions, we had did it earlier,we would have got lots of investors earlier,Oh so this was not the first project you created? That's nice but that wasn't enough for someone to fully trust you. You know there are so many trusted people or companies that run for years before they show their true intentions. That is one of their tactics, to gather as much as confidence from the public so that they can scam bigger amounts.",

Sorry but its truth I dont how do you digest it..ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”Don't have to twist words into a profitable victim position and try to make me look like some kind of scoundrel. I didn't say you were scammers. I said the project is a potential scam. This means that you have not cheated anyone, but the project has all the prerequisites to go bust and leave its investors with a loss. By the way, the projects do not always fail because of deception of developers and owners. It can also occur due to natural reasons, such as poor and ill-conceived tokenomics, very bad marketing, unoriginality of the product offered and other conditions.I came into altcoin world not yesterday and I have reasons to think like that, not just randomly take information and throw it in anyone. Why do I consider this project a potential scam? Because there are no resources to tell about the project concept, white paper, roadmap, there are no venture capitalists, there is no support from various crypto communities. Do you really think that one smart contract address and a telegram group is enough to get people to start investing in you and see your project as a serious player in the crypto world?If you think that I am prejudicially calling you a potential scam, you can contradict me and provide as an argument at least 3 projects that started their crypto journey just like you did (just smart contract address and telegram group) and succeeded, their token grew in value, they attracted investors, conducted a successful investment round and got listed on some exchange. Do you have any such examples?",
