They could really completely be able to apply it or done such thing considering that banks are really that abiding governments laws and regulations on which every spend or outgoing transactions made out by a  specific card holder could really be traced out on where they had been able to make use of their cards.So if they do included crypto thencrypto purchases would really be definitely be imposing such questions on where those funds would really be that be used which means that crypto purchases might be at risks on being banned too.Totally not shocking if we do speak about huge spending when it comes to gambling. It did really just turn out that Austrialian government attention had been poked up because numbersdid really reach out of control.",

Maybe, I can agree with the banning of credit cards in online gambling because of huge losses.And it is also to safeguard these gamblers, to incur more debts from these credit card companies. However, from the actual news that the OP posted, they will even ban the use of digital currencies, which for me, should not be the case.Because if you have your crypto, it means, it is not a debt from those companies, but your money already.This is not good for crypto users in their country. But in any case, they can spend their crypto in other things, not only in gambling.",

For me, the legislation towards this ban is really reasonable as this is the only way so that the Australian government can protect its people not to harm themselves in online gambling, as well as the families of the online gambling gamblers.",

It is really just that wise on cutting off the source of problem on which if they do see that billions had been lost because of it then it would be just that common sense that they would really be banning or prohibiting it on at least it would really be easing out that kind of problem or totally cuts it.It is really nice to see that some governments in the world do really tend to protect out their citizens on such harm because most of the time where government doesnt really boggle up themselves and would really be giving out priority on things which they could really be able to benefit out.",

Credit card is simply credit. You do not have the money. Credit card has encouraged a lot of financial recklessness not just in gambling but in compulsive and impulsive buying and expenses. In regards to gambling it is a good development. It would curb betting on a game with money you do not have. In essence what the Australian government is trying to do is to save the gambler from himself.

The reason they give is that Australia loses 25 billion dollars only in gambling in a year. That is a big amount indeed.The reason why they ban it is interesting.  I think Australian government is smart enough to know what the gambling is. $25bn is surely a big amount, but it is people's money, not the money of the government. As long as the people are okay with the losses, I think Australian government doesn't need to ban it immediately. People spend money on gambling isn't only for gaining money, some people do it for entertainment. Spending money for entertainment, I think it is not a problem. Moreover, we know that gambling isn't a place for expecting income. If Australian government expects for profits through gambling, it means they don't understand what gambling is.Quote from: noormcs5 on September 13, 2023, 05:13:17 PMIs this bill means that Australia is going to ban online gambling because if people can't use a credit card or crypto, how will they do online gambling?If they ban credit card for gambling, it will impact on online gambling, too.
