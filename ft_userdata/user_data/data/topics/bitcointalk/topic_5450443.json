If anyone has been curious about selling coins in future auctions or if you are just curious to meet them and hear how they think about the future of physical bitcoins, feel free to reach out and plan a way to meet up. James can be reached at jmccartney@stacksbowers.com.I'm not shilling anything here. I just follow them a lot since I think public auction action is a good way to gauge the real potential of these collectibles being mainstream. I think the Stacks Bowers auctions in tandem with PCGS leaning into grading physical bitcoins are positive. Steeley",

      "body": "Steeley...thanks for sharing this. I only wish I can attend the event...perhaps someday when BTC will moon then I can do it     Stacks is only a few blocks from where I live so I have met James in person a few times and have to say he is good people and very approachable to talk to with regards to our hobby of loaded coins.   He loved my coins especially the timelock smart contract coins as they were all novel to him. The only request they as is they grade and encapsulate all coins ...unfortunately mine were not graded thru PCGS who as far as I know are the only ones to offer jumbo capsules.   Perhaps someday when a grading company can grade my coins I can hand him mine in person and see what the market says about em.",

I'm definitely going to be stopping by their booth. They're getting a booth right? These collectibles are currently behind these industry drivers! They're absolutely crushing sales and generating new demand and market growth in this space, more so than anyone currently focusing on this niche market, IMO.",

The Stella was only given to members of congress and there are less than 500 ever made. The 1907 St. Gaudens is an amazing piece and the last time that same coin was auctioned it fetched 37k  Here was a snip from the link: \"Stack’s Bowers Galleries has emerged as the leader in physical cryptocurrency auctions; since their first offering in November 2021 the firm has sold nearly $3 million in this category. At the 2023 Conference in Miami, Stack’s Bowers Galleries looks forward to engaging with Bitcoin enthusiasts about the firm’s physical crypto auctions and introducing this community to more traditional numismatics, including rare coins and paper money.Representing Stack’s Bowers Galleries in Miami will be James McCartney, Director of Consignments and Physical Cryptocurrency, and Wayne Berkley, Vice President of Client Services. Conference attendees will be able preview auction highlights at the firm’s kiosk and register to bid in upcoming auctions, including their June 2023 Showcase Auction. The June sale will be highlighted by important Bitcoin rarities including a silver 2013 Casascius “Gold Rim” 1 Bitcoin and a silver 2013 Lealana “Gold B” 1 Bitcoin, both graded Proof-69 Deep Cameo by PCGS. The June auction also features significant rarities among traditional numismatics including a legendary 1879 Four-Dollar Gold Stella graded Proof-61 by PCGS and a captivating (1907) Saint-Gaudens High Relief Double Eagle graded MS-65 by PCGS.Stack’s Bowers Galleries will be accepting pre-approved auction consignments at the conference, including collections of physical cryptocurrency and traditional rare coins.
