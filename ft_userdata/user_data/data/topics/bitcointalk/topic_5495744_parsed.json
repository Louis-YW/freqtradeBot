Storing it in anything other than mnemonics is a hassle and highly unnecessary if you're concerned about compatibility; you'll be able to recover them easily even if they are not supported by Electrum in the future.Electrum maintains compatibility with even their pre-Electrum 2.0 seeds. I doubt that Electrum would drop the support any time in the future since it doesn't hinder the development, just a nice to have. Tldr; Electrum or BIP39 seeds are both okay.",

I wouldn't trust them after this accident and if you are aiming for hardware wallet, you better buy Coldcard or Passport.BIP39 and BIP39 wordlist will be supported by Electrum, at least in the next few years. I think it will be supported for almost forever because there is simply no reason to not use it, it's secure as hell and writing down some words is better than writing down 010101.If you are still afraid of BIP 39, you can use a vanity address generator and generate a bitcoin address where you'll get address (custom if you wish) and private key that you can later import in any wallet.P.S. My advice would be to not worry over something that you don't have to worry. Anyway, if something changes, you can always use an old version of software, create a new wallet in new software and send Bitcoins from old to new address.",

      "body": "The choice between the two seed formats will depend on your needs, all 2 options are safe and great, but I will mention some points from each mnemonic to help you with your choice:1 - Electrum seeds don't have checksum as BIP39, instead, it's carrying a version number, this version number will determine whether the wallet is old (legacy) or segwit.2 - Electrum seeds don't support nested-segwit addresses (p2sh-segwit starting with 3), however this type of address is falling into disuse, due to the bech32 standard already being well matured in terms of adoption. So this won't be a problem for you (I believe).3 - Electrum seeds only have 12 words, while in BIP39 you can choose between 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 words (I think even more).4 - Both electrum and BIP39 seeds provide support for passphrase, a function that derives hidden wallets based on your passphrase, this additional password becomes an extension of your seed. It's therefore crucial not to lose both items, otherwise you will lose access to your funds.5 - Electrum seeds don't support BIP-85.6 - Electrum seeds are recreated and recognized only on Electrum and Bluewallet, I won't go into depth because others have already answered this.My opinion: I use both standards, the electrum standard is criticized because it has not been adopted by the industry like BIP39, so people can't import an electrum wallet into other apps, but this exposes your seed to risk, electrum is a wallet for desktop, this is the company's proposal (although it has a mobile app, but I haven't used it in years).BIP39 mnemonic is accepted by all HW and wallets in general, so if you want to use your seed in other wallets (remembering that the more you restore in other wallets, the more your seed will be exposed), I like BIP-39 more because you can create accounts, this way you can use a wallet for each occasion, all protected by the same seed, whereas if it were on Electrum, you must create another wallet (seed) for each occasion.",

I have been using Bitget for a long time now and keeping my funds there cause I see they have the transparency and proper security arrangements to safeguard user's assets. They review their wallet from time to time and the valuation of their Reserve Fund in addition to the User Protection Fund which is another layer.",
