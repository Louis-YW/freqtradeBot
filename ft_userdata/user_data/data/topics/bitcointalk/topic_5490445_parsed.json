Dormant bitcoins after 14 years, are still your bitcoins.Banks will likely freeze your bank accounts after 14 years of dormancy.

We should all hope that someday our stacks look just as amazing to the next generation of newcomers to the coin. It's true that we don't need to worry about who owns those Bitcoin addresses, afterall we're not getting any share of the money, but you can't help but atleast envy the person that cashed out all that wealth, especially knowing that you probably had that kind of money then but didn't buy Bitcoin with it. Perhaps in the next 20 years people will look back at this day and wonder why they didn't buy Bitcoin, who knows, maybe 1 BTC price could be say 1m, so the lesson to learn from this is to keep hodling till one or two decades before selling. I don't mind hearing any news that talks about Satoshi Nakamoto, he deserves to be discussed about now and then, so he/she/them don't erase from our memories, and if those addresses belongs to Satoshi, then it's all good.",

Oh yes that should just be the positive energy towards this attractions that we should Invest to also outshine with our common holdings of today and in the future of next generation our steady holding and bitcoin accumulations can also be attractive hopefully at a great value as that.Let it not be a burden of depression instead lets contrast with the potential connective of energies that made that great holding in such a mighty success. There could be many more even worth that what the Op has just revealed to us just as he has also said of being many more.

I guess many people can see what is happening in the market right now, which are some of the things we need to be worry about at this moment and how to be part of the benefits that attached to the bull run and, if you have nothing hodling in this season, I will advise you to prepare ahead of the upcoming bear season so that you will have BTC to hold.I don't think anything will make Satoshi to expose his or her identity than to continue make his or her identity secret to the people which are part of some of the things that is giving bitcoiners joy to continue spreading the goodnews about BTC.",
