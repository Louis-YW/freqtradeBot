  "content": "This probably could be the most funny story i  would be sharing here on Bitcoin talk. so yesterday I came across an old friend who used to be a member of this forum. he was actually here before ( last I remembered). it then came to my mind to ask him how he is managing to grow his account here on Bitcoin talk or if he already ranked up to a full member. I was shocked by his reply,  he said that here on Bitcointalk that there are two sets of people as the name implies, some people are here to continually do the talking, while some others are here earning Bitcoin. he said that he gave up on his account when he noticed that after spending several months trying to create good post he only got just 10 merits and this discouraged him and made him stop using Bitcointalk. as he said this I laughed out my ass. I didn't know what to tell him at that point, but then I showed him my profile. he was surprised and asked me how I managed to earn that much merit in few months.again I smiled and told him that it wasn't just the merit that drove me, but my ambition to learn and earn from Bitcoin talk. before we departed, he  told me that he was going to login into his old account and see if he can earn some merits. so I'm just sharing this story here, as an advice for the newbies and every one here on Bitcoitalk who finds it difficult to attain merits and rankup. going through the forum sometimes I find so many account that haven't been registered for a very long time these accounts are very good in creating post and earning merits. I try to learn from them and understand how they are doing this. one thing I learnt, was that true according to my friend earning merit is somehow difficult, but if you put all your focus on earning merits, you surely are not going to earn some. all you have to do is to take your time and be creative, learn new things that fits into the Bitcoin ecosystem, be an active member..we all want to earn some little money from Bitcointalk, but if you are not  patient enough, you will According to my friend continue to do the talking, why others earn the Bitcoin from there membership. just remember that every earner, was once a talker and a learner but some talkers never get to become earners because they never learnt anything. I know that for now I'm still in the talkers section, but some day I will definitely earn from Bitcointalk and also share my success story. so which are you, the Talker or the Earner.",

The great thing is that you take a different approach and you will definitely get what you want.Concerning a role at a bitcointalk.

      "body": "To me, I believe there is some level of fairness in this merit system; if you put your effort into making a good post, you will earn some merits. If your friend had worked hard enough, as he has said regarding his post quality, he could have earned more merit for himself. I don't know how the system worked back then when he was active here, and I don't know how long that might have been. But all I could say is that there might have been more to his absence than just merit. If I am to use myself as an example, from the beginning I thought making good posts required some kind of magic power or something, but the more I spend my time in real life, the more I realize that what I taught was actually not the case. My first merit award motivated me to put more effort into learning more things around the forum, and in doing so, I also shared my own side of the idea, which earned me confidence and merit as a reward for my efforts. I added more of my time here when I realized how beneficial the forum could be to me. That's when I ranked up to a member rank, and back then there were few campaigns that were still accepting member ranks on their signature pay roll. Those earnings gave me more inspiration to keep on pushing, telling me that it's not all a waste of time to be here after all; it's not just learning but learning and at the same time earning. In everything we do in life, consistency matters a lot. Your friend, whom I might consider a quieter, did not get the result he was expecting from the beginning, but that does not mean it will all be the same in the coming days. He should have realized how everything works by himself earlier before he could have even engaged in that conversation with you. Quote from: Turn it off on June 28, 2023, 03:41:44 PM@Justtoons that has been inactive just gave you merit few minutes after your post creation, coincidence or your alt? Or are you trying to initiate some kind of some spray here? Sound like what someone that's crazy as a loon would say, right?An inactive account? You could call the account the OP's alt, but meriting a post is not enough evidence to say an account is someone else's Alt. That account doesn't look active to me, looking at the post history and merit earned, and it's been working for the past few days.",

Which, might have discouraged, who knows how many friends like your one to leave this forum. But one thing i have learned in my stay on BTT is that you always get appreciation and positive feedback. Because if you make some post and one person finds out some mistake and gives you a sweet lesson (which of course does not act as a sweet one for OP), there must be another person too who will agree with your POV (point of view). Take an example of this post. Turn it off is a newbie member of BTT, and his reply might seem to you as the one from the bad or unappreciated category. But on the other hand, Maus0728 is the most ranked member of this platform and he/she appreciated your efforts and also shared his opinions too. i hope you understood my point here. We should always try to learn something even by listening or talking or by earning or in the need of getting merits too. we should learn and do work.",

Then talking of merits I was actually posting and but was that focused in my local board where I got some people who keeps motivating me and asking me to put more efforts and, what ever thing I found too difficult to understand I asked at the local board they would explained more better to me than outside my locals since I never wanted to violate any of the rules, it was from local I grew a bit.

You might spend all the time preparing a post with assurance that it will be merited, but end up not receiving any. One of the reasons for this is the recycling of topics. Most members don't use the search option to check if a particular topic has been discussed. So they spend time writing on an over-researched area and end up getting nothing. If your post is innovative, creative, and solves problems, merit will be given.

If you are not willing to learn in this forum, you will not earn. To earn you must build your account and to build an account you must get merit.
