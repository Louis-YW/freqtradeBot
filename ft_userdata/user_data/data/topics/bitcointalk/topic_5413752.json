  "content": "I'm reee-ing this thread as it was opened and closed before I even saw it... and I do have a lot of responses to comments in it.Personal plea: I'd appreciate it if respondents didn't just rehash knee-jerk opinions on NFTs for the sake of cranking out a post to fulfill their weekly quota, thanks.Obviously OP realized pretty quickly his particular vision of the idea wasn't gonna fly with the community, so no need to belabor that point.Quote from: Coin_trader on September 15, 2022, 03:52:53 PMThis idea will only be possible if theymos or other forum staff will give this a go signal to make this an official forum NFT. I agree this should be the case when it comes to high-profile members, like satoshi and Hal... it wouldn't be right for just anybody to make them and sell them... or sell anybody's w/o the consent of the user themselves... would be interpreted as a cash grab.Quote from: Coin_trader on September 15, 2022, 03:52:53 PMI don’t know if this is possible but it will be good if we can make our avatar directly using NFT like what twitter planning to do.Funny you should mention it -- this is actually what I did, but in reverse: your avatar IS the NFT. The image attached to the token changes when you change your avatar.Quote from: Mbitr on September 15, 2022, 04:00:23 PMThey are actually already being done - check out this thread by nutildah  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5411112.0Thanks for bringing it up. And I'd just like to point out that this is all accomplished entirely on the Bitcoin blockchain. I thought it was cool because its sort of an identity token that represents who you are on the forum and the blockchain. Alternatively, you have the option of minting multiple copies so you can trade them with others (this can be done in a trustless fashion using the Counterparty DEX). It would be a fun way to collect Bitcoin-backed trading cards of other forum users. For the entrepreneurial, you could even wrap them and sell them on OpenSea, or any of the other NFT markets.I was thrilled to have a wisened OG like philipma1957 volunteer to go first... There are 4 other members who expressed interest that I'm current waiting to hear back from.Quote from: OgNasty on September 15, 2022, 08:12:34 PMNFTs today remind me so much of Bitcoin in 2011.  It's so obvious they're the future, but everyone is so dismissive.  It's like people think that this is some sort of 0 sum game and other people's success will take away from theirs.  When the grownups get around to dabbling in NFTs things will change.Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin being the first and most prominent) is the digital representation of money. NFTs are simply the digital representation of everything else. If you believe that society is headed into an era of digital expansion, where the idea of the metaverse becomes more prominent and maybe even a central focus point, you should root for blockchain-backed digital ownership to play an important role in this new paradigm.If you don't believe in any of this, then I have to ask, why do you believe in Bitcoin?",

Namecoin names are, in essence, non-fungible tokens that provide a censorship-resistant method for website access. Because the Tor network and I2P achieve the same effect in a more robust manner, they never really caught on, but they could still serve a role in the future some day.Other good, non-image uses involve NFTs that grants their holders rights, permissions, or special access. For example, there have been bots made for ETH, BTC and even DOGE NFTs that allow token-gated access to Discord channels, meaning you must own the token in your wallet in order to join the channel. Property rights have been conveyed via NFT, rights to music & video IP, and all sorts of media. Its quite possible that NFTs will be used to convey ownership of smart property, e.g. an apartment or car door that unlocks after proof of corresponding token ownership has been established. The most promising upcoming use case for NFTs in the future are related to identity.Quote from: NeuroticFish on September 16, 2022, 08:51:48 AMQuote from: nutildah on September 16, 2022, 08:41:35 AMHere you've stated an opinion backed with zero reasoning behind it, not much I can do with it.You didn't manage to convince me that my reasoning is incorrect.You didn't provide any reasoning with which to do so... you just made a statement, \"I think this is a big step in the wrong direction,\" but you didn't say why.",

This is about the original topic and it's something I've also said in the other post.One problem with the idea of using NFT for bitcointalk could be that it would look like bitcointalk is endorsing NFT technology.

I just think there's been opinions which have been sort of standardised, if that makes any sense. It's become socially acceptable in a sense to absolutely dog on any sort of altcoin, including NFT's whenever possible. I've gotten that impression for a while, and while I don't necessarily blame people for having that opinion, I'm pretty sure it's become just a saying, without the user actually finding it out for themselves. I think the right term would be herd mentality, and following social norms, which this forum definitely does have, as does literally every place you look. I've followed social norms, as well as you, and others. There's nothing wrong with this, but it does frustrate those that aren't following them at that time. The thing is, we need pioneers in this world to generate any sort of new technology or success.  Of course, the altcoin scene is pretty wild, and there's a lot of crap out there which is why I do understand why it has the reputation that it does. However, that doesn't mean everything is crap. There's a few examples which I'm sure a few people could give that are actually fairly exciting. For example, I'm quite interested in the mimble wimble technology which I actually think could potentially be a good implementation. Grin obviously stirred up a storm when it was announced, partly due to theymos announcing grin was accepted for certain things on the forum, but some of that was also genuine interest. So, while NFTs are definitely the fad right now, some users don't realise they've actually technically been part of our lives for some years now, they just haven't been labelled or introduced to them like NFTs. I do think a lot of NFT implementations are crap, but that's the same as crap implementations of altcoins. There is, and will always be interesting ideas which are being tested, which Bitcoin doesn't have.

Although, everything that's been successful will have people jumping on the bandwagon, and trying to make their own version in an attempt to make a lot of money. I think there's a saying \"failure of your own success\". Technically, Bitcoin has been copied a million times by now, and while a lot of users will roll their eyes at a new up, and coming altcoin it's because they're attempting to create the success of Bitcoin, in their own way. Obviously, most are copies or just badly implemented, but there are the exceptions.",

Can you tell more about the \"decentralized database\" the (this specific) image from your NFT is stored in?Arweave is IMO the best decentralized file storage solution currently available. There is a long history of failed attempts, going all the way back to Maidsafe which technically started before Bitcoin and still isn't finished. Also included are Storj, under construction since 2014, and Filecoin, which relies on IPFS. The idea behind Arweave originally was to be a permanent backup solution for website archives, kind of like the Wayback Machine, but decentralized, in that anyone can be part of the network by contributing storage space. They are then rewarded with AR token, which is required by uploaders to upload website data, or any file.

People \"buy\" tokens as speculators because they are trying to make a profit like gamblers making a bet (something that can be done using literary anything else).Even one of the first replies your own topic in Digital goods receives was how can that token be \"traded\"!P.S.

Stories of scams and ludicrous returns tend to dominate any sort of news coverage and resulting conversation because they stick in the craw of the human psyche.However, that doesn't mean we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. A lot of innovation is quietly taking place in this space on daily basis, led by projects trying to distinguish themselves from the noise by providing something unique that hasn't been done before, whether it is in terms of aesthetics, community or utility.No need to lie about it: a lot of NFTs worth $$ now are gonna go to zero. They won't be able to retain the social momentum required to keep new buyers interested as the market expands and attention gets diverted to an ever-expanding array of new projects.However, that's not what my Forum NFTs are trying to do... They are meant to be uniquely-crafted, personalizing mementos that you can use to either identify your forum profile on the blockchain or trade with others and collect.Quote from: Royse777 on September 17, 2022, 08:42:27 AMA friend of mine made good money from NFT, still he is making. According to him they list on secondary market, they buy it then again they buy it. It's actually moving it from one address to another address. This way they create a demand for the specific NFT before someone else buy it from them. Yeah that's called \"wash trading\"   its a common practice... an underhanded one but pretty easy to identify if you can read a block explorer. Nearly every crypto ever to be listed has done this with exchange bots for years.",

For example, there have been bots made for ETH, BTC and even DOGE NFTs that allow token-gated access to Discord channels, meaning you must own the token in your wallet in order to join the channel. Property rights have been conveyed via NFT, rights to music & video IP, and all sorts of media. Its quite possible that NFTs will be used to convey ownership of smart property, e.g. an apartment or car door that unlocks after proof of corresponding token ownership has been established. The most promising upcoming use case for NFTs in the future are related to identity.That sounds like privacy disaster. Analytic company could download whole blockchain (which used by the NFT) and analyze the data to find out how much asset you have or your personal taste, then sold it to government or advertising company. It's totally different case if they zero-knowledge proof cryptography, but i never see any NFT which use such cryptography.",

I don't know what aspect of my previous post you are referring to. At the very least, the assumptions you are making about how these things are actually being developed and implemented are too broad.This is a tactic adopted by nocoiners to discredit bitcoin: put forth \"what if the sky falls\"-type hypotheticals based on an incomplete understanding of the subject at hand.Certainly every blockchain has potential privacy issues; to think the people who are actually basing their careers around building new products on it haven't considered this aspect is not giving them enough credit.",

And while it's true i didn't check technical details of how they implement NFT, i know most of them is build on top of blockchain (such as ETH, SOL, BSC and MATIC) which only offer pseudonymity.All NFTs are built on top of blockchains.Its possible that identity-based tokens will be put in a new wallet containing nothing else from a master distribution wallet. A signature is required by the wallet owner to show proof of ownership, and nothing else is required, no other further input or output transactions. In that way the owner could potentially remain anonymous, depending on what the signature is needed for.",
