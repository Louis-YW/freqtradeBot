      "body": "shorting is selling at a price and buying back in when/if it corrects down(dips).. however this is not guaranteed. and if the price goes the opposite way. you lose your stashfor instance even at the peak of $70k it never shorted to $7k to be a 10x oportunity. the most you would have got if timed perfectly on a 18month contract is 5x by shorting..  what you are being told about is not pure shorting. but leveraged shorting  this is where you gamble. by getting a loan of 10x or 100x of someone else value compared to the value you own.. and hope to trade it to then get back in enough to pay out their original amount leaving you with many multiples.. but again it only wins if the price dips to the amounts that can afford you the profits you seek in a contracted period you set the leveraged loan for.. but here is the thing. the way the fundamentals play out. the new potential bottom is no longer $15k. its actually higher. it will be $20k+ when/if bitcoin corrects to the new bottom.meaning at todays $28k .. meaning a max dip of $8k or 30%(0.3x).. so for you to get a 10x(1000%) you would need a leverage loan of 30x risk just to maybe get a 1000% (10x profit) if you were able to get the market price to go your way.thus the risk does not match the opportunitythe chances of prices dipping all the way down to $20k are less likely thus the 30x loan risk may not pan out.. leaving you with alot you may need to pay back..there is a big reason why certain people promote leveraged shorts.. because they are not the gamblers. they are the contract offerers. temporarily giving their value to you which whether you lose or win. they get paid back. yep when you lose.. they win. when you win they win. but when you lose YOU LOSE ALOT and they win alot",

Bull market could com in the middle of your shorting so \"easier\" is not the word in here any more then if you claim it's easy to predict market direction. Obviously you can say it would be easy to make million dollars if you bought in crypto in 2012 but you would be wrong. It's easy only in hindsight.",

You can do short trade if the price is already telling you to do short while trade long if the rise is about to happen. Trading will always be more about timing and execution, continue to analyze and be responsible.",

Just throwing and wasting money really.         They thought it was that easy and simple to earn here in crpto trading, why is their luck so strong and how dare they say that they want to earn 100x profit immediately? These newbies are so funny. Also, futures trading is not advisable for a newbie who doesn't know anything about the field of this cryptocurrency industry.",

It all depends on what the market is requiring and what position you have and what coins you're holding. Because if someone knows exactly the answer to your question then he'll for sure never gonna look back to his former life and will enjoy every inch of profit but no.Quote from: david678345 on May 28, 2023, 08:27:25 PMHow can I know which coins would have earned me x10 if I had sold short in the last few months?If someone has a crystal ball then he'd already said what are those that can make you x10.

Scam wicks which often happen in crypto can close your position via stop loss or liquidation when there is a flash pump.Yes, X10 might be possible, buy not common. I have mostly seen 2x,3x,4x etc but 10x?",

I think it's likely easier to say than to archive. Sometimes the period might not really be short; it can extend for months or a year. I know of a token lounched for $1 in the first quarter of last year, but after like a month, the token dropped to $0.01, but recently this year, it's trading for about $0.12 this year. So what I am saying is that it is not really very easy to know the right token that can easily earn you an X10 in a short time, some times it can take long before the token can get pumped.",

That's true and risk is something that every trader has to face. Still going for high returns is possible however the return may or may not be guaranteed. In spot trading this opportunity will come rarely and should be taken right away. The other types of trading may commonly see such numbers but they are all comparable to EV - games meaning you are actually gambling.Even if you can a certain return every few days, that is enough to run trading over years, without looking at sudden high returns.",
