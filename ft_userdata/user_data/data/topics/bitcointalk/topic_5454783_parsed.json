  "content": "During the Trump administration, the no-proliferation deal with Iran was scrapped \"because it was not good\":hhttps://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1718/Quick_Guides/IranNuclear#:~:text=About%2097%20per%20cent%20of,remains%20in%20place%20until%202030.Quote   About 97 per cent of Iran’s stockpile was eliminated under the JCPOA, leaving less than 300 kg of low-enriched uranium—this cannot produce a nuclear weapon. The cap on Iran’s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030. International Crisis Group analyst Ali Vaez notes weaponisation would therefore be virtually impossible until thenQuoteTable 1: key provisions of the JCPOA [...]Inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities[..]And guess what did Trump do with it: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44045957QuoteUS President Donald Trump says he will withdraw the US from an Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran.Calling it \"decaying and rotten\", he said the deal was \"an embarrassment\" to him \"as a citizen\".Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.In response, Iran said it was preparing to restart uranium enrichment, key for making both nuclear energy and weapons.Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said: \"The US has announced that it doesn't respect its commitments.\"I have ordered the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran to be ready for action if needed, so that if necessary we can resume our enrichment on an industrial level without any limitations.\"He said it, and he did it: This is the new underground uranium enrichment facility built by Iran. Under a mountain, several accesses and deep enough so that even the most penetrating missiles and bombs cannot hit it. Iran is about to gain nuclear capability in months if not weeks. Does anyone feel \"the world is now safer thanks to Trump\"?QuoteDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Near a peak of the Zagros Mountains in central Iran, workers are building a nuclear facility so deep in the earth that it is likely beyond the range of a last-ditch U.S. weapon designed to destroy such sites, according to experts and satellite imagery analyzed by The Associated Press.The photos and videos from Planet Labs PBC show Iran has been digging tunnels in the mountain near the Natanz nuclear site, which has come under repeated sabotage attacks amid Tehran’s standoff with the West over its atomic program.Completion of such a facility “would be a nightmare scenario that risks igniting a new escalatory spiral,” warned Kelsey Davenport, the director of nonproliferation policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. “Given how close Iran is to a bomb, it has very little room to ratchet up its program without tripping U.S. and Israeli red lines. So at this point, any further escalation increases the risk of conflict.”https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-natanz-uranium-enrichment-underground-project-04dae673fc937af04e62b65dd78db2e0",

Other example is how some time during his first presidency there were rumors about him thinking to withdraw USA from NATO or even going as far as unfund NATO, which would have been very beneficial for Russia and China.I do not understand the idea of getting rid of a pact which was supposed to avoid nuclear proliferation, if ones not ready to replace it with another one even better.",

Wrong strategy.No, you cannot eliminate their nuclear programme at the touch of a button, that is a thing of the past.It is about time that Trump takes some responsibility for his actions. I mean for ANY of his actions in ANYTHING he has done wrong.Anytime that he is caught lying, stealing, falsifying accounts, acting against the constitution and the law... even sexually abusing or paying for sex ... is just \"it is the Democrats going after him\".

It is a bad alternative to the good ol diplomacy, if you ask me...

Israel also still hold on the hope of a change of regime in Iran, which would not be hostile against them and that possibility gets stretched to their limits when nuclear weapons are put onto the table. That is one of the reasons nuclear scientists are one of the targets of the Mossad in Iran.",

This is because they think that Iran was not sincere to reduce its uranium enrichment, thus it is believed that Iran was not granting the nuclear plant supervisors access to all its enrichment sites. So Trump concluded that there was no need to continue with the agreement. But my problem was that he didn't propose another viable agreement.Now Iran doesn't also trust the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) because they are seen as having other negative motives against Iran. Iran will always be uncomfortable with these United Nations’ nuclear watchdog personnel because it is assumed that they are enemies of the state. I ran is just enduring their visits because of the economic benefit of the JCPOA.The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is bound to fail without trust. Iran will never dismantle its nuclear program even if a new deal is put in place because it is the nation's most powerful bargaining power.",

That's pretty much like that. It doesn't matter one bit what the text says, the only thing that matters is the actions. It's like a politician who promises you anything just to win the election but then forgets all of it after the win.The PDF you linked is filled with sections that Iran fully complied with (as approved by IAEA, US itself and other members of JCPOA) and all the sections that other members did not in return.Take section 5 for example. Arak facilities should have been modernized right? Wrong, it was shut down instead. No technology or assistance of any kind was given. The whole agreement is filled with these things.Not to mention that one of the main goals of JCPOA which was the only reason why Iran entered it in first place was to lift sanctions but in reality not a single one was ever lifted. Instead after JCPOA sanctions against Iran increased to over 6000 in about 3 or 4 years starting from 2015 when it was signed, as I said Iran was complying with JCPOA 100%!",

All because Iran has the most amount of fossil fuels (oil+gas) in the world.Iran's genius was to accept JCPOA but make it only about nuclear topic. They disabled everything like the nuclear power plants, the nucleology (nuclear medicine) programs and a lot more but improved the shit out of Iran's defensive capabilities.That is why Trump pulled out of JCPOA. Because it wasn't serving its purpose which was to weaken Iran's defenses to invade and take control of that sweet sweet fossil fuel fields.I am not your bro. My topics are my opinion and usually they are based on documented assertions. Perhaps you are no longer able to tell what is real and what is not:https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/30/iran-puts-its-nuclear-programme-beyond-the-reach-of-american-bombsQuoteIt is exactly five years since Donald Trump pulled America out of the deal with Iran to constrain its nuclear programme in exchange for economic-sanctions relief. Since then, Iran has not stood still. Satellite pictures appear to confirm that Iran is building a nuclear facility in the Zagros mountains, near the existing Natanz enrichment site (shown above). It seems to be so deep under the ground that it will be invulnerable even to America’s most powerful bunker-busting bomb.This article is behind a paywall, but this is not idle talk and there is more evidence. The site is beyond the reach of the bunker busting GBUs.Iran does not have the most reserves as you describe, however it may be possible that an invasion plan could exist. Note \"possible\" and \"plan\". Iran is much more useful to US and Israel as a counterpower to Saudi Arabia and the countries in the gulf.Regarding a military intervention, I do not think that is really possible in the economic sense. Iran is not Iraq. Larger, richer, better armed and controlled with an ironfist. Has some sophisticated weaponry and sufficient international support.Lastly, sanctions have never worked to remove a government. They tend to affect the people, but the leaders are not removed (e.g. Cuba, Venezuela,...)To your credit, at least you have some reasoning behind your views.",

Keep your shirt on!QuoteMy topics are my opinion and usually they are based on documented assertions.As they say facts are the enemy of truth. It's easy to make up truths and \"document\" them, it is not easy to to bring up facts.Quoteiran-puts-its-nuclear-programme-beyond-the-reach-of-american-bombsWhere are you storing your bitcoins? In a hot wallet?What would you do if you found out that a bunch of thieves were planning to rob your house? Will you leave your door open?I can't explain it any simpler. When there has been multiple terrorist attacks on Iran's facilities using drones and micro-drones like the one on Bushehr power plant a couple of years ago that put it out of service; when Iran is being threatened every day with an attack on its infrastructure, etc. only a fool would ignore the threats and not think about defense.Moving under ground is called passive defense.QuoteIran does not have the most reserves as you describe,Iran is among the top 3 to 5 countries with most amount of oil, natural gas, lithium and a lot of other natural resources.Quotehowever it may be possible that an invasion plan could exist.It is not a possibility, as a matter of fact there have been at least 20 serious invasion plans on the past 8 POTUS's desks. The most recent one in that list were Trump's (as reveled by chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff gen. Milley in at least 5 occasions the last of which [among other reasons] led to gen. Milley effectively removing his authority as commander in chief to prevent him from what he referred to as \"pulling a Reichstag Moment\").  The other serious one I'd say was Bush's (as revealed by many including by general Clarke who says he received direct order from the president to destroy 7 countries [includes Iran] in 5 years). Last but not least the oldest was Carter's which was supposed to start with Operation Eagle Claw (aka the dumbest military operation in human history if you read to declassified documents released by Pentagon) to rescue CIA operatives from post revolution Iran to be able to follow that up with a full scale invasion and re-install the pro-US dictator.QuoteLastly, sanctions have never worked to remove a government. They tend to affect the people, but the leaders are not removed (e.g. Cuba, Venezuela,...)Sanctions are the indirect method of regime change, their success rate is not going to change their main purpose.Basically they are meant to ruin regular people's lives so that they revolt against their own governments just because US ruined their lives! After all that is a page from color revolutions. They also work well in some cases, like in the case of Iraq. You see contrary to \"documented assertions\" the project called \"invasion of Iraq\" started at least in early 1990s in Clinton administration not in 2003 with Bush. The start was with sanctions. Why? To target the economy, create famine, starve people (I mean that literary, look up oil for food in '95), create unrest so that people revolt and from inside pressure the Iraqi regime to accept US demands making it easy to invade in about 10 years.Now guess what those demands were? In short disarmament. Basically Iraq to give up its military capabilities, not WMDs no no, they knew very well Saddam didn't have any for example chemical bombs left from the days Germany+US+France were selling it to him to drop on his neighbor, Iran; but instead they demanded Iraq to give up things like ballistic missiles that could reach US bases in surrounding countries from which they initiated the invasion, the anti-ship missiles and fighters that could reach and sink US navy ships that were bombing their cities in 2003, etc.Guess what were the main target in operations like Southern Watch in mid 1990's? Air defense mostly but also civilians. For example nearly 700 civilians were killed or wounded in one operation in 1998 to both soften Iraq air defense for 2003 invasion and also to create more unrest in Iraq.Guess how did US bomb Iraq with 800 Tomahawks when the invasion officially began in 2003? With the USN and carrier groups that Iraq could no longer hit since the regime accepted the disarmament!Now with a little bit of history, JCPOA can be seen in another light. Specially when you put that together with different US demands of Iran that had nothing to do with nukes but targeted Iran's economy, civilian sector and of course military capabilities just like Iraq's in 1990's.",
