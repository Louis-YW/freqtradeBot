  "content": "This is something I feel like I’ve never seen come up for sale here or even being mentioned at all.   Way back when I found this video while doing a search on YouTube. This is how I learned how to properly pronounce “Casascius”. It cracks me up when I see people mispronouncing it as I think most of us have been in that same boat at one point in time lol. Anyways, just curious if anyone around here has one? Certainly a rare Casascius piece, would be a nice addition to a Casascius collection. https://youtu.be/pb6Ev8wEv-k",
