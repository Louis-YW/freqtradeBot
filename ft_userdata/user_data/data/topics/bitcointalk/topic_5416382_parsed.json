The console will have numerous potentials like they claimed which will allow the players to enjoy gaming while mining the network native token, they also announced their first game called Web3 War which is a first-person shooter. Can you include a link that contains this specific information? sounds pretty intriguing to me. Although the P2E trend is disappointing because it cannot create games that are as entertaining as traditional games and in the end it couldn't keep its weak appeal. But I still believe that P2E gaming will continue to thrive in the future and it will come back with a completely different look. If this news comes to fruition, it will indeed be a huge step forward for the blockchain gaming industry and could directly threaten traditional gaming companies.",

There are tons of crypto start-ups making promises about consoles and taking things to the next level, but so far they haven't done anything. With this news, it is possible that crypto competition in the gaming realm will increase, the news also mentions that this console will launch in the first quarter of next year, hopefully Ziliqa will not disappoint us all.",

The console industry is an entirely different space since the big players either (1) have the capability to design good quality hardware, or (2) have the content delivery experience (or both). These are two KSFs in the console. You don't just publish a few games proprietary for a specific console. No one will buy the console. That said, the PC ecosystem is still better since gamers don't have to purchase new hardware, in other words, lower entry barrier and easier adoption.",

It will be hard to compete with two popular console since many already into it even way before. If they will be able to showcase it properly and can promote appealingly then it can have a chance to be notice in the market.

The prospect here is the ZIL mining function and cooperation with well-known organizations. The article is very short and does not give complete information about the mechanics of the gameplay, but the main point is clear, so we will wait for the release.",

And look at twitch (most popular gaming streaming platform) - its in top 3 most watched game.Its 2022 and they sell more than in 2014-2018. Because there is nothing better to play. Most awaited game of 2018-2020 was cyberpunk2077. Ended up being bugged, overhyped game that lost most of players almost immediately.And now I should be excited about \"their first game called Web3 War which is a first-person shooter\"? It will most likely fail. Whole gaming on blockchain is rather weak idea because:1-you game for fun not to earn2-no one wants to invest in this because you are in fact \"paying someone to play a game\"3-its not 1970. Its 2022 and whole industry is very overcrowded. So if game made by pros made 100% to entertain users is loosing players in long run how a game made by newbies made as a \"game to earn\" or \"game on blockchain\" will stop them from leaving?4-how a game that is loosing players in long run can hold prices of items?... and many more",

And I don't think people will buy a console for a small number of unknown games, regardless of how popular (in the past) p2e games were, or s2e in their model. They still have that issue of balancing the entire economy centered around the games they're going to make which is insanely difficult imo since there's a bunch of factors involved, not to mention involving the enjoyment factor in it (since in the end, games are for entertainment regardless if you can earn or not).",

There won't be any impact, but it can be seen that Zilliqa is working hard to develop the blockchain gaming industry. It's like the early stages of P2E can lead to failure but they are trying to push the P2E game or blockchain game to be more and more mature. Like P2E game, I can say it can't compare with traditional games but its technology and idea is very good. It just needs to grow and improve, it will soon become a real competitor to the traditional gaming industry. Because with P2E we can both have fun and make a profit, something that traditional games can't do.",
