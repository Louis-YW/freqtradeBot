  "content": "This question has occured to me many times but whenever it happens I push it off my mind. But I want to ask now and get opinions of members on it. I do not know if this section is right place to post it. Please moderator move it if I posted it wrongly. My question is why do members move from one campaign to another? I will not mention names of some that I have seen move from campaign to campaign every time there is opening so no one feels am attacking him.I know alot of us will say it is the difference in weekly reward, that the higher the reward the more people move to campaigns with better payments. But I have seen where members go from better pay rates to the ones with lower rates and lower posts requirements. Some apply to campaign of the same manager in less than a week of getting accepted and they want to move again, the same payment and number of posts. I have also seen those who have refused to move to campaigns with better rates, they will be picked if they applied because of their good posts. They choose to remain. Is it about loyalty? Is it that they are scared of switching? Is it about fulfilment with where they are?And for those who move always, is it money driving the motive? Is it about going to where those they see as family move to? I want to know. Some days ago I was surprised to see someone who has stayed in a campaign for more than three years. He was with BestChange. Alot of people can not remain there because there are many campaigns paying higher rates than the campaign he was with but he remained until yesterday that he moved to another campaign. Three years is like a lifetime, both for the campaign running and the member who remained faithful to it.What makes members move everytime? I need your contribution on this to make me understand it better.",

Some people do not join campaign because they are rich and see the campaign money to be too small. Some people join low paying campaign and stayed there because they are afraid to move. I do not see it as loyalty but I think they are afraid if high the paying campaign can last like like the low paying campaign they are. Some people prefer campaign manager because campaign manager favour and less strict to campaign partipants than another. You can see a campaign that people are leaving for a low one because the campaign manager of the high paying campaign is removing participants without notice. Some people want to join high paying campaign but not selected.",

It's true about some users leaving a campaign due to delay in payments by the campaign managers because since payments are made in BTC, it's price may be high at the moment, but when they may receive payment, it would have dropped and this discourages a lot.People leave or stay in campaigns due to personal reasons but it's better to remain in a particular sig than moving about because it may look like the user is unstable.",

In addition, recently, one has observed how the bonus system used by managers gives a good increase. Perhaps one manager does not see the potential of the participant and does not pay him bonuses, at a time when the person himself is very ambitious and is sure that he deserves more.In any case, why are you worried about this? Why think about it?The economics section is not at all suitable for discussing the signatures of companies. Move the topic, as advised by hosseinimr93, to the \"Service Discussion\" board.",

Some members try to move to long-term campaigns, that is, a class of members try to move to campaigns that are likely to last for a relatively long time, because there are many competitors in the forum at the moment, so if you miss a campaign, you will be able to participate in another campaign later the user has to struggle a lot. Basically, by thinking about these things, users change their current signature and participate in a different signature campaign.",

They choose to remain. Is it about loyalty? Is it that they are scared of switching? Is it about fulfilment with where they are?You probably didn't have me in mind when writing the above, but I related to that particular situation more so than the others.  Personally, I'm not on this forum to make money and I don't like switching campaigns frequently because I don't want to burn bridges; when you leave a campaign, the manager then has a slot to fill and it's more work for him.  So although in the past I probably could have gotten into higher-paying campaigns, I chose to stay where I was for the reason I gave (and I don't want to get the reputation of being a campaign-hopper).Everyone is different, though, and if you think about it, it's a good thing people are jumping to campaigns that pay more.  That in theory should drive up pay rates across the board, because if you're renting signature space, to get good posters you need to pay a competitive rate....just like in the real world, you know?This forum is basically about money and if people are honest most of them would identify as capitalists.  And what do capitalists do in the labor market?  They go where the money is.  It's not that tough to figure out.Quote from: Adbitco on September 02, 2023, 06:58:32 AMThis could be as a result of unsatisfied pay rate just as the user said, and delay in payment..Lets say some manager don't pay on time after week runs out, some participants wants after week runs before 8am in the morning they expect to see their balance changes in their wallet and not those manager that will delay till almost that day runs out before paying participants even when they hold funds with them.Yes!  I don't want to name names, but I've had an experience like that and it was annoying as hell (but it was years ago).  Imagine if you were working a real job in the real world and for some arbitrary reason your paycheck didn't show up on time, maybe a day late.  That would cause chaos in a real workplace.  There's a lot of flexibility with sig campaigns and a lot of leeway given to campaign managers, but they should still try their best to be consistent with the payouts, i.e., everything correct and payments made to participants on time.Oh, I think this thread ought to go in Meta or Service Discussion.  It's an interesting topic to me, OP.  Even the idea of sig campaigns has fascinated me ever since I figured out what they were (and that took months for my pea brain to compute).",

I need your contribution on this to make me understand it better.It depends on every individual’s perception, we may have different view of signature campaign and what may drive me to change from one campaign to another will be different from yours but I believe most people are influenced by the pay rates just as _act_ have mentioned. When ever a new campaign with higher pay rates is launched a lot of people will leave their campaign just to join that campaign but not everyone is joining because of the high pay rate. Quote from: Fiatless on September 02, 2023, 08:01:29 AMChange of campaign rule: When the rules of the campaign change, it might not suit some members. Some campaigns can decide to remove or add some boards to their campaign posts which some members might not be comfortable with This is also one of the major reason why some people change campaigns, the post requirement for some campaign may be too much for some members to cope, they may be too occupied to have enough time to carry out the required number of post and so they will be seeking to join campaign with lower post quota. There are also people who are not convenient to post in some boards like how some campaigns demand for 10 gambling posts for the week and when they don’t have much knowledge about gambling discussions they will seek for campaigns that doesn’t make it mandatory to make gambling posts. Quote from: Fiatless on September 02, 2023, 08:01:29 AMLongevity of the campaign: Some members might decide to leave a high-paying campaign to a lesser one because they believe that the low-paying one will last longer. Some members cherish longtime campaigns rather than high-paying ones. This is another aspect that individuals take into account while switching from one campaign to another. Some people choose long-running campaigns because they believe they are more secure in the long run. We've observed some high-rate efforts that didn't survive as long as anticipated, yet their members kept switching to the campaigns that paid less. The reputation of the campaign manager and how strictly the manager runs the campaign are other reasons why people switch to other campaigns. People will rather participate in a campaign where they will feel secure and have peace of mind.",

I bet you the person you claimed to know who remained in campaign for three years didn't have the same issue with people who move from one campaign to another. Nothing is beyond the power of money.",

Alt campaigns found in 'Bounties' board are trash while in services board most of are gambling related, which is not my subject.

The reason is because of money.Those who jump from one campaign to another because of payment factors, when a slot is opened with a higher salary offer, they will immediately apply in the hope of being accepted.2. Factor in the number of posts and rules in posting.The weekly quota amount is also a consideration for them, they will immediately apply when there is a vacancy according to their account rank in another campaign which requires a weekly posting quota of less than the currently promoted campaign. Apart from that, posting rules such as posting on boards were excluded in the old campaign but counted in the new campaign. This is also a consideration for those who like to move campaigns.3. Campaign duration factor.It is undeniable that the convenience factor is a big consideration for Campaign participants, those who have been accepted into a campaign that has been running for a long time will remain loyal to that campaign. Their loyalty to the Campaign is not only because of the amount of payment, but they want to be guaranteed to continue being in the Campaign for the long term.4. The factor of wanting to find a new atmosphere in a different campaign.It might seem strange when suddenly participants who stay for a long time in one campaign suddenly move to another campaign. This is not due to a lack of loyalty to the old campaign, maybe there is something you want to look for in another campaign or you want to find a new atmosphere in the new campaign. imo",
