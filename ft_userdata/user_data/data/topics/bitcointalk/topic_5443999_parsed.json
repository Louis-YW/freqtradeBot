Sportbet think they can so simply confiscate the money from people without any respond from people and fight, they acting like they do anything but it will not be like that with this case. I see many many negative opinion and exactly cause of that specific situation and I will spread warning message everywhere I can about it.I hope nobody will made such a wrong stupid idea to create over there account, cause in 100% they will take your money once you will start winning somethig.Be aware guys !Edit : proof of Sportbet.io scam and how easily they will try to steal your moneyhttps://ibb.co/c1yH4n2",

If I knew you will be so greedy for the money and have the possibility to confiscate the money with one better reason expect the fact of proof of innocent, I would never recomend this scam site to anybody !You guys are nothing more then violent bandit thinking you can go away just with your crimes closing people account and confiscating money.Don't you think it's over for you, specific lawyers will take this case I don't know to how far but you acting with clear crime against me who have plenty of proofs I'm innocent of your accusation.Me and my friend passed two Verification successfully but anyway they took the chance to steal our money.This site should be called scam crime sportbet cause they are nothing more.",

They closed many customer accounts and confiscated their funds, claiming they violated their policies & terms. I hope they review the proofs of the affected customers because not all customers have already committed these violations, as there may be confusion in the matter that requires evidence and clarification.",

This mafia thinks anyway they can do everything and run away just like that, so I don't know what kind of help you could offer. I'm open guys and willing to do everything, including paying more money for this case lawyers etc. then leaving this act of crime just like that, if I will stop here and just give up everyone could do this and they really want we will do like this. I really will not give up and would like to pay the highest price for it.

Did you use your friend's referral code when signing up?2. In all of the time you or your friend spend on the platform, have either of you utilize their bonuses or promotion program? Any of it?1.

You're saying you borrowed and played from your friend's account instead of creating your own with your email address, username, etc.?Second, how does sharing wifi doesn't translate as you shared the same main IP address?Third, let's assume by some reason you both played on different IP, it still breaches their TnC --which you and/or your friend agreed upon signing up-- under the clause of same household and address.I think no one has notified Steve yet, I'll PM him so he can give his insight on this matter.Edit: PM sent.",
