      "body": "This is more known in gambling industry as algorithm I think, which is the randomized 'pattern' of the outcomes which are evident with dice games, roulettes, and slots. I doubt that all casinos have no power with RNG,there is a tendency that some has. Actually we wouldn't know not unless you yourself have your own gambling platform. But to think of the tendency, if there is a way to break the 'code' with these patterns, many people should have been rich already because they could take advantage on knowing the result and they could bet for themselves.

Every site \"must\" provide methods so that it is possible to verify all this information in order to do justice to the \"provably fair\" method",

The random numbers are there for the protection of the casino, if a casino tried to somehow cheat and their random number generator did not gave random numbers but instead they could manipulate the results, hackers will soon enough discover the pattern in which this happened and they will take advantage of it, it is why when you see a gambler somehow beating the casino they do so by finding a way to reduce the randomness of the games, so while such a thing would be possible it could play against the casino as well.",

He did not rule out that in some sites with little supervision the mechanism is manipulated to favour the house, but in regulated and supervised sites the system is completely random. We have to think that even if it is random, the house is going to make money from the HE, it doesn't need to cheat anything. The casinos that may be tempted to cheat are those that do not manage to attract traffic to the site and a good volume of bets, because if these two things are achieved, with a good management of bankroll and maximum bet to avoid going bankrupt if a whale wins in the short term, profits are assured.",

It's good that another company provides the random numbers to reduce the manipulation opportunities. RNG is definitely the biggest part in gambling, without it we wouldn't have any chance at all to win a big jackpot. The house edge is what makes the casino money overtime, so the more we gamble the higher our chance of losing money. That is why we the randomness part that can change to outcome in our favour.

So basically, what the RNG does is to ensure that when we play our favoruite casino games, it creates random number, thereby ensuring that the result of every game are random and fair. No one would enjoy playing a game where they have no fair chance of winning.Rhis is one of the unique importance of choosing an online casino to gamble with because we trust in their delivery capacity when we gambles that there's going to be a hundred percent fareness in what they do, how will it appeas if two gamblers were having thesane tickets numbers to claim their winnings on a particular game they played individually but having the same number as tickets, things could go complicated but RNG has been a solution to this and we trust their system in this except the betting slip is lost by the winner being careless with it.",

MMOs and the like have a ton of relation with RNG drops, I was an avid player back then so I studied a bit about what RNG was and how it worked. It was a wonder to me back then as a kid as to how it worked since it seemed complicated a f and it wasn't really that easy to understand how it works, besides knowing that it was, well, random. In the case of casinos, I just trust them really. I know that some providers have lower RTP than others, but I can't really be assed to actually care for the most part. As long as it was random and wasn't manipulated in any way, I'm fine with the RTP they present, it's a well-known fact that the casino always wins anyway.",
