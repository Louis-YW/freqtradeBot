      "body": "It all depends on the distance and on the restaurant, as many restaurants may deliberately raise the price for delivery. In general, delivery has become much cheaper now because of covid and also because of a lot of competition. For example, I know that Domino uses the services of a courier company that now delivers their food. Now imagine how many companies like dominos are passing off other people's couriers as their delivery driver at the moment, and how this has affected the delivery market.",
