A single seed backup contains infinite keys(based on what Google said) is it not enough to manage all addresses generated from exchanges?Binance have separate wallets to ensure the safety of their customer's funds but they only transfer them from the exchange to other wallet. If I remember correctly they have 4 separate wallets.",

So i want to know that these address will always be different and will link to the wallet or completely separate ?It varies depending on exchange, and some exchanges has its own block explorer that gives more information about wallet addresses and cold storage, but I do not think there is an explorer that shares user data, such as linking Bitcoin addresses or cryptocurrency addresses to the account ID.This does not mean that no one can know that your Bitcoin addresses are linked. Even if you use a mixing service, doing it incorrectly will lead to revealing your identity. Here is an example of two accounts[1] that were discovered to belong to the same user despite his use of a mixing service.So what are you trying to hide or do you want to enhance your privacy? I will give you better recommendations based on the situation.[1]  'John Abraham ≈ naim027' Coincidence or Connection?",

Similarly, the subaccount's wallet deposit addresses are linked too ?Bitget allows you to create 50 different addresses for each cryptocurrency. As far as I remember, in sub-accounts there is no possibility of creating a deposit address; there is the possibility of transferring assets between accounts. You can create different addresses within your main account and they will not overlap. Exchanges operate using a completely different algorithm than wallets. They can be used as a mixer.For example, you have an address on an exchange, you send your cryptocurrency there, and if you want to withdraw cryptocurrency from this address, then your exchange address will never appear in the transaction. The exchange withdraws your funds from its hot wallets. And addresses on the exchange are only needed to deposit your coins.This method is obviously adopted to enhance the safety of investor's funds on the platform against hacks and the overall security of Bitget as an exchange, rather than a cause for alarm. As much as I can recall, Bitget recently partnered with Cobo SuperLoop, an off-exchange settlement network - leaders in institutional digital asset custody technologies. I read Bitget users will trade on the exchange while securely holding their assets off-exchange, protected by Cobo’s advanced wallet technologies. That could be why you're getting direct generated address at different attention.",

I haven't tested the subaccounts deposit address creation but in my Main Wallet, i can create different deposits address too and they will not belong to same wallet too, as you told.By the way, its strange the Bitget give option of 50 subaccounts, FTX used to give such an option but binance do not give the options of subaccounts.

Mixing coins on an exchange may only protect you from being tracked by people around you, but the exchange can hand over all your related information to the authorities if they have to. And please note, the exchange also has a censorship mechanism for \"tainted\" coins according to their own discretion. The coins you try to mix may end up in confiscation.",

I never try this because i haven't made all the 20 sub accounts, but if we delete a subaccount, its deposit address is lost and then when we create another subaccount (after the 20th), it will generate a new set of addresses ?If anyone can confirm this ?",

(When you internal transfer form sub account to main account for withdrawal purposes, that activity is internal and is not visible on blockchain).",
