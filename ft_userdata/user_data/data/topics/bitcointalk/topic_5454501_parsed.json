This type of trade is not allowed on most of the large exchanges. A concern of cross-trading is that it may be used to \"paint the tape,\" whereby market players manipulate the price of a stock on purpose by buying and selling it amongst themselves.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross.asp#:~:text=A%20cross%20trade%20occurs%20when,most%20of%20the%20large%20exchanges.It is something completely different from what you talked about, and it is a kind of market price manipulation that occurs in pump-and-dump groups or outside-the-market trades.",

      "body": "I agree with Yamane_Keto, the thing that you are sharing isn't cross trading. But a purchase of a coin before its launch, and such coins are mainly offered as presale on sites like Pinksale. However, you forgot to warn the uses about the frauds and scams on such sites who offer their coins and grab the money even before the launch. I know such sites have model to lock some amount of the liquidation, but still many frauds are looting people on such sites. I must say that there are some good projects on those sites, but unfortunately it's really hard to know the good ones. I have invested in some of those projects and unfortunately have lost more than $500 within a month. I'm sure many people have lost far more than that, but the point is that many of those coins are scam projects which are basically listed on such sites to scam innocent investors.",

If you look at all the examples Op provided they are all related to the PEPE token we have other examples why did he choose those ones? And at the end he gave a link to a site that's not even related to the topic, from all of this it is clear that OP is only trying to shill his project nothing else.To you Op, this is a shitty way to promote a project and if you continiue like this you will only end up giving everyone the idea that your project is a scam you probably should hire a more experience marketer to do the work for ya.",

When a user moves his or her funds from one exchange to the other for trading, there is no crime or any law against that. If, for example, I have money on my exchange A account and exchange A doesn't have what I want to trade but I can see a potential coin that I can trade and make profit from in exchange B, what is stopping me from moving my coins from exchange A to exchange B? The only place we should think about the connection here is when you don't want an exchange to know where your assets went. If you don't want them to be traced, then you better avoid withdrawing directly into another exchange wallet.",

The bridge is working as a gateway that interacts with smart contracts and I do not think that I have heard that it has a use in transferring cryptocurrencies between two or more central exchanges.Centralized exchanges work basically exactly as the banking system works, two platforms can transfer currencies between them without any transaction happening on the blockchain.What you are trying to say is arbitrage trading where you benefit from the price difference between the same currency in two different exchanges, that you buy at one in which the price is low and sell at one in which the price is high.Arbitrage trading was profitable in the past, but it has become more difficult with trading bots that correct prices in fractions of a second",

If that was the case, then we would be having lots of rich traders here.Firstly, what you forget is that a number of exchanges disable withdrawal and depositing of the token even several hours after the listing. By the time withdrawal or deposits are enabled, the arbitrage trading bots will have already balanced up the prices across all exchangesQuote from: btctalk-memeboss on May 30, 2023, 09:36:05 AM#Protip new coin coming soon is pepewx.tech its the official PEPE Coin FORK to a new blockchain.What a shitty way to promote your valueless token.",

I mean, this isn't something am aware of even, didn't see it like a thing I tell you but, I was hoping on an explanation that made comparison between certain pairs on certain exchanges when traded or sent directly between them.That aside,I think one of the issues most users face is having to trace or get news of these coins that are yet to get listed. In many cases, its always a pump and dump anyway so, it makes little sense having to go through all that for a coin that is going to dump soon.Sure that's not a project you hope to pump at OP.",
