  "content": "Gang, I am a coin collector and trader. My mantra has been to pick a lane, learn as much as you can and stay focused. As a result, I decided early on to just collect coins / tokens. It is what I know from my past trading too before physical bitcoins. However, all the bitcoin bills are awesome. I am not going to be a collector accumulating a lot of bills, but what advise would you give to someone like me who decided to try and own one or two? If a new collector asked me what coins to own, I would say: 1. Affordable and reliable classic - Satori. 2. under $1000, so real money, but forever great collectible - 10,000 bits Crypto Imperator or a number of Lealanas. 3. Big money but legacy collectible - Loaded Casascius. What is your advice for picking up a bitcoin paper note? Steeley",

SteeleyBitbills are the very first physical bitcoin collectibles and were produced even before casascius coins were invented. Hence they are the holy grail of physical bitcoin collecting imo. If you ever have the chance to get your hands on any of them, I’d say to definitely consider it. Krogo made a nice thread about them here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3334918",
