  "content": "I came across this post and i was touched to report it here because it's a slap to our entire board for someone from Nigeria to go make such post, I don't even know who brought such user without even giving them proper orientation. There are some post you would want to make that requires reasoning before releasing those post or even possible try consult your boss or your madam who brought you here do you think we are upto 1,000 users here or we more than? Quote from: PhilixCrpt on December 13, 2023, 04:51:04 PMBitcointalk.org has become a blessing a large number of unemployed youths in most low income countries around the globe.From my observation, Bitcointalk.org has helped in creating wealth creation for thousands of unemployed youths.This has helped in reducing unemployment and in turn boasting the Nigerian economy through Wealth Creation.Thanks to the originator of this life saving platform that has engaged millions around the World.Truthfully, platforms like this has helped in reducing crime rate in many Countries by engaging mostly the young generation that would have resorted to crime.I have seen so many struggling youths, now financially self reliant and helping others around their communities with resources made via this platform.Kudos to the inventor(s) of this great platform. üôèüëçüëè‚úçÔ∏èIf i am not mistakenly we are only less than 200 active users who are in this forum that doesn't mean they are earning money, earning is from bitcoin investment and not bitcointalk- that is to say here is a community to get information and acts or not act according to information you get or not but for saying this forum has helped thousands of person from we kontry is a kind of slap although I can say that lots of Nigerians are into cryptocurrency investment, trading and whatever but not solely depending on this forum and even as that you should be guided properly before going out to the english board to post. I know say e get plenty newbies wey dey come here to come hustle but that no means say you go come blow up the cover onto say you wan earn or receive merits to just put bad records to our face. Please if i should come across such post again I don't mind reporting those as shitposting or spamming then such will be ban. ¬†Any person wey carry you come here make him go show you road how to take talk and how to carry post because you are bring shame to our local board. Due to some things wey i see i stop to dey post here because every time na the same story, the same post with another format organized in a different ways and to me i think we are more than so let us stop to dey bring our names after we don go up finished one newbies wey from no where go just ruined our reputation this one wey every body don dey give strength say wey dey try no be where we go just come messed ourselves up onto say we dey introduced people to follow hustle abeg make una mind the kind of incompetent people we carry come here next time before theymos go vex delete our localboard oo. I no wan talk much but anyhow una fit comment here make we reason the matter.",

That guy really shame us for here. I don prepare my response but the thread was locked before I should finish with what I was doing.

Even thou na merit you dey look for, you no suppose downgrade your fatherland for personal gain.

Locking the thread is not enough because e go dey break my heart if I waka jam am anytime. I'm very disappointed in whosoever is behind that account.",
