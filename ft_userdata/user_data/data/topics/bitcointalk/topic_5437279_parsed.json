  "content": "You may have heard of them, and you may even understand them in general, but I watched a documentary - I regret that I cannot recall its name - about a variation of the double-slit experiment that was made more interesting and fun.In this experiment, a machine was built similar to a slot machine, with two entry points and two exit points. On the right, there was a series of small light bulbs leading to the right exit point, and a series of bulbs crossing a line to make an X shape leading to the left exit.The experiment used colors to demonstrate the behavior of particles. Each particle was represented by a red light on the right and a blue light on the left. Releasing just red or just blue had similar results: the particles either went straight to their exit (most of the time) or crossed paths to go to the other exit. However, when both red and blue were released at the same time, they appeared to react as if they knew about each other, and their pattern of selecting their path changed drastically. They even started to follow a specific unchanging path every time they had the same color. They either went right or left together, or crossed paths with each other, but never once went solo on their desired path.This is not yet the scary part. The experiment got even more exciting when they tried computer-generated random patterns for the color of particles to constantly change, making it impossible to know the last color at the last bulb before it exited the screen/panel. Surprisingly, both particles knew their own and each other's final state/color right before the exit, even before seeing each other, and there was no possible way to change their path. This suggests that something spooky is happening: the particles demonstrated the same behavioral patterns as if they knew exactly each other's last state at the exit, whether they were going to be the same color or different colors.This indicates that even the smallest particles in the universe could be intelligent. Are they conscious after showing this level of awareness? Knowing sub-atomic states at a certain point in time in the future suggests that there must be some sort of echo moving back in time in the form of waves. To navigate through their lifespan, they must be able to recognize and differentiate these waves, as there could be trillions of trillions of such waves moving in all directions every second. What kind of communication methods/encryption could they be using?ðŸ¤”Ps, I used AI after writing this to check for grammar/ phrasing, this is the result with zero change, enjoy, lol.",

Are they conscious after showing this level of awareness? The smallest particles in the universe may be intelligent, but they cannot be conscious or aware of what they are doing.Intelligent in the sense that it is programmed in its physical structure to follow certain patterns in certain cases, but I do not think at all that it can be aware of what it is doing or that it knows what it is doing!!!Only rational beings possess awareness and perception. This can be likened to a robot or artificial intelligence. It possesses a great deal of intelligence and is able to solve many dilemmas. It is also able to program itself to deal with new problems, but despite all that, we cannot say that it has awareness (until now, at least).",

      "body": "Well, I guess you could say they are not self aware on their own, but definitely they act coordinated, no matter how much it seems that everything is chaotic happening by accident. I was doing some reading and the subject of tachyon tingled my curiosity, now I'm positive that retro causality is easily provable by science. Of course if we could prove the existence of tachyon particles which are faster than light, and seeing something faster than light is not possible so far.On the subject of non-locality, I'm fascinated ever since I found out that quantum computers operate by harnessing the non-locality properties of quantum particles. One could just imagine about the possibilities of different applications based on that architecture, just mind bending.",
