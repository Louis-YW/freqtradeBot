  "content": "Hello all. I bought a used S17+ last year and didn't get around to plugging it in until this past week. The seller sent me a video of the thing working before shipping and of course I get it and I can't get it to mine. I get 2 error messages \"Socket Connect Failed: Connection refused\" and when I go into network diagnostic and hit \"ping\" I get the message \"6 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss. I have put the latest firmware from bitmain on there, rebooted it, hit the reset button on the machine, the IP search button and occasionally the \"socket connect failed\" message disappears but it never mines. Any thoughts on how I could get it to move? I am thinking of trying Slush Pools firmware to see if it acts any different. The kernel readout has a ton of output, the only thing that stands out is: 2023-01-10 23:28:28 temperature.c:843:get_temp_info: read temp sensor failed: chain = 2, sensor = 0, chip = 14, reg = 1And does this mean it is actually the third hashboard \"chain 2\"? I am guessing that means the 14th chip on the third hashboard might be bad? Any input would be greatly appreciated. Also is there a cheat sheet of sorts to understand what all is going on in the kernel log? It kicks out a lot of information but I don't know what it means.",

      "body": "Do you think the \"temp issue\" which is likely a bad chip or solder job could explain the \"socket connect failed\" message or the \"6 packets transmitted, 0 packets received\" message? The socket connect failed message is intermittent, it occasionally goes away and you can go to the Miner status stab and see 2/3 hashboards attemping to work.",

      "body": "I had peeked under the hood before but didn't notice what appears to be QC stickers on the 3rd hash board. I guess that board has had issues before and they did a bad patch job.I unplugged the third hash board turned the unit on and got a fault light. Hit the reset button on the back and after hitting the IP report button it seemed to try to mine (Normal Light was on) and heat coming off of the miner. The hardware error went away and it seemed to be trying but I still cant get a good \"ping\" diagnostic. Also of note was the fan was throttling down and up. No luck  What are the odds that I get a video of the thing working in china and then it arriving here, sitting for a few months and my first attempt at mining I get these errors? Are these issues typical of something happening during transit?Apologies for the large amount of text, I didn't see a button to attach a file. This is the kernel log after removing the third hashboard and it sounding like it was trying to mine.

      "body": "This was the kernel log from before i removed hashboard 3. Do you think chip 14 is the likely culprit of what is hurting hasboard 3?We are having cold weather tomorrow, perhaps I will have some luck getting it to hash if temperature is killing it.Aside from my sadness that this expensive paperweight I bought isn't working. Have you ever tried immersion cooling miners with the monolithic heat sink? I am wondering if the thermal paste could muck up the fluid. When I bought this miner it claimed to have upgraded heat sinks but ended up being the old individual type. I am wondering with the monolithic heat sink maybe there is less chance of board failure since there is less solder floating around.

I am going to try using a monster fan to cool it while running to see if that helps. Other than that might buy a diagnostic computer from Zeus.",

      "body": "I hope that you know how to use the insert code tag a sharp # button while editing your post it may look better than pasting the whole logs without it.Anyway, what I see most of your logs are read temp/sensor errors it might be overheating or maybe the 3rd hashboard has a loose heatsink, and actually the miner itself is trying to fix the issue by gradually reducing the frequency. Miner heatsinks sometimes loosen during delivery that's a common issue the only solution for that is to find that loose heatsink and reglue it with thermal glue/adhesive most recommended glue is an artic silver thermal adhesive to reattach the loose heatsink. Another thing that I notice is the fan doesn't have signalsHere's mine with an insert code tag do this in your post above it will attract more people to come here and help you.Code:2023-01-10 23:26:26 driver-btm-api.c:1255:init_fan_parameter: fan_eft : 0  fan_pwm : 0Would you mind to try to remove the 3rd hashboard first and let it run and let see if the two fan are running fine because sometimes abnormal fan can give different logs to other hashboard but the only culprit is the fan. So make sure to check if the two fan is working fine.",

      "body": "I did not know that inserting code was a feature, thank you. I did unplug board 3 and 1 and managed to get board 2 to run but it eventually stopped (was only running at 11000 GH/S). I think unplugged board 2 and got board 1 to run for a bit (was running at 23,600 GH/S) but I still get the \"socket connect failed: connection refused\". It seems random, if I reset on the miner and then hit the IP report occasionally you can connect to the miner but it has always failed the \"ping\" diagnostic in network. I also hooked up a monster fan and used spoofers on this latest test. The board and chips were running cooler but maybe some chips aren't working. While running one board the highest temp the chip saw was 50°C, max PCB temp was 36°C. Maybe the damage was done the first time I ever turned it on. Before running my monster fan setup my chip temps were up to 77°C. The heat sinks all felt good, nothing was loose. That being said I think on the chip side it uses the mono-lithic type heat sinks that are held in place with screws. Not sure if there is poor contact or not. I can say for a used machine it at least looks like its in pretty good shape.

I am guessing I either need to pick up one of these testers:https://www.zeusbtc.com/ASIC-Miner-Repair/Parts-Tools-Details.asp?ID=1467Orhttps://tester.asic.repair/enDid you have a chance to look at my logs to see if it was something obvious? Also, since I have a monolithic heatsink on the S17 are those best removed by putting the entire thing in an oven and if so what temp? All of the videos I have seen so far deal with individual heat sinks. On my most recent test I got rid of the stock fans and used a monster fan to push air through so that it will run cooler. Mission accomplished on that front however the miner still wasn't working. I never been able to connect to my mining pool, always fail the ping diagnostic test and get the \"socked failed to connect\" message.",

      "body": "Mikey I think you are right. I finally managed to connect to a mining pool and am finally earning negative money but it is neat to say I have mined. My miner's has rate dropped off and when i went to go check the miner it had disconnected and was reporting chip temps on 127°C even though I am pumping a ton of air through it and previously the chips were setting at 55°C.I looked at your earlier post referenced by zeus and it seems I have to do the same thing (Step 1. Reboot miner, Step 2. In my case hit the IPS report, Step 3. Un-plug and plug in the network cable) and it seems to come back to life. I am guessing when the miner senses high temps it is trying to save it self by shutting down. The good and bad is that the side that the chips are mounted on are covered with a monolithic heat sink so I have to remove that to test the chips. I had gently tried to do it after removing the screws and I am guessing they used the thermal glue? Any idea how to remove the heat sink to get to the chips? Do you know if the thermal paste/glue is typically non-electrically conductive? I have dreams of eventually trying to immersion cool these things and I am wondering if the dielectric would dissolve the paste/glue and then you would have bits of conductive stuff floating in the fluid.I may consider taking you up with telegram (which I don't have yet) and anydesk. I am scared of stranger danger though...",

Looking at some earlier posts if all boards and chips are registering high temps that means the power supply has crapped out? No usually high chip temps sometimes it is due to loose heatsinks or no proper ventilation. Do you mind telling us what exactly your room temp is?You can try to run the miner with low power mode let's see if it can help to drop the chip temps. There is other thing that I would like you to try there and maybe this unit also has hidden settings where you can able to adjust frequency and voltages. Check the Mikeywith guide here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5247179.0And then set the voltage/frequency to the lowest and gradually increase it depending on the chip temps until you find the right spot.",

I am scared of stranger danger though...The fact that you got to connect to the pool even for a while eliminates the network related issues, which means you no longer need my help in network diagnoisis, your issue is now hardware related and I am not the best person for that.One thing I know is that if all temp sensors are acting weird it usually means a bad PSU, so you might need to replace the PSU, if it turns out to be actually sensor issues, it will require a pro to fix it, not something the average person can do, there is a pinned thread in this sections that is dedicated to repair services which you can check.Although with all honesty, that gear is worth less than 300$ fully working with no issues, fixing it will cost probably 100-200$, with shipping and all that you may go past the 300$.",

      "body": "@ BitMaxzRoom temp was 55 (this is out in the barn for now) and I have the miner hooked up to a 10\" ducted fan that can move a lot of air. I would post a picture of the setup but I don't know how. Do you have to post pictures to another site and then link it here?I looked into to the post of mikeywith but I did not see that on mine. I have an S17+ if that makes a difference. I am guessing you went to \"more tools\" and \"developer tools\" to get that to pop up? Currently I only have the normal and sleep mode available. Side note, when I turn on the miner I got a voltage of 20 volts across the buss bars going to the hashboards. I let it run and it connected again today but you see the hashrate slowly dropping off. Once I saw the 127 C chip temp I went back to measure the voltage and it was reading 0 volts. So at least when you first turn on the power supply it appears to be working, but could the voltage dropping off be from the miner telling it to dial back the frequency/Voltage?@ MikeywithAgreed that it is almost not worth it to fix at current prices. I got this miner to learn the ropes and see what you can do with them. Seems like a bought a lemon or just a really finicky miner. I eventually would like to have several miners and was hoping to get into immersion cooling them and trying to power them with solar. I was planning on messing with overclocking but now it seems you may want to baby these things to make them last longer.",

I would think that the solder issue should be less since the chip side has a different heat sink. The backside still has the old style. I would post a picture of my boards but don't know how.",
