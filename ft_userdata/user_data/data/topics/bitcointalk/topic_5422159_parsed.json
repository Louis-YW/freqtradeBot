Looking at Luis Garcia, looks like he is not an easy opponent at all so this could be crucial for Davis. Less than 2 months left to prepare, hope they can both make it. This could be a unanimous win for Davis.",

Davis really needs a lot of money to resolve his cases and for this, he's going to whack the 2 Garcias. Ryan will get a title shot against Haney if he goes to jail right?Only the hardcore boxing fans knows who Hector is, he isn't also a walk in the park. I wonder if Tank's fight with Ryan will be canceled if he loses against Hector by unexpected upset.",

Do he really need a tune up fight before Ryan?And if I'm not mistaken Hector Luis Garcia is a career 130 lbs, so pretty much he is going up one division. And with that, it was a mismatch to begin with, Tank has been campaigning at 135-140 lbs. But very clever on the side of Davis to get a tune up fight first because his much anticipated fight with Ryan Garcia in May. He will be as least as active as he can be before that big fight.",

And in any case, I wouldn't mind this, as long as he will fight Ryan whether in May, as long as it will happen this year, and I'm down with this fight.",

I'm pretty sure the bookies will list Tank become huge favorited again, just like when he was fight with Rolando Romero.",

Pretty sure Tank already started his light training because he was already expecting a fight while Luis Garcia just won his first ever world title in late August, he is probably fat right now from celebrating, partying, and enjoying the feeling as a world champion. Although Luis Garcia is moving up against Tank's fake lightweight title, 30 days to prepare is short notice. Luis Garcia is after the money though, and his 130 belt is safe too, so he doesn't care if gets KO'd by Tank at 135. Nonetheless, I hope an upset happens. I'm sick of fighters cherry-picking their opponents. PBC is the worst promotion nowadays, at least the other promoters will try as much as possible to negotiate with other promotions if the other big names and champions are on the other side. It's funny how Showtime trying to sell Tank as a 5-time world champion. His only division where he held a real belt was at 130. Devin Haney holds all the real belts at 135 hence he is called undisputed. Josh Taylor was also the undisputed champ at 140 when Tank moved up in 1 fight against Mario Barrios.",

Just imagine that, if Davis lost this one, for sure the Ryan fight will be scrap as the hype will die down.

So all his belts is just secondary, for hard core fans, we all know that, but for casual, perhaps they could sell it that way.",

Meanwhile, Garcia is a +1100 underdog, which means you’d earn a $1,100 payday on a $100 wager",

Lol  easy money again for the team especially mayweather.. I'm not saying that the opponent is weak, and i know there's a possibility that Hector can survive but i dont believe he can defeat the tank on this match it impossible IMO.",

The fight, which Davis must win to move onto the planned April 15 bout vs. Garcia (Ryan), will be a Showtime PPV, according to a source, and will be contested at 135 pounds rather than 130 for Garcia's title.https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/35048076/ryan-garcia-gervonta-davis-agree-catchweight-showdownWell, it says here that Tank Davis should have a win in his first bout versus Hector (his debut in 135 lbs.) so that his fight with Ryan Garcia will go through afterwards. Now, that time frame is too short to prepare for a fight with Hector Garcia, don't know which they're underestimating between the two Garcia's because the fight schedule is just too close with each other with just only 2 months of preparation.",

Either way, Hector Luis Garcia would still get some paycheck, and win or lose, depending on his performance, he can say that he fought with one of the current greats in boxing, and that might even give him some openings on other good title shots.",
