The game is similar to Tetris and Sudoku, and is available on the THNDR mobile gaming platform. THNDR has also announced the Gaming Graph, a reputation and badging system that will allow players to earn badges that are tied to their identity and can be transferred to other ecosystems.“The launch of Bitcoin Blocks marks an important milestone in the development of THNDR's mobile gaming platform,” the press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine states. The game is the first to showcase THNDR's social competitive layer and features, which include Leagues, THNDR's leveling system that pits community members against each other.Gaming Graph will serve as a badging and reputation system for players that is easily transferable to other environments and clients, including Nostr. Through Cameri’s NIP-58, as players advance through THNDR Leagues and achieve gaming milestones, badges will be issued to their Nostr pubkey and tied to their identity, allowing users to build a virtual reputation. These established reputations built in THNDR games may have merit or value in other communities.“We're thrilled to add Bitcoin Blocks to the THNDR platform and continue our mission of spreading Bitcoin adoption through play,” Desiree Dickerson, THNDR CEO, explained. “By combining two familiar classics - Tetris and Sudoku - we hope to reach new users traditionally underrepresented in gaming and financial access and introduce them to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Blocks marks a major milestone for THNDR, as it showcases the first of many social, competitive features on the platform.\"THNDR plans to continue rolling out competitive gaming and social features to the platform throughout the year. The company’s most recent title “Club Bitcoin: Solitaire,” has become the highest ranking bitcoin game of all time, reaching #21 in the U.S. App Store, according to THNDR.https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/thndr-games-releases-new-game-to-earn-bitcoin....Interesting:QuoteTHNDR plans to continue rolling out competitive gaming and social features to the platform throughout the year.

Just after learning about this here at the moment without hesitation I downloaded the app and start rolling on already and in no time playing the game I was rewarded with w 4 sats already.Surely a game of  diverse interests  where you have fun, you learn , test to trust your investing strategies in the competitive marketing and of course still earns you profitable rewards alongside.",

      "body": "I did not like those games, but in my opinion the principle is the same. Instead of watching advertisements or the complications of adding a bank account to withdraw your profits from the games, users can now buy and sell gems using Bitcoin, although I do not know how the licenses for creating such systems or the judicial complications will be ignored. I hope that they will succeed and that they will not use the word Bitcoin just to attract customers’ attention, but rather as a real application for payments without the need for banking systems.",

A forward-thinking approach was taken by THNDR. I have heard of \" Club Bitcoin: Solitaire\", which is ranked #21 in the U.S. App Store though I am having a hard time finding it in my region. This is really a bold approach that creates a unique space for them in the Bitcoin-centric gaming universe. Instead of using a bank or other 3rd party platform users can withdraw their profit in bitcoin which is less costly and convenient.",

But regardless, I find the idea worthwhile to “spread Bitcoin adoption through gaming” a really attractive one, that could attract hundreds of players around the world who love these popular classic games.But in my opinion, saying that these games help adoption is an exaggeration, because these players will aim primarily for profit and entertainment in the second place, and they will not care much about adoption.",
