Obviously it would have been better through escrow no doubt. However I clearly state how I do business. I’m honestly trying to do business here and it’s disappointing to see this is my first impression to the community on this site.",

      "body": "If you don’t like my service that’s fine but ridiculing me like this is disheartening. I’m trying to provide a honest service. Also you haven’t caught anything I simply deleted my Telegram as I’m not offering this service anymore. It’s the best way of doing it as you can’t delete post on this website unless you contact a moderator and that takes time (currently waiting) and most people prefer escrow. You come off as a real jerk in this situation.",

      "body": "my service is as is, you were never scammed and I never had intentions of scamming anyone. You disliked my service and made a big deal about it. Escrow is clearly the best way of exchanging currency , so I deleted my Telegram and requested one of the mods to delete this post as I’m no longer offering this service. Now you think you’re onto something… It’s really not that deep. Sorry for wasting your time, this is my last post.",
