I have never understood these people who keep accumulating during their lifetime to leave nothing to their relatives when they die, like Buffet.The bad thing about this “donation”, if it is like Satoshi, is that in the end it will be necessary to make a change in the protocol to allow subdivisions beyond satoshis, with all the bitcoins lost and the foreseeable appreciation.It would also be nice to know of the distinction Michael Saylor bitcoins vs bitcoins that Michael Saylor owns through MSTR shares. If when he dies he has no heirs I would imagine his shares would go on to appreciate the rest? I recently bought some myself by the way.",

Bitcoins that are valued at 17 billion USD today, will be a lot more when Saylor is gone! So it will be excellent for the humanity. But unfortunately, greedy politicians will take their cuts from this immense amount of wealth before it reaches to the humanity. I honestly like this idea of giving away wealth to the humanity instead of passing it to the next generation. Majority of the billionaires do not think that way. Otherwise the world would have been a very different place today!",

Is it not surprising that wikipedia doesn't have any of those information? Because I checked (or maybe I didn't check well). Wiki usually contains someone's general information from the majority I've seen, but Michael saylor's information talks more about his business and career.Quote from: PremiumcryptoHub on October 22, 2024, 02:50:23 PMMicrostrategy CEO Michael Saylor is one of the world's largest bitcoin holders.

Just like Satoshi left a million Bitcoin to the universe, so I’m leaving whatever I’ve got to the civilization,”.These are quite some interesting statements that's coming from him, but not sure if he is actually leaving those Bitcoin as a donation or lost coins that won't be accessed again. In satoshi's case, it was more of like lost coins, which I think saylor should have been more specific. Making such statement feels like there isn't anyone close to him that understands Bitcoin that much, because I guess he would have preferred to leave such fortune to someone like that.",

He’s not too old to Father a child with a younger woman, maybe he still has time. I am surprised that Michael Saylor dont have a child. This kind of decision not to have any heir is popular in most developed nations. In my country having children is almost compulsory for everyone. The rich who cannot have children naturally usually seek other means to have successors. But that's his decision and we have to respect it. Satoshi left his fortune in wallets and didn't donate it to any charity. I hope this is not the path Micheal is following. It will be better for him to give the funds to people who need it. There is an increase in refugees, sicknesses and natural disaster victims that need such donations. I observe that people donate to medical courses if they fall sick, maybe this could make him donate to research and development of drugs and vaccines.",

However, i don't see any reason why Saylor wouldn't want to pass down any of his coins to anyone, even if he stays unmarried until death and has no heirs, he can work on a way to pass it down to charity or any good cause, but it is his money anyway.",
