What factors do you consider to be satisfied and to stick with the game plan all the time?Lost all of the money I've planned to spend on gambling in one game of dice because I was frustrated and the other opponents are taunting me and are being annoying so I just dump all of the money in one go and then it's gone, just like that. That moment was so heartbreaking to me at that time because I was trying to learn how to discipline myself in terms of being stoic and not giving in to outside pressure and so I promised myself (again) to never do that kind of shit again.For me, as my story have included are the factors of emotions and the people that's around you, emotion is going to be a big problem especially if you are easily influenced by it and so your action suffers like what happened to me, I let the instigation and annoyance to drive me to go all in in just one game. The other factor which is peer pressure or just the influence of people around you is a big problem because you're under the impression that you need to impress them and that if there's a challenge being issued, you have to save face so the people around you don't see you as a sissy or a coward.",

Just bet with it like you can win it lose or the way that you want and enjoy gambling. This is what I am doing and I am not going beyond it which would be unhealthy for me. I am not expecting to make money from gambling anymore.",

Increasing your bankroll doesn't guaranteed your winnings instead how skillful are you while choosing and selecting your games, it could be a single bet but if the predicted game plays according then you keep winning it's better to win little than increase your wager and lose higher amount.",

      "body": "It's okay, friends, because everyone sometimes makes mistakes when they lose and follow emotional urges to continue gambling. This is what we usually experience as gamblers. If we ask how we can be disciplined in managing money, it's actually easy to say but it's really difficult to do, in fact. This is just a matter of being busy, if you don't have anything else to do, find something else to do and focus on a certain time to gamble.For example, every working day I never open a casino site and let alone gamble except on holidays. At first I also had difficulty but over time I got used to it by slowly reducing my gambling activities so I became more disciplined in managing my finances and time to gamble, for example I had to spend $100 every week make sure you have to spend it or win above that, always remember to use unused money or money you normally use to find entertainment, so when you experience a loss there will be no urge to chase to recover it. just think of gambling as entertainment",

Personally, I'm not very disciplined, but I'm good at giving advice, so the phrase ' it's easier said than done' really hits me big time in gambling.The question is how to...?The only answer to that is to learn how to control your emotions. You shouldn't allow them to dictate more than your mind; otherwise, you can't beat the casino at that.",

The problem on this is your total bankroll is not suitable to the type of gambling experience you are looking for.It’s like you want a 50$ profit on single bet while your bankroll is just a 100$ or less. The best way to deal with this is try to learn on adjusting your profit expectations based on your bankroll so that you will not overextend your bets out of your bankroll range. I control this problem by not playing when I really urge on gambling and play while I’m cool and not thinking of winning too much.",

And also on the other hand as we know that something in gambling that can make a gambler addicted because of the extraordinary sensation when they manage to win a large amount according to them.You've done something better, my friend, because we should not make gambling activities such as a place for many problems to arise for ourselves. You have done a good thing by organizing everything so that it runs in balance, yes it is better for us to bet on bets that are not too high risk even though in the end it may still require luck factors such as sports betting that you do lately rather than slot machines or other similar, because of course you say the actual fact that games like slot machines are very testing mentally and psychologically, when we lose then usually there will be a lot of temptations that come that like telling us to play again. Managing bangkroll is very difficult especially if we have entered gambling, but you can do it slowly.",

      "body": "I think the principles of gambling are similar between it and any risk-based activity. For example the principles of trading without taking unbalanced risks are very well documented and generally respected in the community. These principles are pretty simple and easily understood.For instance, you should consider that gambling any amount means that it could result in the total loss of this amount. So based on that, only a portion of your steady income should be risked with such activities. Let's say you make 300$ per week. After expenses like rent, bills and various other smaller things, maybe you can put aside 50$Of the money you put aside you should also keep some for emergencies. So the self-imposed limits should be to never gamble more than 50$ a week, and ideally even less. For instance if you already have a decent savings account, gambling with all the 50$ you put aside in a week won't do much harm to you for one week. But especially if you don't putting money aside should be a priority so the gambling spending should be reduced. To adapt the above example to your personal income, you can simply take an average of how much you can put aside each week from 3 or more months, and then put a hard limit to how much you will be gambling with.",

Lol, is there anything like that? Hell no! All games are 50-50% and you just have to make decisions based on what you believe in. What I see in this your comment is a typical explanation of someone who is chasing their loses and that's a very dangerous habit as far as gambling is concerned. When you're chasing losses, you're allowing your emotions to control your decisions and this can lead to poor results. Instead of focusing on trying to make up for your losses, you should just try to focus on the process of improving your gambling skills.Op, in your case you need self control and discipline. No matter how many times or how perfect your bankroll management is, if you can not discipline yourself and abide by it then there's no need to set it up in the first place. You just have to make up your mind and say hey I will stop here and let it the decision stands no matter what.",

So after my cash out the other team equalized the goal and the match ended in 1:1 which still resulted in x that I selected,  but due to poor bankroll management I withdrew the available bankroll without having a thought of what the possibility was even though the games were still at 60+ minutes. But then,  lesson leant and we move to the next bet.",

Start from betting small and increase your bet while you are winning. This is the best way to increase your bet amount for your own entertainment without risking all your bankroll at once.The problem on typical gambler was they increased bet amount when they are losing that’s why their bankroll is easily depleted while betting the same amount or decrease bet amount when winning which is the biggest mistake on riding profit. Learn how increase bankroll during your profit streak so that you can increase your bet while still on the range of safe bet proportion to your bankroll.",

Gambling should be for fun and not to put your finances in jeopardy, if you start finding it difficult to manage your bankroll, you can take a break from gambling and try out other fun activities. Yes, it may be easy for you to do, but we have to see in general that there are many people who have difficulty in managing their finances, especially when they are involved in gambling. Although what you are doing is very appropriate and it seems like there is no problem at all in doing it, but not everyone can do it even though we have suggested it as hard as possible. The problem is in the mindset, if only they had the mindset like you who gamble just for fun then they would not be likely to have difficulty in terms of management, that's one of them.Basically, limiting or reducing is what every gambler is better off doing in terms of budgeting for gambling, lucky enough for people who don't have high  hopes and aren't really interested in gambling, because then they will have a good balance in their finances. Yes that's right, the fact is that there  are still a lot of other things that are quite fun and not risky, but whatever everyone has the freedom to choose whatever they want even without careful consideration, it's really out of our control.",
