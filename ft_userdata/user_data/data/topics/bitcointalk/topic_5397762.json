  "content": "EDIT: Idea got well executed. Price reached $20,830.   Bitcoin 2018 vs 2022:In this chart, you can clearly see how Bitcoin fell almost 40% on every sell signal on MACD.As you can see on the left, 2018 had 3 signals from ATH, 2 Sells and 1 Buy.Something similar has happened now with Bitcoin: 3 Signals, 2 Sells and 1 Buy.I am expecting another 40% drop in the price and will call that bottom of the cycle.Let's see how it executes in upcoming weeks.",

My prediction is something like $25,000 as the absolute bottom of this cycle. $69,420 was the top, which was not a blow off top.

I don't want to argue with others who think that we can bounce back to $40k-$50k before the end of the year because for me it's not going to happen.So it's better to preach buying the dip right now, maybe we can see $25k or even our previous ath of $20k in 2017 that could be the absolute bottom for me.",

So it's going to be very difficult for the price to have a good bounce this 2022.",

Right now there are more investors (especially institutional ones), more traders, more merchants, more social promoters, more gamblers... All these factors contribute for raising the support level of bitcoin, so we can expect smoother and smoother corrections along the time. 40% looks too much considering those currently market conditions.So far bitcoin has dropped about 14% since the last stable price in the 39,000$'s range. Next days must be decisive.However, things can get really bad for bitcoin once US Federal Reserve increases interest rates again (it's expected). On that case I believe a sharp correction could happen leading bitcoin to the mentioned 40% decline in price, although it's a real chaotic possibility, worst of the cases.",
