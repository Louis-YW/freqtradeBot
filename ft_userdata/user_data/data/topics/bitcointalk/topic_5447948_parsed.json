In the country where I live (Indonesia), we have seen adoption increasing year by year, until by 2022 it is estimated that around 12 million people (4.5% of the population) have adopted crypto [1]. Different from 1 year earlier which was at 7.2 million people (2.66% of the population) [2].I still firmly believe that eventually, the big men in the mainstream media will also adopt crypto, and then there will be no more fear and misinformation spreading.References:[1] https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-indonesia-2022/[2] https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-indonesia-2021/",

Certainly they would prefer to well known money saving such as bank since they also mention it at school, on how does it work and etc. Bitcoin doesn't get the recognition it deserves, some schools doesn't even enlighten youngster about the powerful impact of Bitcoin, only few schools around the world that acknowledged Bitcoin as a subject. Since it might be complicated for them to teach it at schools. Also many people prefer centralized system as they give them assurance and security for their funds unlike to the decentralized (Bitcoin) which is open to fraud and scams. The volatility the Bitcoin holds also hinder them to acknowledge it as they only think Bitcoin as an complicated alternate currency. If you ask people in here about Bitcoin, majority would think it as a \"scam\" or \"complicated system\" which is true because you would need a prior knowledge in this industry.",

Now the problem is a misperception in various circles of society who consider all events against altcoins to be the point of destruction of bitcoin, as before MT.gox from that day many said that bitcoin would die and there was a lot of Fud and propaganda being carried out to bring down bitcoin, and I admit that it has become a culture of the crypto market and that causes extreme polarity in bitcoin.I think it's only natural that more people are still investing in bitcoin because most people still believe that bitcoin will come back and take them even higher. bitcoin became an escape for the failure of banks in America which caused attention and trust to shift towards bitcoin.",

If someone invests it's saving earned as a salary or basically earned outside the crypto world he/ she will obviously repent investing when he loses money because this isn't how traditional savings and investment works.

Negative news released by the media will not be able to kill bitcoin and even if the government tries to stir up this kind of thing to stop it.Keep calm and buy to the best of your ability, because we are about to see a much bigger future for bitcoin now and in the future.

This declaration of an attack thereof is already a move against the reputation of bitcoin in the country, coz in the minds of those who are none the wiser when it comes to crypto, the attacks are justified and must therefore be necessary. There's criticisms which of course is integral to the growth and development of this industry, as those just give us newer ways to improve upon and add features that are never before seen, and there are blatant attacks.",

I hear ya when you say people are wary of investing in Bitcoin, even though it's got mad potential benefits. It's true - the media is always spreading negative vibes about it, saying it's too risky. That's not always the case.You gotta get informed, bro, and understand the risks and rewards of investing in Bitcoin. Yeah, it's had some wild swings, but in the long run, it's been nothing but gains, with some major price growth. And guess what? The experts predict that Bitcoin's value is only gonna go up in the future. So, don't be a sheep, dude - invest in Bitcoin like a boss!Now, about the government's warning about scams - yeah, there are some unscrupulous characters out there. But plenty of legit folks and companies still use Bitcoin for legitimate investment and payment purposes.My advice? Don't let fear or negative hype stop you from potentially benefiting from Bitcoin's growth. Learn all you can, assess your risk tolerance and investment goals, and make an informed decision.",
