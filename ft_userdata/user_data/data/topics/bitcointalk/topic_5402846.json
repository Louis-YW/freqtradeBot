  "content": "After the hack Bitfinex didn't close they carried on. The stolen bitcoins were $71 million. When Lichtenstein and Morgan got arrested 6 years after it's $4.5 billion. The couple's trying a plea bargain that's why they didn't show in court on June 3rd. Ilya ‘Dutch’ Lichtenstein's in jail. Heather ‘Razzlekhan’ Morgan's under house arrest. They're back to court on August 2nd.What's going on with the plea bargain if they've recovered all the Bitcoins it isn't needed. I'm confused is Bitfinex getting back all 119,754 bitcoin worth Billions or just $71 million?",

It seems strange that wasn't part of the initial deal for a plea bargain if they held on to the funds and used those as a negotiating tool (though that might not have worked - withholding 10% though might).",

A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Quote from: arabspaceship123 on June 16, 2022, 12:27:39 PMI'm confused is Bitfinex getting back all 119,754 bitcoin worth Billions or just $71 million?That's between the DOJ and Bitfinex, unless the court decides that the bitcoins have to be returned to the ones owning them at the moment of the hack, the customers, and thus voiding bitfinex repayment scheme all of them will go to the exchange. From there it will be customers vs bitfinex and it will have nothing to do with the two above.",

It seems strange that wasn't part of the initial deal for a plea bargain if they held on to the funds and used those as a negotiating tool (though that might not have worked - withholding 10% though might). The American legal system's strange, strange. It's easy getting criminally convicted it's easy avoiding jail. They've traded plea bargains in famous high profile cases before it's happening in crocodile of wall street.Quote from: stompix on June 16, 2022, 12:55:57 PMThey are not trialed for the hack but for conspiracy to commit money laundering and defraud the statehttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency .They're connected. Even if they didn't carry out the hack they've laundered money. If you're laundering $71 million or $4.5 billions it ends with criminals jailed. How's their plea bargain getting them safe from jail I think it's getting them less sentencing time. If plea bargain succeeds they're going to be old when they get out.Quote from: arabspaceship123 on June 16, 2022, 12:27:39 PMI'm confused is Bitfinex getting back all 119,754 bitcoin worth Billions or just $71 million?Quote from: stompix on June 16, 2022, 12:55:57 PMThat's between the DOJ and Bitfinex, unless the court decides that the bitcoins have to be returned to the ones owning them at the moment of the hack, the customers, and thus voiding bitfinex repayment scheme all of them will go to the exchange.

If Bitfinex customers got funded back on Bitfinex expenses those Bitcoins belong to Bitfinex. What was Bitfinex repayment scheme?",

I'm confused is Bitfinex getting back all 119,754 bitcoin worth Billions or just $71 million?The crime still took place, it doesn't make any mention that they helped in recovery of the coins - police seizing their devices might have been able to retrieve this without their help. The value of the bitcoins is somewhat relevant, because customers might not have been able to cash out when they wanted to at a much higher value. You should not have sympathy for them, as they planned to get away from this and did not hand the money back after taking some altruistic view of life. They should be punished on the basis that they would have kept hold of the money if they were not traced and slowly cashed it out to fund a lavish lifestyle, they were caught because they were terrible at moneylaundering.",
