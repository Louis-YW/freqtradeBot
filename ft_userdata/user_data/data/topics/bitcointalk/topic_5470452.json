  "content": "If I receive a transaction from four different people at the same time, are these transactions going to be received by different nodes? The order will be different. So, in my opinion, mining nodes will include them in various blocks, and their hash rate and nonce will differ. So, I have a question: Is it normal for bitcoin transactions to result in blocks that include completely varied orders of transactions that were generated by various nodes? The only thing that I think matters is the correct number required for proof of work (and if it is found, then the block is going to be accepted by other nodes), and perhaps in terms of the number of transactions contained in them.",

      "body": "Once a transaction is broadcasted it is received by each nodes and they create a candidate block and add this transactions into the candidate in order they see fit, there is no actual arrangement required except that in case of dependent blocks where parents transactions comes before child transactions, or probably based on transaction fee which is not a protocol. So if all this transaction are ahead to one miners candidate block and the four transactions sent to you happen to fall in the block, if the miner gets the right nonce first then his block get added to blockchain after been verified by other nodes. In simple term there is no prescribed protocol way to arranged a transaction except if one transaction depends on the order and the parent transaction gets added first, nothing more than the miner adding any of the transaction he pleases and as we know miner’s priorities that base on fees",

It's not that each transaction goes to a mempool of different node. Once you broadcast a transaction, it's propagated to the network and almost all nodes will receive that. If you received four transactions, almost all nodes will probably receive all those four transaction. Quote from: AYOBA on October 15, 2023, 06:11:54 PMSo, in my opinion, mining nodes will include them in various blocks, and their hash rate and nonce will differ. Miners prioritize transactions based on their fee rate and it's possible that a miner include all those four transactions in the same block. Quote from: AYOBA on October 15, 2023, 06:11:54 PMIs it normal for bitcoin transactions to result in blocks that include completely varied orders of transactions that were generated by various nodes? Again, transactions are prioritize based on their fee rate. Assuming the fee rate of transaction A is higher than the fee rate of transaction B, transaction A will be probably confirmed in the same block than transaction B or earlier. Quote from: Zaguru12 on October 15, 2023, 06:43:41 PMOnce a transaction is broadcasted it is received by each nodes and they create a candidate block and add this transactions into the candidate in order they see fit, Not all nodes need to create a candidate block. Only mining pools and those who mine solo make candidate block.",

The first is the coinbase transaction which must be the first transaction and the dependent transactions which are considered as packages with the parent transaction verified first before the child transaction. The mining pool then pick transaction in terms of transaction fee from the of highest fee to the lowest including the packages. But this is not a protocol rule that must be obeyed because the transactions can be ordered in any way except the two cases I mentioned.",

Since nodes verify transactions in the order they have been placed in the block, if there's a parent and a child and a miner wants to include both of them in the same block, the parent must be placed before the child.",
