  "content": "One can safely assume that we are in an accumulation phase for the next 2 years now? Or can we expect some action in the next 2 years? Was the mid 2019 a mini bull run? Currently price is just peeking out the bottom of the \"Fire Sale\" blue band, is this gearing up for a mini run like in mid 2019? There are certainly features on display that might suggest this? A possible W formation since the June 17.6k low to now (though now confirmation yet), Fear + Greed is relatively on the fear side at 20, consolidation since early September... What do we think?I think it is human nature to prepare for the worst or try to look for the most complicated answer, when sometimes it's all there in front of us... For those of you who were looking at this chart in late 2019 or early 2020, what were you thinking?I can't upload pics but here is a link...https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/",

If by any chance you had read what is written under the chart, you might not have taken the whole thing so seriously QuoteThe Rainbow Chart is not investment advice! Past performance is not an indication of future results. The Rainbow Chart is meant to be be a fun way of looking at long term price movements, disregarding the daily volatility “noise”. The color bands follow a logarithmic regression (introduced by Bitcointalk User trolololo in 2014), but are otherwise completely arbitrary and without any scientific basis. In other words: It will only be correct until one day it isn’t anymore.",

I meant it is inaccurate but some models and some charts can be useful.However, you can not rely on anything that is just likely useful and likely accurate, you must have plans to protect your capital and your life if it is not correct and the market does not go well as you think.",

For example nobody could foresee the effects of the pandemic in 2020 on global economy and the effect of economy crashing on bitcoin price. Same as today.In my opinion we are indeed in an accumulation phase but next move depends on the global economy:If the economy continues crashing slowly like this there is a good chance that bitcoin starts reviving again. If economy stops crashing then the chance is higher.But if the economy sees a sudden big crash then bitcoin could be panic sold and crash too.",

It's far from being scientifically accurate and actually at least once the price was already out of the range. Actually current situation is also a bit out of the rainbow's expected price range.Quote from: thevoyager23 on October 23, 2022, 01:20:25 PMOne can safely assume that we are in an accumulation phase for the next 2 years now?No. Never assume anything.Quote from: thevoyager23 on October 23, 2022, 01:20:25 PMOr can we expect some action in the next 2 years?Because of the halving, some price action is to be expected.

Even within the rainbow, there is plenty of room for ups and downs, and yet not everything fits neatly in. You can also look at more conventional price charts (such as here on Coingecko)to see that there's no objective rainbow there. As Lucius quoted, it's not even meant to be taken seriously.

Leaving aside the models and charts that we use for speculation as a form of entertainment, buying and holding bitcoin will remain profitable in the future because of its unique, decentralised and finite supply nature.
