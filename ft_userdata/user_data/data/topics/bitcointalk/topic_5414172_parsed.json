  "content": "Hello everyone,I have a question and i know that you have the answer I noticed that exchange like Binance for example apply a withdrawal flat fee of 0.0002 BTC (≈ 3-4 USD). I was wondering how they determine this amount because network fee is not fixed.For example if tomorrow the network has lot of activities maybe the average of fee will be something like ≈30 USD so transaction with 0.0002 could take days to be completed. So if this scenario is during for weeks they will update they fee manually ? Maybe they have a periodic review (each quarter ?) of flat fee ?Thanks for you answers !",

      "body": "Most exchanges that use flat fees like that review it periodically and adjust things. There's a lot of exchanges that use fees that vary depending on what the best fee is at the time (they might also go slightly higher to ensure things get confirmed - I've not had a problem with coinbase for example when they set their fees based off the market).I think people will complain about both because on one you can expect to pay the same fee for a while and on the other you can spontaneously pay more or less but you're paying what the network demands and not the exchange.",

      "body": "They would most probably check the trend on fee over a period of time e.g. 2 weeks and adjust from there. I notice this when using a local exchange. Their fees change every 2 weeks and they try to keep it as close to the minimum as possible without having to shoulder anything and still get the transaction confirmed within the next block. It's not like they decide these things arbitrarily and just pick a number that they feel like. That $3-$4 already has a huge buffer on it to make sure that all transactions with more bytes can still get some confirmation within the next block.",
