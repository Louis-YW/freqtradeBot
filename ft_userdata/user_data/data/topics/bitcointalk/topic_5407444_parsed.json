  "content": "The modden team plans to create a united community, without competition, where we all support each other and make ourselves known. For this reason, taking advantage of the launch of our forum, we would like to offer the first 100 projects that submit their application the option of being able to advertise for free on our forum. Specifically, we offer the possibility of enabling a space in the forum where you can create a thread of your community and share your links, attract new users and be in contact with other projects. In addition, once the registration period is closed, we will add a space in our forum to publish a banner of your project (free) for a period of 3 to 4 months. Finally, note that we are launching a space on our website dedicated to sales and services. The objective is to put professionals in our field, whether they are designers, moderators, marketing agents, developers, consultants, etc... in contact with all those projects or members that need their services.The only thing we ask from the Modden team is that in order to be able to list for free on the forum, you spread the word on your main channels and share our website/forum https://modden.io/Thank you very much for your attention and your time.",
