  "content": "Hi everyone, I'm sorry that this is my first post, but I'm desperate about this issue and ledger staff does not answer yet.Until May 20th, I had 0.7259 BTC in my ledger nano s, I took a screenshot because I was doing a blog.Img from May 18th:https://i.ibb.co/ccGLcwr/2022-05-18.pngImg from May 20th:https://i.ibb.co/chX3yZH/2022-05-20.pngI opened my ledger on Aug 1st and everything was normal, I don't have a screenshot from that day.Today I open my ledger and now I have only 0.4 BTChttps://i.ibb.co/ynJqrzz/Captura-de-pantalla-de-2022-08-08-14-33-11.pngAnd as you can see in the transactions, the last deposit I made was on May 9thI tried to remove cache from ledger, reset my device and nothing works... do you know why is that or any idea about it?Thanks in advance.",

Maybe you find something Ledger Live is missing.(Edit: Electrum shows by default mBTC, you may want to change in Tools->Preferences to BTC to avoid further confusion)",

      "body": "I was wondering when someone will appear who will have problems with the balance in a negative sense, considering that until now it has always been the opposite situation. However, it seems that the OP cannot solve his problem with clearing the cache, so he will have to listen to the previous two tips and see what the blockchain shows and whether Electrum will show the correct balance.From everything shown, it doesn't seem like it's a hack, because then the balance would be 0. For a possible fix for Ledger Live, I would completely remove it (including all its files), and then download the latest version.",

For a possible fix for Ledger Live, I would completely remove it (including all its files), and then download the latest version.I am not a Ledger wallet user but I have seen many complaints Ledger users had in the past which they brought up on this forum like displaying of zero balance or just like this one with incomplete balance. They were easily solved by clearing up the cache and it will work just fine and the accurate balance would be seen. If andrew185 is having more coins other than bitcoin, he may not like to use different wallet software with his Ledger hardware wallet and just prefer Ledger Live for it as it supports many cryptocurrencies. Because of that, he can just go for your advice. But if having just bitcoin, it would be better to just download Electrum wallet to avoid such cache error. I am very surprised this time that clearing up cache did not even work.",

Also, make sure before doing ANYTHING you have your seed words backed up safely and securely. On the off chance that while doing other things with the LL software something else 'burps' in the device you want to make sure you have a good backup.The odds of it are so low as to be zero but why take the chance, there is already something not right with the software don't want to find out it did something wonky and reset the device.-Dave",

Have you checked your addresses on blockchain explorer? This is the only way to be completely sure of how much BTC you actually have in your wallet.",

No seed words are imported in the Ledger Live. I am sure you know that, you just didn't express yourself very well. Even after the user reinstalls Ledger Live, there is no need to enter seed words in the hardware device. They are in there until he resets his device to factory settings.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on August 10, 2022, 11:27:18 AMAlso note that Ledger Live is showing your native segwit account only. Have you checked your legacy or your nested segwit accounts too? That's true, but the first screenshot shows that particular account is supposed to hold 0.72 BTC.@OPDid you ever have 0.7 BTC in your \"Hold bitch\" account in the past or didn't you? The third screenshot doesn't show any outgoing transactions. And there are only 3 incoming transactions. It really shouldn't be difficult to remember if you made more transactions. We aren't talking about hundreds of them. If you connected your wallet to Electrum and it shows the same balance with no outgoing transaction as Ledger Live, then it's correct. The 0.72 BTC might be the glitch. One software (Ledger Live) can have a bug and display a wrong balance, but it's unlikely that a second one does it as well. Maybe the difference is in one of your other BTC accounts because you seem to have a few judging by the screenshot of your portfolio.",
