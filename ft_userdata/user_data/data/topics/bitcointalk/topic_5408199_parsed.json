Also my 1.5 Ghsh when the Ethereum mining will end agrees on this,I have near 1.1 Ghsh in ETC 4 GB cards and near 400 Mhsh in Ethereum with cards from 8 GB to 16 GB.Hopefully we will hit it right when the time comes and ETC will be a safe haven for all of us.I think that whatever amount of crypto we make daily for the longer run I am sure we will all be in huge profit.Patience is key in this crypto winter.",

Its the demand I think will be the problem because afaik there is not much tokens created on top of ETC chain. I can't remember the last ICO token on ETC posted in the forum.They should be developing more or a migration system making it easy to switch tokens of ETH to ETC.",

They figured many <4GB could be mining and secure the network. So this is why they forked to a lower DAG.The algo however was also changed and the original Antminer ETH asics couldn't mine it until months later when some firmware fix was released. If they wanted to keep ASICs on, they wouldn't of made this drastic change.",

ETC is the original Blockchain from ETH - ETH forked away in 2016. ETC has max cap, block reward reduction every year, but has implemented all updates like ETH. ETC is in the Top 20 back again.ETC forked to the ETChash algo to get more hashrate into the network after the hacks in 2020 - the ETC community want ASIC´s in the network to secure it!!!!! Is really nobody understanding how important ETC is and what is possible? ETC is the 3. biggest network after BTC and ETH",
