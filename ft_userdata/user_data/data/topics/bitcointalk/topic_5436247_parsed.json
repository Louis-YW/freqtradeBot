NVIDIA announced its official cost – $6800. That is 46% more expensive than the predecessor of the Ampere generation. It’s also 4.25 times more expensive than the gaming flagship GeForce RTX 4090.https://videocardz.comhttps://technewsspace.com/nvidia-starts-selling-the-rtx-a6000-ada-generation-graphics-card-for-professionals-costs-6800/",

      "body": "Those brutal stats and performance and only 300 Watt power consumption,sounds like the perfect card to run it all.There is a big limitation though in this card for everyone of us here in the forum and I believe that to be the price of near 7000 dollars,I am sure every miner and every normal user can use that amount of money in a much better and wise way than just buying a single card.Hopefully the 4090 ti will be in those lines but I doubt it as the 4090 ti will not be higher than near 2000 dollars in total.One thing is sure though,despite the time we are in,Nvidia is continuing with their really high prices for video cards.",
