I have tried for longer than i will admit to move funds or export keys... and upon the export it crashes. It indicates its sync'd to the current date there but i think its false as it never completes and always cycles and then crashed into a pile of burning crap.  I tried a key export again only running that and it disappears after so often...  see picI read somewhere i need to compile and run X-server also for this ... is there anyone who can suggest something perhaps?  i am at the end of my rope with it.Yes i did ask the devs awhile back on github about this crashing and the response was not something helpful   yes i know its alot of little nothings...",

      "body": "From the above screenshot we can see that your electrum is synchronizing. Let the wallet synchronize itself first (allow 10-20mins depending on your internet connection speed) and try again. Also, you should upgrade it to the latest version 4.3.3 from the official website since you are using an older version as seen by your screenshot. Older versions might have few unsolved bugs.",

      "body": "I don't think there is any solution to this. The way Electrum wallet is designed, it is not made for such gigantic number of keys/transactions! The wallet file is a simple JSON that loads into the memory and it is not normal either to have nearly 100k keys in the wallet.You should use another wallet like core that handles wallets as a database not a simple JSON file.",

With that balance, I would continue working offline!I'm curious: how did you get to this point? I see many dust transactions from last year.Quote from: nc50lc on January 14, 2023, 05:06:43 AMRun Electrum offline, remove the password (leave \"New Password\" blank) and open the wallet file as text.The keys should be listed there under \"keystore\", import them by batch per wallet this time.All the more reason to do this offline. And start by making another backup of your wallet file before doing this.After exporting the keys, I'd import them all into Bitcoin Core. You should be able to do that from the command prompt, and when done let Bitcoin Core update it's wallet. From what I've read, it should be able to handle that many keys without problems.You may want to read my topic on consolidating small inputs to save on transaction fees.",
