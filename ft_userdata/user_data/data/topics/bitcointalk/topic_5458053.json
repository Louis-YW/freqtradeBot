  "content": "Hello,I am really disappointed and surprised about what Rollbit did to me yesterday. I had been betting on their sportsbook since about 3 months without any problems, having multiple deposits and payouts processed succesfully. Then suddenly a couple days ago I could not bet anymore as I had a message saying I needed to fulfill KYC. So I did, I uploaded my ID card and some selfies. And then when I checked back a couple hours later to see if it had been verified by now, my account was disabled and I could no longer log in. So I asked per email for a clarification and they said that my account was \"permanently disabled for sportsbook abuse\".This is how the conversation went:Me: QuoteHello,My account is disabled. I submitted my verification a couple hours ago and now I suddenly cannot log in anymore?Please tell me what is wrong and what other documents or verification you might need from me.Rollbit:QuoteHey!What error are you seeing upon login?Lunr,Rollbit Support TeamLunrRollbitMe:Quote\"account disabled, please contact support\"And this while a couple hours ago I could still log in and I did the verification. Made a photo of both sides of my ID card and several selfies with my face pointing a different side each time. And now I check back to see if it was verified and I suddenly cannot log in anymore. Very weird.Rollbit:QuoteYour account is permanently banned for breaching our terms and conditions.LunrRollbitMe:QuoteWhat conditions did I breach then? I am very surprised to hear this.Also, why is this only the case after my verification? Is there something wrong with the document I verified?Please explain to me.Rollbit:QuoteYou were banned for sportsbook abuse.You aren't permitted to create accounts in the future and your account will remain locked indefinitely.LunrRollbitMe:QuoteWhat kind of abuse? I have been a normal customer for several months. What is the absue? I really don't understand it.When did the \"abuse\" take place?Rollbit:QuoteUnfortunately, we cannot provide further details of this extended review. The account will remain locked for abuse.LunrRollbitMe:QuoteThis is absolutely rediculous. If there was abuse you should not have only noticed it after 3 months. You have every right to lock an account and close it, but not to confiscate the remaining balance of $410. If you transfer the remaining balance to my last used withdrawal address then it's fine, but if you dont then better be sure I will be opening a complaint about this on Bitcointalk forum and Askgamblers.comSo please let me know if you can transfer the remaining funds to my last used withdrawal address or not.One thing is for sure, I will never open an account at Rollbit.com anymore. That part is clear for me.Then Rollbit stopped answering and now I am here to warn you all against these filthy practices of Rollbit.comRollbit I invite you to defend yourself and come up with proofs if I really did something wrong.Explain to me why my action was fine for about 3 months and all was good and then suddenly out of the blue a couple days ago there was \"sportsbook abuse\"?And please also define what the supposed abuse was.Also let me know if you are willing to hand over this case to Askgamblers for them to judge independently, and then everyone can be sure of a fair outcome. If you are so sure I did clear abuse then you should not be scared to take this route.",

      "body": "Been seeing a few accusations about Rollbit lately. I am not saying they are all legitimate but reading this one particular recent scam accusation makes me feel like the support at times is not so helpful in providing the right answers.Though the problem was slightly different, in that scam accusation. Their forum representative helped sort out the issue that the support had earlier on ignored, making it to go on for many days. Perhaps you can try contacting Rollbit Razer",

From the conversation uploaded above, I think you @OP kept things simple and the support representative is working in accordance with there terms as well.As much as you might and I filled should know what terms you might have bridged, the gambling site isn’t trying to revile its particulate offense to avoid gamblers deriving means for  any pass.Even at that, I still fill it would be a lot more better to know and accept your offense.Again, confiscating reserves is always a part of this sort of punishment.I see Rollbit to be a reputable gambling platform on the forum and like Logfiles have rightly directed, you could as well seek help from there forum representative Rollbit Razer and you might be good.",

This would make it easy for third parties here to know if that person was really in the wrong, without them having to even reveal to us their investigation techniques.Just saying that “your account was closed because you went against our TOS” doesn't help. In fact, it makes things a little shady and destroys the casino's reputation. I already see 1 negative and 3 neutral reviews, suggesting the way issues are being resolved is not satisfactory, and this is not good for a casino that has taken their time and funds to market themselves here and grown over time.",

This is a clear evasion to attend on user case. Why they are so dodgy to release their findings on the reason for the breach of their ToS while they are discussing in private.I’m removing the possibility that OP breached the ToS but atleast care to give the full report on their findings to verify if their reason is valid since they disable account with balance intact on it.",

But lets come to think of this, how could a well known gambling site to have unleashed such act towards their user and what happened they don't want to reply you based on your error and where you have violated their terms and conditions.At least a fair casino should explain a bit of what you had done wrongly before finally put you in a pama ban where you no longer have access to operate or even to have your funds.",

Rollbit has been getting a lot of accusations lately, hopefully they clear this up and that most of them are fakes.If you read Razer's explanation, it was their sportsbook provider, Betby, who flagged OP's account first. Reading between lines from this info provided and OP's chat with Lunr, I think this is when OP got disabled but can still log in, performed KYC, and got banned as the nature of their KYC itself breached terms agreed by OP. So, there were two offenses that OP probably did, sport betting abuse that's flagged by Betby, and geoblock circumvention flagged by Rollbit's internal security team.I am sure I have no perfect knowledge how it works between a provider and bookie, but with the assumption above, it is not too far fetched to think that Betby did not inform Rollbit the reason they flagged OP, and/or, Rollbit did not chase this further as their own investigation bear result of another breach.As for why Lunr did not tell OP on their chat that OP was caught circumventing georestriction, it is quite established that customer support and security team is not exactly on a speed dial. With the amount of complaints made by customers, both legit and cheaters, on daily basis, I think it's quite easy to imagine how one or two inquiries from a complaining customers did not arrive or escalated to the security team for them to provide the reason behind the issue. Not that I am saying it's is a right practice, I am just trying to say that this is one of the benefit that the forum provide, another way to raise complaints where community manager like Razer can try to revisit and get clearer assesment of the issue by getting in touch with both departments.",
