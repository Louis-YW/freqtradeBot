  "content": "there is too much uncertainty and not enough innovation in the dex space, especially for gen1 dexs regarding regulation. dexs have reached a wall where little sets them apart. a race will begin to capitalize on tokenized assets and securities and this will require the winners to comply with regulation. there will eventually be a uniswap for any valuable asset you can imagine, swapping crypto for gold for shares for grain instantly. this expansion of assets available will bust through this wall, and those regulated few next gen dexs will see true glory as the hub for humankind's bankless financial system. the gen 1s like uniswap and 1inch have catching up to do, but it's not impossible that they will continue strong.search for the next generation of dexs/cexs with this vision. all I've come across are criminally underpriced. everybody knows it's coming but nobody is putting money in yet.",

I don't know what else to say, or whether the many who frequent this board can even comprehend the narrative, but take this as reinforcement that the narrative is yet to emerge, criminally underpriced, and absolute gold.",

      "body": "Decentralized exchange does not suppose to be regulated, if it is, there isn't any decentralization. And there won't be any platform that claims to be DEX to have tokenized assets or securities, if we look at tokenized stocks, most CEXs are handling it. It comes different with a platform like 1inch or Uniswap, etc, I don't think such kind of platform is going that way, to be registered as a formal and centralized entity.In another hand, if the regulation allows it, and some CEXs are able to forecast its profitability, it will likely to happen.",

      "body": "This is all about regulation right? Well the only thing that could be regulated is centralised exchanges, they are the biggest in this space too if we have to compare with liquidity and volume, do not worry about what could happen to decentralised platforms, Governments are only pretending to support the people through regulation, it's only for their own gains, take it or leave it.",

      "body": "I think there are two separate situations about the DeX first is that DeX meaning is a Decentralized Exchange meaning it should be free from manipulation and control by a central authority, and also DeX was created as an alternative for CeX or centralized exchange, But due to the changing crypto regulation and landscape, some DeXs are just followed and comply to the centralized authorities so they can continue to operate especially now that the crypto adoption is going to the mainstream DeX's has no choice but to comply the regulations or else they were shut down.",

But they will not be able to oppose the regulators, because this will greatly interfere with development.We can only hope that all services will not be regulated.",
