Not all debt is bad though. If the population is sustainable and is able to generate more workers and as long as the economy keeps up its pace, then some level of debt is sustainable. Most of the debt is internal anyways, owed by the American public. Eventually they'll catch on and recognize their government is generating more debt than they can pay off in many life times. It isn't possible to keep borrowing from people that haven't been born yet.",

The major advantage the us has over other countries as regards foreign debts is the debts are in the US currency ($). And all these foreign economists believe the US can just decide to print more bank notes and clear her debts most especially the internal debts, except there is a legislation that prohibits her to do so.",

The US has always been ranked first for the GDP in comparison with any other nation while over the time public debts will also matter. First, Japan has suffered from deflation so the whole increase was simply not happening.Second, why not compare them, Japan is a 5 trillion economy that ranks 3rd in the world with one of the highest GDP per capita, so what would be a real argument for not comparing them? Quote from: so98nn on December 28, 2022, 01:59:55 PMThe difference between Japan in 98 and US in 2022 is that, we have just crossed pandemic cycle. And? The point still stands, we have a country that has managed to get over a GDP-to-debt ratio of 200%  over 14 years and as you can see despite going through the same pandemic is still acting the same, actually welcoming inflation, which barely managed to hit 4% and is set to decline again.You do realize they have gone tough the 2000 recession,  the dot com bubble, the 2007 crisis, and the 2020 crash just like everyone else and we don't see the same panic of Japan collapsing? This shows just how biased the world is when just because they envy and hate the US they try to ignore how others have dealt with these issues for decades. Nigeria has a GDP-to-debt ratio of 20% Canada has exceeded 100% with consolidated debt, let's do a quick poll about where you would want to start a business or live  Quote from: so98nn on December 28, 2022, 01:59:55 PMSometime in future millions of peeps are going to withdraw their gratuity and provident funds from the government and it would intersection of chaos.Yeah, somewhere in the future which can be 1 month from now and 100 years, in which case I have to ask, do you honestly make your financial planning based on what might happen in 2060?",

Especially as we seem to see politicians getting more divided and bitter in recent years, when they should be about compromise and finding common ground to work together. At this point the huge number behind it is almost irrelevant, but I guess it does serve as a reminder occasionally that runaway debt is irresponsible and might sharpen the minds on places they can save money. Funnily enough America is in a rather unique position as the default reserve currency of the world so let's hope they don't throw it away by breaking that trust.",

Take for instance, I take a loan of $500 and after a year I pay back $300, that means I owe a debt worth $200. So if I take another loan of $1000, I'll be $1200 in debt. So if I pay of $500, my debt would be $700. Is this how state debt works?I'm asking this because every single country I've seen, their state debt just keeps increasing. Like they don't pay it off or something?  Why does it just keeps increasing at an alarming rate?For example, U.S debt was $16.05 trillion at the end of 2012, now we're talking  $31.4 trillion in 2023.

Countries around the world have taken steps to reduce their HODL stash of the US dollar, as an international reserve currency. As US debt has risen, smart and savvy players around the globe have reduced their exposure to a worst case scenario, incrementally.If the US defaults, those hit hardest will be the ones who didn't see it coming. Those who believed they were better off not following current events or the news. Who thought they were \"better off\" not knowing. This description covers millions of people. Perhaps even billions. Who would be caught unprepared and suffer significantly reduced standards of living. Is it fair to say bankrupt corporations often sell off assets at severely discounted prices? If the US defaults, its assets might likewise be sold, restructured or redistributed at huge discounts. The end result whatever it is, must be something most support.
