Just pursue creating a flag for him so he will be aware that all our eyes are on him. He can't just fool the newbies and fall on his trap, fool on himself but never do it to others most especially to those who are still new to their investments and have no ideas if he is telling the truth or not. Otherwise, if we let him keep doing that, he might think that the forum members are very easy to deceive, and we don't want that to happen.Obviously he won't be active here again because he is now caught on his modus operandi.",
