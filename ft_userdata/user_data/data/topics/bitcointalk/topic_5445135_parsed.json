It's true security is the most important if you're want to invest in Bitcoin, because if you lose all of your Bitcoin, there's no company or assurance will refund your stolen coins. Hardware wallet is not that expensive, it's around $100.",

Satoshis and bitcoins are pretty much like pounds and pences or any other denominations of money. So I'm not sure 'Satoshi owner' is a correct way of phrasing it. But I am happy that you, the op, managed to accumulate enough funds by gradually investing in Bitcoin, and I do agree that it's very important to take the wallet's security seriously.",

You should have written that in small letter, yes it's good to accumulate a small amount of Bitcoin every time you make some money, if you aren't in some rush to make money it will surely pay off, treat this as a way of saving for the future, the only thing you should avoid is buying at a higher price, since you always have very little to spare do not buy when the price is surging, always wait for some retracement, like you said, a little drop of water makes a mighty ocean, the cheaper Bitcoin is, the better for you.",

Don't wait until you own a lot of Bitcoin before you can take security seriously.Many people wouldn't have had the opportunity to. own Bitcoin if it was not divisible. It will take close to a decade of saving for me to own one bitcoin. So anybody that is looking down on Sats is doing that because of a lack of understanding. For low-income earners like me, the only way we can invest in bitcoin is to buy gradually. I don't joke with my sats because I bought them with my hard-earned money that's why they are well stored in a decentralized wallet. No matter how the price moves it is important to always follow your investment plans because the price might not be certainly predicted. For now, I have not identified another viable investment that is better than bitcoin.",

I know that it's sort of confusing but yeah, that's much like the idea of what you're trying to say.We all have started somewhere below and every accumulation that we do much be appreciated by none other than us. We're the one who's working with all the accumulation and every single sats that we get do matter.

Don't wait until you own a lot of Bitcoin before you can take security seriously.You are one of those people who have great patience in collecting Satoshi grains to become Bitcoin units that you can have as valuable assets for the future. Your advice is very good for everyone and not only for those who are beginners, because almost everyone who works in the crypto space collects Satoshis in various ways to have a large amount of Bitcoin.What you are doing is part of your own quest to earn Bitcoins and that is great as long as you can still earn a few Satoshis each day to patiently collect. And I'm sure you will also succeed one day if you keep collecting Satoshis, because then you are a big believer in Bitcoin. Continue to collect as many Satoshis as possible and keep them in a really safe place so that your assets are safely kept in your wallet.",

What he says is thisQuote from: Mrbluntzy on March 16, 2023, 09:27:00 AMDon't wait until you own a lot of Bitcoin before you can take security seriously.So he, accumulating sats, gives this advice, but does not say that he has it. And if he did, he would have a problem. With a whole bitcoin with thousands of sats inputs he would have to pay a lot in fees to be able to use it or consolidate the inputs. That's the problem, to stack sats is not like collecting coins, it has a cost. In some cases, to stack a few sats, like 700 you're going to pay more in transaction fees in the current market than what you are going to be able to stack.",

It's a given that most users here may not even have owned a whole Bitcoin. Besides, the positive thing is to hodl and keep hodling as that shows support for Bitcoin. It shouldn't matter if it's not up to 1 BTC.

I read it was a glorious era for faucet claimers. I tried my hand on faucets too around 2017/2018 but my experience was far from encouraging.
