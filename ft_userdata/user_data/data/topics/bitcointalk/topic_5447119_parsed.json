My brother approved and 500$ gone in second. Before doing any transaction, connecting wallet with dex or something claiming that they will give you airdrop, first check real website link and it will be much safer if you first connect secondary wallet having zero portfolio.",

This is much easier and more convincing than emails and other types of messages We have a proverb that says \"the trick is to leave the trick\".Scammers have been using this type of scheme since ever, and it's unfortunate that they continue to find new ways to target victims. Sometimes i think that anybody can fall into this scheme whatever how much smart he is. Unfortunately, the majority of users are not good at dealing with their electronic addresses, and most of them suffice with a single email address that they use everywhere, and often the same password.",

Zksync related videos in Youtube are most viewed in last month and twitter big account are also tweeting about Zksync. I believe airdrop has always been popular, but it is true that the recent Arbitrum airdrop makes people get encouraged to try many new projects hoping they will get the airdrop. It is also understandable that those Youtubers or even Twitter influencers don't know the exact steps since no projects explicitly stated that they will airdrop some tokens to their users. It is a very good marketing strategy, to be honest, stay mysterious, and never explicitly deny any token airdrop so people will try their testnet, etc voluntarily. On top of that, they can simply post a pinned tweet saying there is no ongoing airdrop to prevent scammers without any further action to save time.Quote from: AnonBitCoiner on April 11, 2023, 09:45:00 AMThe Site mentioned by OP is more dangerous and one can loss big here. I always use my secondary wallet with very low balance for connecting purpose and my fund is saved yet. Judging from the recent airdrops, users need to spend some money to test the network, so they can't simply use an empty wallet and connect it to some platforms. I believe this is why the scam is also getting prevalent nowadays since people need to use actual tokens to make sure they are eligible when the airdrop happens. Anyway, if anyone is active on social media, I suggest staying away from dead subs/unmoderated forums since I've seen a lot of them popping up there nowadays.",
