  "content": "The cryptocurrency market has turned green once again after weeks of volatile price movement, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the recovery effort by showing, for now, at least indications of stabilizing above the crucial $30,000 price barrier.Interestingly amidst the current bearish market environment, the number of times Bitcoin has been declared ‘dead’ so far in the first half of 2022 stands at 12.In point of fact, this represents a 52% reduction in the number of times the flagship digital currency was declared dead when compared with H1 2021, which totaled 25 times, according to data from 99Bitcoins, the cryptocurrency’s official obituary.Despite the fact on May 17, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which serves as a cross-market sentiment gauge, hit a score of 8 out of 100, its lowest value since March 2020, during the period around the coronavirus pandemic inspired a market meltdown.

Now after Bitcoin drop 50% and few countries already accept Bitcoin as a legal tender, did anyone still think Bitcoin will become dead coin?

And it should be worst right? we have the war in the background and yet this numbers?Of course bitcoin is good for long term investment no question about that. And 67% down from our last all time high? there is something against those perma bears or those haters of bitcoin in this bear market. Maybe the attacks is not there anymore and so we haven't heard more about the argument of bitcoin being dead many times in this bear market.",

HODL is still a very good solution today as long as everyone has patience and believes that Bitcoin will continue to grow well in an in-demand market. Because the decline in the price of Bitcoin that has been happening all this time is something that has happened in the past for Bitcoin so it is still possible to keep believing in Bitcoin because after the decline, Bitcoin can still increase again which means HODL Bitcoin is still a good solution at this time",

This is why I believe that we shouldn't be shocked to see people not really thinking its going to die. If you see something \"dying\" a million times and recovering a million times then its not going to be a weird thing. I know for a fact that crypto will not die, sure there would be \"some\" cryptos that dies, but the general idea, and bitcoin doesn't die neither. So we should just keep it going this way and ignore all those people who keep saying that it will die, seems to be wrong and we should realize that.",
