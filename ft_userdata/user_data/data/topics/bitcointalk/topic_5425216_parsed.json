  "content": "It appears Apple executives are trying to find more creative methods to make more revenue for the company hehehe. This might be because Apples's production of their products in China will go down because of workers' protests in their sweatshops?In any case, this might only be the beginning. The government might use this and regulations to force other technology companies to cause impairment on the infrastructure of the cryptospace. It begins with consumers and their wallets.Apple blocks the Coinbase wallet on iOS. As per the details from a tweet thread by Coinbase, iOS users will be unable to send NFTs from their wallets on iOS devices anymore.The main reason cited and mentioned by Coinbase is that “…the gas fees required to send NFTs need to be paid through their In-App Purchase system so that they can collect 30% of the gas fee.”Additionally, Coinbase mentioned that, for anyone who understands how NFTs and blockchain work, Apple’s request is impossible. “Apple’s proprietary In-App Purchase system does not support crypto, so we couldn’t comply even if we tried,” cited Coinbase.Read in full https://watcher.guru/news/apple-blocks-coinbase-wallet-release-on-ios",

Maybe Elon can deliver this.At the very least, Android still offer as much freedom of what you can do to your phone. With F-Droid being the popular one, and on a popular device model, one can opt-out out install any Google apps to the device. As with the third player, I don't think the mobile market share needs another competitor, even if Elon would do it. Quote from: ETFbitcoin on December 03, 2022, 10:02:52 AMUnfortunately, it's nearly impossible to install third party app store on iOS.There are a few third-party app stores for iOS: https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=iphone+third+party+app+store&ia=web.As far as I can see, AltStore is the open-source one. Nevertheless, digging deeper into the app, seems there isn't many apps being supported.",

Actually what the hell, don't be surprised if Windows runs on the Linux kernel one day too.QuoteWe definitely need a third player which supports a better app store. Maybe Elon can deliver this.That is not going anywhere without a complementary desktop OS. The truth is, even Google is on the desktop with ChromeOS. There's no way Elon Musk is going to find the manpower necessary to maintain such an OS, even if he ends up plagiarizing Linux like the rest of his competitors. Let alone maintaining two operating systems.",

Apple has no incentive to change either since people still buy their product, so it's kinda useless.

Trust Wallet could be his real target.How big is Trust Wallet market share on IOS? They are smaller than Coinbase on the app store, with fewer downloads and user ratings too. I doubt they want to kill such a 'small' wallet when they already went for the bigger one. Cash App is probably the next target if there is really some sinister idea behind this move.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on December 03, 2022, 11:38:06 AMI didn't know existence of AltStore which don't need jailbreak. Although requiring computer for initial setup would discourage many average user who're used with convenience. If they are considering using an alternative app store, I think most of them would be prepared to do something more than just download and install an app. At least that's how I feel when I regularly mod my Android phone in the past. But doing this on IOS is definitely not easy, not many apps are supported by default and we need to find our own IPA files to sideload. CMIIW.",

The title is accurate on what real story is and has also kept the clickbait classification hehehehe.In any case the title is not the argument. Similar to @mindrust has said, the community needs more players that can deliver the necessary infrastructure for the cryptospace or Apple and Google's duopoly will have the power over what is released or what gets blocked. The government can also use regulations over Apple or Google to force what is released or what gets blocked.",

Since if you buy anything thought the apps on Apple the get a cut (been like this since it started nothing has changed) they have to be consistent. If they allow app \"CB\" to allow certain purchases without paying them, app developer \"X\" can then fight them saying they should not pay either for some reason, and then another developer does not want to pay and then another developer does not want to pay and so on. Easier to just not allow the 1st app.That's just good business.-Dave",

Bringing it back to the topic at hand, I think it's not that big a deal if CB wanted to work around it they could, even if it was a 'if you buy it on the app your gas will be 50% more message' and just take the cut. But, since they did not you have to figure they thought it was such a small market as to not be worth it.Outside of the NFTs are crap side of the augment, looking at it from the other way NFTs are dead.
