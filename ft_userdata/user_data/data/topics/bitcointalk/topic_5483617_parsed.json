Of course that is a misinformation, Metamask is a wallet that is only compatible with EVM, so there is no way they can support the native bitcoin network.

Bitcoin blockchain can not interact with EVMs.However, if it is about wallet, if they use same BIP, they can use same word list for wallet seed and a wallet can serve for both Bitcoin and altcoin storage with same wallet seed.You can get example with Trust wallet.However, even if you use Metamask to store Bitcoin and altcoins, you must have different wallets for different storage purpose. One wallet for Bitcoin storage and another wallet for altcoin storage.",

However, Bitcoin users have alternatives like Leather Wallet for managing Bitcoin and its related assets, including BTC, STX, and BRC-20 tokens.For integrating Bitcoin into MetaMask, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) offers a solution by tokenizing BTC on the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, the development of Bitcoin-specific MetaMask Snaps could potentially expand Bitcoin's accessibility within the MetaMask ecosystem.@OP this is just some twisted information to click bait readers.",

If it is supporting Bitcoin what big difference it can make in the already competitive Bitcoin wallet market? Looking at the present condition, a Bitcoin user would like a wallet that provides privacy for transactions made through it. I do not think Metamask can come up with such kind of solution as that which is cheap. As for getting into a Bitcoin wallet is a good sign as WBTC, like tokens won't be considered as a first option for Bitcoin. Now users would be more interested in getting Bitcoin than wrapped tokens which are nothing but ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The same analogy would go for tokens that are on the Binance blockchain but are not original Bitcoin. I feel this is good for Bitcoin as these Bitcoin replicas will now enter a phase when they will die and diminish.",

I knew one thing like swapping feature like we can swap our one token to another well buying feature can be a good feature. On the other hand, I also have not faced withdrawing or buying Bitcoin from a visa card I will also have a look at this feature by doing some research Thanks OP for sharing.",

This is a huge mistake from the particular blog site or maybe you have misunderstood it.If it were actually true, we would have seen it all over the internet and on their website. Infact, that would be a catch for new customers. I checked the Metamask website and there is no information on this.I think this is a better explanationQuoteDoes MetaMask support Bitcoin?MetaMask supports Bitcoin, but not in the way an exchange wallet accepts the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is not an ERC-20 token, so the largest cryptocurrency is not accepted directly by MetaMask. However, you can get BTC into your MetaMask in a roundabout way.That said, do not try to send Bitcoin directly to your MetaMask. If you try to do so, MetaMask will not be able to receive the token, which could lead to negative consequences. You could lose all the Bitcoin you have sent at once, which would be a terrible situation!https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-store-bitcoin-on-metamask",

If we install an extension on the browser to check whether they really support Bitcoin it won't take long, but because we don't want to.If true, metamask no longer wants to focus on altcoins alone but they want more.Because the news is already available from Cointelegraph, for now let's just assume that the news is true if the famous metamask that only supports altcoins now supports Bitcoin.But the news from the sources mentioned by users here indicates that the information about metamask supporting Bitcoin is not true.",

You did not understand the article properly. it is talking about a Visa and a Third party dapp called Transak.That dapp will enable users to sell BTC directly for fiat via Visa card. they'll probably use Wrapped BTC for metamask. but transak itself works with multiple other wallets so it's likely to be possible to sell actual BTC too via Visa Master Card.",

Metamask is an EVM-compatible wallet only, I haven't heard of or experienced the direct Non-EVM chains' integration with Metamask. There's a possible way to use the same phase to access every chain using the snaps, where the address varies from chain to chain as per requirement but the master key & recovery phases remain the same, and to check the updates regarding the assets you need always go through those snaps.Snap is a third party, so to me, it's really unreliable.

But, to be fair, many platforms who say they now \"support\" Bitcoin, don't do so directly.Many merchants \"supporting\" Bitcoin actually only accept Bitcoin through a 3rd party (you send this party Bitcoin and they settle your payment with the merchant) or don't even actually deal in Bitcoin. PayPal famously supported Bitcoin buys for US people some time back, but you really were just paying them to display a Bitcoin balance on their account. Couldn't withdraw it to a Bitcoin wallet. I could simply say I support Japanese yen and allow people to pay Yen at my site, via a 3rd party settler, but doesn't need me to actually network with any Japanese currency channels.So we don't forget.

So basically they as providers strive to make it easier for their users to be comfortable, safe, easy, and things related to their users' wishes. And of course it will also be very profitable for related provider companies.",
