  "content": "Timelord2067 pissed me off with this story that I'm a scammer.I have never defrauded anyone, the only data that can be read from my history is that I have repaid dozens of loans. The blockchain and transactions can confirm this even more than my word.No one opened a single scam accusation against me, just because i never scammed anyonone: I have a job, I have a real life and I have my money and my crypto.What do I do with the money I borrow? Those are things that concern me. I use cryptocurrency for my privacy, and it's certainly not my intention to tell the first idiot who asks me certain things. Of course I do things that are legal, permitted and that don't cause me problems.I didn't cheat because Mr. Timelord did the guardian, but because I'm an honest person unlike timelord who keeps accusing me of being dishonest.Message @Timelord2067:- You was removed from DT members just because you acted like an idiot.- You tried to contact a lot of users by PM (you contacted Shasan and others) asking about me, because you were preparing your charges.  Technically this is unsolicited PM, reason for Ban. And 1Maiu has already made a similar accusation to you (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5459010.msg62517299#msg62517299)EDIT : If you're depressed and your life doesn't make sense, stop venting your dissatisfaction on others and work to improve your life.",

IMO really unless its newbies vouching for 1 another or something of that sort, I don't see where it's anyone's business as far as needing to see the txid. If someone wanted to verify, I'm sure that proof might be given via pm, but it doesn't necessarily have to be publicly posted for every case. I ask for loans and keep it all private. My lender is fine with it and always gets repaid with nothing posted.Regarding ban evasion, unfortunately people are telling you the truth. Banned means gone as a person, not just the account. I don't know that I 100% agree with that rule. Depends on the offense IMO, but that's not my call to make. Hopefully if you do get banned and currently have a loan, you still repay and keep your morals in tact.",

      "body": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2572722.msg26208188#msg26208188Is exactly the same as this topic from HedgeFx: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5203031.msg54259301#msg54259301And in that topic, somebody \"loses\" $500 and then Hedge lock the topic and stop the \"service\"? Seems to a scam to be but what do I know.But if you did abanoned the trading idea and it was so bad and everything, why was the first thing you did on your \"new\" account HedgeFx to start a trading thread again??Very strange, and it did go bad there to.. people lost their money all the time, or did they really? I don't care and not up to me to decide, but very very very strange that a person opens an new account, starts trading again if he get banned and it works out terrible bad??  I don't think you're as innocent as you want to appear. I feel little bit sorry for @alterra57 that was recognize in all this earlier.",
