Or it has to be BTC bets?What's the approx time for answering questions? In other words, how able will people be able to Google answers, haha. I prefer really fast rounds so no one has Google advantage Just curious but is it football team+player knowledge or general World Cup trivia? e.g., will it be \"Better xg stats, Ronaldo or Messi?\" or \"Who was the mascot in World Cup 98\"... I'll suck at both but may have a better chance if it's more general knowledge rather than obscure trivia.",

What platforms are we using for this quiz pool?I was expecting a World Cup prediction pool, but this sounds cool with a few limitations if you ask me. I've reserved a spot and hope to be a part of this if I'm still breathing during the World Cup. Life stinks.Loving this cro2 team already!!! Hahah",

As I understand, we have to answer questions before each round in Google forms and then you with Trofo will manually count results. World Cup will have very intensive calendar with 4 group games played each day and some games will start quite early. So, there won't be that much time to fill questions. And it require a bit more time than making score predictions on Superbru . But prize pot is worth efforts.Anyway, I still would like to play classic pool where we predict scores on Superbru (or kicktipp). I already can't imagine big football tournament without it .",

This is just cherry on top.@LTU_btc10 questions per match day, there is 8 groups so every round will probably last 4 days. We will take care to carefully choose games and always leave you at least a day to put the results in. Probably even 2 since we can post new bunch before round ends if necessary.@igehhhWhy look at it as spending 3.5 mBTC. I guess you should be able to win most of those bets and this competition is intended for active bettors that should actually play much more than that and then requirement can be seen as just sharing one of your tickets. Places are limited so apply as soon as possible and then drop out if necessary.@notblox1Well you can always join the pool and not this one. That will be regular result predictions.",

Probably even more but 24 hours for sure. That way time zones should not matter. You will not be able to see each other picks before the round starts. We will make them public only after entries are closed.And you are answering 10 questions for whole match day not for each match. So first match day will have 16 games over 5 days I think and you will answer in total 10 questions for that whole bunch. Don't worry, there will be time to do it and it won't be too much work.",

The questions will be something you can't really Google, because all questions will be about the games that will happen. Google will be able to help you make a better guess - because the players with better knowledge of how the teams play will have better odds of guessing.",
