      "body": "Glad to see this thread in the Services board has been re-launched after the previous one was locked. I made a post in the now locked thread that I think you would agree could do with some clarification and feedback from you. I am looking forward to your reply:---------------------Regarding the service offered by AlexPCS, I recall posting in his thread a long time ago and I had serious doubts. Subsequently, some members have vouched for him after using the service and to my knowledge no scam accusations have been made against him therefore his service is considered by some as genuine and trustworthy because packages were purchased and feedback was left.As far as CoinPayCard is concerned, here are some initial observations which I am happy to revise if I have them wrong:Cons* As this is a virtual VISA card money cannot be withdrawn from ATMs* Card load fees at 4% + $1.50 means $10 load will give $8.10 to spend* $249 annual fee for $5000 monthly spend limit* $499 annual fee for $10000 monthly spend limit* At present only USDT is accepted method of payment* Website sign-up page uses reCaptcha (from Google) rather than Hcaptcha or simple bot checker that does not harvest data* Website terms and conditions do not state who is behind the project and who an end user can take to Court in the event there is an attempt at litigation. Ideally it would have been a company or incorporationPros* Customers can register a card in any name* No KYC required before or after registration* Only email address is required to register* Customers are issued a card number instantly via your website* Customers are issued VISA cards* Customers can add their card numbers to Apple/Android phones to use to make offline payments* Card load fees at 4% + $1.50 means $100 load will give $94.50 to spend* $99 annual fee for $2.000 monthly spend limit (probably just about acceptable for anonymous cards)* Direct dealing with issuing bank, no third party intermediaries are involved* Promise to make a full refund if cards are blockedSuggestions* Reduce the $99 annual fee to around $49 at least for an introductory period* Reduce the 4% + $1.50 card load fee to 2.75% + $0.99 for an introductory periodI have always cited not having ownership details and appropriate terms and conditions as a sign of major concern and this as a negative in many ANN threads because it has potential to give scope for exit scams but several members expressed views saying it was alright for project owners to remain anonymous. Many or most signature campaign participants are promoting businesses that have anonymous owners therefore it is something that has become acceptable as the norm.Keeping all I have mentioned in mind, I am confident enough to want to test the service soon. I will provide more comments, suggestions and ask some questions after further analysis in the coming days and look forward to reading comments from you and other members too.edit: I noticed on your website you stated you do not make money from the 4% + $1.50 load fee and that is set by the card provider therefore my suggestions about lowering the price for an introductory period will understandably not be looked at.---------------------",

      "body": "Quote from: JollyGood on January 02, 2023, 09:17:15 PMTextYour observation is correct 3 notes:1. Our card pricing start at $99/y for a $2k monthly spend limit.2. And correct we don't earn on card load fees, as we created this program with the card issuer directly, they wanted a higher fee because of the \"risks\". They also take a 30-40% cut on the card issuing fee. So lowering the prices would make it financially not worth it to issue cards. 3. It's (almost) impossible for cards to get blocked, you need to make some really shady purchases that would flag a bank compliance check, never ever we received such a request. But in the case your card get blocked, you will receive a free new one or a refund of your the remaining balance. However, with the discount code: e6aa4a8d-a3b0-4ef3-9de8-148cdd29lnln you can get $10 off your first card.",

      "body": "In that locked thread there was a question that was asked by Pmalek: Do these cards work worldwide without exceptions or have you noticed some service providers/countries reject them?Have you noticed anything of concern or as far as you are aware the virtual cards simply work the same way as physical ones when using them online?Can you provide some comments about these points:* Website sign-up page uses reCaptcha (from Google) rather than Hcaptcha or simple bot checker that does not harvest data* Website terms and conditions do not state who is behind the project and who an end user can take to Court in the event there is an attempt at litigation. Ideally it would have been a company or incorporationWould you consider replacing reCaptcha in your register/login pages? If you decide to stick with it can you explain why you would want to do so over using Hcaptcha or a simple bot. Also, why are there no ownership details listed in your website terms and conditions pages?I can understand reluctance on your part if not wanting to reply to the following questions because it could be deemed as business related sensitive data and maybe you do not want competitors to know or maybe your numbers are very low but if you can reply it will give some background in to your business: Are you able to give the number of customers on your books?Are you able to state how many cards you have actually sold?",

But keep in mind, every retailer has their own acceptance policy. For example, retailer A does not accept card with a US billing address or issued in the U.S. - Regarding reCaptcha; we never worked with Hcaptcha, but we will look in to it and possible replace google reCaptcha- Regarding our corporate info; at this time we don't want to share that data just for privacy reasons. We will probably in the future, for now that's not something we planned to be honest. Let's be fair, any data on card issued or user base can be dispute/manipulated unless we prove it by showing our database (what not will happen of course) so this data will remain private.",

This topic has no deleted messages.To answer your question: Yes, you can receive small amounts to verify accounts at different merchants. 9/10 they will just temporarily hold a small amount the verify that the cards works.Edit; Btw, your card holds USD. USDT is only used for funding your on our platform, we automatically convert it to USD.",

Ok, I understand your point and since you're ready to do the right to resolve any negative feedback everything should be okay. However, some forum users won't still like the idea though.Bolt card can use as closed-loop and also has debit card performance. However, the Debit card performance is only exclusive to the Bolt card registered customers. I like the idea of your service being KYC-free and I would like to know if the card has no restriction worldwide.",
