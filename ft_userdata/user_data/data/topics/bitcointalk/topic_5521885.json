  "content": "Florida Considers Including Bitcoin in State Reserves by 2025.New York - By Jae-Hyung Park, Special Correspondent: The state of Florida is discussing plans to include Bitcoin (BTC) in its state reserves by 2025, aiming to fortify its leading position within the blockchain industry.According to foreign media reports on the 6th (local time), Samuel Armes, President of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA), expressed optimism about the possibility of establishing Bitcoin reserves by the first quarter of 2025. Armes highlighted that groundwork for this plan is already underway, citing existing state investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets as its foundation.Florida's $185.7 billion pension fund ranks as the fourth-largest in the United States. Armes mentioned the potential allocation of a portion of this fund to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.Additionally, it is noteworthy that part of the state's $116.5 billion budget surplus for the 2024-2025 fiscal year could be directed towards Bitcoin investments. This investment strategy would be pursued in a manner that does not impact core public services.Armes stated that he plans to proactively propose pro-Bitcoin legislation, including the Bitcoin reserve bill, to the Florida legislature. These efforts underscore the state government's determination to establish Florida as a leading region for blockchain technology and cryptocurrency adoption.Source.https://www.google.com/amp/www.eblockmedia.com/news/articleViewAmp.html%3fidxno=8437",

It has been rising since the day it was created and still, billions of people are hesitating to invest a single dollar into Bitcoin. Does that make sense? No, that doesn't. There is still a time to buy Bitcoin at discount because yes, 100K is not its all time high price, there will be much better records.Quote from: avikz on December 07, 2024, 04:41:00 PMIt's not just Florida, even some countries are planning to introduce a national Bitcoin reserve after it has reached 100k.I think that at this point, it's easy to predict that Bitcoin will become a part of reserve for many countries. We should own as many Bitcoins as possible to make it expensive for them to buy because if countries invest it and make it their reserves, they won't sell it for a low price.",

Although the organizations will also need to start by understanding the financial implications that come with such bold step and weigh it with the benefits that will follow thereafter. Secondly, the organizations will need the by-in of the workers or pensioners involved if there funds will be allocated to bitcoin then go further by tutoring the enrollees the benefits attached to investing in Bitcoin to avoid occupational conflicts between the workers and the management in the short and long-term. Ultimately, I think it's a very good idea to explore and the organizations should work towards conceptualization of these ideas.",

Managers of pension funds start to add Bitcoin into their Pension Fund Investment Portfolios but with small proportional weight. They perhaps want to try first, assess results and will consider to increase Bitcoin weight in their portfolios.First UK pension fund invests in Bitcoin.USA State pension funds and Bitcoin investment.In Canada, you have this Pension funds explore crypto investments.QuoteCanadian pension fund manager Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) had invested $150 million into Celsius in October 2021 — less than a year before the crypto lender filed for bankruptcy the following July.

This action follows what has been done in Arizona and Wisconsin, both show that cryptocurrencies can complement traditional investment tools and drive economic leadership. Bringing Bitcoin into the state's reserves could really put Florida on the map for blockchain tech, attracting talent and investments, and helping to onboard more people into using digital assets. These moves show the state is all in on keeping up with the changing financial scene.",
