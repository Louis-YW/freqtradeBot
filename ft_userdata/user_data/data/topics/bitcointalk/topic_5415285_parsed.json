  "content": "First, let's define Blockchain Privacy Paradox.According to Dentons.com, Blockchain Privacy Paradox means that records published to a blockchain cannot be deleted. This means an individual person would not want to use a Blockchain for their personal and sensitive information. Also, how can an individual or data subject exercise their right to be forgotten when the information recorded on a blockchain’s ledger is permanent?This is what Oasis Network Solves.With Oasis Network’s architecture, it can separate consensus and smart contract execution into the Consensus Layer and the ParaTime Layer. This means that separating these layers allows ParaTimes to process transactions of different complexity in parallel with shared consensus, offering incredible flexibility and the potential to incorporate customizable privacy-preserving technology that can break the blockchain privacy paradox.Currently, Oasis Network has two confidential ParaTimes named: Cipher & SapphireWhat are your thoughts about this?",
