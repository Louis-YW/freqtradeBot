Don't force it if you don't do well learning online, there are two categories of persons, the ones who can learn things easily online, while those that do better with offline knowledge. Be sincere with yourself where you belong and adjust to that learning style. If finance is not an issue, i'd advice that in addition to what you have be given here, if learning online is not so much your thing, seek for a professional in your locale who can offer one on one teaching and guidance, learning offline and from someone's experience can facilitate the learning process.",

I have some basic knowledge in creating Dapps on solidity and really bored on Ethereum and other chains. Really want to explore \"What Bitcoin Blockchain is capable of?\"",
