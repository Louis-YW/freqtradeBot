  "content": "A random thought bumped my head, and it concerns  the Blockchain technology on which major crypto currencies exist. We have seen over the years how one technology gets dumped for another, which in the end does offer better incentives, mostly economically, to sooth the times.No doubt Blockchain has done really well in making lives better all round. Bitcoin and other crypto has simply been just a perfect revelation which Blockchain technology has made real.Now where even the metaverse can boast of having its own cryptocurrencies we understand how fast decentralized system is innovating. In the nearest future some technology might simply have to be upgraded or dumped to sooth the time.*So what happens if a new network technology out performs Blockchain technology with speed, better innovations, good charge rates and simplicity of interface? *What automatically becomes of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that rely on the decentralized Blockchain network to function? *Can Bitcoin and other crypto run on a new network technology, incase something happens to this Blockchain or it becomes too slow?As I went to my favorite teacher, Google, I got informed on the Performance-wise Hashgraph or Hedera Hashgraph which is rumoured to be a likely successor to the Blockchain technology in the future.Instead of the regular block protocol like the Blockchain would provide, this Hashgraph uses a protocol called 'gossip about gossip' to verify and validate before adding the transactions as individual graphs to display open ledger and transactions data. To show this technology is out to support cryptocurrency, It also has its own hash based currency called the HBAR.Mining has no impact here as it isn't required, fast speed, better performance, lower charges are some of the benefits this Hedera Hashgraph aims to provide.Any thoughts?Visit link to learn more:https://blog.accubits.com/will-hashgraph-replace-blockchains/#:~:text=Performance%2Dwise%20Hashgraph%20could%20replace,network%20security%20and%20transaction%20performance.https://kriptomat.io/cryptocurrencies/hedera-hashgraph/what-is-hedera-hashgraph/",

      "body": "Checking out the Hedera hashgraph it shows that performance wise is more secure and faster than blockchain. It is better in almost all ramification but one can't really tell the future since technology grow, like soft forks have been created to compensate for some of the issues of Bitcoin blockchain (scalability), so it might become a big name in the future or not. Bitcoin is popular because of it's community and the decentralization it creates but according to what I read Hashgraph isn't fully decentralized QuoteHedera's hashgraph consensus mechanism relies on a committee of up to 39 nodes. It is run by a Global Governing Council of up to 39 well-known corporations this might pose issue to its adoption. Recent performance has shown that despite looking better than blockchain investor's prefer to invest in a larger sea than one looking all beautiful.To your first question i would say nothing, this Hedera Hashgraph is already a proof.Second question they are still working fine thanks to the belief of the community.Third question am not sure it is possible to move it. Even if something happens to the blockchain developers will try and rectify it, history can even backed this and in the case of the blockchain been slow, it can be considered relatively slow but improvement like soft forks (Segwit, Bip118/119 etc) development and second layer network like the lightning network has been helping improve this shortcoming.Never had of it, was shocked that something that could serve as an alternative for blockchain exist. Blockchain is the first doesn't mean more won't come we can see with Coca cola and Pepsi cola. As long there's a market there would be competition.",

Oh activity token, I believe it can replace all other cryptocurrencies, one because I believe it, two because I say so, three because I made it.My advice, look for a better teacher.",

      "body": "It is about DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and besides Hedera, we have Byteball (now renamed to Obyte) which uses DAG technology too.DAG are not blockchain as they don't have blocks. Hedera has their explanations for DAG vs BlockchainObyte.org's definition about Obyte ledger.QuoteObyte is a distributed ledger based on directed acyclic graph (DAG). Unlike centralized ledgers and blockchains, access to Obyte ledger is decentralized, disintermediated, free (as in freedom), equal, and open.So far, DAG coins have yet successful like Proof of Work coins especially a very decentralized PoW coin with very big hashrate like Bitcoin.",
