Even several companies, including well-known exchanges, are based there. But that's not big news at all, the country has a low population  (maybe less population than my city). I doubt this approval will increase the user count statistics significantly.",

Is it related to the regulatory nature in Singapore, or is it a mistake on your part because Bitcoin is usually described as a cryptocurrency or a digital asset and not a token, which is banned in some countries?Good news for Singapore, at least Upbit is a well-known service.",

As far as I know, yes, Singapore is crypto-friendly; they have exchanges that have crypto trading. I'm just not familiar with what exchange there is in Singapore. And if that news is true and can be implemented, it will be a good innovation for the country of Singapore.That's another cryptocurrency adoption. Of course, I have friends and relatives in Singapore; if that ever happens, they can use that exchange if they send it to our country.",

If it is related to using Bitcoin to pay for goods or services, I guess that already happened. I remember reading some news about Singaporean business owners accepting BTC as a payment method. Some services that I use and based in Singapore also allowed their customer to pay with crypto years ago. Not really surprising considering how aggressive they are with modern technology and business, since that is one of the ways to make money for their resident.",

Nevertheless these approvals are good news for us in the Bitcoin community... my question is just to gauge the level of Bitcoin penetration there. If I'm not mistaken, Singapore is indeed a friendly country. The growth of it's economy could be attributed to the young IT professionals and consider as one of the hubs not just in Asia, but in the world, although we all know that if a country experience so much growth in the last 20 years, their laws are going to be strict.Also in the ICO boom in 2017-2018, I also remember that Singapore is one destination for those project and make it their headquarters. Not sure though if the government is going to legalized BTC. But if they continue to be bitcoin friendly and accepting crypto exchange, then it's going to be good news for their young population.QuoteWhile global crypto ownership rates averaged around 4.2% in 2022, countries like Singapore and Thailand have significantly higher adoption rates at 11.05% and 6.47%, respectively. This is largely attributed to the tech-savviness of their respective populations and the pro-cryptocurrency stance adopted by both Southeast Asian countries. https://cointelegraph.com/learn/an-overview-of-the-cryptocurrency-regulations-in-singapore-and-thailand",

Nevertheless these approvals are good news for us in the Bitcoin community... my question is just to gauge the level of Bitcoin penetration there. Hi there! Hope You doing well. Your Questions is sounds well buddy. Well, Most population of the Singapore  people is well educated about Cryptocurrency which means it is cryptocurrency friendly country. This is good news for the people of Singapore as upbit is the largest exchange of South Korea Although we know the News are publish publicly means anyone  can read these news no matter where he/she belongs too right? and those countries who don't believe in Bitcoin and exchanges kinda things may be able to believe by reading these kind of news. Like the news if Singapore is Allowing these exchanges to be execute in their country then there may be chance of other countries Taking interest in this field of cryptocurrency. Well, i think these kind of news put some kinda impression on the market maybe late because it's obvious these things take time to be executed. Now, i know many of here will say market also relay on many other factors like demand and supply, CIP data and any other factors involve in it, I do agree with all of them but i am just sharing a little fact.   Quote from: Yamane_Keto on October 16, 2023, 12:56:21 PMsinpe..Hmm, buddy thanks for mentioning this mistake, i actually i just noticed it as maybe the news is removed or deleted website so i am putting another source here. Many Thanks!Edited source news",

No, Bitcoin adoption will bring pressure on other anti-Bitcoin countries pressure. Regulation is another thing, and Bitcoin regulation is another, They are most likely pro CBDC.",

Singapore is blockchain hotspot in asia so they are indeed crypto friendly. Even huge exchange choose to operate in there to have a friendly regulator compared to other country. Bitcoin is not illegal in there as well as other cryptocurrencies in general. So anyone can trade crypto on Singapore without any problem since they are already adapting on Blockchain technology.If by means of Bitcoin being legal is a legal tender, I would say that this is a difficult matter which is very hard to implement on a country that is not under dictatorship or one ruler.",
