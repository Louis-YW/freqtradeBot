  "content": "MAXX.Finance is a new high yield staking platform launching in August. It will have a fair launch: the team will only receive 5% of the supply and the project will be managed by the community using a DAO. Plus, the contract will have whale protection to ensure that no entity can dump on investors. Initially, there will be a free claim in which participants that have popular cryptos like Ethereum in their Ethereum wallet for example, can claim MAXX tokens. There will also be a generous referral program. There is currently a free NFT giveaway on their website (click the Get Early Access button) and this NFT will give you an APY bonus of approximately 10%. Unlike other staking platforms, MAXX Finance will also offer a suite of DeFi DApps, will be fully audited, and the team is doxxed. After the free claim, there will be a 60 day amplifier event in which you can swap your crypto for MAXX tokens. This process will also have a referral program.The bounty process involves completing a couple easy tasks such as following social media channels before claiming the NFT.If you have any questions about the project, or need help claiming your free NFT, feel free to drop a message here.",

The DAO collects the revenue and distributes it to stakers. I haven't been hyped about a DeFi project in a long time but this one really does it for me. If you look into it, it's basically a self perpetuating ecosystem that is well balanced and well thought out.",
