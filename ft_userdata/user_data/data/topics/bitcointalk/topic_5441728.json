Decided to work with Python as seems to have the largest ecosystem when it comes to Bitcoin. I am a bit confused about the various different Python Bitcoin libraries though. From my research, here are the main 4:https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlibhttps://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpchttps://github.com/1200wd/bitcoinlibhttps://github.com/ofek/bitand herehttps://ofek.dev/bit/guide/intro.html",

      "body": "Python programming is definitely a valuable skill to have in this field. First off, it is important to start with the basics. Once you've got the basics down, you can move on to more complex things and even start building your own projects! There are lots of free online courses and tutorials available that can help you. Some good ones are Codecademy, Udemy, and Coursera. You can also join online communities like Stack Overflow to ask questions and get answers from other developers. Learning Python takes time and effort, just take it one step at a time and practice a lot.",

      "body": "I know it's hard to go about it when you haven't got motivation, but it's probably best you just focus on learning Python, before thinking about Bitcoin related projects. That's not saying within a few months you tackle a few basic Bitcoin related projects, but you probably aren't going to find the best courses or studying materials that focus on Python. I'd learn Python, learn programming fundamentals in general, and then move onto Bitcoin related projects.There's numerous boot camps out there, and books. Generally, any decently reviewed book on Python are good these days. Some universities teach Python in their modules, and while you might not be attending the university you can sometimes find old module books being sold around the internet or local stores. I find universities really teach the fundamentals of programming well, better than any other book.",
