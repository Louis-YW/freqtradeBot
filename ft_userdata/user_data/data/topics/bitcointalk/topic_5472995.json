Some people only think that it's when they are growing old, like at the age of 30 and above, that's when they must start to invest or save to invest.Some people think that they can live a lavish lifestyle as long as they are still 20 years old, and maybe when they get to 25 years old, that's when they can start to invest for their future.I quite think that there is a particular age at which one is supposed to have been living a comfortable lifestyle financially.

I mean, at age 30, one should be in a financial state where they can fend for themselves and their family if the person is married. The person is supposed to have had at least one or two financial sources that they can always see as reliable sources of income.It's always wise and profitable to start saving and investing at a young age, like 18 years old.",

But I realized it when I was old enough and I regretted having missed that opportunity.I have a good opportunity and a good chance, because I joined the forum in 2017 and at that time the bounty campaign was very promising because the results were very good. I got a decent income from the forum but I forgot to invest and the money was used for living needs, having fun, and helping my parents, I forgot that I needed to invest and I only realized it now. Right now I can only regret that I missed the opportunity I had",

      "body": "With that phrase or parable you've mentioned, I won't give an exact age on what is the right time for someone's stability. It's because we have our own timeframe but this only applies to those people that are trying hard, working hard, and trying to be the better person that they are. It's true that our decisions will determine us on what is the right age for our financial freedom. There are cases that there are kids that achieved that when they're on their teens and don't get it wrong or don't be discouraged when you happen to see one. It's because we're not all the same thinking and with proper guidance, someone can really achieve that right. While on the 20s-30s, that's the time when people gets to enjoy most and even up to 40s. But as said, you do you. So whatever makes you happy, you make memories and you create it together with the people that you're happy with. It is incomparable to the topic that we have for being financially free. We can always work for the money but if the goal is to retire early and get lesser work but more time to enjoy. That's why you see people work tirelessly from these ranges of 20s-40s and then gets to enjoy life 40s on wards.",

We all come from a different families and that says a lot about us.We don't expect someone from a poor background to start investing at age 15 - 20 when they can barely feed well at home or afford going to college . You must have extra to start thinking of Investment. Which is why it's weird if we're to make a timing that's suitable to invest in ones life to achieve financial stability.Justin Bieber was financially stable before he got to age 19 in fact he was just waiting to get to the age constitutionally recognized as adult age for him to have control of his finances. But we know there are Bieber's age mate that are still struggling with life as we speak. What am I saying real sense, it's that there's no age for financial stability. Whenever yours arrive accept it that way.@Philipma1957, the good Lord will surely make you see 67 and beyond, in good health.",

One pastor was given a sermon one Sunday, and he was talking about \"the benefits to sow early.\" Then he talks about a stock he invested on when he was yet 18 years old, and after 20 years, the profit he got from that investment was able to build him a house.That's to say, investing on time and holding for a long time is very beneficial, and also, if someone invests very early, like at the age of 18 or more, at that time, the person is  not yet open to a lot of responsibility because they might still have some guardian who is yet providing for their needs, and as such, they will only have little responsibility.",

You don't have to prioritize savings or investment especially if what you have is limited. Although there are parents who teach their young children to save, a child doesn't actually think about that. A child only wants toys. All I'm saying is that we're sometimes too futuristic that we forget about the present. If you're young, it isn't bad to go out and spend your money and travel and enjoy life.",

Some can work better, get higher salary than others and if they have good personal financial management skills, they can have better life than others. Not all people who work and get high salary can have better life than people who have lower salary. They only have it if they can use and manage their personal finance well enough.It needs education on personal finance and it needs experience and usually we see people start to get better finance when they are entering their 30s or 35s. Because they already experienced in life, in finance, learn from their lessons and make less personal financial mistakes like when they are younger.Usually when people are teenagers, they don't have ability to earn money so very few of them can make saving for investment.",

They feel they have full authority over themselves, have a job that can support themselves, have no dependents (not yet married) or pay installments. The low level of responsibility in life makes them spend money more often to enjoy the results of their work efforts and buy new experiences. Each age level has different financial needs and demands, but initial planning for choosing the type of investment must be done carefully according to age and needs.",

I feel it's more about opportunities and people should be educated at their college level itself about savings and investments so that they don't work till the age of 60s, rather people should be made aware how to divide their expenses and try to invest even if it's as little as $10 per month.

Financial literacy isn't common, making it a rare occurrence. Only young people with the guidance of wealthy parents who understand this can make it happen... privilege as part of a wealthy family can be a significant accelerator for them.It's quite common for people with limited financial means to take a bit longer to achieve financial freedom. It makes sense for them to aim for that when they reach their 40s or older, where they should ideally have a more substantial source of income. The process takes a little longer because there are bound to be many human error along the way, which necessitate more time. They need to bounce back when they fall, a struggle that those born into wealth don't typically have to experience.By the way, at your current age, have you achieved the financial freedom/financial stability you aimed for to retire from exhausting physical work?",

First, young people at the age of 18 do not have their own income. Rather, they mostly depend on their parents, so if their parents are not wealthy, they will not get a lot of money to invest. The other important thing is that young people at the age of 18 do not have sufficient awareness and experience to start investing.
