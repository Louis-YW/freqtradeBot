  "content": "I got a neutral tag from jollygood. Is it important? yes it is important for me. He accuses me of being an alt and accuses me of being a merit finder for signature campaignI will answer:1. I am not an alt2. If I have the opportunity to join the signature, I will join itExplanation1. Do you think people registering on forums is the same as registering in a school? do you think newbies are clueless? Let's have a direct discussion, you always avoid having a direct discussion with me. This is not my first forum, do you think this forum is the only forum on the internet? so you dare to accuse me alt. I consider your tag to be an abuse of DT's power as I'm not sure in the future you will remove it Because you are DT, So I challenge you, prove your accusations, if your accusations are not proven then it is defamation and you should apologize to me and 10 negative tags because you abused your DT powerI'm sure you will dare to accept my offer, because 10 negative tags is not problem for you, Because you don't care about signature campaigns. Only other people will you think is wrong if they join the signature campaign. The most important thing for you is to judge people2. Please explain the meaning of this point. If I want to raise my rank immediately to sign up for a signature campaign, then I will support you and maybe many people will give me merit. What I did today is at risk of being tagged, so how can you accuse me of doing that? Please explain what logic are you using? But I'm not an anarchist so maybe I don't know if you explain about thatMaybe you can't make a thread to judge me because you don't have any proof. But if you still haven't studied law, of course you can create a judgment thread without attaching evidence and initial analysis.So I opened a thread to judge myself. So you don't bother making threads. So please present your arguments for your accusations and attach the evidence. Remember this is a judgment thread so need to provide concrete evidence, not assumptions. You need to distinguish between what is discussion and what is judgmentSo, I'm waiting for your reply about this and about the challenge that I gave.Have a beautiful day",

Even the now disgraced chipmixer campaign attempted to enforce participants from various regions of the world so again establishing whether there are alts in a campaign is crucial for campaign managers (just as an aside three high profile users were found to be alts in the chipmixer campaign simultaneously when it was paying out at it's most lucrative)Having said that, a campaign manager would undoubtedly see the *neutral* and keep it in the back of their mind.  But, until you apply and are rejected and ask respectfully why you were rejected then told it was the neutral then this is all hypothetical conjecture at best.",

There is no discussion going on in the thread other than reputationIn addition, new members are not considered in the discussion. Just like you who didn't answer my question in the rby case thread. Yes maybe this tag is not very influential, But those accusations are bogus, I need to warn jolly, and he really likes to tag people based on assumptions. If this neutral tag turns red then my next step is: I'm crushed or he's crushedI want to explain things with you, but the more I explain, the easier it will be for you to criticize me. Such a method of logical discussion exists in the concept of hermeneutics, but I forgot, I haven't read a book in a long timeQuote from: lovesmayfamilis on July 06, 2023, 05:43:43 AMIt looks like the guy is too hot.

I need to criticize a few things, how is it possible for a judgment thread but no preliminary evidence? That's really surprising, and I think it's wrong and needs to be fixed. But Jolly doesn't consider me, because I'm just a junior member.Though he need not worry, because I'm not a lawyer. But if he wants to defend himself I am prepared to re-read what I have read, and I think that is good in a discussion.Note: I'm still waiting for jolly to answer this and bring evidence to his charge",

If you want to trade with people will it make them more likely to use an escrow? Probably not, since you no trades / sales or anything else to most people trading you have no reputation for that so they would want to use an escrow anyway.Having 150 posts, which comes out to 5 a day and creating this thread makes you look more guilty then the neutral tag. That is a lot of time and effort to put in for a new user.Creating this thread will make people question what you are doing here more.

Your third day! If you want us to believe you're some kind of prodigy then you'll have to live with the skepticism you're going to receive.This isn't your average forum. I've seen people do all sorts of crazy things here over the years in an attempt to manipulate others to make money: open 100+ accounts, come up with crazy stories about why they lost money trusted with them, rabid insults, suicide threats, death threats, smear campaigns, attempts to get law enforcement to take action against posters they didn't like, etc... So if somebody has a wild or weird story to tell that serves to enhance or preserve their account's reputation, sorry but my default opinion is they are lying.Quote from: PytagoraZ on June 15, 2023, 04:41:31 AMI have learned about merit and activity systems. I have a goal to gain merit and activity at the same time. I learned a lot at the local board. Many members say that beginners don't need to think about merit, but I think it has to go together.

Just seems like you'll do or say anything to make a mark here.This is gonna sound crazy to you but when I came here I didn't care about any of this shit. I was just doing a lot of reading and learning as much as I could about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. I found it truly fascinating. I registered in April 2014 but didn't join my first signature campaign until 2018 or 2019.I'm glad I pursued knowledge at the beginning because I used it to participate and build in a few early projects, the fruits of which have amassed me considerable more wealth than sig campaigns ever could. The point is if more people used the forum as an educational resource, they could probably figure out ways to improve their quality of life much more dramatically than sig campaigns will.",
