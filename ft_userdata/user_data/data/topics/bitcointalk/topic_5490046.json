The process of mining Bitcoin requires substantial computational power, which in turn demands significant amounts of electricity. This electricity often comes from non-renewable sources, leading to greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change. However, the extent of Bitcoin's environmental impact varies depending on factors such as the energy source used, mining hardware efficiency, and operational location. Efforts within the cryptocurrency community aim to address these concerns by promoting sustainability, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and improving mining hardware efficiency.

The Energy consumed by miners is huge nowadays, and not only for bitcoin, remember there are a lot of coins that need hardware miners to validate their blocks. And this energy most of time comes from dirty sources... But if we power off all the miners, did you think the energy production will decrease?, i don't think so. Is like the dilemma of vegans, if you become vegan you think less cows and chickens will die? the answer is no. And why are we worried about the climate change? what makes you think the climate is a constant? it has always been changing and is a natural process that we can't stop.",

This electricity often comes from non-renewable sources, leading to greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change. Almost all the sectors that utilize power negatively impact the environment. The government and some organisations have attacked Bitcoins by claiming that Bitcoin consumes more power than other sectors. There have been several anti-campaigns that claim that Bitcoin consumes more power than New Zealand and Belgium put together. But the truth is that Bitcoin mining doesn't consume as much as the power banks and electrical car charging stations consume more power.  Quote from: herecomesjohnny on March 23, 2024, 05:12:45 PMHowever, the extent of Bitcoin's environmental impact varies depending on factors such as the energy source used, mining hardware efficiency, and operational location.

Many Bitcoin miners are moving to green energy and some are also recycling the emission that is produced by mining. Some of these by-products have been used for heating and some are been applied in agriculture to raise plants. It is also important to note that Bitcoin miners contribute to the economic development of some countries through taxes. Some countries also generate excess electricity, so Bitcoin miners are assisting them to consume the power.",

      "body": "If I remember correctly, there is an ongoing effort from miners themselves to switch to renewable sources of energy. The catch is, the initial investment will be expensive, but the cost per kWh is much lower compared to traditional electricity. Concerns regarding the environment have been raised for years due to the bitcoin network's massive power consumption and requirement, and I believe miners are also into it as a huge number of these miners have made the switch. (Source: Cointelegraph)The problem with green energy is that it's hard to establish a facility for it, and the outputs are sometimes not enough to satisfy the needs of the people. It's also hard to scale, that's why fossil fuels are still the go-to when it comes to electricity generation. Almost every one wants to use green energy, it's just that it's hard to facilitate and scale up for wide use.",

Yes.  By becoming a Bitcoiner it becomes very likely that you learn more about how the world runs, how Banks enslave you and you will at least partially free your mind.  So instead of supporting Banks who print plastic and paper bills and Governors who use private jets to commute, you end up realizing Bitcoin provokes about zero impact on the environment when compared to every thing else the Government does every DAY through which they likely pollute more in a month than we do by mining or using Bitcoin in years.",

It is not a major concern, but it is a concern. Bitcoin mining has impacted climate change in the environment, and we cannot disprove that fact. Let us put it into consideration, because whenever the government is ready to act because of that, they will take things into action. It is good that the OP brings up the topic as a reminder. Although it has been discussed in this forum before, it is good that we are aware and make good use of the best mining tools that have a limit on causing harm to the climate.",

A group of people just tried to create FUD. Nowadays, miners have also started using renewable energy, and I can't see much discussion about mining energy consumption.

Though, I am the kind of person who believes the climatic impact of Bitcoin is way overestimated and inflated for the sake of FUD, it is pretty convenient for the enemies of decentralization to badmouth Bitcoin and decentralization in general in times like these, when people are so concerned about the climate and the future of the planet.In reality, what I think it is going to happen is that in the future, most miners living in the developed world would have migrated to green energy and the same will eventually happen to those miners in developing countries, but at all lower pace.In the end, the world would be still headed to a climate crisis, regardless of the existence of Bitcoin, you know. There are industries which contaminate way more than Bitcoin does: the vehicle industry, mining industry, some would even say the traditional financial industry/institutions pollute more than Bitcoin does nowadays. So no, I don't think Bitcoin will end the planet or will have much on an impact on the future of the ecosystem. If we truly want to save Earth for future generations, we need to take a look at those industries I just mentioned.",

But the reason you mentioned may not be correct. The amount of electricity required to mine Bitcoin is nothing compared to the electricity consumed by industrial plants or various large projects. The world has large factories and factories for the manufacture of various chemicals, but there is a lot of waste and electricity, which has a serious impact on the environment. Apart from these, there are brick kilns, but a large amount of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are emitted, which are all gases that are very harmful to the environment. If we can survive in the environment by accepting these things, then the amount of electricity consumed in Bitcoin mining may not have a very bad effect on our environment.",

Bitcoin mining operations are often located in areas with cheap electricity, often with lax environmental regulations. But to be fair, it's not as harmful as other behavior that we think of as having a different climate impact, and the climate issue is common to everything, not just related to bitcoin.",
