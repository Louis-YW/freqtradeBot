      "body": "MSI Afterburner is awesome to overclock cards, both AMD and NvidiaAs user above said, use only official links: https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cardsBut there are some points to considerWith Nvidia, MSI Afterburner is probably the only program you need, just to adjust power limit, memory clock, core clock and fans. If you are more experienced you can adjust a curve to set a limit for clock.Talking about AMDs, you can use MSI afterburner too, but with Radeon Settings (come with AMD drivers) you can adjust more and in a easier way, I'll post an image just to you see the adjustsAnd if you want to dig a little more, you can use MorePowerTools to let you reduce voltage (and power consumption) in Radeon SettingsSource of image: https://www.legitreviews.com/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-video-card-review_226712/16",

What video cards do you have?There are some other useful Windows utilities for more advanced overclocking, such as OverdriveNTool. But this utility is not needed for all video cards. For older AMD video cards, a BIOS firmware with modified memory timings is required.",
