      "body": "Noncustodial wallet means their is no other person that controls the wallet but you. Where am I going to withdraw from if government ban crypto trading when I have the complete control over my noncustodial wallet? It is not an exchange and it is not a custodial wallet. Because government wants to ban crypto trading, I do not think gambling will come my mind at all than I am gambling before, to just use little amount of money to gamble. My bitcoin will stay on my noncustodial wallet and I am going to move fully to a decentralized exchange like bisqAnyone that have such decision is a fool because government banning crypto is entirely different from how gambling is legal. It has no connection that will make the person to think of sending all his coins to a gambling site, which is a big mistake.",

There's no casino or gambling site that are all 100 percent trusted they had some complaint in one way or the other so I decide to store my bitcoin to a personal wallet, if worse come to worst I use p2p to sell off my bitcoin. Maybe I might send settle amount there for just gambling sake but not because bitcoin wanna be ban.",

Trading and gambling is different thing on which if you do mind off on how you should gonna spend those coins then gambling might be an option but since you are involved on trading then it would be common sense that you are really tending to accumulate as much as possible which it is really that contradictory if we do speak about spending those coins on gambling.Just like the rest or people been telling on here is that we do have that non-custodial wallets on which means that we do still have the full control of our coins as long you dont touch up centralized exchange and if you are really that eager to trade then there's platforms that dont ask out KYC so it wont be a problem and if you are still that hesitatingthen we do still have that DEX which we could deal off with.",

Guy I will change all my coins to fiat currency before the government policies will have effect. Or i might transfer some to my casino wallet so I can easily have access to them and use to play games whenever I want it. Government policies are not certain they can come up at anytime. So the best way to do now is to remove the coins from all wallets to online banking apps. Whether non custodian or custodian wallets as far as the government is involved in it, you should not keep the coins in any wallet but transfer it to another online banking accounts",

So in such a situation,  if the government should ban Bitcoin, what I will do is store my Bitcoin in a non-custodial wallet, best I use a hardware wallet device to serve as my cold wallet and I will continue holding it.",

Here, people prefer to trade crypto than play gambling. And the government supports trading more than gambling. So, it is impossible for our government to ban trading. But if it really happens, I prefer to withdraw. Playing more in casinos won't increase the chance to get bigger money, it even leads to addiction and loss of more money. You must remember that we must have good management to allocate money for gambling. Increase suddenly the allocation of money in casinos won't be a good idea, it is not the right way to multiply money.",

When it comes on banning of BTC and interest with web 3.0 platforms, then I guess it would be better to wait for things to be more visible in terms of accessibility. Sometimes, prohibition is specified to usage but not actually with totally banning this blockchain or network, so if that's the case, you will still bave access to your crypto funds and in such way you can still play on crypto gambling sites. So I guess it would be a case to case basis. If it is a total restriction then it would be risky continuing 'coz your funds would be at risk of not being accessed.",

Many people in my country still do gambling almost every single day in online fiat casinos. It means that there is always at least a way for people to do what they want even if the activity is banned by the government. The same for crypto trading, even if my country ban it in the future. I still believe people will still do crypto trading by alternative ways. This is the answer if you ask me personally since I do still gambling although it is illegal activity/banned by government.",

I will not waste my hard-earned money because of government policy. First, government policies are not static or forever, another political leader or party with a different ideology might change the ban on Bitcoin policy. Second, if the country didn't criminalize the owning of bitcoin but the use of it, I will keep it in an air-gapped, open-sourced non-custodian wallet. It will be safely kept there. Third, I might also decide to travel to a neighboring country where I can carry out bitcoin transactions and return back to my country. Fourth, if the majority of my income or wealth comes through bitcoin, I might migrate from my country temporarily.",
