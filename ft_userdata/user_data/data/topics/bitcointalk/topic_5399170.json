      "body": "My opinion is that this is very unlikely (almost impossible) in the countries you mention. China has already clearly defined its position on Bitcoin and all other altcoins, and given its political system, it cannot accept anything that it cannot fully control. The US and England are among the world's largest economies and will not allow another currency to become equal to the national currency, with the addition that the Bank of England has a very negative attitude towards Bitcoin. In Japan, Bitcoin has been a legal tender for years, but not in the way it is in El Salvador. The difference is that in Japan it is possible to do business easily by accepting Bitcoin as a currency, while in El Salvador Bitcoin is legally equated with the national currency and anyone who wants to pay something with Bitcoin must have that option.Realistically, rich and developed countries are not the ones to look at when it comes to accepting Bitcoin as a legal tender in the literal sense of the word. I live in one of the EU member states where the central bank and some regulatory financial agencies have a very negative attitude towards Bitcoin, but this does not prevent adaptation in the sense that a very large network of physical crypto exchanges has developed and it is possible to buy a lot of things by paying with Bitcoin. I want to say that Bitcoin does not have to be a legal tender to be successfully integrated into society.",

Yes it might been a legit currency for others, but there are still plenty of reason why they wont do it and thats due to volatility and of course bitcoin can be used to such crimes. A highly volatile currency would not be good for reserved. Some warns other the risk of it so probably if there is a chance that it would be tender probably from other countries.",

Purchasing of bitcoin will always be available in the market. Not 100% of the bitcoin holders are solely holding, a good chunk will always be for sale on exchanges3. The 21 million limit will be reached (not exactly 21m but yea) likely sometime around year 2140, so we're really not that 'close'",

Possible, in the future.The question is, how it's really important to make Bitcoin as a legal tender? Bitcoin doesn't need to be legal tendered in every countries though it's good for the adoption, but at least make Bitcoin not getting any banned in every countries! That's make people have a freedom to choose to use Bitcoin or not. It doesn't have relation with the maximum Bitcoin's supply.",

Otherwise, it is necessary that a complete paradigm shift in finance and economics will have to happen first. I believe that the prevailing financial and economic systems are largely incompatible with the system espoused by Bitcoin. There will have to be a complete process of restructuring.QuoteSeeing it's getting close to it's mining 21million limitNot really. The 21 million limit will not be reached before the year 2140.

England i not an EU country, and the US and Japan already accept it as an asset and Bitcoin is regulated there. No wonder you have not received any merit since the merit system was introduced.

Quote from: DaNNy001 on May 18, 2022, 10:10:11 AMPlease I ask the forum do you think Bitcoin can be installed as a means of legal tender in advance county like CHINA, USA , ENGLAND, JAPAN etc...I agree with many other fellow forum members who have responded before that I see it as extremely unlikely, let alone in the short to medium term. You never know what might happen 30 years down the road or more but in the next 10 years it's not going to happen, it will just continue to be considered an asset on which you have to pay capital gains when you sell (or pay) if you have made a profit on fiat over your base purchase price.",

In countries like Japan, there is still a possibility to have bitcoin listed as legal tender in future. That could happen in European countries as well. But not in dictator led countries like China or Russia. They will rather implement CBDCs over cryptocurrencies. But in case of another world war, the gameplan could be changed totally.",

Unfortunately, those countries are accepting it as legal tender who are on the verge of bankruptcy and who has devalued their currencies against the dollar. They are like using bitcoin as escape route to recover their economy with the help of decentralisation, free flow of money and trying to get overseas money inside the country, (through businesses, personal incomes etc).However, it seems difficult that all the countries would accept it in the near future.",

Specially if they are trying to dominate the world with their own fiat currency, since obviously they would see bitcoin as a threat. Examples are US and China.Other countries that don't want to dominate the world on the other hand, would be more willing to adopt bitcoin as we are seeing it happen in many of them like Japan and El Salvador regardless of their economy size or strength.In the far future, when bitcoin has reached a much bigger adoption level and has a much more stable price and also second layer solution such as LN are more solidified, we can expect more countries jump on board because they wouldn't have any other choice and have to accept the reality by then.",

Yes it can, but those countries have a strong Fiat currency that are protected by their governments, so it is unlikely that they will allow any competition to their power.
