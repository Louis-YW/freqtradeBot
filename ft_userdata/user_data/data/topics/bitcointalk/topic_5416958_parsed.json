      "body": "V2 has little to do with the original Stratum.A miner should do only three things : get shares from a pool/node, process the work, report results.Oh, and monitor itself & provide a GUI. Fine, that's 5 things. Period, end of story.IMHO having the low power CPU's in a miner deal with more than the absolute minimum of work is a horrible idea. Then there is the matter of changing work w/o it being obvious to the owner of the hardware. Ya know - like the security hole known as extra-nonce aka XNSUB which allows the miner to change work on-the-fly to mine other coins (DevFee hashing is 1 example) -- as well as do other things in the background if it connected to a bad-actor pool.Everything I've seen points to V2 being solely for the benefit of pool operators and not the miners themselves.",

I can see it slowly taking over as the manufactures start using it by default, but until you hit that critical mass point I see most people still using V1, I know a lot of people never even update the firmware on their miners unless thy wind up having an issue with something. For the small miners, there really is no advantage to all the additional overhead that it needs. And as with anything, the more features you add to something the more issues you will probably wind up with. -Dave",

Or is it expected that we'll have a LAN device that aggregates traffic and provides configuration interface?Upd: I see they have different connection options on their website. Is there a way to monetize this so-called \"translation proxy\" that is basically what I mentioned above? Maybe there is a commercial opportunity, but still I don't know why would anyone buy such device.. there is no real financial incentive.",

Yeah years old idea.Some pools supported GBT for a while ...No one ever actually wrote code to use the transactions supplied - GBT died.It's death was a good thing.Stratum already has the option to request the transactions, so you can verify the merkle slices, but not change the ones used.No one uses GBT or that option in stratum for a reason:What it actually leads to is 2 things:1) about 2000 times more data per works sent, and thus about 2000 times more data per day per miner.Yeah so instead of about 15MB a day per miner per pool connection, you are looking at about 30GB per day per miner per pool connection.This also means on average more than 3MB of data per work change instead of less than 1500 bytes.Networks do not transfer data instantly.2) transaction biasThis is completely against the ideals of bitcoin.People have tried, on multiple occasions, to put this into bitcoin. Fortunately they've failed doing so.Adding it to pooled mining is a really bad idea.----The initial problem with stratum was the fact that the work difficulty was separate from the work.Slush wouldn't fix this coz it meant changing his pool code. Very slack of him.However, not a big problem, unless a pool is misbehaving or coded badly ... ... ... ... ...",

I keep looping around. Are miner manufacturers going to create new binaries for the new stratum and risk having issues with it before pools support it.And will pools support it if everyone is still using V1? And it just keeps looping and never takes off. Take a look at IP6, been around since 1995 you know pre internet boom and it's adoption is still minuscule. Heck some cable ISPs are still supplying modems that do not have V6 enabled.....-Dave",

      "body": "Going a bit OT here but ja, why Bitmain, microBT, and since their IPO even Canaan, don't open up their auto tuning routines for users to tweak some of the operation targets is beyond me. For the record, Canaan used to market their miners as constantly monitoring each chip and periodically tweaking them to a defined performance level. A lot of the more general tweaks are available through the cgminer API that Kano wrote. Canaan's entire code for that tuning & chip performance monitoring as well as of course all cgminer switches supported - including the Secret Sauce drivers for all of their chips used up to the A10 series - is out there in the wild. If the mfgrs are so afraid of the inevitable warranty issues then activate one of the non-resetable flags inside the micro-controlers used to signal intentional operation outside of OEM boundaries so the OEM can check it and also grab a log of settings and take it from there with the user as yes warranty or no.So... Since example open-source code (from Canaan) exists for auto-tune routines as well as per-chip monitoring/control code, ja, someone should build on that to work with other miners and publish it! Since at one time most miners (except perhaps Bitfury) did and these days still *do* follow the cgminer API at least up to a point, it is not too hard to hack their version of cgminer for the basics of Vcore, fan speed, etc. Heck using Awesomeminer, just pull the list of API commands supported and talk to the miner using ssh/GUI. The hard and most important part is the chip driver(s) used to access whatever resources said chip has regarding the monitoring/controlling of it. *That* Secret Sauce is why the closed source fee based 3rd party FW exists. Throwing in a decent GUI for tweaking that uses all chip control resources available vs using a more limited command line options switch is nice but also the Marketing hook. Canaan *does* support some tweaks for the A10/11/12/13(?) and have published command line support for that but again, since their IPO beyond that limited bit AFAIK they have not published any of their code.At least Kano made the s17 driver for the Compac-F open source",

I think if the true goal is everyone mining than just give all the information so people can make educated decisions and remove warranty after X amount of hash done by miner maybe lock changes for X amount of hash time.I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out how the miners work and almost nobody has the time to do that so i think if you wanted to stiffle mining for new/small timers keep doing exactly what has been done by mining mfgs and all these aftermarket firmwares nobody really wants to run.",

So, it's either Bitmain doesn't know about the existence of custom firmware, or they know, and they just can't be bothered.What Whatsminer does on the other hand is they would give you the \"special\" overclocking firmware if you contact them directly, it's not publicly available, so they probably need to attach it to your own mining gear and then automatically take that gear out of warranty.But we are not even talking about overclocking here, we are talking about underclocking, which is even better for said companies, if people run their miners a lot cooler and at lower clocks, this would result in fewer repair tickets, it almost seems like these companies want their gears to die so they can sell you the next generation, it looks as if they try to ensure that gear won't break during the warranty period at stock but then break right after.  . I know that may not be the case, but I can't think of a better reason why won't they allow us to underclock our gears!I don't think we went way off-topic here (maybe a little), but we are addressing the resistance to change on these manufacturers' behalf. When they won't even add an option to allow users to change fan speed -- we should not expect them to rush into implementing something like Stratum V2.",
