Check here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directoryKeep in mind that is a file that contains all you BTC. If you save it to a location that others have access to then they have access to all your BTC.Make sure it's password protected or secure in some other way.AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE 100% CERTAIN OF THE PASSWORD.Many people have lost a lot of BTC because of \"I'll always remember that password\" and sometime later they don't have a clue as to what it is.-Dave",

      "body": "You don't really need to open the data directory to get to your wallet.dat, you might have a custom datadir anyways. You can simply go to File>Back Up wallet and use it to place a backup to make a wallet.dat to any location that you'd like. Make sure you're currently in the correct wallet.A few things to take note:1) If you're running it in Hierarchical Deterministic mode, you can just make a backup at the start. If you're in the HD mode, you should have a HD symbol at the bottom right corner.2) If you're not running it in HD mode, you have to back up the wallet.dat every 100 or 1000 transaction. Generally, newer clients are HD by default.3) You have to make a new backup for everytime your passphrase is changed, be it setting a new passphrase or just changing the passphrase.",
