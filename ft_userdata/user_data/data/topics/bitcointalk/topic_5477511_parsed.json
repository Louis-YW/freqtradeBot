You may not find the data for an exact date, but roughly every month since 2017 has got a stored snapshot, with a few dating back further.Bear in mind that, once you're on a given snapshot, moving around using page links or any sort of link may change the date of the snapshot being presented. In other words, if you start clicking things, you need to look at the date of the snapshot on the top right hand side of the page, to check if it has moved you from one snapshot to another.",

There are also a few altcoins that can make you rich in 2024 if you hold them. We know Bitcoin will be halved in 2024. A Bitcoin halving in 2024 will surely make Bitcoin worth $100,000 or more. I think those who can hold Bitcoin will be rich in the coming years. And there are hundreds of proofs that many people have gotten rich in the past years by keeping this Bitcoin away. I would never recommend buying coins other than Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a safe investment with low risk.",

The list does not have any impact in the supply and demand of Bitcoin, because the identify of the wallet owners are concealed. Anyways I'm glad that he's able to get what he wants, and let it be useful for him, he perhaps wants to keep the list as a motivation for him to aspire to be like them.",
