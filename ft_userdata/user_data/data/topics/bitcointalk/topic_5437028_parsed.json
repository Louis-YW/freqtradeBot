  "content": "GM crypto fam.As I was doing my usual Friday market recap, I came across this interesting story about Moody's working on developing a rating system for stablecoins.So apparently, Moody's is working on a stablecoin rating system that will grade stablecoins depending on the quality of the reserve attestations.As a stablecoin supporter, I really like this idea because it feels like this is the missing piece. But with Terra's collapse and everything that's been going around in the crypto space lately, it seems like many people have lost their confidence in stablecoins.I'd like to get your input on this, as you're probably more experienced than I am.Could this move rekindle interest in stablecoins?Source:https://app.getresponse.com/view.html?x=a62b&m=BJSRD2&mc=9M&s=BtgXWnG&u=QcLhh&z=ECi4GHI&",

In \"Big Short\" there is a memorable scene about how a person from an auditing company explains that he have to give A rating , in another case his client will go to another rating company to get it. The only difference is that someone else will earn for the service.They are not comming here to help us. They came here because they see a product they can earn on which is \"bribe for a good rating\". Can't wait for 2030 huge crypto collapse after A+ rating stable coin going bust.",
