However, developers or contributors may receive donations from users who appreciate the service.I tend to agree, upon reading the OP's question, I'm thinking this answer. Since Electrum is open-source or any open-source wallet, most of the developers who contribute to the progress of such open-source wallet often do so voluntarily, which means, they didn't generate any profit.  But their passion as a developer pushes them to contribute to any open source projects like Electrum Wallet. I didn't know Exodus wallet since I didn't use it.",

I usually do not request donations for myself, because I do not think it is an effective way to incentivise free software. Developers who request bounties tend to finish projects quickly, and do not really care about long-term maintenance.However, you you can donate to the people who run public Electrum servers. Electrum does relies on servers, and we currently lack an effective way to reward the server operators.Also note that I created a company that will distribute Electrum, sell paying services to Electrum users, and fund further development of the Electrum software.As for Exodus, it offers buy and sell and trades or swaps. Surely, they are earning from the spreads of those. After all, you cannot just swap or buy and sell coins and tokens based exactly on their actual prices in the market. There will always be a difference and that's a nice source of revenue.",

Such is life even in the real life. Those who have money can pay someone to develop an open source wallet and pay the developers to maintain the wallet while the sponsors are serious investors in cryptocurrency. So they don't know to make money from the users of the wallet. Before and even now many people think that, wallet developers make money from the transaction fee but that is not true though that was what they think and it was not bad for them to think so but that is not wrong. Developers do not make money from transaction fee or mining but it is from affiliated services or they render free service to develop the cryptocurrency ecosystem. And as others have said, and I am not far from that, and Electrum wallet developers are not making any money from the wallet but I believed they are strong investors in Bitcoin so they don't bother to even thinking of making money from it since they are making money from the investment. And I believed they update the wallet through donations and from their investment. And among all the wallets the Op mentioned, Electrum is the most friendly and easy to use. I have been trying to install Wasabi wallet in my system but I can't so I leave and for the Exodus wallet I have not seen it before.",

Nobody paid him (assume Satoshi Nakamoto is a male person) for the Bitcoin development but he actually reserved something like mining early Bitcoin blocks and believed Bitcoin will have value some day.Only estimation. How many Bitcoin does its inventor Satoshi Nakamoto still own?Quote from: satoshi on February 06, 2010, 11:25:53 PMEventually at most only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the world if it really gets huge.Quote from: satoshi on February 14, 2010, 03:52:23 PMRight.  Otherwise we couldn't have a finite limit of 21 million coins, because there would always need to be some minimum reward for generating.  In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes.  I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.What do we know and have so far?Millions of bitcoin probably lost. We don't know the exact number but surely not all 21 million bitcoins in total supply can be spent, some were lost forever.The world population in 2024 is more than 6.8B people. It is 8B in 2023.
