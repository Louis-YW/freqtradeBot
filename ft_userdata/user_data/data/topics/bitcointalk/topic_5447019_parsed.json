That was an unrealistic change whatsoever.  It should not be surprising that something like this is happening, when OJ Simpson went to trial due to the murder of his wife and a friend of hers the price of his memorabilia skyrocketed at the time.So Simpson began to churn out all kind of collectibles and he paid his dream team of lawyers this way, and now that Trump is facing legal issues it should not be surprising we are seeing something similar, and if anything his  collectibles could grow in value even further.",
