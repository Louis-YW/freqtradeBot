      "body": "That's a very pretty looking machine, even if it isn't the most practical thing.¬† Vespas are dogs anyway, and all the added weight is bound to make it even slower. ¬†The wood looks great, it obviously took some skill to form. ¬†I'd be curious to learn how it was formed. ¬†Was it thin laminates that are glued onto a pre-formed structure?Quote from: Saint-loup on July 25, 2022, 05:28:26 PMIt's made in genuine wood? What kind of wood it is precisely?The seats are wooden too? It's not much uncomfortable when you are driving for long trips?Anyway that's a real awesome work, it's stunning.Let's hope the wood is something that is \"marine grade\" so that it holds up in weather. ¬†It almost looks like it could be Teak, which would be a good choice, but it could just be the stain. ¬†The saddles look like the original 50's era leather saddles that Vespa used to install on their scooters. ¬†They remind me of my Brookes Saddle that came on my (purchased used) 1969 Raleigh 10-Speed.",

By the way is it ok to use it under rain, snow or an heavy sun? When temperatures are very low or very high?Do you sell wooden helmets as well?",

      "body": "Damn, I love this. It looks cool especially when it is shown moving in the video.I wish there are more info about the bike though, like what year is the engine, and from what model was used on this? Here in the Philippines, there are currently 5 models of Vespa available, ranging from $4k to $9k. Yours, made of wood is 4 BTC, roughly double the current price of modern Vespas. I get it, it looks antique, and the engine is too (probably) but my only concern for this would be if ever it gets knocked over, wouldn't the wood chip off? Although, I think if anybody buys this, I doubt this bike would go anywhere other than a showroom.",

But... Teak is great, but does not withstand years of weather conditions well at all. It warps/bends, & also becomes discolored from sun/elements.I know this because I bought a very expensive teak deck table and chairs. After about 3-4 years it warped and became discolored. aka... Firewood... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAnyhow this is cool for anyone NOT in a zone like me where there is 1/2 year of snow/ice/rain... I think anyways.. I wouldn't subject it to such brutalness anyhow, it'd be in a warm garage and I'd probably be paying a few hundred a month for that for at least 4-5 months of the year!",

I never heard of a thing like a wooden Vespa before today let alone seen one myself. However, my genuine concern is the seat. We know how uncomfortable it gets sitting on a wooden surface for a relatively long time. What happens when the rider is on a long journey? It's obvious they will feel that discomfort. The ass is going to cake on the journey. That's the only reservation I've got for that beautiful work of art.",

      "body": "That is a very nice-looking Vespa,! ¬† ¬†kinda pricey I think. I can see that you have a think on wooden things since you also have a wooden car in your garage plus this wooden custom Vespa which is great for collectors I guess, I can see a lot of collectors getting interested in your Vespa, shipping might not be a problem but takes a lot of time, I really love Vespa but it was just too expensive for its specs in my opinion and the look of it was just great and classic. I see a lot of brands already adapt to this kind of look and I have a target brand that I think has a reasonable price in the market and I can use daily in my work. But I guess I would go to a touring or adventure bike since I like more comfortable rides than getting a sharp-looking sport bike that is high-speed.Will probably share this on my social media. Good luck!",

      "body": "I hope nobody will pay for this before they actually got the vespa.Im not saying it¬¥s a scam only that the logic here does not make sense at all... the website, takes like 30 seconds to do.. and only contact in TG. Why not a open Facebook page where you can leave reviews?And its another company that actually make vespa¬¥s like these and sell them more ten times cheaper then this price.And world wide free shipping of a vespa, shipping a vespa will cost around $500-$1000 and they I counted very low.For two BTC you can get an very very good brand new car! A vespa with a 125CC engine cost not more then around $1000-$2500 depending on the model.I doubt the engine is much bigger here then 125CC.It¬¥s strange that so many members act like this is a legit thing before trying it.again i am not accusing this for a scam, just saying that people should be careful it¬¥s a lot of money.I would say be careful and don¬¥t pay anything before if you actually get the order using Cash on Delivery only.",

That partnership will bring in more fortune than scouting for single/individuals to patronise. Lets say you partner with Toyota and they get it for their limited edition of 2024 Toyota Camry, You'll forever value that partnership as you'll have your product littered all over the world and your trademark on the product will still get you more customers as people will reach out for more custom edition on other products.",
