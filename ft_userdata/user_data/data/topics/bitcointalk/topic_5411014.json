Actually countries that doesn't accept Bitcoin as legal tender would harm the economy since they're not use Bitcoin regularly due to it's not accepted on merchants. But we're talking if there's many people who hold Bitcoin, if it's only small group, then the effect is small.The best option is don't force the countries to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, but governments shouldn't ban Bitcoin and allow any merchants if they want to accept Bitcoin payment.",

Accepting BTC as legal tender is just that â€” the fact that people can legally accept BTC payments.BTC being \"harmful\" or not would obviously just depend on the people if they buy(or receive) at higher prices and sell at low prices.",

It's like having another means of exchange in that country. It's no different from paying with fiat to the businessmen and as well as paying them bitcoin with anything you purchase from them. And when there's a new means of exchange and legal tender, since it's bitcoin, there's a lot of use of it and it's even creating more sources for a country.Quote from: Crypto Library on August 24, 2022, 06:55:19 AMOr is it better to use it through control to avoid illegal or the bad side effect on economy?Many countries have still outlawed it for not being able to control it.You use it or not, you'll just going to contribute to the growth of the economy.

Accepting bitcoin as a legal tender will not have a huge adverse effect on a country's economy. Having it as a reserve currency, will surely have an adverse effect. Or else if the government makes a large investment into bitcoin, that will bring in adverse effect. Simply making it a legal tender is just fine.

Illegal stuff like money laundering are even happening outside crypto so we cannot just assume that just crypto would be able to resolve it just that easily and heck to those people that even think that Bitcoin should be banned because it is used for all those illegal activities that you could think of.I cannot recall who was that user but this thread made me recall of that one user that mentioned that making Bitcoin as a legal tender is a no-no since regulations would happen which is somehow against to the nature of Bitcoin itself and...... he has a good point.",

Therefore, there are not a few countries that still refuse because of the uncontrollability of incoming and outgoing finances. As for talking about the economic growth that a country has achieved due to adopting Bitcoin, it is not a specific benchmark. But specifically, if a country wants to adopt Bitcoin, it means that the parties managing finances in that country have a goal of building public trust. For example, in El Salvador, initially many countries doubted the decision to adopt Bitcoin.Especially when a bear market you may see bait against the government of El Salvador considered a failure. But all of them went through with confidence and as a result, they experienced a change of condition that improved when other countries were just starting their economic recovery after the epidemic.",

Many countries have outlawed it because they are not able to control it. And honestly, by now they have proven that they simply cannot do anything except scare people into believing that they somehow can.The economy won't be harmed. In fact, a transparent, fair and verifiable market which cannot be corrupted will only benefit the economy.The only ones it hurts are the people who profit from financial corruption. That's why corrupt countries like china try to desperately ban it.",
