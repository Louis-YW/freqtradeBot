I have asked them to tell me how much is mine, how much is theirs, and how much total is invested, so I can track the progress of my gains- for example, if they have 4 BTC and I have 6 BTC, total 10BTC, then at the end of the month they tell me there’s now 12, I can say 60% of 12 is mine, or 7.2 BTC. Is this reasonable? Right now, they’re stalling and aren’t being active in telling me. I want to talk business and strategy, reinvesting and calculated withdrawals, but they’re aloof and disinterested. How do I tell them it’s necessary to know the standings ahead of time to guide investing process? In fact, I don’t really even know how it works and I want to find out more but they’re always distant and reluctant to talk for more than 5 or 10 minutes. How do I get their attention and say “hey. I need more information about this” without pissing them off?",

Is this reasonable? If you invested in a true mining pool...I doubt it is!To mine BTC you need machines (asics) you don't stake coin like in PoS, and those basics even with cheap as possible electricity have at least a year of ROI, so it would be way more accurate to ask how much profit have those made in a month not that you have recovered your investment already!So, unless you have actually invested those coins to- change them to  staking coins and stake those coins for profits- your partner has bought actual gear and is mining BitcoinI smell a scam!Quote from: roxane40 on June 13, 2024, 10:37:59 AM I want to talk business and strategy, reinvesting and calculated withdrawals, but they’re aloof and disinterested.

Yes it is very reasonable. It is your money mate so you have full rights over that no matter what this person does to it. To me this seems like they already have run away with your money.

It is better you avoid something like it but that is if you want to avoid scam.I told a friend of mine to avoid cloud mining a year or two years ago but he did not listen. He paid the money and he later told me that the profit were sent to him, but just like 2 or 3 times and no payment again. Out of 100% money that he payed the scammer, he lost more than 70%.Some are even just from scammers that will not pay anything back at all. You will pay the scammers the money and you will not be given any profit in return and you will lose the whole 100% money that you paid the scammer. This is very common. I am wondering why there are still many sites that have cloud mining and not yet banned till now. I think this type of scam should have been forgotten but it is still common.",

I suggest you learn things about the mining pool on your own so you won't bother this person too much and only reach out to them about important matters like an update to your contribution.I would suggest that instead of contacting them at random times of the day hoping that they reply, you set a specific time where you guys can actually talk. Say once a week could be enough or maybe twice if you want frequent updates. This backs them up into a corner. Since you have set a specific meeting, they are now obliged to talk to you.",
