That is an extremely old ASIC device but if you want to heat your home that is a great device for that.Since it is an old device the most profitable coins are listed in the minerstat website in the link below but if you search a bit more online you can find some really low value coins like DEC if I remember correctly that you can make a substantial amount of them daily.For all other coins still relevant to that device here is the link to check it out https://minerstat.com/hardware/antminer-s7",
