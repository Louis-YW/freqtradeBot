I also strongly agree about cointelegraph being a good source, even though sometimes it seems to be too pro-crypto (not objective) to me. I would like to add a YouTube channel by a famous and very smart person: https://m.youtube.com/user/aantonop. His videos aren't particularly interactive to me, but he sure knows his stuff. As for crypto news, sometimes I simply read the articles by Guardian and Forbes on the matter, as these portals are generally reputable.",
