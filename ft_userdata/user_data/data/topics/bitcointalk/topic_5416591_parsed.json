But I noticed that some gambling sites give bonuses to players that their account is becoming inactive, to encourage them. Aside that, the bonus i know about is deposit bonus.",

A cashback will be my choice to save the day. Also to persist gambling even after consecutive losses that same day can be an evidence that I am becoming an uncontrollable gambler who does not know when to stop and that's a bad character to portray.",

They're already know if they keep gamble, they can get bigger cashback or they will gamble until they will reach the bonus. IMO bonus will make the gamblers will gamble more, so for casinos it's better to have bonus promotion.",

Losing continuously are normal if you let yourself gamble without control, I always have my limit and I didn't experience yet to receive any bonus just because I lose money, most of the time I receive bonus because I participate on their promotion.",

And after wagering/ losing, there is cashback/ rakeback.Normally, a deposit bonus is only for the first deposit or if there are more, maybe up to 3rd deposit. Whereas, with cashback/rakeback feature, mostly, casinos are offering this as long as you are playing on their casino. So technically, these 2 features go hand-in-hand. But for deposit bonus, only at the first few deposits.But if you are going to choose, and you are a heavy gambler, maybe cashback would be a good one.Because you can enjoy this reward while you are active in the casino. But usually, do take note that the percentage is only very small.",

If there will be another bonus other than that for gamblers who have lost their bankroll, then I'll be willing to accept any bonuses.

And after wagering/ losing, there is cashback/ rakeback.Yeah, most casinos offer both, but I believe OP wants to know our preference in the mentioned situation.Isn't it obvious that after we lost a lot of money, we want something back since we usually tried to win back our losses? For me, it's cashback/loss back if I wasted ALL my budget. Offering me bonuses won't matter since I lost all of my budgets, so I can't deposit more anyway.But I can see if bonuses make sense, especially if I still got some balance left. So it depends really whether a player has wasted ALL or only a portion of his budget. For me, If I lost, there's nothing left except my pants lol.",

Besides, what bonus is there to give to a $20 max deposit every week either way? There are 100% deposit bonuses on new casinos but that's just about it. My bet amount and bankroll is so low that it's best not to worry about these bonuses because they are usually negligible in value, so either of which is fine for me.",

That's what I get Cashback or Rakeback in weekly and monthly even if we have reached high wagered with VIP level it will be even bigger, but for other bonuses I don't know but if we play in a row then keep losing I don't expect anything except in Cashback or Rakeback given by the casino, but if it leads to another especially if I have lost a large amount then I go and come back tomorrow or wait for the normal situation again in my mind, then with bonuses only expected from weekly and monthly with the amount big wagered.",

In terms of cashback, you need to have a lot of games before getting your return profit. Still, most of the gambling casinos right now are offering both of these because cashback is suitable for people actively playing and bonuses. It depends on how much they will give to you, so people have different platforms for their gambling habits.",

I don't know what kind of bonuses you are pertaining but rakeback is the best for me since its the percentage of the total profit the casino that being distributed to all players. Relying on cashback percentag of your loses is nonsense since you need to lose in able to claim while other bonus can be claimed regardless if you win or lose.",

We all have almost the bad days and bad luck in gambling and likely 80% is the right figure to explain it but bonuses and cashbacks are just design to urge our addiction I guess.",
