First of all I would like to congratulate you and your friend for making this bold move and accept bitcoin as payment for the business and want to ask are there sufficient customers who are happy to pay with it? See I have not hosted any seminar before but you could find some threads on the forum and you can simply check out them like this one making google search which can help you to find some of the answers Code: Bitcoin seminars bitcointalkBut will say you should be having basic knowledge and technical part understanding also to explain it to the audience to make better understanding to them and target audience will be dependent on you and explaining the benefits of btc to them will help a lot.Rest host one and you will gain experience for the next one's.",

Any good advice on this? before doing a full seminar(requires spending to rent space, and organising event) do a small \"meet-up\" such as a informal chat with locals at a cafe/bar EG put up posters/spread the word/gossip with people that you will be at X drink establishment(or your own business/shop) between [time suitable] each day a certain week for anyone to pop in and have a chat.where you can gauge the interest and discuss things they may want see, or may be of interest for them to hear if there was a bigger seminar.  ask questions, answer questions. gauge the interest and the mood. find out what they want to know and then formulate something that will meet their expectations to want to attendhint at things informally about ticket prices (gauge the local economy acceptance of how much is acceptable) and figure out how many tickets to offer and thus what amount is needed to cover overall organisation costs.. find out who locally is \"expert\" in topics. or runs businesses and work out who is good enough to be spokes-people or who from your chats local people want to see as spoke-peoplein shortmeetups if popular, become seminars, which if popular become regional conferences, which if popular become national conferences",

Worse he can be called MLM scammer for introducing this especially to those people who's been skeptical about this program.",

It depends on how we explain it properly and easily understood, and one more thing. Tell them about the profit you get, as well as what you get for the bitcoin yield while you are involved, it's all just to motivate them.",

      "body": "Agreed to @franky1.I can speak from experience as both an artist and the administrator of our local art group when I say that organizing a full-fledged seminar is quite taxing as you have to consider the venue, find keynote speakers, the entrance fee as well as the bonding of the group itself. The same is true when hosting a technical presentation on a topic like bitcoin. A base group of people who are genuinely interested in the technology, who get along well with one another, and who have the same goals is necessary for any seminar. You may easily find individuals who are incredibly knowledgeable about bitcoin, whether in the technical or financial aspect, after the group has grown to such a size through informal meetups where they can communicate with each other to grow as bitcoiners.Additionally, you can estimate how much the event will be in demand.",

It's a first time seminar (I'd even try calling it an event where you can give away free satoshis to try if they are willing to use Lightning, let's say) just treat it like a show-and-tell. Send your friend the BTC. Show them how it's done.And answer this question as much as possible: Why should I accept Bitcoin when my local digital payment is faster, free, and more widely accepted?(A good way to start answering that is to say, accepting Bitcoin doesn't mean abandoning everything else, it just means opening more doors for a merchant)",

At this point, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still not on 'safe' state wherein new investors could fall at risks involved in this industry. Ofcourse seminars would help them to avoid unfortunate actions towarda this industry but risk will still be there regarding market price volatility. Given that not all people would be able to cope up with the downsides of this industry, I think inviting more people into this, is not yet advisable. Make them more knowledgeable indeed but it would be different to some people. Not all would cope up with the do's and don'ts therefore they'd still be at risk. The only time I'd advise this industry to non-crypto users is when price stabilizes.",

If indeed you and some of your friends want to do a Bitcoin seminar it is a positive and good thing.Having a Bitcoin seminar can provide more insight and knowledge to someone who previously did not know what Bitcoin is and how to use it.We can also simultaneously provide knowledge of investing in crypto, especially in Bitcoin. It would be even better if the seminar was held in a place where there is very little knowledge about investing or cryptocurrencies.",

      "body": "The steps that you and your friends are taking are good steps and should be appreciated. You have a passion to spread awareness about Bitcoin to the people around you. Making a seminar does look simple, but of course you have to have sufficient preparation. both in terms of material and in terms of delivery. Enticing people to attend your seminars is also an important step. More and more people attended the event. then believe me we will be more excited. but if only a few attendees sometimes it makes our spirits drop a little. But I hope you can keep your spirits up even if there aren't too many participants. I say this because that's the experience I've had.Some tips that must be prepared so that the Seminar runs successfully are:- Start making the concept and purpose of holding the seminar. And we have to focus on the concept and goals we have made.- Prepare a relevant and interesting theme for the seminar later. Adjust to the needs and conditions of your environment. like the importance of knowing Bitcoin in this digital era.- If you are the resource person, you must prepare the material carefully and completely. practice how to speak with interesting and not boring delivery. or you can bring in resource persons who are more expert in this field. But I think bringing in Special Resource Persons will require more money. So if you are confident with your insight. then there is nothing wrong if you and your friends become resource persons.- Prepare seminar packages (kits) or seminar souvenirs. such as ballpoint pens, notebooks etc.- the last step but also from the beginning is how to make a promotion to attract more people to the seminar that you will hold.good luck guys.",

No, I don't plan on making it that big, I will start will max of 10 people for now, so there will be no need for sound equipment, snacks and drinks is affordable and yes my friend will be present on the day, I plan to use a very limited space for this so this shouldn't cost me a lot, thanks for your suggestion @CryptoPanda",
