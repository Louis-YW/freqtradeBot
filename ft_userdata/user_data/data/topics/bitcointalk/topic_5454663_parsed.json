The project aims to integrate NFT and Tokens with IoT and artificial intelligence applications. ROADMAPFirst Stage(2023):- Spread the network over multiple nodes across the planet.- Increase the number of active users- Block explorer for the Assets (NFT/Tokens)- New wallets, including mobile- Agreements with compatible projects, such as FLUX.- Search for a minimum price to guarantee the network.- First exchanges to facilitate access to new users and miners.- Hackathon for developers.- More soon...Second Stage (2023-2024)- Web with documentation for developers.- Libraries to facilitate access to Neurai.- IoT devices such as ESP32 or RISC-V compatible with Neurai.- Hackathon for projects based on Neurai with IoT hardware.Third Stage (2024-2025)- More soon...Network DetailsNetwork Name: NeuraiNetwork Abbreviation: XNAMining Algorithm:  KAWPOW Proof-of-workBlock Time: 1 minuteInitial Block Size: 8 MBBlock Reward Schedule: 50,000 XNA per blockBlock Reward Micro-halvening: 10 days (5%)Maximum Supply: 21,000,000,000 XNADecimal Places: 8Launch Date: 2024-04-17 08:40 UTCGenesis: Fortune 16/April/2023 ¬†Elon Musk agrees A.I. will hit people like an asteroid Network Port: 19000RPC Port: 19001LINKSüìå ¬†Official- Website: https://neurai.org- Github: https://github.com/NeuraiProject- Explorer: https://explorer.neurai.org- Explorer2: https://neuraiexplorer.comüëõ Wallet- Neurai-qt (Windows): https://github.com/NeuraiProject/Neurai/releases/latestüí¨ ¬†Discussion- Twitter: https://twitter.com/neuraiproject- Telegram: https://t.me/neuraiproject- Discord: https://discord.gg/dxJSrSeXjF- Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/neuraiproject- Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@neuraiprojectüì∞ Information- Medium: https://medium.com/@neuraiproject- Coinpaprika: https://coinpaprika.com/coin/xna-neurai- Whitepaper: Soon- RoadMap: Soon‚õèÔ∏è Mining- NeuraiPool: https://neuraipool.com- SatoPool: https://satopool.com- Rplant:https://pool.rplant.xyz/#neurai#connect--------PENDING31/05/2023- Website: Not finished.- Only a windows version compiled, but it is possible to compile for Linux and MAC.- More info in Discord.--------We invite all developers, miners and users to join us on this journey.

If we were to make a chain from scratch with an algorithm that nobody has used, we would end up spending a lot of time on something that we don't have the expertise for. Using Ravencoin is simply because its algorithm is ASIC resistant and we want anyone with a GPU to be able to mine freely. Also because it has many libraries available and saves us a lot of work for interconnect development.I don't know if there are other projects working with micro-controllers and interoperability with blockchain, I haven't seen anything except some things for Bitcoin. Doubts will always be there and we can't prove we are not scammers with words alone.Come by in two months and ask us again",

Nor did we start with a pool or explorer or wallet, we had to compile it ourselves.A few days ago a user of our Discord advised us to spread the announcement here, although the truth is that I have seen that there are many coins that do not do any of this. We are going to make a lot of mistakes along the way, I won't deny that, but we will try to work it out as problems come up.",
