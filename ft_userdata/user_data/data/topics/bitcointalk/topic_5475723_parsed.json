Quote I mean making a backup \"only\" every few months is nothing compared to Myspace accidentally destroying 12 years of content in a botched server migration. Myspace? what is that? never heard of anyone using Myspace for cloud storage.QuoteRemember that \"the cloud\" is just someone else's computer, with all that that implies. If you don't like how that someone manages their computer, including how frequently they make backups, consider buying and using a computer of your very own.well and that's the thing though. these people probably gave a big thumbs up to google before they got jerked around. it's only once something bad happens that you have to reconsider the quality of the service.  https://www.howtogeek.com/google-drive-is-mysteriously-losing-user-data/This problem was first reported in a Google Support thread on November 21st. One person found that all the files synchronized to their Google Drive after May 2023 had mysteriously vanished. Oddly, the file structure of the user's Drive also reverted to May 2023, and their account shows no activity or files changes beyond that date.Other people say that they've lost years of important data. There are several ways to recover Google Drive data, but the recovery process doesn't work in this specific situation. Lost files are not located in Google Drive's trash and cannot be synchronized from offline cache.Funny thing is, I noticed Google Photos was blasting out a Cyber Monday sale. I bet those people that lost their data might feel a bit like they got put on the backburner seeing as how about they can do is post on a google help forum   and hope someone notices.",

Remember the old social media, Friendster? There have been lots of files as well there and family photos and videos that can no longer recover and it's the same to this. And for those that likes to keep files on cloud storages, keep yourselves a back up on your personal local data storages or personal computers for your own convenience.",

There have been lots of files as well there and family photos and videos that can no longer recover and it's the same to this. yeah i remember Friendster but all I could find about their history is this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendsterIn June 2011, Friendster shifted from social networking site to a social entertainment site with a focus on gaming and entertainment. Previous users' accounts are unchanged. However, all the photos, messages, comments, testimonials, shoutouts, blogs, forums and groups that the users may have had in the past may no longer be part of their Friendster account.[43] An exporting tool is provided to back up the information of the user account. This tool has the ability to export photos to Flickr and Multiply.The deadline given to users to export their photos was extended to June 27, 2011. Photos which were not exported before the deadline were removed and are no longer retrievable.not sure how long the deadline given was. but it sounds like it might have been a short one  I'm assuming that's what you were referring to by people losing their data. They didn't act fast enough so it was gone, deleted.QuoteAnd for those that likes to keep files on cloud storages, keep yourselves a back up on your personal local data storages or personal computers for your own convenience.for sure. there's really no excuse with multi TB SSDs these days. other than just laziness.   of course, when a 1 minute video from your phone uses an entire Gigabyte, you would need a 1000TB SSD most likely if you do alot of movie making...",
