But how to find newly created wallets, I couldn't find.Searching for wallets with only one fresh transaction also works.I considered the following services:zapper.xyzapp.zerion.ioetherscan.iodextools.ioBut not a single service allows you to achieve your goal.",

An address with a valid checksum = a valid address, whether someone generated it with a wallet before or not.As for your second question regarding a tool that finds addresses with fresh transactions, I'm not aware of any. I even checked some on-chain intelligence services but there's nothing of that nature. Obviously, that's doable but you might need to code it yourself. I'm curious, what is it that you're trying to achieve here?",

Thank you very much for the information and the link, my friend! You're super!  Quote from: OmegaStarScream on September 25, 2023, 12:30:37 PMAs mentioned above.

I'm curious, what is it that you're trying to achieve here?I watched some YouTube bloggers who tell guides how to find successful whale wallets in DEX, and poke their deals. Such whales have insider information. But when I really started checking the transactions of the token wallet, I saw that most of the first buyers use clean and new wallets. It's logical, why leave the story behind, so that people like me and other guys copy them. I thought that it would be possible to track the crypto wallets that have just been created, and monitor them. parse wallets from the first tranazktsii, map their addresses with the names of tokens and try to repeat their purchases. Maybe my questions are stupid and my ideas are naive.",

Maybe my questions are stupid and my ideas are naive.It is a different case but yes whale can be detected easily since they carry a large amount of money there is also tracked bitcoin whale or there is also a report from CryptoQuant - https://cryptoquant.com/ or Whale Alert on telegram https://t.me/whalebotalerts Bitcoin dormant and large address who contained a ton of money are trackable now. and what do you mean poke their deals. Did you mean Sniffing transaction using MEV Bot on Dex if yes, MeV bot actually quite profitable but some Dexes now has the feature to counter this attack.",

Don't expect every feature to be free, though.Also, you really can't know if a wallet has just been newly created. You can only know by their first transaction. And how do you even know for sure if the new wallet is a whale's wallet? It could be anyone's wallet.",

It could be anyone's wallet.That's why I don't trust those accounts that says they follow whales wallet. Sometimes it just create more confusion for newbies.As for the service ask by the OP, there is none so far and I think it's better be that way though.",

Maybe my questions are stupid and my ideas are naive.Not really It is actually something that's worth considering by the developers, but the big question is what will motivate developers to create a tool that can track a new wallet, we never know, the technology is advancing we may see a tool for this in the coming years, its quite a complex idea to materialize though, maybe a centralized wallet can do this but a decentralized wallet will not offer this kind of feature.",

The wallet platform simply facilitates you fetching one or more private keys randomly using the wallet's own proprietary method.So, when a new wallet can be monitored is from when vitalik started running the ethereum blockchain for the first time.",
