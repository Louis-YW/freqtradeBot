Trading skills cannot be learned overnight, and no one can give you a magic formula for how to be successful. You are right, $10 is not a serious amount and you will hardly attract any experienced trader who will be encouraged to help you and explain something. it is more of a call for savvy traders and those who know a little but overestimate their knowledge. you will agree with me that such traders are not the best source for learning.if you make a little effort yourself and start to understand the concepts, you will come to know more precisely what interests you and you will ask more precise questions. if you ask such questions here, you are more likely to get quality answers, even for free.So, start to learn through your own research and ask here (surely there are still plenty of forums dedicated to forex) what you don't understand.what you also need to know, cryptocurrency trading as well as services dedicated to it are significantly different from forex trading. everything looks very similar, but there are significant differences. but you can find out for yourself. or not?",

Be careful of paid trading signals, paid bots and copy trading, learn trading from scratch yourself and use the amount of money you can afford to lose for it. Know one thing, that new traders are always lose, even lower the amount you can afford to lose, just use small part like $10 to be learning trading.

      "body": "You want to day trade or swing trade? I'd advise against day trading. It's extremely exhausting and sometimes you'll feel like you had 2 good days and then a bad day wiped it all out and you realize that you spent 3 days doing nothing, just wasting your time. That's especially if you try to day trade crypto. There are people and bots who make money of day traders by doing what you're trying to do just with much more money and much faster reaction time. Rather than day trading try to identify general trends and do monthly or yearly trades. You'll do much better. Most rich traders started as day traders and as they had more and more money their perspective became longer. It was no longer about making that $100 a day from 50 trades but making 5k a month from 1 trade.",
