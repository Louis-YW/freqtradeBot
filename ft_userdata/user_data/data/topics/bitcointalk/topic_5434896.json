Also, a reused (\"catch-all\") address gives an opportunity to mititagate some of phishing attacks because other sources (trusted ones, e.g. friends, self-made or external directory) could validate an address. Moreover, storing and keeping many addresses is more complex for a sender (imagine choosing the best/valid address among hundreds of them pertaining to a recipient). Lastly, protection is simpler for one private key than many of them (even if they are generated in a deterministic way like BIP-32 or BIP-39).There is the disadvantage that a list of transactions is not obscured (in comparison to using a new address for each transaction) - so-called \"privacy\" issue on the Bitcoin network.",

So, if a sender makes a mistake typing it, then the mistake will be immediately identified by any reasonable wallet software and they will be unable to send to the wrong address.  Reusing an address encourages a sender to go retrieve the address from a list of addresses somewhere that they are maintaining, significantly increasing the risk that they accidentally retreive the wrong address. If they retrieve the wrong address from their list, it will be a valid address and the wallet software won't stop them from sending to it.Quote from: Greg Tonoski on January 16, 2023, 08:47:25 AMless steep learning curve (e.g. for IBAN users),More steep learning curve for anyone that has ever worked with an invoice number.Quote from: Greg Tonoski on January 16, 2023, 08:47:25 AMfewer keys to protectIt's just as difficult to protect a single key as it is to protect a thousand keys. Furthermore, if you use a new address each time, then there it doesn't matter if a key is somehow accidentally leaked once the funds that were received at that address have been spent. And, to top it all off, if you fail to protect a single key of a reused address, you'll lose ALL of your funds, if you fail to protect a single key of a non-reused address, you'll only lose that single payment, and still retain control of all your other funds.Quote from: Greg Tonoski on January 16, 2023, 08:47:25 AMAdvertisement an address is simpler vs maintenance of a system that advertises many unique ones.That depends a bit on your specific use case.  For most users, it isn't any simpler or more complitcated.  You just run your wallet software, and teel your sender what address to sent to.Quote from: Greg Tonoski on January 16, 2023, 08:47:25 AMAlso, a reused (\"catch-all\") address gives an opportunity to mititagate some of phishing attacks because other sources (trusted ones, e.g. friends, self-made or external directory) could validate an address.Actually, it increases the risk of a phishing attack.  If I re-use an address, then a phishing attack can create an address that looks similar to my \"usual address\".  Since my friends will be conditioned to expect that particular address, they are MUCH more likely not to notice the small difference. On the other hand, if I use a new address every time, my friends and I are far more likely to put verification processes in place.Quote from: Greg Tonoski on January 16, 2023, 08:47:25 AMMoreover, storing and keeping many addresses is more complex for a sender (imagine choosing the best/valid address among hundreds of them pertaining to a recipient).Why would a sender need to store or keep addresses?  They are useless once they've been used.

If they retrieve the wrong address from their list, it will be a valid address and the wallet software won't stop them from sending to it.It also encourages sloppy behavior.

As I mentioned above, I don't think 99% of users should ever be handling raw private keys, as it is completely unnecessary for them to do so and it just opens them up to additional risk. Even fewer users should be handling their chain codes for any reason.Just back up and protect your seed phrase and be done with it.

Now people use HD wallets and only handle one seed; the history has shown that having wallets with a lot of unrelated keys is a recipe for disaster.Quote from: Greg Tonoski on January 16, 2023, 08:47:25 AMThere is the disadvantage that a list of transactions is not obscured (in comparison to using a new address for each transaction) - so-called \"privacy\" issue on the Bitcoin network. By using correctly multiple addresses, different parties will not know how many bitcoins one has. This is important, there was already at least one case with user complaining here on bitcointalk (some years ago) that somebody know all his bitcoins and now it's threatening him. So it's not something to be as easily dismissed as you do.I will add that moving to new addresses at least now and then is beneficial also for security, at least in theory. If an address was used in the past with a wallet with bugs and - in a way or another some information was slipped online - using new addresses at least when going to new wallets can easily help one avoid bad surprises.",

So your main task for security is secure your master key or seed. If you lose your master key or seed, you lose that wallet and all keys inside.Mastering Bitcoin, WalletsQuoteThe second type of wallet is a deterministic wallet, where all the keys are derived from a single master key, known as the seed. All the keys in this type of wallet are related to each other and can be generated again if one has the original seed. There are a number of different key derivation methods used in deterministic wallets. The most commonly used derivation method uses a tree-like structure and is known as a hierarchical deterministic or HD wallet.See explanatory graphics for HD walletsWhen you open your account on a centralized exchange, they will assign one public receiving address for you that is derived from a likely grandchild private key. You don't own that key and your grandchild key belongs to a big wallet owned by that exchange.",

The simple reason is that every new address gets a new label, and when it's paid, I know exactly who it was.",
