      "body": "If you are a crypto trader, you can check your wallet every day because you need to observe price movement and make decisions. But it is needless for a long-term holder to check his wallet every day because it is irrelevant. Long-term holders already have plans on how to handle their investments so there is no need to check the wallet often. Also checking your wallet every day can cause FUD which might make you sell your holding prematurely. Checking your bitcoin wallet every day can expose you to hacks or scams especially if you are not using a well-secured wallet. The more you expose your wallet to the internet, the greater the chances of experiencing problems. Most holders keep their investments in air-gapped wallets and leave them for a long time.",

Old token may do good within minute, one can take such advantage to make good cash out of such forgotten token.This is not a wise advice, because it is impossible to browse the wallet every minute, and it is difficult for the time of your browsing the wallet to coincide with the time of the currencyâ€™s rise, given that the rise of such currencies is fast and does not last for more than a quarter of an hour, even if you activate the notification and you are lucky to be connected when that currency rises It may take some time before you can sell it.Such tokens are not suitable for long-term storage, and therefore withdrawing them to the wallet is not a smart idea. Trade them with a trading bot so that it sells as soon as the currency reaches a certain price, and then you will not need to check the wallet continuously.The only problem is that such bots work in central exchanges and the exchange may be hacked, but the chance of hacking is less than the chance that you will be able to deposit it in a timely manner.",

Once they successfully lead you to their site, that's when the real game begins they are working hard to capture your attention and guide you to invest in their pump and coins and eventually the worst-case scenario is they are giving some rewards to others via referral program as well and it would be a nightmare if you are the one recruit the other victims to invest. so the best thing to do is to completely ignore it once you receive such random coins in your wallet if there is no decent price in it.",

I agree, usually those shitcoins that pumped that much don't have liquidity at all. And that means that you can't even sell and take that moment of selling it.As much as you wanna sell, no taker is there as it's risky for the observers and traders that have noticed that pump. In other scenario that you're holding good tokens or altcoins, you have to take time at least when you've got spare time to check on how it is going. That's a norm even if you're just a long time holder just for you to check on what's happening and how much you've gained/loss on it.",

They do not have faith in meme coins that are prone to sudden price increases followed by sharp drops, as well as scams where developers abandon the project. If you hold Ethereum or Bitcoin, there is no need to monitor the price on a daily basis. Anyway, most people frequently check prices, but there are very few holders or traders who don't. As shown in the chart you posted, pumping can also occur, which involves manipulation with very low trading volume. I have seen this happen many times, so there is no need to regret or think that we missed an opportunity.",

My guess is that you couldn't have sold your tokens anyway because i am betting there weren't any limit buy orders on those levels, just market buys for a thin sell wall that was most likely dev or a bot buying their own tokens for fake price action. Either that or a glitch. You don't need to watch your wallet constantly, that's not healthy.",

The example picture is just a rug pull which the value is fake. Most likely that token came from a scam airdrop which scammer is using nowadays by spamming their scam tokens through airdrop then charge some ridiculous fee just to swap it on DEX.I have a wallet for almost 5 years and there's nothing inside until now. So using your advice will just waste my time if I do this for 5 years consistently. A rug pull token shouldn't bother you to do that because checking your wallet regularly will loss your focus especially if you are doing important things usch as work.",

I also agree, that as a crypto investor the motto \"I just wanna hodl so i buy and then i don't look at my coins at all for several years\" is not a smart thing to do and can even lead to a total loss of your investment. A lot of stuff is going on in the crypto space with hacks and security breaches.So stuff like the issuing of a new token is not that rare and i just had that a few weeks ago with Poolz. You had to claim your new poolz token on a website. So if you are not following the space at all for a long time it is very much possible that the time for the token swap is running out and in the end you only have worthless tokens on your wallet.",

This is if we assume that this exchange will allow users to register and create accounts and be able to sell at an appropriate time before the currency price begins to decline. some exchanges use fast bots and prevent the execution of orders to attract more liquidity. They may ask users for documents or more data before they can withdraw their currencies. Therefore, unless the currency is listed in less than 5 reliable and high-liquidity platforms, you will not be able to sell it if you are lucky and the price of that shitcoin increases.scam exchanges will require users to deposit bitcoins to be able to withdraw.",
