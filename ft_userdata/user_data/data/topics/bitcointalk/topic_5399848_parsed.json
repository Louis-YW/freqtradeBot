  "content": "I was directed to use Kano.is because it was allegedly reliable and run by the same personwho runs ckpool.I've been mining with Kano.is for a couple years with a small ASIC miner. Other peopleare using smaller miners.Suddenly I found that cgminer could no longer log into Kano.is for pooled mining andcomplained of an \"authorisation\" error.This is very odd, because the documentation says the \"password\" can be anything, so I just use \"x\".Meanwhile, oodles of other people are continuing to mine on Kano.is...Despite this problem, ckpool still works for solo mining although now I'm not sure I trust it.Has anyone else experienced any problems with Kano.is?FWIW I have tried other ports besides the usual 3333, and other Kano servers, but no luck.Errors:Code:[2022-05-23 09:51:30.673] Closing socket for stratum pool 0 [2022-05-23 09:51:35.673] Testing pool stratum+tcp://stratum.kano.is:3333 [2022-05-23 09:51:35.864] Pool 0 version_mask:1fffe000. [2022-05-23 09:51:35.932] Pool 0 difficulty changed to 8190 [2022-05-23 09:51:35.993] Pool 0 message: Failed authorisation :( [2022-05-23 09:51:35.994] pool 0 JSON stratum auth failed: (null) [2022-05-23 09:51:35.994] Closing socket for stratum pool 0 [2022-05-23 09:51:40.994] Testing pool stratum+tcp://stratum.kano.is:3333 [2022-05-23 09:51:41.187] Pool 0 version_mask:1fffe000. [2022-05-23 09:51:41.249] Pool 0 difficulty changed to 8190 [2022-05-23 09:51:41.316] Pool 0 message: Failed authorisation :( [2022-05-23 09:51:41.317] pool 0 JSON stratum auth failed: (null) [2022-05-23 09:51:41.317] Closing socket for stratum pool 0",

      "body": "A) Kano pool is ran by Kano and NOT -ck who runs solo.ckpool!Yes, in the beginning Kano and -ck worked together on cgminer and the ckpool code and then started & ran the now defunct ckpool but they parted company long long ago in 2014.B) The Kano pool thread is disused because very few folks have issues that need to be reported there and most now use Disccord. If you repost there (pool thread) and you will get better response.That said, have you changed the miner firmware being used? Most of the aftermarket firmwares violate the cgminer GPL so they are automatically banned from Kano's pool. The one exception is Braiins, they are allowed because it is clean code that is not based on cgminer. Considering that Kano is the 'other' main developer of cgminer he rightfully takes great umbrage towards those who refuse to publish their code modifications like the GPL requires them to to.edit: BTW, KanoPool accepts connections from *anywhere* on the planet with no restrictions (aside from the 3rd party firmware thing).",

After disabling verbose mode, it mines just fine.Since you aren't mining at 1 diff on any pool, those messages will always show when you tell cgminer to show them ... in verbose mode.They're the internal check of the diff of each nonce returned.cgminer must check the difficulty of each nonce returned by the hardware and decide if the pool wants it.e.g. when mining at 442 Diff, on average 441 of each 442 nonces returned will be \"above target\"It's not an error.",
