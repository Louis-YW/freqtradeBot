By extension, all of this will have been shared with various blockchain analysis companies, most likely some branch of your government, and potentially a variety of third party data brokers or other interested parties who buy data from blockchain analysis companies.So now you have to ask yourself how happy you are with all of this. Do you not care that all these entities know exactly how much bitcoin you own, exactly which addresses belong to you, will be able to track exactly any future movements, transactions, purchases, trades, etc., that you make, and potentially use this information against you in some way? If you don't care, then do nothing. If you do care, then continue reading.Next ask yourself what coinjoining will achieve in this case. Let's say you split all your coins between multiple coinjoins, coinjoin everything thoroughly, and move all your coins back to a brand new wallet with no links to your previous addresses. This will prevent the entities above from knowing which addresses you are storing your coins on and from being able to track all your future transactions. They will still know that you own some bitcoin, but will also lose the ability to know exactly how much. Their estimates of how much you own will become less accurate as time goes on, as they won't know if you are spending or selling some of your stack.If you continue to buy bitcoin via this KYCed account and then coinjoining it, then again they will not know where your coins are or what you do with them, but will still have the data on how much bitcoin you bought over time. If you instead choose to buy non-KYCed coins via a DEX, then they will not have this data, provided you are meticulous in keeping any non-coinjoined coins separate from your newly bought non-KYCed coins.And of course, make sure you don't use Wasabi to do any of this, since they work hand in hand with blockchain analysis companies.",

Maybe I should just focus on accumulating non kyc coins?So far, the exchange can only determine that whoever you sent the coins to has not yet spent them. If you did not have to register a withdrawal address, then they can at most assume that you sent them to yourself. If every withdrawal went to a different address, then they have even less information.If you don't mind them having that information, then there is no need to coinjoin, and the time to consider coinjoin would be when you move or spend them.",

To link yourself and your mixed coins, you have to either spend mixed and unmixed UTXO in one transaction or via change. ChipMixer does have some good practices, but that implies you'll use their service (which provides better mixing than a coinjoin, but trades-off self-custody): http://chipmixorflykuxu56uxy7gf5o6ggig7xru7dnihc4fm4cxqsc63e6id.onion/articles/best-practices-2021 (use Tor)",

All coins are from kyc exchange and have been in cold storage a while. It depends. What are you planning to do with these coins in the future? Since you have already done KYC, the exchange already knows who you are and how much bitcoin you have in your address/addresses. If you are planning to send the same coins to the same exchange at one point in the future, I don't see the need for a coinjoin. If the coins will be used for other purchases or everyday spending, it makes sense to break the link and start fresh. I repeat, will the coins go back to the same exchange in the future to be swapped for fiat or some other crypto when you are happy with your profit?Quote from: hZti on November 15, 2022, 08:11:45 AMAt this time there is no benefit in doing it or not doing it, since nearly all exchanges will accept any coins.

For KYC sats, I would just use coin control to send to your own wallet, and then hold it there for a while. If you're lucky enough to stack non-KYC sats, I would CoinJoin them to cold card with Sparrow's whirlpool implementation and then HODL for at least 10 years. I think in the future, having both a KYC stack and non-KYC stack will prove to be beneficial but I would LOVE to slowly get down to nothing but non-KYC that has all been CoinJoined. When it comes time to spend them, hopefully more people are running PayJoin so we can CoinJoin as we spend to preserve our privacy in the future.",
