  "content": "We all know and use the concept of \"Whale\".  However, after all, the whale is the largest animal in the world that has no enemies and peacefully swims in the ocean. And Whale doesn't eat other fish, it eats one plankton. A whale in the ocean is completely different from a whale in cryptocurrencies or in general in the financial sector. By calling these owners of huge amounts of money whales, we are making an unforgivable mistake. Because a whale in wildlife in its way of life does not at all correspond to a whale in finance. I hope that this post of mine is read by real fans of cryptocurrencies.  And we all have a bad attitude towards those whom everyone calls whales. Because there is still no benefit from them for real and not too rich owners of cryptocurrencies, but there can be harm. For example, when they arrange pumps of some coins. And we can lose some of our money in the process.  So, in order not to disgrace the majestic animals - whales in the ocean, it is proposed to call whales in cryptocurrencies the word \"Hwale\". And treat \"Hwale\" with a joke and not like real whales. We all remember this comic story with the word \"HODL\" very well.",

Really?It looks like you know nothing much about the whale diet  Ask the squids and Octopuses and see they consider whales as peaceful animals.Here is a guide so that you make up for mind on the \"hwale\" suggestionQuoteHere's a small overview of the baleen whale diet:SquidKrillFishOctopusLarvaeCrustaceansSmall crabsQuoteHere's an overview of the toothed whale diet:Marine mammals (porpoises, dolphins, whales)CrabsOctopusSquidFishOther sea creatures (sharks, seabirds, walruses, sea lions, seals)Personally I don't even see the point why you are suggesting this.",

      "body": "Why did I create this thread? Of course, I know very well what whales eat. And I know well the difference in the diet of different species of whales. Here, in general, this question is of secondary importance. Here's a little historical background:Even in ancient Rome, there was an expression \"new man\" - novus homo.  This was the name given to plebeians and representatives of noble families who managed to get high government positions.  The patrician aristocrats looked at them with contempt. The French phrase \"nouveau riche\" appeared in the 19th century.  With the transition to capitalism, an industrial society, the role of the nobility began to decline, and enterprising representatives of the \"vile class\" began to grow rich: the children of shopkeepers, artisans, and peasants could become wealthy manufacturers and bankers. The old French aristocracy treated the \"new rich\" with condescension, despised their ignorance, ignorance of secular manners, low cultural level.  At the same time, the nouveau riche, wishing to raise their social status, could buy titles of nobility.So the development of cryptocurrencies over the past 13 years has led to the creation of a whole army of unexpectedly enriched people, the ideal and which can be jokingly considered dreams of \"Lambo, their island and many women, mulattos.\"  And some of the newly born \"whales\" are completely unsuitable for  possessing colossal fortunes. Here, in order to somehow distinguish such \"new rich\" who have earned on cryptocurrencies, it is worth having an international term in English. Well, make your suggestions on how to call such people so that the comic meaning is still clear. I'm here  and thought that \"Hwale\" might well be such a word. What can you suggest?",

      "body": "The name 'Whale' IMO, was given to the animal Whale with no attribute of behavior attached to it. However, some English expressions use animal behavior to describe a phenomenon, For example, the word 'I smell a rat' - means something suspicious; causing a feeling that something is wrong or that someone is behaving wrongly. There is no point changing the phrase to may be 'atr', or other term as it may confuse people. IMO, I think it is more vivid to use the word 'Whale' as it makes a better/faster meaning to convey the message. the word 'Hwale' may be confusing and may create doubts on the exact message the person want to convey. Just my humble opinion.",

And Whale doesn't eat other fish, it eats one plankton. You missed the biology class, right?First no, there are whales that eat fish, there are whales that squid, and while everyone called them dolphins both killer whales and sperm whales are also a part of the toothed whale order. And as the name suggests those things kill everything from sharks to other whales.Quote from: delfastTions on May 15, 2022, 03:52:04 PMBut of course, \"Hwale\" may not take root, but you still need to come up with some kind of word to refer to such \"new rich\" in crypto. Of course, it won't because it's just a rip-off from HODL, nothing more.Anyhow, the term whale was not invented by crypto lovers, it's a term borrowed from gambling as that's one of the first things that really took off with crypto and it's about being a high roller. you can check the forum yourself, before 2012 nearly all the talk about whales was about the animal itself.",

      "body": "It's good that you expressed your thoughts on the issue here. I agree that \"Hwale\" really looks like a plagiarism from \"hodl\". I also agree that \"hwale\" is unlikely to be accepted by the crypto community. But I think that the attitude towards random mega-rich cryptocurrency holders should be a little ridiculous but also dismissive. For such people, a special international term should be established. And I think the widely used word \"whale\" does not quite accurately refer to such people. After all, whales are now understood, for example, exchanges, institutional investors, developers of a successful altcoin, and so on. It turns out that \"whale\" is not exactly \"new rich\". So the term \"Whale\" is not accurate. \"Whale\" is too general a concept. It is necessary to isolate directly from this term \"new rich in crypto-currency\". \"\" \"Lambo, Island, Tanned mulattos in swimsuits on the beach under palm ... ...\"",
