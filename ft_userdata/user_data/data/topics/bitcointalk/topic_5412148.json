The question is how does the Priave Key Is generated and where it is stored ?  If the private key is generated when your computer is online then it directly can go to the o blockchain Private Key database. And it is not impossible for hackers to find it by using some kind of hacking tools. When you generate a new BTC address it automatically generate a private key and store it in the local blockchain private key dataxtorage. If you connect your computer you cannot be sure that if a pink back spy wares is present in your computer it will ultimately Transport to the hacker. For secure private key plus second stage password could be an extra security that every one need. So their fund will remain in their Bitcoin address safe. But how about offline btc transaction worked with your private key in you local network ?   And how does it published latter in the Blockchain ?",

The private key should never go to the blockchain.The private key is stored only locally, this is why it is best to generate your private keys in a off-line environment (air gapped).The only thing that goes to the blockchain the signature that goes along with the transaction. The signature is made using the private key.The private key is really just a really big number. You can generate it using just by flipping a coin 256 times, for example.",

So their fund will remain in their Bitcoin address safe. What do you mean by second stage password?Do you mean 2FA? If so, it's not a good idea to use 2FA for securing your wallet. If you want to use 2FA, you have to rely on third parties and that defeats the purpose of bitcoin. Generate the keys on an air gapped device and keep them safely. That's enough.",

      "body": "i think the topic creator is probably confusing a online service. NAMED \"blockchain.info\" thinking that this service is \"the blockchain\"its not. its just a service for a online wallet that chose to call itself something that relates to something crypto related. much like tesla is nothing to do with nikola tesla, but called tesla to be related to a business thats related to electric inventions..anywaya private key is not found on the bitcoin network blockchain.. EVERif you use an online SERVICE/BUSINESS, then there is a risk that the owner of the website could gain access to their database of passwords usernames and keys they store on their website. so be cautious.and be cautious about typing in such things into websites, becasue those websites might be hacked, phishing sites or have other issues. so be cautiousbut dont worry about private keys being on the bitcoin network blockchain.. there are none nor ever will beusing your own wallet to generate a private key, that key gets saved into a separate file called a wallet.dat file that is on your computer. again its not put onto \"the blockchain\" EVER",

      "body": "Quote from: DigitalMonk on September 02, 2022, 03:01:27 PMThe question is how does the Priave Key Is generated and where it is stored ? It all depends on which approach you had taken when generating your private key because, in some cases, like using offline methods to generate randomness, your keys don't touch the online environment at all and are stored nowhere except for physical media such as paper or metal. If, however, an insecure device connected to the Internet was used to make a private key, the information of this creation could be stored on your HDD or on some remote server controlled by a malicious actor.Quote from: DigitalMonk on September 02, 2022, 03:01:27 PMIf the private key is generated when your computer is online then it directly can go to the o blockchain Private Key database. And it is not impossible for hackers to find it by using some kind of hacking tools. The bitcoin blockchain has no database containing private keys, and it even doesn't care if a certain address has a corresponding private key. It only cares about data structure being present in a correct format to track the chain of ownership changes. If some of the addresses representing ownership cannot be spent due to a lack of private keys, the blockchain simply keeps this data unchanged forever.Quote from: DigitalMonk on September 02, 2022, 03:01:27 PMBut how about offline btc transaction worked with your private key in you local network ?   And how does it published latter in the Blockchain ? You can sign transactions offline by attaching a cryptographic signature that can only be created with a private key. An offline transaction cannot be modified or altered by a malicious actor, but to make your transaction financially significant you first need to broadcast it using whatever method of transmitting data that is able to reach the nodes connected to the Internet and the bitcoin system. Once your transaction gets into a block and receives a sufficient number of confirmations, it becomes an immutable record of ownership transfer.",
