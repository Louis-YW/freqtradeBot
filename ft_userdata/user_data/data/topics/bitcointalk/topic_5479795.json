The key to your problem is just invest money which you didn’t need to spend in short term. Try to invest small regularly so that you will not be needing this money anytime soon for you to hold.It’s not about you being poor but rather just proper money management.

      "body": "The problem that you are having is that you are using the funds for important things to invest in bitcoin and this is why you cannot hodli. Since you are earning up to $3k, you should make a proper calculation on your monthly expenses and how much it is, after that, you should also keep some funds in reserve for emergencies that can occur in future. If all these are done, you should look at the amount left and if it is still up to $500, you should keep $400 aside and use only $100 to buy bitcoin regular, either weekly or monthly based on when you do get paid. If it is weekly, you accumulate the amount for one month to make sure it is $100. Always buy bitcoin with this amount every monthly, and practice this for four years, it is called DCA method. Forget that you have an investment somewhere, but your concern should be your constant buying to keep on increasing your bitcoin portfolio. Then be patient with your investment for a very long time. Before you know it, you will have a significant amount of bitcoin in your portfolio after four years. However, if after doing all your calculations and you just have let me say $20 below, you should cut down your expenses and also look for a second means of income to enable buy bitcoin and hodli for a long time and also it will help you to be able to increase your bitcoin portfolio. Only use the money that will not be useful to you for a long time to invest in bitcoin so that you can hodli.",

I cant really blame out someone on missing out those profit making opportunity on holding Bitcoin for long because i do experience it even upto now that i do need to convert those coins into fiat because this is part for me to be able to survive on day to day living.I do have an income from my day job but since i do have my own family and having this worsening economical conditions then additional expenses would really be there on which my paycheckdoesnt really fit out on the expense that you could really be having and this is why it would really be leaving no choice but for you to make out adjustments accordinglyeven if it means that you would really be needing to sell those coins even if you do plan on holding it for long term.",

There are potential investors who are avoidant because the market price of Bitcoin is so high right now. But the catch here is that nothing requires us to own 1 Bitcoin in an instant. We are free to do partial investments of it little by little, just an amount you won't need in times of emergency. Problem is that we are giving or putting everything to it which makes our pockets 'thinner' than the usual. The difference of only investing an amount you can really afford (afford means you can just let something for years without worrying about it), than forcing things out. First and foremost we have circumstances to deal with. Many investors are pushed to edge of selling early because of situational issues on their end and circumstances along the way while holding. This is where investors are suffering from loss which we should avoid in the first place as much as possible.Quote from: Barikui1 on December 30, 2023, 05:09:46 PMBefore investing into Bitcoin, you have to firstly have a source of income, because if you don't do that and depends sorely on the dividend on your Bitcoin investment, you will surely eat up your Bitcoin investment bit by bit till it's been exhausted.So my brother you need a source of income first before thinking of investing in Bitcoin.Not only just a source of income but something stable and consistent for you to have enough 'margin' to engage with investments and to eventually develop additional income.

Try to invest small regularly so that you will not be needing this money anytime soon for you to hold.It’s not about you being poor but rather just proper money management. It’s not necessary for you to invest big immediately.Exactly. If you are only putting in purely extra money (like long term savings / retirement money) into Bitcoin then you won't be in this situation where you always end up having to sell bitcoin to pay for something.Figure out your budget, cover spending as well as short term savings to build up an emergency fund, and see if you can have even just like $50-$100 per month extra that can go toward long term savings - this is what you should be putting into Bitcoin in order to hold long term so that you can realize that 10x or 20x gain over the next decade or so.",
