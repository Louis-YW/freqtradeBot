  "content": "Just like every other investment, it's necessary as bitcoin holders or intending holders to understand what could lead to your failure in the bitcoin investment so as to put out the right measures in place that will prevent it from happening.I did failure analysis of a welded system as my undergraduate research work and I know the importance of understanding the possible point of failure in a system and how important it his to protect such a system against such failure and I think this will be very much applicable in this Bitcoin space because if we know the risk associated with bitcoin investment, we would put out the right measures in protecting our holdings and our bitcoin holding will be safe for us.So I'm going to outline some major areas that I feel could lead us to experience looses in our bitcoin journey and look at how to protect ourselves against them.1. Drop in bitcoin value:    everyone accumulate bitcoin because they want an increase in it value which will yield them profit in a stipulated period of time and in the event that the price goes down bellow the amount you bought your bitcoin, fear might set in but we need to understand and come to term with the volatile nature of bitcoin and still continue holding on to it and that way the momentary loss comes back as a gain after the price of bitcoin has increased.2.  You could loose your private key or an intruder could get access to it.     This is also one major thing that could lead you to experience a loss in your bitcoin investment and because of how severe this loss is, it is very necessary to take your security very seriously. Apart from the normal posting and replies we do in the forum, it is very important to put in all the necessary security measures in place to avoid losing our private keys or allowing it to get into the wrong hands. Remember that people can get access to your device without necessary having physical contact with it so we need to make sure we write out our private keys and save ourselves stories that torches the heart.3.   Beware of hackers and fraudulent people  . This is very important at this stage where many persons are looking for newbies and victims that will fall prey to them. Avoid clicking links you are not sure of, their are mails you should avoid responding to and there are some random messages you shouldn't take seriously. Scammers are everywhere and have interesting tactics they can use on unsuspecting individual just to hack into their account. Watch out for them and be as careful as you can.These are just a few of the areas I feel could lead one to experiencing a loss in bitcoin investment and it's necessary we guide our selves in this areas to be on a safer side. If you have other areas you think we should consider taking very seriously, share it here so we can all learn together.",

Drop in bitcoin value:    everyone accumulate bitcoin because they want an increase in it value which will yield them profit in a stipulated period of time and in the event that the price goes down bellow the amount you bought your bitcoin, fear might set in but we need to understand and come to term with the volatile nature of bitcoin and still continue holding on to it and that way the momentary loss comes back as a gain after the price of bitcoin has increased.One thing we sometimes quantify bitcoin with is the price raise, bitcoin distinctive advantage is the fact that it’s value does falls but the price which is use to quantify it that raises and falls due to the demand and supply volatility, if not 1 bitcoin is always equal to 1 bitcoin. Over the years the bitcoin has proven to always increases in price and as such for you to get the maximum profit in price you just need to hold for long period.

The simplest solution is once you are holding for a long period of time or even hold large amounts of bitcoin, avoid online storage of your funds, go fully into offline storage either by buying a hardware wallet or airgap your device, and also store the seed or keys offline in a secure place.",

You could loose your private key or an intruder could get access to it.     The point is if you lose your private key or mnemonic seed, you lose your bitcoin.Who will have access to that private key or mnemonic seed is not necessary related to you because you must assume you lose your bitcoin after losing private key/ mnemonic seed.So, let's repeat and remember it every day.\"I have to backup my private key/ mnemonic seed safely and my backups must work for me\"Quote3.   Beware of hackers and fraudulent people  .

Secondly they can not completely save you if you fail at first two points practically.",

Otherwise, no matter how you protect your investments, one moment of carelessness can work against you and your investments.This is true, after observing all the security measures, if a person makes the costly mistake of paying into a wrong wallet, this can never be undone. Most times we're in such a hurry to copy and paste wallet address to send crypto coins, if there's any mistake of a single number or letter, and we go ahead to send, there's no redemption afterwards. So it's Important to always crosscheck the segwith, confirm that it's the same address before sending, this little exercise can save us from regrets if mistake where to occur.",

If you have issues on your wallet or exchanges it is best to chat their support on their official website. Although centralized exchanges do not have private keys except some few that have eternal wallets apart from the exchanges but on No account should the private key to personal wallet be given. Moreover exchanges should be the last place you keep funds and also telegram shouldn’t be a place you discuss about your bitcoin holdings. Should there be a senerio where you maybe sent funds to an exchange due to this high transaction fee saga it doesn’t drops in time, do not get frustrated and start chatting support even if you do and they request for private keys or seeds even if it is the real support channel do not give it out to them. The worst is to wait for the transaction and Monitor it on explorers till it gets confirmed or dropped. Even the right support for platforms could be compromised without one’s knowledge.",
