This area are essential aspects of the forum.But I notice no form of mercy, no form of live support chats, no indication of users who are online.If the forum can look into the following needs as a polite suggestions it will be great.* Am suggesting the forum to open a live support chat to both banned or active users.    This will help forum users to explain better of their errors, mistakes and plagiarism acts.* Email should has a quick and prompt response to enable both banned and active users to communicate their feelings.* Forum should indicate either puple, green or white colour lights on users who are online. This will enable easily replys when is post or comments are made.* Forum should make creation of newly register accounts easier to avoid making people to make use of fake names, emails and ID's.*  Forum should make available new reviews from the old rules and regulations. Please as I said earlier is an observation and polite suggestions. But I want to see your critics. Drop it thanks.",

If yes then BTT (Bitcointalk) do have merciful rules like if you violate some rules like spammy posts or bust posting and plagiarism posting or using AI content to get attention etc. Then you will not be banned instantly but you will be alerted with a warning so next time you should not do that.Here are some rules of merciness like if you do spammy posts it will be deleted by moderators and then your account will be temporarily banned and when you break the same rule 3 times your account might be banned permanently.Quote from: JamesBorn on March 28, 2023, 01:41:47 PMIf the forum can look into the following needs as a polite suggestions it will be great. I totally agreed with your suggestions, like a live support will help you a lot when your account got banned temporarily or permanently.Like you can get useful information from this topic about how to recover a ban account??? or read this topic Your Account got Banned ?

A chat, on the other hand, can give steel to some information if it is lost or not well interpreted.If you want to communicate with moderation, send a PM or open a topic about it.It is true that you speak in support chat, but this is no company. It is a forum, where it tends to be very open in communication. That's why a post, topic or PM should do 90% of the time.",

The support functions would be flooded with requests, spammers, etc. and would require a probably-impossible amount of manpower to properly maintain. If anyone has a problem with their ban, they can appeal it already. It's not common for a ban to be reversed, it's also not common that a ban is unworthy to begin with (based on all of the appeals that I have read).Quote from: JamesBorn on March 28, 2023, 01:41:47 PM* Forum should indicate either puple, green or white colour lights on users who are online.
