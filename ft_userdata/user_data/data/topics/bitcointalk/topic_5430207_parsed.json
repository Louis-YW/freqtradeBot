Does it mean that one can just wake up from the cloud create an account and start scamming people? As I see OP is a new bee here without any platform knowledge of how things works best onboard this platform.  OP seems to have uploaded a scam site here for people to start patronizing his product but forget to know that this is not just an any how platform where you could just mess up with and go Scot free. It's not so here OP I must say you made the wrong calculation and also, you met the wrong people. OP o would suggest you go back to your drawing board to get a bigger and clearer picture of your project before coming back here.",
