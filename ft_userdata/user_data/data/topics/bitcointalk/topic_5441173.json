  "content": "I Was reading through the comment box of an interesting tweet shared by Rizzo, about a man that sold 160btc at 0.003 per 1 about $0.48. Went further to read the reddit link shared below the tweet and discovered that it was our super admin Theymos.  According to him he was getting the BTC easily with his computer and felt that the 5 cent price per btc was way too expensive, so reduced his price to $0.003 per btc, which is, according to his response, the lowest price of btc sales ever recorded. This was interesting to many users that they couldn't help, but ask if such an amazing opportunity is still available.  However, the forum has made lots of history in the market regarding the opportunities it provided for the early birds, but i'm not sure he sold all the 160btc as he didn't mention it, he only said he sold at $0.003.

You must to have something, other deals to compare.The first successful trade with Bitcoin is Pizza for bitcoins?It equates to $41 in 2010$41 for 10,000 BTC and 1 BTC was traded at $0.0041, 41 cents. It is a higher price than theymos' deal.",

Its considered legendary to make the decision as of a time when people knew nothing about bitcoin, the buyer or buyers may have sold higher, who knows, but it'll be lesser to what he/they would have made in 2021 if they/he held. Yet it's obvious that sellers are making it to mainstream, and top influential pages on social media often share such contents. Hence, always amazing to read how people sold bitcoin in lesser prices. And that won't stop, even in future the price we sell now would be considered legendary, and stunning to readers. Well, who could tell how the transaction was executed. If he sold to different people, or a person bought the whole 160btc. The first named would be considered a giveaway.",

Well, if you look at it, despite selling at that price, theymos has continued to accumulate more over time. Just by seeing that the forum no longer takes advertising because it is sitting on so many bitcoins that it doesn't need it, we realise that selling at a cheap price is not the end.There were many others who sold for a small profit and did not accumulate more. Or people who bought bitcoin, sold at a loss when MtGox or others went down and never bought again.One lesson we should take from this is that no matter how much you sell for, it is always a good time to accumulate more.",

Who would have guessed back then that this would become so revolutionary for the evolution of our monetary system. Bitcoin is definitely one of the few things I love about our modern age.

That is pure wishful thinking and nothing more, most likely the only ones which still retain some of the coins they bought or mined on the early days are super strong hands and those which at some point lost access to their coins and then they recover them somehow.So it is pure fantasy to think that one of those people wishing to have heard of bitcoin on the early days will still have their coins, as those coins could have been stolen, lost, spent or gambled away.",

After so many years, it has evolved and now we see millions of people transacting using bitcoin. This will only grow from here onwards.

Kind of funny TBH, but even those early adopters at that time didn't know what is the future of Bitcoin thus, they sold some of them for sure. I would not hold it either if I'm one of the early adopters of that time of Bitcoin. Bitcoin at it's early stage is almost the same as any other new projects today. No one can trust it at all, if they see the coin pumped, they will sold it immediately and they have no guts to hold it for a very long time. Even theymos can't hold it at that time thus, he sold it as well.  It's good that there are some educational videos from Youtube right now, and documentaries online that can convince and attract people towards investing in Cryptocurrency. In that way, more people will buy it. Those who trusted it at that time and still holding until now (or at least sold at it's peak or near to it) are the ones who profited the most, and the ones who sold it earlier are probably regretting just a little bit with their decisions.",

Maybe Theymos will find a moment to say a few words?Now events such as selling 160btc for $0.48 or a couple of pizzas for 10.000BTC seem highly unreasonable due to the current rate of bitcoin. It seems like a lot of wealth has been lost, but in fact, it is not. Don't forget that btc was obtained with less difficulty, as it is possible now, and therefore corresponds to the sale price.All these events have made a significant contribution to the rise of bitcoin to fame and have played an important role in history of this. This is priceless. You don't have to measure them in terms of money. 160btc at $0.003 per 1 or pizza for bitcoin. Their influence can't be measured in dollars, even with many zeros.",

For all we know bitcoin could've went south and he may have won big from that profit. I'm getting off to a tangent here but the point I'm trying to make is that to someone living in let's say 2009-2010, bitcoin is nothing like the bitcoin we are seeing and investing in now. To the people back then it was nothing, not worth more than the lint in your pocket, and basically just another penny stock you can invest in.",
