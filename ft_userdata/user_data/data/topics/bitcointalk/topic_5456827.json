Something that I check validity by myself.My server is gone, so i'm no longer running bitcoin core, but isn't there a \"getblockheader\" parameter in bitcoin-cli?EDIT: i'm currently using getblock.io (which is free for personal use)... I tested the getblockheader parameter, and it seems to work:Code:curl --location 'https://btc.getblock.io/mainnet/' \\--header 'x-api-key: my_api_key' \\--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\--data ' {    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",    \"method\": \"getblockheader\",    \"params\": [        \"00000000000000000003db936a59e25354d7c9ad0b1922ae9430cf2643d0966f\",        true    ],    \"id\": \"getblock.io\"}'In reality, you'll have to combine this with the \"getbestblockhash\" parameter in order to get the hash of the block @ the tip of the chain... When you have this hash, plug it into the bitcoin-cli getblockheader command to get things like the merkleroot, time, nonce, bits,...If you're not running a reference implementation of the node software (bitcoin core), and you don't want to use getblock.io, there's always https://www.chainquery.com/bitcoin-cli/ aswell (which works without signing up, but you cannot automate using chainquery)",

Something that I check validity by myself.Depends on how you mean to check it yourself. There are two interpretations. The easy way: run bitcoin-cli getblockheader <BLOCK_HASH>, and check yourself the block header (with nonce included). You can also run bitcoin-cli getblock <BLOCK_HASH> 0 to get the raw block data (the zero indicates that it will return hexadecimal string). And the hard way: write the functions that perform block header validation from scratch.I think you mean the former. Indicative executions for block=1:Code:$ bitcoin-cli getblockheader 00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048{  \"hash\": \"00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048\",  \"confirmations\": 795025,  \"height\": 1,  \"version\": 1,  \"versionHex\": \"00000001\",  \"merkleroot\": \"0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098\",  \"time\": 1231469665,  \"mediantime\": 1231469665,  \"nonce\": 2573394689,  \"bits\": \"1d00ffff\",  \"difficulty\": 1,  \"chainwork\": \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200020002\",  \"nTx\": 1,  \"previousblockhash\": \"000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\",  \"nextblockhash\": \"000000006a625f06636b8bb6ac7b960a8d03705d1ace08b1a19da3fdcc99ddbd\"}Code:$ bitcoin-cli getblock 00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048 0010000006fe28c0ab6f1b372c1a6a246ae63f74f931e8365e15a089c68d6190000000000982051fd1e4ba744bbbe680e1fee14677ba1a3c3540bf7b1cdb606e857233e0e61bc6649ffff001d01e362990101000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0704ffff001d0104ffffffff0100f2052a0100000043410496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858eeac00000000",

Something that I check validity by myself.There are innumerable ways to retrieve information about Bitcoin blocks, including previous block hash.

Am I missing something?By using modern hardware, you can quickly run out of possible nonce values, but this is not the only data that can be changed to calculate a block hash. When miners have no additional values to create a hash from, they can slightly modify a timestamp or change the ordering of transactions or transactions themselves. Once they changed the value, they start increasing nonce and change block data again and again until they find a hash below the target or until they lost the current competition. The number of possible combinations is so vast that it takes minutes to find a correct value. The number you see in a successful block is just one of the possible solutions: combinations of nonce+timestamp+merkle root.See this answer for additional information: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/67771/why-the-nonce-is-difficult-to-find-in-bitcoin",

Am I missing something?They can indeed reach even the maximum nonce value in a second.But there's something called an \"extra nonce\" which can be anything in the block header that could be changed after the maximum nonce in reached.Each miner has their unique or simply a widely-used method of getting extra nonce,For example, some pools are changing a value in their coinbase transaction's OP_Return output which will produce a different \"merkle root hash\".With that they can restart the nonce since there's something's changed in the block header.",
