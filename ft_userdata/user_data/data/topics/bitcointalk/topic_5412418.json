There have been monitoring apps and accounts that follows this specific action from the whales. But for most traders, this could be a big thing as it looks like an indicator as there's a possible sell-off that can happen at any time to affect the price. Whoever may be the owner of that address, deserves the profit he's about to take, after almost a decade of holding it.",

People buy and sell every single day. If you do this at a 70% discount and yearly lows, you're a fool.",

Or are you surprised that a whale had 5,000 BTC in his wallet at that time?Because I don't find anything unique in this case and also see it as a normal thing because someone who can only have 5,000 BTC in his wallet and if it's been sold, then you don't have to worry about what the pope has done. But if it still hasn't been sold, I don't think the whale will immediately sell everything at such a low price as it is now.",

And we should not care.What you posted is FUD: the numbers can be seen as big and scary by the inexperienced, but it's actually just a fraction of the coins sold and bought on a daily basis. Even more, somebody with such amounts of coins is usually not so stupid to break the price and sell at a loss.Still, we're in bear market, so the price can still go lower (or higher!).

And we don't know why, it's happening that is another big reason. And we don't know where that BTC came from.

There’s a possibility too that this Bitcoin belongs to a project treasury like what Luna do when UST under attack. I think a single whale will not put all his money on exchange at a single deposit since it will be risky for him to do that. It’s more believable to assume that this money belongs to a project or group that involves on investment.",
