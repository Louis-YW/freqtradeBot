Because it's very likely that most of us, including you, will fail at first attempts. Therefore, having other parts of your capital for later attempts is not a bad idea.Quotein my opinion, if our invest in crypto for beginners and invest with large capital, it seems that if you fail, you will experience big losses, but if you make a profit, it will definitely be big, so what do you think?Think of risk first.Think of how to protect your initial capital is important too.Don't over think about profit and try to bet all your capital because you think you will get big profit if you bet all your capital at one time.",

      "body": "\"Investing\" is pretty much a gamble at the beginning if you don't know what you're doing, most especially if we're talking about cryptocurrencies. So obviously go small.Mostly though, I mostly say invest as much money depending on your conviction or how convinced you are that a certain asset is a good investment. Just make sure you actually know what you're buying, and not buying a certain asset just because some Reddit post or some YouTuber told you it's a good buy.",

Investing in cryptocurrency will be profitable if you understand how it works, crypto is a type of investment that is high risk and high gain, so before you put money in cryptocurrency you better understand crypto and know the risks.If you want to buy (Bitcoin) and other crypto it's better when the market is in a negative condition because the opportunity to go to a positive condition is huge.",

If you did invest that amount and again waited to 20x, you'd be up between 20% and 200% of those initial funds which would still be an extremely impressive rate of return - especially if you're able to invest the rest of your money in accounts that can pay that amount in interest within a year (particularly if banks or stocks where you are can offer 4-8% returns a year). The figures used here were based off the last few bull market cycles taken individually, we could do better or worse but don't make either a concern if you take away the idea of investing with any money you need to survive plus an emergency fund of a few months if you can afford it.",

But at the same time, you are right; in the future, the total profit will not be very large either. You need to develop a habit, or behavior, if I may say so, of making regular investments without paying attention to the current value. And at the same time, determine the period for which you want to invest your money. But, again, the old learned rule: you are the owner of your money, and you are responsible for their safety, so you need to know how to handle and how store your passwords and keys. And, of course, invest in an amount that will not disrupt your daily life. Don't forget, there is only one life, and you need to live here and now.",

If you start big, you'll definitely make expensive mistakes that might cause you your interest in the industry. Many newbies that came into the industry and went big on their investment aren't profitable anymore like those that bought coins that are no longer existing or trading at the highs when they bought but now with no hope of returning back to those ATH price Many newbies jumping into investing goes for altcoins since they're over hype and all over the media but with time they grow to understand that chasing after those hyped coins aren't the way to go about investing in cryptocurency.The best investing strategy which is DCA (dollars cost averaging) that has been tested to be profitable over time has to do with investing small capital for a long period of time and that alone should convinced you that starting small is always the best way to start. I think everyone makes a costly mistakes in the industry and it's best you make yours when the impact will be less felt than when it could cost you all your life's savings.",

Most probably that if anyone invest now, big profit would be the result, but very good to still always keep in mind that investing in altcoins can be a big loss.Make appropriate research and find good coins to invest, but the best coin ever has been bitcoin. Getting the right time of investing in coins is very important to achieve profits, because the losses can be more. I think you should answer the question yourself, you already know that if you invest too much, the losses can be greater, but while the profit can be greater too, invest the amount you are capable of.",

When I said the money that you can afford to lose is now left to you and what you worth because the amount you invest will determine your profit and lose. Doing my first time investment in bitcoin I invested just $20 but that time I can afford to lose $100 but I didn't invest in it do that invest small capital, but after doing the time that Bitcoin price was increase small I did not make  profit  like that because my capital was so small,so what  I am trying to say is invest the money that you don’t need in you daily, weekly and monthly activities. But all you need to know first the risk in crypto involves so that you can be strong whenever anything is happening in crypto market.",

Crypto space is now flooded with multiple coins which must of them are just scam coins and shit coins, so I will advice you to avoid altcoins. If you are planning to invest, then just invest in bitcoin and have peace of mind. Also if you are planning to invest in bitcoin, then you should be prepared to hold for long term.",

It is also important that you have a strategy and that you know what you want, and that you understand all the possible risks that come with it. If you invest long-term in Bitcoin, you can always expect that the price of the same will change, and that during that time you will be in loss or gain, but until you decide to sell, you are in an unrealized loss or gain, so you have to prepare for all these situations in such a way that you are not caught by too much euphoria or panic.",

And it depends on your risk tolerance level, so we can't make a generalization about whether you should invest with small or large capital. If you can handle some big losses, get in with more money. If you're risk averse and unable to recover from big losses, you may want to get started with small investments. However, that's just my opinion from my own experience. Everyone will have their own differing views on this subject.Before you make any investment decisions, always do your research and plan ahead. Take the time to look into the potential risks and rewards, examine which cryptocurrencies are worth investing in, and create a strategy that lets you ride out any bumps along the way. Regardless of the amount you decide to invest, your due diligence is crucial. Good luck!",

Many had suffered losses in their early days which is why people here are suggesting starting by investing a small amount and gradually increasing it once you are fully knowledgeable about the market. Yes, having a huge capital will possibly give big rewards also but you can't just underestimate the volatility of the market and many people got it wrong. And I hope you don't and I hope you would listen to us, otherwise, never blame the market for whatever happens to you if you push yourselves to invest a huge amount.",
