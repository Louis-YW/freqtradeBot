This will be very useful if I use it in discussion boards that contain a lot of spammers.another question from me is . \"Is this feature (moderation by myself) free to use on every board, or can it only be used on certain boards?\"",

Can you say what boards this applies too? This is going to be bad if it is on certain boards, cause some people can edit threads to benefit them, I really hope it is just the off-topic board.The excluded sections are Meta (except for this topic), Scam Accusations, Important Announcements, and Auctions. Tagged scammers can't use this feature. You don't have to participate in self-moderated topics if you're worried about manipulation by the OP.Since the post is from 2013, when the self-moderated feature was added, Iâ€™m not sure if it is up-to-date with the board exclusions, as there might have been changes at some point later down the road.",

      "body": "Some of my threads are self-moderated and it's neat feature to have. Sometimes I forget to tick the option and at other times I intentionally don't want a self-modded thread. I personally don't like to see self-moderated threads when money is at stake or someone's reputation. People might question your motives if you are moderating such threads yourself. It makes it look like you are trying to hide something. But with the bots we have scrapping the forum nowadays, that's practically impossible to do. I also remember seeing reputation threads or accusations against a person or group in threads that were self-moderated and had local rules that restricted those individuals from posting. That doesn't make much sense. You don't accuse someone of something but don't allow them to share their side of the story so that the community can approach the issue in a neutral way.",
