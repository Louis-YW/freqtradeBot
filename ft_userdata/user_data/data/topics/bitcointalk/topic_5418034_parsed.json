  "content": "They are no difficulty in managing that which we can control, it's all over the web2 kind of internet, and one thing is under every creator's control  — post count. If done the right way with good and valuable pictures, write-ups, or videos the account builds, and the likes start coming in every day. The same applies to the forum. We can only control the post counts, and the result of our account growth depends on how well that which we can control is been managed. Think of the forum as another social media and apply the same method. Create good content and remain consistent from time to time. Most people post once a week or twice a week on social media even on their blog and maintained that frequency. I think if a person who wants to rank up in the forum is frequent with the number of times they visit the forum and make good quality content they will always strive, so far the content is quality. Since we can't control the amount of merit a post is to get for us, then the right thing to do is worry about the one in your control if it can make good out of that which you can't control.",

Would it be really bright, or does it look like pouring water from a full bucket into an empty one?Well your opinion is good but the way web2 works it's almost the same everywhere. They is no huge difference between this forum and a social media because social medias like twitter have special interest boards which is what a forum means in the networking terms. And if a user don't post or answer a question their account won't be visible in on the board or forums. Web2 is Web2 no difference. Reddit has upvotes and karma, webhostingtalk has likes, namepros has ranks etc. Unlike Web1, Web 2 allow users to post and share information on the internet which is how every other sites works including this forum and social media. They is no much difference just the Interface and how people utilize the niche they want. So if a person have an interest of ranking on any site including this forum they must be consistent to get visible and impressions in form of likes or merits. We are all here to learn and to learn you must acknowledge what you have learnt by creating threads to help build more knowledge into the subconscious. Sugar-coating the forum for newbies will end up having a forum where no much information will be shared when many of us stop using the forum due to businesses or other things. I think being consistent and learning truly is a good advise for the newbies and everyone cheers.",

Little goals always brings you closer to a greater one and most of all, it serves as a source of encouragement.
