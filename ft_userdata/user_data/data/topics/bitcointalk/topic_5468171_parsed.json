  "content": "Everyone has Spotify installed on their mobile phone, if it is not Spotify then you would have a local app for streaming music on the go. None would pay you to listen to songs, like, comment, and dislike the song on their platform. They would charge you a monthly or yearly subscription amount to use their platform. With Web3 applications coming out daily, there was void space in the music streaming and engagement sector. Clousound noticed this problem and found an opportunity to create a rewarding platform that incentivizes its users. Using the BNB Smart Chain every active user would be paid a fixed amount of $CLS token for listening to songs, liking, commenting, disliking, and much more.The feature that made me write about them was when I found out on earn $CLS link that, anyone can earn their token by uploading any song without worrying about copyright issues. Meta and its products have been doing it for some time, I am assuming that they are following the same terms. The total supply of Clousound tokens goes down with each transaction, making it deflationary. I think it is an interesting project which I believe is unique, that is the reason for me sharing about this project here.I am not shilling or promoting this project, I am not part of the team. I felt the project was unique, not sure if other projects have been already discussed here.  Where is $CLS being traded? You can trade $CLS on PancakeSwap using the contract address 0xf848110edfF52f506CB0F256cbB641B5Ef9c9c2d.Do you guarantee the project won't quit?I do not guarantee anything. You have to make your own decision.Future of this applicationIf you're into crypto and music like me, check out Clousound. It's a cool way you can earn while enjoying the tunes you love! Let me know what you think if you end up trying it out. Website link: https://www.clousound.com",

      "body": "Looks like a good project but how much longer can they sustain this model? I do not see any revenue generation other than user buying their token from the DEX. What about the copyright act, they seem to allow song uploads too. Can you upload anyone else song without buying the right one? I did not see any information regarding it on their platform. The token does not have good liquidity as it is a brand-new project. If you can share some more information about this project then I can look into it. I do not want to register for the sake of earning their tokens.",

      "body": "Revenue generation becomes a problem for such projects.I remember only one Music based project that was promoted in this forum and I took part in their campaign, it was Viberate. It seems pretty good when it first came out and it was giving out rewards in VIB token at that time for people who contributed to their database of artists. The plan was to allow VIB to pay for artists in getting up gigs and concerts.Eventually they stopped going that path and changed their approach and now the coin is of no use. Although the team is genuine and they have offices in many countries.Still they all end up being a pump and dump, mostly because of the lack of acceptance of crypto.",

      "body": "Op I appreciate your effort in enlightening us about this new project but the fact that their revenue cycling has not been properly understood I don't think I'll be taking it as a means of earning but rather a site for streaming and having fun uploading some music, and beside correct me if I'm wrong, I was unable to find the link for withdrawal of earned CLS coin or will all earned CLS coin remain in the site?, or was the idea of earning created by the developer to trick people into uploading, commenting, etc so as to gain traffic in the site?. Including their comment on music, it wasn't functioning properly when I tried it. I think the developer has to still make some corrections if truly his intention is for the grater good.",
