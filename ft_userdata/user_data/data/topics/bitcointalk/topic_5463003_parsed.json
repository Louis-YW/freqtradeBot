I increased the fee to 4satoshi - Fee per vbyte and broadcast the transcation.Now when i check the old Tx, it says it is not found.  OLD TX, NOT FOUNDI see a new TX ID and it is still pending confirmation.My question is that the fee which i paid in the old tx, 0.00005064 BTC, where does it goes? Is it lost?Because in my new TX, the fee is 0.00012064 BTC (4.0 sat/vB) or did the OLD tx fee added to it  Also how long will it take for this new transaction to be confirmed with 4.0 sat/vB fee ?",

The terms have nothing to do with what output is created by your transaction.Full RBF is a setting for nodes. If a node has been enabled \"full RBf\", it will allow all unconfirmed transactions in its mempool to be replaced by a new one paying higher fee even if they have not been flagged as RBF.",

The old transaction remains perfectly valid. The new higher paying transaction is far more likely to be confirmed in a block, but there is nothing stopping a miner from including the old one if they choose or if they don't learn about the new one for some reason. I can see that OP has bumped his fee again, this time to 7 sats/vbyte, and his transaction has now confirmed. I would also suggest to OP that I don't know where he is getting his bitcoin from, but receiving >40 outputs to the same address, some of only a few thousand sats, is a very inefficient way to use bitcoin. You should try to receive larger amounts less frequently if you can. And given that almost all of those outputs predate the current surge in fees, I don't know why you've chosen to consolidate them now when you could have consolidated them at 1 sat/vbyte almost any time over the past year.",

If i remember it correctly it was around 0.00021064.After reading your post, i came to know that even if we receive small amounts on the SAME bitcoin address, when we withdraw from that wallet, it will detuct a lot of fee. Don't know the reason for this as all the bitcoin are in the same wallet address.Another thing was that i only send around 5$ to some address, why it used a change address in the transaction and move all my funds to a new address in my wallet. Maybe this was the reason of high fee    How to send to certain wallet without using the change address  Another question is that since the fee these days is always above 6Sat/vbyte usually, when can we perform that consolidations as you mentioned ?",

Don't know the reason for this as all the bitcoin are in the same wallet address.Bitcoin transactions are based on outputs, not on balances. Every time you receive some bitcoin, that creates a new output, even if you receive to the same address multiple times. Each of those outputs remains separate until you combine them in a transaction as you just did, and when you do you must pay a fee for each individual output, regardless of how much bitcoin is on that output. I can see you had outputs ranging from around 10,000 sats up to 0.02 BTC.Think of it like receiving physical coins and putting them in your pocket. Even if you receive hundreds of coins, they don't magically turn in to a $20 bill in your pocket. Only by spending them altogether and getting back a $20 bill in change can you combine them in to a single output.Quote from: noormcs5 on August 13, 2023, 04:57:19 AMAnother thing was that i only send around 5$ to some address, why it used a change address in the transaction and move all my funds to a new address in my wallet. Maybe this was the reason of high fee  Yes, this was the reason for the high fee. You had plenty of outputs which could have made the 20,000 sat payment on their own. Instead your wallet chose to consolidate every output you had in the same address and return the rest to you in a single output as change. This will benefit you in the future by saving you fees in the long run, but as I said above, you could have performed this consolidation at a better time to pay less fees now as well.Electrum has a feature known as coin control which allows you to spend just a single output when making such a transaction rather than consolidating all your outputs, if you wish.Quote from: noormcs5 on August 13, 2023, 04:57:19 AMHow to send to certain wallet without using the change address  There will always be a change address unless you spend an output completely. Bitcoin cannot \"leave behind\" some part of an output. If you have an output of 20,000 sats and you send it all to the recipient (minus the fee) there will be no change. If you have an output of 100,000 sats and you pay 20,000 sats, the rest will be sent back to a fresh change address you control. You cannot skim off 20,000 and leave the other 80,000 behind.Quote from: noormcs5 on August 13, 2023, 04:57:19 AMAnother question is that since the fee these days is always above 6Sat/vbyte usually, when can we perform that consolidations as you mentioned ?If you don't need to spend those other outputs now, then just wait.

Particularly at the moment, fees are higher than usual for a couple of reasons. We still have plenty of ordinal spam clogging up the lower fee rates, there has been a couple of recent big swings in the price which always results in lots of transactions as people move coins to and from exchanges, but most importantly we are around 60 blocks behind where we should be for this difficulty period. If you knocked 60 MvB off the mempool we would be down in to the 5 sats/vbyte range.As I said above, it could take months for the mempool to settle back down again.
