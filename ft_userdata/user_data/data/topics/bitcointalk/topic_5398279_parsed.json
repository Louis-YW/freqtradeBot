But I'm just trying to make a proof first before suspecting anyone, that's why I search about his social media, address etc to see if he have another alts and cheat in the same campaign, even with the name alone achow10 is really close with achow101 (there's also achow102 but inactive). If giving negative tag because of impersonating someone is right, I will accept my wrong understanding.However for learning purpose, if I see someone made an account like my username e.g. Apocollapsa, Apocollapses, Apocollapse1 can I tag them with negative?",

Every other thing would be interpreted on the basis of a possible coincidence, the sort of posts the user has made and their actions generally since joining the forum.",

There were some cases I've seen with impersonation of theymos, Lauda, LoyceV and if I remember correctly all of them had a negative trust due to the possible security issues. If you have own alt account you can just leave a neutral note that you have control over it, and that's it. All this reminds me to the old homograph attacks, where tried using fake, similar in name, websites to trick users and steal funds. Here the case is not that extreme, but again fooling people even without purpose is still not nice. I tagged the user not because he had a similar name as the Mod, but because he was cheating in bounties.",
