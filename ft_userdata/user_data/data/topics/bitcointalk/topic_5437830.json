  "content": "I'm going to launch a bitcoin adoption campaign in my local community soon, and in order to give accurate guidance, I'm looking for the best alternative of exchange to suggest people where they can acquire their first bitcoin coins, and hold them (I know it's not recommended, but people aren't going to spend 100$ or more in a cold wallet).The main goal is to avoid fees, so they can buy more satoshis with the same amount of money. I thought about three alternatives:Crypto.com: zero withdrawal fees to bank account, 0,0750% fee on exchanges;Binance: 0,70$ withdrawal fees to bank account, zero fees on BTC/fiat pairs exchanges;Local digital bank: zero fees, average 1% spread fees on exchanges.From the above alternatives, I think Crypto.com is still the cheapest one, unless there are hidden fees I'm still not aware of. What do you think?Or do you recommend another alternatives?",

It is more important to have the fiat pairs you need.

Most of them wish they could go back in time and at least buy a hardware walletNot sure if this is the right time to recommend newbies using crypto.com, especially at a time when there is word that they could also have been affected by the FTX/Alameda scam.",

But when I can't find the best deal that I can, I'm transferring it to another exchange and that costs me a lot just to transfer it from Binance to my account. Anyway, there's an added service now in Binance where those users from respective countries that they support can now directly withdraw it from Binance to local bank account, I just can't find that blog of theirs but I saw it before.@OP, what you're doing is a good thing to make some information on how much the spread are from different exchanges available in your locale.",

If they enjoy the experience, they should adopt extra safety measures for larger invested funds.I find it a little ironic that you will talk about what's risky and what's not, and you will let them do the risky thing and not the safe one. It's like teaching them the fundamental dos and don'ts and you will let them do the don'ts and not the dos. That doesn't seem right. I understand that the amount is minimal. It's probably for the sake of simply showing them how it works, for the sake of the experience. But central to teaching newbies about Bitcoin is to create a wallet. And I mean a wallet, not an account in whatever centralized platforms. Omitting this very important learning step makes everything incomplete. I've noticed that you're wearing Stake signature. Why don't you make use of your Stake account for this. I believe the minimum withdrawal is $10 and it doesn't charge a fee. Am I right? Or why don't you send them the coins from your own wallet, one which allows you to use the lowest fee possible? That would be more interesting I guess.

I mean, there must be other ways. Yes, that is a good idea. I reached the conclusion I'm going to sell interested people bitcoins myself. Minimum withdrawal from Stake is 20,000 satoshis and there is a fee of 7000 satoshis. For larger transactions that fee is fine, but if they want to acquire a small amount, I can also make the transaction from freebitco.in platform, paying only 520 satoshis on fees (slow withdrawal).The point now is the receiver wallet... I know people in real life who invest in BTC and use only Binance to store their coins, so it's indeed the first option for the layman due to the accessibility, and they don't seem interested in self-custody. Moreover, it's out of my control if they prefer accessibility over safety, after all it's responsability of each adopter to take the possible consequences for their decisions. They will decide doing the don'ts or the dos, as they wish.My advice is that a hardware wallet is purchased, as that is the method I use and think it's pretty simple, while being safe.",
