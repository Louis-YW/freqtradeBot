I missed your in-depth analysis as I felt you would reply to those questions with details which you do more often. Not an issue as it was suddenly planned and executed by the OP. Still, we have plenty more events lined up in the future and I am thinking about Rakhi. Can we get a few sponsored and start an event next week wherein the winner would be given a prize as in satoshis? What do you think?",
