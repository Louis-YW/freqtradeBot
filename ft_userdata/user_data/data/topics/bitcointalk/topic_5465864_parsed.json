In my perspective, we are already in a bull market. However, because we are in the retracement phase, it is not too late to buy; we only need to figure out what the potential swing point is before the price continues to rise.",

There's no other choice that you've got upon having this condition of earning with lesser risk. If you want to protect your money from any risk then you can visit the branch near you and ask them for their products like a time deposit. That will secure your money more if you've got this type of condition. Staking is like the counterpart of it on this market but as you've said, you don't like low APYs.",

It is a passive income for those who have it to thank for and a true source for those who may be financially incapable or conservative as you hinted. Besides this, unless you got no choice or naysay about trading physical products or offering services with your skills, then trading altcoins using copy trading features and AI bots, might just be the solution to your inconsistent effort so far in the crypto space.",

The market condition is much lower now compared to other times, so you can invest the amount you have saved in these four years for a long period of time if you want. Now if you can invest in the market then undoubtedly you will get some good returns from the market. I appreciate your patience as you have waited for four years and since you have enough patience you will be well ahead in seizing this opportunity. Invest in any coin and wait some more time. While waiting like this, you will see a profit of twice the amount you have invested.",

I can't think of anything that can suit your needs except staking, which provides you with quite decent opportunities, depending on how much you're willing to risk. Firstly, you could go for stablecoins, either algorithmic or the most known ones such as USDC, TUSD, and so on; these, however, won't yield any significant APY but are generally safe options. On the other hand, algorithmic stablecoins offer much higher yields, but there's always the risk of facing a possible depeg for a variety of reasons, like we saw with UST.Moreover, you can opt for other pairs, except stablecoins, and achieve higher yields; however, with those, you'll face the risk of losing money due to impermanent loss, which is the possible devaluation of the coins you're staking.",

If you do find yourself not really that too patient when it comes to this market movement in between bear and bull cycles then this market isnt for you but since you've been here on this market for 4 years then its impossible that you arent really getting used to it. Somehow i do really be able to understand the pain and the boredom when it comes to waiting game which it would really be that so normal that on the time that you do see your portfolio or earning or income isnt really that something that in fast pace or that a significant one then this is where doubts would really be starting. You would be seeking for other options even though its less risks but something profitable. It doesnt exist i should say because dealing up with this space does really signifies that you would really be needing to deal with possible long bear market season and instead on freaking out then it would be better on securing out your position at the bottom and find and reap those profits on the time that market make out some reversals which i could say that this is only the situation.",

I don't presume you are a full time trader, else you would have noticed the few bull runs and traded to your advantage within this period. Hence the importance of joining a group where crypto signals and news is shared regularly so as to keep abreast with the market speculation and trend. This Bitcointalk offers a source of passive income, as much as Quora, YouTube , and any other social media could offer to any of its consistent and persistent users.

I was shuttling between OKX and Bitget at some point subscribing in their Shark Fin product which has been eventful but tbh one must have sizeable amount of assets to earn something reasonable. I also learnt another similar earning product (Snowball) was recently launched on Bitget. It could be worth exploring cos imho HODLing alone can be boring but could be interesting when you can utilize some of these product to compound your holding.",
