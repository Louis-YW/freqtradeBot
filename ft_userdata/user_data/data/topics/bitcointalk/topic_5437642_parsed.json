  "content": "Welcome to Metaplayer.oneIntroduction    Metaplayer.one is a decentralized metaverse platform that allows users to interact, create, and explore in a fully immersive virtual world. Built on blockchain technology, our platform offers a secure and decentralized environment for users to own and monetize their digital assets. With a wide range of tools and features, Metaplayer.one empowers users to create and participate in unique experiences, from gaming and socializing to education and business. Join the metaverse revolution and be a part of the future of online interaction on Metaplayer.oneWhy Metaplayer.one?    One of the key benefits of Metaplayer.one is its use of blockchain technology. This allows for true ownership and control of digital assets, giving users the ability to monetize their creations and trade and transfer assets without the need for a central authority. This level of decentralization also ensures that the platform is secure and transparent, with all transactions recorded on the blockchain and accessible to all users.    In addition to its use of blockchain technology, Metaplayer.one offers a wide range of tools and features for users to create and participate in unique experiences. Whether you're a gamer looking to explore new virtual worlds, a social butterfly looking to connect with others, or a business looking to expand your reach, Metaplayer.one has something to offer. With a wide range of customization options, users can create their own avatars, build their own in virtual worlds, and even create their own games and applications.    One of the most exciting aspects of Metaplayer.one is the ability for cross-world interactions. This means that users can interact with other users in different virtual worlds, opening up a whole new level of possibilities for collaboration and creativity. This feature is particularly beneficial for businesses and educators, as it allows for virtual meetings and conferences to take place in a fully immersive environment, and for students to collaborate on projects with their peers from around the world.    Another benefit of Metaplayer.one is that it is accessible to all.

Join the metaverse revolution and be a part of the future of online interaction on Metaplayer.one.Metaplayerone Mainnet:     MetadMetad is a Go implementation of Metaplayerone MainnetMetad has been a core part of Metaplayerone Mainnet. Metad was the Metaplayerone Mainnet implementations making it the most battle-hardened and tested client.Metad is an Metaplayerone Mainnet execution client meaning it handles transactions, deployment and execution of smart contracts and contains an embedded computer known as the (EVM) Ethereum Virtual Machine.Running Metad alongside a consensus client turns a computer into an Metaplayerone Mainnet node.     Consensus        BLS    BLS also known as Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS)—is a cryptographic signature scheme which allows a user to verify that a signer is authentic. It is a signature scheme that can aggregate multiple signatures. In Metaplayerone Chain, BLS is used by default in order to provide better security in the IBFT consensus mode. BLS can aggregate signatures into a single byte array and reduce the block header size.        POS    The core logic behind the Proof of Stake implementation is situated within the Staking Smart Contract.    This contract is pre-deployed whenever a PoS mechanism Metaplayerone Mainnet is initialized, and is available on the address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001 from block 0.        EPOCH    Epoch Blocks are a concept introduced in the PoS implementation of IBFT in Metaplayerone Mainnet.    Essentially, epoch blocks are special blocks that contain no transactions and occur only at the end of an epoch.    The Metaplayerone Mainnet Epoch is 43200 blocks (one day)METAd Coin :    METAd is the utility coin as well as the native gas coin of Metaplayerone Mainnet. METAd was created to uphold the following goals & objectives: To decentralize the ownership of Metaplayerone MainnetTo align our vision, values & incentives with those of our coin holders and reward them for being long-term supporters    The Metaplayer.one Coin economy is designed such that all of the revenue & values generated accrue to our validators and team, even including the gas fees as we operate on our own chain. Below are some of the use cases for METAd:NFTs as exchange, buy, sell, rent, lend, borrow and earn.Pay gas fees.Participate in Games.Performance based RewardsCommunity RewardsValidator RewardsBountiesMint NFTs (lands, assets, avatars and ids).Staking & become validator.    The maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 METAd pre mined at block 0.The distribution will last for 1030 days following the public sale.
