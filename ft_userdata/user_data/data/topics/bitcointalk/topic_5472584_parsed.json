Without them Bitcoin would have been popular but participation would have been lower. Many people who enter into cryptocurrency bought altcoins and tokens with the hope that they can get huge gains like Bitcoin offered early investors. Some actually succeeded while some also failed by buying shitcoins. Without tokens and other altcoins, Bitcoin would have been probably very expensive with less number of people using it",

Exactly this was what I'm trying to get there's only a giant if Embrace beliefs classify it as giant and it somehow for Bit coin but with the token falling and it seem to stand what if there were no tokens or other shitcoins, would it have been so popular like this or what will be it outcome if there's no sheetcoins and i believe they all kind of share a proper variation with BTC coming first",

You are welcome . I have you know the rules and regulations of the forum and the local board. Please read more and make comments from the read topics and from there, you can improve and create threads and don't just go straight to board and make threads. Avoid spamming and shot post then what brings you here, you go achieve am.Then back to your question. Your question is not straight forward but in a confused state. I don't know but let me try. Bitcoin doesn't depend on any token and it stands alone and that is why bitcoin operates in a decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain technology system. Yes other tokens are depending on bitcoin and bitcoin operates directly to himself or to a fiat currency for exchange.",

As the first.wey exist, the popularity come strong and meaningful come pass others wey follow am for back but however, other existing shit coins depend on Bitcoin to survive Naim make you see say anytime Bitcoin dey do well other coin too dey grow but of the reverse Na the case, other crypto too dey follow go slow too. That is why Bitcoin dey superior and unique pass every other token. So Bitcoin no dey dependent on any other shitcoin for survival.Lastly, I see say d don provide links for your perusal. I go advise make you to take time read the article them wey dey d link so that you go get more information and insight as things dey work here.",
