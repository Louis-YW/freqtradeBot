  "content": "I do recall that coingate used to have it as a option, but i dont find it anymore, and my only way to buy something for lets say 150 dollars top, is by phone bill, like landcall, sms, etc. Or if someone is playing some game which can be donated with phone bill in exchange we can roll. Thanks in advance. Also betting sites are okay if there are some, that accept this way of depositing.",

May I ask why someone would prefer that service over others ?Because it way easier and you pay your phone bill monthly even 2 months, also this is going to be, next way if sending small amounts of btc or whatever coin, they work on it. In some countries like in India or Africa thats the way they buy coins, idk exactly how they named it but for btc will be i think micro transcactions. I have buyed many times this way from daopay, they worked with coingate, but now services most of them aren't working, and also atm id rather spend some cash which i can pay later, than pay now,its good way, when u want to buy, but don't have in cash. Fortuno doesn't work too for me because they provide for only one phone company",

(I haven't tried this, DWYOR)Haven't figured out what causes the service to no longer work. If it's coingate's policy, there's the possibility of being constrained by the single regulation of payment services on the Continent. idk, try to find out more, maybe coingate has announced something about this on their social media.",
