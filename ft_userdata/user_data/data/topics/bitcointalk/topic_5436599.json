There are old guys and new guys in Bitcoin market and not all of them understand it. Even you are old participant in the Bitcoin market, there is chance that you have yet understood it.Understanding it is difficult, then applying your knowledge and understanding to have good decision is harder.QuoteImagine if the FTX collapse happen in 2017, I believe the impact will be more drastical compare to today, now I can boldly say that Bitcoin has now recovered all it's losses since the FTX collapsed, is this safe to say? Nothing is similar entirely in different years of history. Lot of different conditions in Bitcoin market, cryptocurrency market and their ecosystems as well as social conditions like politics, economics and others.FTX is one of biggest collapses in history of cryptocurrency market but it is not a first and won't be the last.QuoteI never expected the fast recovery that's why I said the world is finally understanding why Bitcoin is a necessity in every one's life, am I saying too much? Or you think I am right? If you fully understood 4 year cycle of Bitcoin, you should not say it. Because what you said shows that you did not understand the cycle. It will be a first time Bitcoin can recover fully very long time before its halving.",

I guess they're think hardware isn't completely safe too.

But for now, the spiral of bankruptcies this season is causing has to go away, if we want to see investors (read: users) buy more BTC which would ultimately raise its price to that level.Bitcoin probably has a mini bull run like it had in 2019 with a good mini recovery from $3700 to about $13,000 before it was pulled back to $6,000 to $7,000.If Bitcoin continues this recovery, I only expect it to touch $30,000 from that it will be pulled back like in 2019. From $30,000 to $20,000 is a good pull back in 2023 for Bitcoin. It will need months to be warmed up again for 2024 halving.QuoteThink about it, how do you expect Bitcoin to recover when a big player is declaring bankruptcy every few weeks? This isn't even a span of months we are talking anymore.Fud is everywhere, bankruptcy from big players in 2020 and 2021 have yet completed so there will be no bull run to $60,000 in 2023.

The more people begin to believe in the existence of a 4-year Bitcoin cycle, the more likely it is that this rule will not work in the future.  Yes, there is such a thing as a halving... The significance of the halving is that it reduces bitcoin inflation.  However, each subsequent contraction is less significant for Bitcoin than the previous one.  This is due to the fact that the miners have already mined most of the coins.  Therefore, we are not entirely sure when exactly the Bitcoin bear market will end and its bull market will begin.  It is also very difficult to objectively assess the impact of the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange on the dynamics of the price of bitcoin.",

The recovery is arguably pretty quick if we look at it since the FTX crash, but I would always be wary of anything that's deemed 100% secure. Even market speculation, including investors, are now starting to dare to take large-scale buying actions and choose to forget about the incident at FTX. Personally, I don't feel overly ambitious either during market recoveries or crashes what I'm still doing is dropping a few dollars every 2 weeks on Bitcoin.",

You have to understand that bitcoin does not collapse with the FTX, it's all about having your bitcoin investment with them that got scammed along the FTX collapse, those affected were their investors that confided in them and not the bitcoin network neither doesit make any deligible difference in determining the bitcoin price, so in this context i will only admit the fact that if the affected investors have find it a means of recovery ever since the attacked to have invested on bitcoin but now on their own wallet.",

Or you think I am right? I think you think too much, but these thoughts go mostly in the wrong direction and are very limited to just one event without looking at the big picture, which prevents you from seeing things in the right context. There are a lot of elements that have influenced the BTC price drop, and FTX was just the latest to cause the crash towards $15k. A much bigger crash was caused by the failure of that scammer project from South Korea, and before that we were sinking due to the increase in inflation and the fall of the stock market, as well as disruptions in the world markets caused by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.Add to all that the fact that ATH was always followed by a correction, and then you have a much clearer picture on the basis of which you can draw conclusions. In addition, this recovery is not yet a definitive sign that we have exited the bear market.As for your belief that \"Bitcoin is a necessity in every one's life\", I think you are exaggerating beyond measure, because if less than 5% of people in the world have any contact with Bitcoin, how important is it to the rest of the people in the world - especially those 40% who don't even have access to the internet?",

My reason is this,in different years there are always different challenges that hits the crpto market which I think last year was the worst. Inflation is also around the corner all these joined together can still affect bitcoin cyclic movement. It can be before the predicted time or after the predicted time nobody knows.",
