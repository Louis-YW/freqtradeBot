I mean, ETH developers are tiring themselves making feature after feature (defi, NFTs etc.) but it only has a small percentage of BTC's market cap with virtually no hardforks at all.Perhaps people simply like tried and tested coins better.",

It is a reasonable assumption to say after many years a new and better innovation comes along that could become bigger than bitcoin but not necessarily replace it.However, I don't see how a centralized shitcoin with mutable blockchain and numerous protocol flaws such as ethereum even came to your mind when you read this comment!QuoteThe protocol and network will look a lot different. There will have been at least one major hardfork that changes quite a bit of the protocol. — Have you got something on this one (not counting separate chains — BCH, BSV, etc)?We had significant changes through soft-forks like Taproot that even changed the signature algorithm we use from ECDSA TO ECSDSA.QuoteA lot of transactions will probably occur through a payment system on top of Bitcoin because Bitcoin transactions will be somewhat more expensive than they are today.  — Lightning network? Yes, except that transactions on main-net are not expensive and they should not be expensive otherwise the second layer would face difficulties. QuoteMaybe Bitcoin transactions will work more like email and you'll send transactions to an address like theymos@fast-bitcoin.com — Not on bitcoin but it's available on ethereum and some other chains. There is no bitcoin available on any chain least of which centralized shitcoins like ethereum. What you see there are fake tokens that have no connection to bitcoin despite their fake claims.Also I don't think the quote means what you think it means. It is predicting that you could send bitcoin to emails (or something similar like IP address that existed in early days) instead of sending to an address.",

      "body": "It's an interesting look back, though my predictions don't strike me as especially prescient or anything.IMO it seems less likely now that Bitcoin will be replaced as a base-money/digital-gold asset. Bitcoin's network-effect and reputational advantage is too strong at this point. Any replacement would have to have overwhelming advantages over Bitcoin, with Bitcoin failing to compete against these advantages for years. I don't see ETH as a likely competitor in the base-money niche, though there is clearly intense demand for easy-to-use smart contract capability, so until BTC smart-contract tech advances to compete with that, ETH will have a place. It's definitely possible for off-chain BTC smart contracts to work just as well or better than ETH's smart contracts, but the development of this has been slow. And CBDCs are in a completely different niche, and don't compete against Bitcoin.I've never been opposed to hardforks if they are uncontroversial and are phased in very slowly, though I underestimated how much could be done with softforks. There probably will be a hardfork someday, though probably not soon.On the email-address thing, IIRC I was specifically thinking of a hub-and-spoke payments system where everyone would have a Bitcoin wallet provider of their choice (possibly self-hosted), similar to how everyone has an email provider like gmail and it's also possible to run your own email server on your own domain. You'd trust a small amount of your total BTC with your wallet provider, and small everyday transactions would be done in a process like this: 1. You tell your wallet provider to send to client@wallet.com. 2. If your wallet provider is wallet.com, then they just do an internal debit/credit, with no on-chain transaction. 3. If your wallet provider has a payment channel open with wallet.com, then they debit your account, adjust the payment channel to move the BTC to wallet.com without an on-chain transaction, and wallet.com credits their client account. 4. If there is no existing payment channel, then a payment channel is opened, requiring some on-chain transactions. This would require an automated negotiation about how large the channel should be and how the fees should be split between the wallet providers, though these fees would presumably be just a small cost of doing business for the wallet providers rather than a per-transaction fee for the end-users.The idea was that you'd still send large transactions on-chain, similar to wire transfers vs ACH transfers. This would only be for small everyday transactions.This is somewhat similar to LN, but LN improved upon it in almost every way.",
