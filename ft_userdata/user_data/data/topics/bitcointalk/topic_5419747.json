One last thing, the contract of the exchange box needs to be increased to help users know what exactly they are doing.CONCLUSIONOverall its a clean site but I feel the news articles arent necessary as they could misdirect a potential customer away from the platform that was looking for answers from the FAQ section, all in all, good site 8/10 rating for me.BtC addy: bc1q6pm0afcphvqp594fgna8u63gza37qkrm3wvf0s",
