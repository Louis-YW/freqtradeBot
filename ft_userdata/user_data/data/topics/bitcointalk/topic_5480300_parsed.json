  "content": "Supposedly we've only got a week until many people think the SEC will accept the first Bitcoin ETFs.Do you think it'll actually happen? Or do you think it's just been a bunch of 'hopium' and the SEC is just gonna reject all the ETFs same as they've been doing for the past 5 years?It seems like the SEC has actually been engaging in talks about ETFs with various interested parties so it at least does seem like for the first time the SEC is actually considering the possibility of accepting ETFs. But at the same time the head of the SEC, Gensler, is well known as a Bitcoin hater and he wants to see the entire industry destroyed in America. But the one thing Bitcoin ETFs have going for them despite Gensler opposition to Bitcoin is that Gensler and the SEC has come under increasing pressure from Congress and the courts to stop denying ETFs and stop standing in the way of the industry.To me, it could go either way. Maybe Gensler stands firm in his opposition to Bitcoin and the crypto industry (though if he does he has gotta know the political and legal pressure on him is going to get a lot worse), or maybe he has been feeling enough pressure last year to just say the hell with it and allow an ETF despite his personal vendetta against Bitcoin.What do you think? Are we just days away from Bitcoin ETFs getting accepted or is the whole market about to be in for a huge disappointment?",

These are final adjustments which you don't discuss unless there's strong grounds for approval.",

After all the SEC has gotten pretty good at drowning all approaches in red tape so far and I have my doubts that they are out of red tape just yet.In the end they'd just kick the can down the road though, so while a rejection may result in some short term volatility I wouldn't worry much about the long term.",

Yeah the fact that SEC has actually been meeting with and discussing the ETF with the participants and financial exchanges and whatnot in recent weeks makes me think that it may actually happen. I didn't get onboard with everyone else last year just because Blackrock put in an application, but when SEC started losing their court cases I was like okay maaaaybe that'll be enough pressure to force Gensler's hand against his own will but at that point I was thinking like 5% chance of approval, up from 0%. But now it does seem like SEC in recent weeks is actually discussing it to get everything ready for an approval and not just waiting for the deadline to reject everything as they normally do. So now in my mind it's gone from like 5% possibility to higher than 50% at this point, but I still wouldn't be remotely surprised if they reject everything, but it does seem like its leaning towards acceptance at the moment.",

Every of their move now will definitely shake the market and investors will be looking out on their stand on this Bitcoin ETF. I have some conviction that they also want to become amongst the main determinants for the market and give directions to where the market will go. I just donâ€™t really like the spot Bitcoin ETF because it has caused too many uncertainties for the market and everyone is at the brink of what step to take next.",

      "body": "Regardless of the scenario, the interest in bitcoin will be great. I believe the ETF will be approved, but I also speculate about it being rejected. This scenario cannot be ruled out because the nature of the SEC's mission is to regulate it. Managing the US stock market where the stock market is the \"Barometer\" of the economy, \"Ensuring\" \"Protecting\" \"Stabilizing\" the \"Capital\" market is the top task of the SEC.The macroeconomic situation shows that the US economy is still able to withstand the FED's large interest rate increases, but the number of bankrupt businesses has increased, if you look at the difference in the yield curve of US Treasury bonds. 10 years and 3 months, we can see that the probability of a recession within the next 12 months is 61%. I know that historically, the yield curve has been a reliable indicator of economic recessions, calculated based on a New York Fed model that uses data from 1959-2009. Therefore, even if the FED adjusts interest rates in the next 2 quarters, capital flow priority will also be given to large businesses, so approve BTC ETF and deployment in 2024 is also unlikely, although the interest is huge.Imo, not to mention the fluctuations with large amplitude and lack of control (the US government's BTC reserves are only ~ 300k and are being sold), the value of BTC will be a factor causing manipulation of the US capital market. So imo, BTC ETF is unlikely to be approved at this time, let's wait and see the verdict in the next few days.",

SEC probably needs more time to consider the right decision to make.Well, I don't know why people are too thinking about Bitcoin ETF. I think we must focus on Bitcoin halving, it must happen. Bitcoin ETF is just another factor to support the bullish day of Bitcoin. I think it won't influence much for the bullrun season.",

But i can totally see a scenario where it won't get passed and bitcoin just keeps on moving up, like it didn't care at all. It's not like this would have affected too much before. So i don't see not accepting being anything huge. Accepting on the other hand would launch it for sure",

I don't know if this one is as well, but I think this affects the price of Bitcoin. I saw an article from Cointelegraph saying that we might not see Spot Bitcoin ETFs getting accepted because SEC Chair Gary Gensler doesn't want crypto in the US.

Gary Gensler is acting like he's the main antagonist in one movie, eh?  I'm hoping that somehow, there will be at least one or more ETFs that will get approved, but I will not be surprised anymore if the worst thing happens, and no one gets accepted.",

Dilemma if ETF not announce yet they will approve or not because take advantage by many community or whale to make bad news and bitcoin potential drop drastically again. Hope for bitcoin holder don't panic with fake news and bad possibilities in the future if ETF not approved bitcoin because is not the end era of bitcoin have large community holder. Actually hope ETF will approve bitcoin as soon possible and make investor keep confidence holding their bitcoin fund until raise higher price left few months later will be halving time.",
