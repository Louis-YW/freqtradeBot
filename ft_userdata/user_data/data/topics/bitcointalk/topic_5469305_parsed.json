(note the edit.) so I gain 100-30 = 70 a month if I use the s19xpSo I can do the L7 which will be harder to make quiet.or I can do the s19xp which is easy to make quiet using the epic controllerWhen the L7s come I will test and try to get a good heater from it.",

But really, jokes aside, a toy that costs you money to buy and money to run doesn't make sense to me, people say they want to learn more about BTC, and that's fine, but you could learn more about it by reading 5 pages on Bitcoin Wiki than doing this project, also it involves little to no DIY in the first place. If this was a USB miner where you would learn about running a full node, using GitHub, and one or two SSH commands -- that'll be great, but that space heating projects are just a straight line with little to no learning in the process, I could be wrong, I don't know.Quote from: philipma1957 on November 03, 2023, 07:15:58 PMSo I can do the L7 which will be harder to make quiet.I suppose if it's pretty cold outside, you could run a duct from the outside with pretty cool filtered air directly entering the miner, the fans will have to spin very slowly, changing the cheap stock fans to better ones would also make it a lot less noisy, however, using the stock fans + sucking room air which will eventually be somewhat warm will make the miner noisy given that you don't have many options in regards to frequency, voltage and fan settings.",

So for me the question is how long can I keep it running. Over 2 years = certain profit. under 2 years = maybe profit.At the moment I am running 1 L3 in my den as my den is always fucking cold without a space heater.It is cold in the summer due to acIt is cold in the winter due to ⅓ of the first floor having a hill which insulates the den and the bedroom on the first floor.Now if I run the 1 l3+ it make 22.50 a month and save 25 in heat. in a month so 47.50 but costs 70.56 to run I lose 23 bucks.The l3+ is quiet. it has paid for itself about 5 times over. both in coin and cash.So If I do a space heater ⅓ of the day the cost is 33.60either way I lose 23 to mine the LTC/Doge 33.60 to use a space heater 8 hours a day.So I mine with the L3 and take the 23 dollar loss over the 33 dollar loss.This absolutely would not work in so many parts of the worldmikeywith = never heats his house.stompix = electric power is higher than 14 centsme = works 5 months a year. with ancient gear the L3+But I kind of want to use an L7 as I will profit. then put it in the mine in April",
