      "body": "Answering all questions one by oneFirstly, thank you Eclipse33. Any feedback from you is highly valuable. Quote from: Eclipse33 on October 26, 2023, 10:06:25 PMHello RC, If I understand correctly this appears to be a portfolio tracking application. Perhaps provide some insight as to your vision for the project so we can understand fully what you are aiming for.  That is correct. It is for managing, searching and tracking portfolio. Plus, a unique id per collectible. QuoteAdd investment feature: This is a tough one because prices depend upon if the coin is raw state, graded and slabbed by what agency.  We have added recent auction prices for some coins now and default BTC prices are supported i.e. if you add a loaded coin, we will tell you total value of your portfolio of all loaded coins. We will slowly add more coins and varieties, plus, addresses. We agree it is a tough challenge.QuoteIf you drop the watches and hammer down only on physical bitcoin price indexing your site could lead the space as I have seen no-one before attempt to create a robust price tracking engine for physical bitcoin.  That's a good point. If the user only adds crypto coins they will only see crypto collectibles. We can add a Radio button under search to only look for crypto collectibles. Sounds good?BTW few LEALANA early coins have been added. Thank you Team RC",

Just not a fan of storing data somewhere out there so that's why I'm asking.In the mobile app, you can choose to store data locally. However, please be aware that if you ever delete the app while using the local storage option, all your data will be permanently lost.Storing your data on the server ensures that your information remains accessible across different devices and won't be lost unless you choose to delete your account.Let us know what you think of these options.Thank youTeam RC",

When adding your collectibles, you can include them without any specific conditions for now. You can always edit them later if necessary.QuoteQuote from: raritycheck on October 26, 2023, 09:31:01 PM- Track and get notification if there are price spikesI'm not sure if you're planning to monitor only a specific place or many places but the latter would lead to a disaster [unfortunately, this should be the route if you want to do it accurately]!Multiple sources of sales. Yes it is a difficult task but we are working on a price engine.QuoteBTW, I noticed a bunch of duplicate listings.Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The issue was due to the missing version information, such as \"version 1,\" \"version 2,\" or \"series 1,\" \"series 2,\" in the names. We have now fixed those issues.That's all folks! Please keep on leaving your feedback!RegardsTeam RC",
