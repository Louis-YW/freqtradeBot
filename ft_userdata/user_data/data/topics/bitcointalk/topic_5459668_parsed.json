  "content": "Today, let's shift our focus and discuss something different instead of constantly addressing gambling addiction. So, I've decided to bring up a new topic: signs that indicate you are not addicted to gambling. Let's explore it. Here are some indicators that demonstrate a lack of gambling addiction: Absence of Gambling PreoccupationDo you don't find yourself constantly thinking over recent gambling losses. You do not get lost daydreaming of past wins. Your day is not spent thinking about gambling, or constantly laying plans on your next bet. You do not schemes ways to get more money to gamble with.Stable ToleranceYou do not need to gamble larger amounts to feel the same level of thrill.  You are satisfied with regular bets and low stakes.  You do not pursue bigger wins, higher stakes, high gambling risks to feel \"high\" or happy.No Withdrawal SymptomsWhen stop gambling, you do not feel restless or irritable. When you are not gambling, you are having feelings of depression or anxiety. For you gambling more like hobby, something you do for fun.Non-Escape MechanismYou are facing your problems and challenges head-on without turning to gambling forget about them. When you experience stress, or any negative emotions, gambling is not used as a mechanism for coping.Lack of Loss ChasingWhen you lose, you do not attempt to bet more and more, with the mindset of winning back what you’ve lost. Rather you \"leave\" to bet another day.Honest and Accountable BehaviorYou are opened about your gambling behaviour and how much you have either won or lost while gambling. You see no reason to lie about it. Your family and friends know about how you gamble because you have made accountable to it.Unaffected Relationships and OpportunitiesYour life, career, relationships are in order. They are not being negatively affected by your gambling habits. You met you work target and deadlines, your education is not neglected, and you haven't lost any financial opportunities as a result of gambling.Financial IndependenceYou have not ran into debts because of your gambling. Neither do you rely on other people for financial support. You haven't engaged in any illegal activity to get money to support your gambling.Avoidance of Illegal ActivitiesYou have never considered partaking in illegal actions like theft or fraud to finance your gambling activity.Demonstrates Self-ControlYou can go days without gambling because you have the will power and might to. You do not feel powerless and unable to control your desire to gamble.These signs suggest a healthy relationship with gambling and indicate that you are not addicted. What other signs do you know of?",

      "body": "That's too much, the simple way to indicate someone isn't a gambling addict is gamble only for fun and afford to lose.When a gambler think gambling is for fun, he know how much he need to gamble and not looking for making money, the gambling activity will not harm his life. Different people have different amount that he can afford to lose, even someone can't save his money and use it for gambling, it's not a problem as long as he follow that two rules.",

They don't gamble all the time and they spend their time doing other things instead of gambling.3. They don't regret losing, but just think it's part of gambling.4. Can forget about gambling anytime and don't talk about gambling often.Those are some of the other signs that I have observed, but of course there will be more and more based on the experience of each gambler.",

Neither do you rely on other people for financial support. You haven't engaged in any illegal activity to get money to support your gambling.If you are earning money very well to the extent you can feed your family and many other people with you still having savings, this may not be your story, but you will know deep down within yourself that you are an addict and making you not to progress the way you supposed to.Quote from: Davidvictorson on July 13, 2023, 11:29:04 AMAvoidance of Illegal ActivitiesYou have never considered partaking in illegal actions like theft or fraud to finance your gambling activity.Because a gambler has not been seen to partake in illegal activity does not mean he is not an addict. Addicts are much many than those seen with illegal activity. Some gambler will leave addiction before it grows up to that. But some people are unlucky to the extent they can commit suicide. A rear story but which I have heard and read about more than 3 times.Quote from: Davidvictorson on July 13, 2023, 11:29:04 AMWhat other signs do you know of?Use less than 5% of your weekly income to gamble weekly. Do not gamble always.It is not good to be addicted to gambling. We should gamble responsibly.",

It would be very had someone to be free all those qualities as for me I truly understand the rudiments that associated people who are gamble addicts thought one must not necessarily be free from all to know such person is not additcts.When classifying addicts to me an addicts is someone that gambles everyday, it must not be that such person borrowed money or involving themselves in any malicious activities but In as much as such person is having his money to gamble every day I can classify such person to be an addicted gambler. On the contrary, anyone who could spent a week or months without gambling there's no way we can say they are addictive gambler.",

      "body": "I think that \"Lack of Loss Chasing\" is a big key factor that we are not addicted to gambling. IMO, a person who keeps on making deposits once the first amount was depleted is a sign that he is not doing pretty well, and maybe one factor is that he is already addicted. Thankfully, I don't do this yet. I just keep an amount I can afford to lose and once it is gone (which is mostly the case weekly) I just find another thing that I will do. Either working, keeping the house clean, watching movies, tv series, or anything that will keep my mind occupied until the next week comes again for me to gamble again the planned amount. Sometimes, I can make it survive up to 2 weeks because of sports betting where I mostly win, but I cannot just stick there because I also want to reach a VIP rank and that means wagering more and that's where casino gambling comes in.",

When you're not an addict, you will search about signs of gambling addict and there are few signs that same like your habit, you will diagnose if you're an addict and vice versa. It's better for someone visit a doctor and ask them if you're an addict or not, so you will get a proper answer since they more know about your problem.",

Out of the 10 signs, I only exhibit 1/10, so I can still consider myself relatively unaddicted to gambling. Many of us have made mistakes while gambling and blamed ourselves for the lack of discipline. However, as we learn from those mistakes, we become more responsible. It's crucial to recognize that time is valuable, and we shouldn't wait until we have lost everything before learning from our mistakes. That would indeed be unwise.",

We can talk about other signs that OP brought up but you will still fall to gambling addiction if you keep playing on regular basis since gambling games is designed to be addictive due to the fun involved. It’s very hard to maintain a composed attitude if you are consistently exposed on an acivity that works to let players addicted on game or profit.I’m playing only once a week the most. This way, I never feel the urgency to gamble more since I’m not exposed on it frequently. Remember that repition will make someone addicted on something that is addictive.",

Yeah, I happy if gambling with small amounts, because the money I can afford to lose is only a little. For self-control, I've tried it and success. I can control my desire to gambling, because if I didn't have self-control. Then surely I would continue gambling and maybe every ten minutes because also now casinos are available online everywhere, and well it's not too difficult to play and find them. But actually, in my opinion if we can control ourselves, then we are not an addict, because self-control already covers most of the signs.",
