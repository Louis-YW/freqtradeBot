  "content": "Congrats on your election victories. I believe we now have more than enough Patriots to fix the issues that concern the Country especially Nov 2020 election which lots of citizens are demanding that justice be done about. I have no doubt that the large number of winners of the recent election are patriotic people who will work for the good of their country and fix its problems without fear. One of the reasons the fearful ones ignored fixing certain issues that should not be ignored is the fact that they were knowingly/unknowingly involved in the alleged rigging of the 2020 Nov election. Of course, people can be unknowingly used by the enemy who is aware they are being used... That is how bad the system can be to people who are enslaved by it. Many fear going to jail or getting punished hence the silence or unwillingness to expose the evil they were part of. This is why we have considered pardoning those who may have ignorantly rigged or were ignorantly part of the rigging. *If you are afraid to disclose your identity while exposing what really happened, you can do so anonymously. In the end, you will be forgiven for exposing your mistakes, fixing the mistakes and taking corrections. Always remember that one of the main reason you got elected is to help fix the issue concerning the Nov 2020 election. Useful works have been done already in that regard. Now we need to prove that the works and evidences are actually useful and true. And more investigations should be done in other states in contention using the previous or better methods. Don't forget that people are in jail for protesting the result. The truth can help vindicate those that do not deserve to be there. Let the truth be known. Congrats once again.* Note that the Victorious Patriots are mainly those from both major parties that participated in the election.",

Quote from: https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/18.htm11“The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes anymore— 12cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; 13cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and human beings sold as slaves.Iraq's ancient Babylon did the same thing. They did it through idolatry against God, and through astrology. The infamous 666 number has to do with several things. One of them is the angle of inclination of the Tower of Babel's walls, 66.6 degrees, built to worship the stars of the zodiac.Today's idolatry is the worship of money, but in high levels of wealth, it is often still astrology.",

That's what the Dems were (and still are) when they stole the election from Trump and the Reps... honest people who were trying to play by the rules.",
