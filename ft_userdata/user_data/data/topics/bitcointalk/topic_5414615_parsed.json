Appreciate any thoughts and feedback ¬†üç¨I'd like to know how's your experience on this, have you won, and how do we know that this is fair this can be manipulated, I read in one review that there is a coin that counts our steps but unfortunately there are reports that some steps are not counted, are you sure that they are really counting those steps, in my country you have to buy data, what if you run out of data while walking, you have to give us reviews first before inviting us.",

I'd guess as long as people are having fun with their bit, it doesn't matter if there are people trying to cheat the system - especially if there are other protections in place. There are a lot of wagering/game apps that come and go and I think the op is only making the app for certain countries atm too it seems.",

And what are payment options for withdrawals?I have already tried depositing through Binance and withdrawing back. The minimum withdrawal amount is 0.0005BTC about $10. I made minimum bets, didn't want to take any risk and got a bonus, but not a big one around a dollar a day, although the bet was only $2. I want to make maximum bet as bonuses will be much higher there, but I am not sure if I will be able to make so many steps regularly.",
