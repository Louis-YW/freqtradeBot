Depending on what the bull market is like in the next 12 months or so, I will sell more or less, but I always consider HODL for the long term, I would say forever, to leave as an inheritance. I think those of us who have been doing this for years don't look at it as an all-or-nothing question, as if I buy a large amount now and sell it in x amount of time. We accumulate as much as we can and we spend or sell as well, especially when the price goes up a lot.",

I've now been accumulating and holding Bitcoin since late 2020 or early 2021, and honestly, I don't think it was a long time period. I'm not sure if I'll hold till the next halving; we still haven't seen what price Bitcoin is able to surpass, but we'll notice the effects in the upcoming months. I'm not planning to sell anytime soon; however, I'd be tempted if I were to wake up tomorrow and see its value at $100,000.Life happens, and 2028 is too far away to make any accurate statements right now. I don't have a specific price goal either, but the psychological boundary of $100,000 is certainly there.",

The cryptocurrency market has just organized its fourth Bitcoin halving, meaning it will take another four years for the next Bitcoin halving to take place, which is likely to happen in 2028. There are many who will be able to hold onto their bitcoins for four years or more, and there are many who will buy and sell bitcoins during these four years to meet their own needs.Those who have a specific goal with their investment will never sell their investment until they reach that specific goal either before or after the bitcoin halving. Everyone has a different investment plan and even I have a different plan for Bitcoin investment. There are probably many of us who bought and hoarded Bitcoin three to four years before the fourth Bitcoin halving took place as a long-term investment. There are many others who will buy bitcoin this year and hold until the next bitcoin halving. I have never seen a bitcoin halving before but before the bitcoin halving this year I bought bitcoins and set a certain price point at which I would be ready to sell the bitcoins. I am ready to sell if it reaches that price point before the next bitcoin halving takes place.",

At this time of the year we all are usually very scared that the market will dump a lot and dump to almost half of the value. We have good reason to think so, every year we see this in the market. Since the market is like this every year, this year too we expected that maybe the market will come down a lot during the halving and do a lot but in that case we can hope for something better.

But if the market doesn't have a big dump in 2022, we shouldn't expect crazy growth like the 2021 bull season. Because if you want strong growth, you need strong declines. Many people also predicted the same as you but I don't believe it. Personally, I still see that crypto is still a wild market and it always will be. There will probably be some changes as bitcoin ETFs are approved and ETH ETFs will also be approved soon but the rest will remain wild. Because that is the nature of cryptocurrency, and it is that wild nature that sets the cryptocurrency industry apart from the rest of the financial market.",

When opportunity makes itself available you should learn to take it, if you have bought some Bitcoin in 2022 or 2023 I expect you to take profit by 2025, the halving is over now, a new all time high is coming, sell your bag and wait for a dramatic pullback, it will always happen. Taking profit and buying Bitcoin back is the best way to have more Bitcoin in your cold storage, those who just buy and sit are wealthy, they will always have money available to take advantage of a bear market.",

Just funny about the crucial advices we get in the bitcoin investments that we should keep on holding and not sell nomatter what appreciable incomes we've made and nomatter what financial challenges we may encounter.I don't know if the incomes is just all fallacies or some kind of meme funds for mimicking that we've funds out there.Holding our bitcoin til 2028 is a potential chances to have more incomes to our holding yes but that's definitely not the limited rate by which bitcoin price would rise. So after holding to 2028 when you can actually sell your coins just like you said, some investors bought, accumulated for about two years now and would make great profitsby the bull run. So does it give them lost counts if they sell after much little while holding Op?Well, after the current bull run circle of 2024, Op is curious that we should hold til 2028, that's actually a good one but what about future bull run circles such as 2032, 2036, 2040 and the rest of it?Are we to keep holding Op?",

But if people just newly acquired their bitcoin maybe that should be done since for sure there's a lot more to happen in year 2028. But for people already seeing some good cash from their long time investment then maybe they should consider to take their profit since maybe there's a possibilities that we could able to see a huge correction and that's what I anticipated so if that case happen I am happy to get my profit already then that will be the start of another phase of accumulation again then wait for another halving cycle.

In short, I'm not sure if I will still hold my bitcoins until 2028; many, I'm sure, will also sell their holdings after halving if the price of bitcoin somehow reaches $100k or near that, and I'm one of them. I'm content with the $100k worth of price and will not regret selling some of my holdings as the reward is too much and very satisfying. Now the thing is, what will really happen after this halving?

I don't buy the idea of holding for years to come, since we have bulls and bear market I think its better to take advantage of them, when your BTC is at a new ATH it won't stay there forever, there will be many corrections in the market. It is better to sell most of your Bitcoin in a bull market and wait for a bear market to buy back, you will always end up having more Bitcoin, just keep repeating this and in the future you will end up with significant amount of Bitcoin. To say the truth, it is wrong to advice people to hold till 2028, a new bear market will happen in 2026 and there is no point to hold from now till 2028, it is simy telling people to hold through a bull market into a bear market and repeat, it is a stupid advice sorry to say..",
