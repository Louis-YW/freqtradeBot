Looking for a breakout in either way can give us the opportunity to make a short term profit from the market.I think this should be a thing of worry to short term investors, that is, those who invest for the purpose of making profit then exit. Most long-term investors must have been familiar with this trend and won't expect any magic to happen in the Bitcoin market that will trigger something unfounded.Maybe newcomers too. Since they have a shallow understanding of how these things work and may end up too excited and carried away by the current market trends. It is also an advice that you should not put all the resources you have into the Bitcoin market as the bull or bear run will end up giving you a high blood pressure, although it is something pretty much expected by experts.",

Most of the things you have said so far is pure speculation. If anyone knows that the price will be for sure favorable during the year, then they will buy huge and always wait for it. This is a good time to control emotions, patient and greed. Since we have managed to accumulate some Bitcoin, we hope to see something great in the future.Quote from: BitDane on November 01, 2023, 08:53:17 PMBitcoin had been volatile all year out.  This year we have experience less volatile from Bitcoin. And it has highly affected those who trade day to day because they cannot make any profit since they depend on the volatility to trade.

The price at which bitcoin now won't be the highest as bull market,  so even if volatility affects the market and it falls in price it doesn't mean it will keep continuing dropping in price , it is just volatility which fall of price will still take place so no need to be in panic and sell off. This is the best time to keep patience and take away fear to keep hodling no matter what happens in the market because their will be things that will take place that can make one to be panic.",

Pulling out of funds and closing position is most common amongst long term position holders as they will begin to take profit and wind-up for the year to prepare for the coming year, but you can still make money from such market especially if you trade on shorter time frame but then don't allow your trades linger for too long. For HoDLers it's advisable you leave your assets at this time regardless of the price you see I'm your portfolio as it just a reaction to market situation and not the permanent price of your assets, they will definitely get you back in profit by the opening of the next year.",

Normally towards the end of the year many businesses, traders and others as  well take note and records of their ledger for the year before it ends so in that case there is every possibility of the market would be at a standstill when that time comes and moreover, it is end of year so it is expected that such should happen within the festive period.
