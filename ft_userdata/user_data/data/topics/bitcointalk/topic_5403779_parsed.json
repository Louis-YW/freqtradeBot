  "content": "Hi all, I first started investing in crypto 4 months ago and up till now have just left all my investments on the exchange but thinking about buying a cold wallet to store my crypto on as I am buying more and more lately so want it all to be as safe as possible. I hold the majority of my crypto on Coinbase with a little bit on FTX & Crypto.com.I am looking for advice on which cold wallet to go with? Ideally I would like something that is easy to set up and use for a beginner like myself and not too expensive although I don’t mind paying a lot if it is worth it. Would also be interesting to hear who is for and against using cold wallets and the reason why?All suggestions/ advice welcome Thanks",

If you keep your coins on coinbase, they will have full control over your fund. They can freeze your account at any time for any reason. Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on June 23, 2022, 01:43:05 PMHow likely is it that Coinbase could get into trouble one day?They have full control over your fund and everything is possible As said, it's not recommended to keep your coins on an exchange or any custodial service. You should always keep your coin on a non-custodial wallet, so have full control over your fund. Non-custodial wallet is a wallet in which you have full control over you keys. If you want more security, you should use a cold wallet. This means that the keys should never connect to the internet. One way is to use a hardware wallet and another way is to use an open-source non-custodial wallet on an air-gapped device.",

It depends on how much you have there, I'd recommend if the amount you're storing on the exchange exceeds 10x the price of a hardware wallet, you're probably better off getting one. If you have a smaller amount of funds you can also make a wallet with electrum and store your funds there (electrum.org - their wallet also works quite well with ledger and trezor). Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on June 23, 2022, 01:43:05 PMHow likely is it that Coinbase could get into trouble one day?We can't know for sure but a lot of things can happen:1. What if the exchange closes and you're out of the cryptospace for so long you lose your funds due to that.2. The exchange could lose money due to a hack or poor financing.There's always a risk with leaving funds on an exchange but there might also be a risk in entrusting yourself too.I'd say ledger and trezor are the best warm wallets (cold wallets have no online interaction and require it to remain secure).",

Your feeling is right. It's not secure to keep your coins on an exchange. Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on June 23, 2022, 02:08:15 PMI am just totally new to this so would just like an easy to use wallet that isn't too complicated. You can also use electrum. It's open-source and give you full control over your fund. (Download electrum only from its official website and do not forget to verify your download.)Note that electrum only supports bitcoin and if don't create your wallet on an air-gapped device, it wouldn't be as secure as a hardware wallet. For 100% security, you should use electrum on an air-gapped device or as already said, use a hardware wallet.

Hardware wallet is not a must if you technically know what to do to keep your funds safe.Keeping them on exchange is usually not a good idea: their policy may chance, they can get hacked or go bankrupt and so on. People keep telling: not your keys, not your coins.3k pounds is, however, not a life changing amount (or maybe not yet) and I can understand that you may not want to invest more, especially now with the bear market. Plus the exchange will get a withdrawal fee off you.However, on long term you have to find a safe way for storing your coins. Good luck in finding the best solution for you. As many said, it may be that this solution is a cheap hardware wallet.",
