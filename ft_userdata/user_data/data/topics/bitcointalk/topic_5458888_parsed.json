      "body": "If I'm not mistaken, the hashrate is ridiculous, in the order of a few kh/s isn't it?If you're interested in lottery mining, I would recommend Gekkoscience's ASICs. You will find some USB ASICs doing up to 300 GH/s and more, or in the Th/s 's range with the R606 - R909. You can find them online and they are not too expensive. Gekkoscience's ASICs are stable, reliable, and made their proofs since years. A (very very lucky) block was already found by a USB Compac F. Otherwise, Bitaxe is a open source ASIC project and some are on sale (already assembled I mean) if you look at their topic on the forum. It will be more efficient than nerd miners too , but the project is pretty recent. (I think that for now they deliver only to the US)In any case, the chances of solving a block are tiny, but at least you'll have a small chance, because with a few Kh/s it's almost non-existent.The forum is full of information on this subject, you can search in the Mining section and you'll find all the info you need on lottery mining, and small ASICs.",
