  "content": "Hello my country people, I want us to reason an issue that have been bothering me for a while. I suppose majority of us in this forum are youths, so we have to deliberate on some key happenings in our dear country and just maybe, we can do things differently when we have the chance. Today I want us to talk about the fuel subsidy hoax, as I would love to call it because there are chances that we were never paying subsidy or that the supposed subsidy was never what and how they say it. Walk with me as I give my perspective on this issue.       THE CRUDE OIL SWAP DEALIn a bid to meet local consumption of fuel, subsequent administrations of the Federal government of Nigeria via NNPC developed what is called crude-for-fuel swap deal. By this deal, Nigeria give crude oil to selected companies and in exchange they give Nigeria fuel. Nigeria is not supposed to pay for these fuel so I wonder where the subsidy comes in. I have attached a link to the list of companies that won the bid for 2021 till date. As you can see, both foreign and local companies are involved. https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/05/13/nnpc-picks-16-companies-for-new-crude-oil-swap-deal      BLENDING OF CONDENSATE AND NATURAL GASOLINE FROM BONNYAnother aspect of this \"organized crime\" happens through NLNG Bonny and Bonny River Terminal (BRT) operated by Exxon Mobil. NLNG produces Condensate as part of their finished product in addition to LNG and LPG. Foreign companies like TOTSA comes to buy the Condensate, move the vessel to Offshore Lome or Offshore Lagos where the product is blended (mixed with some chemicals) and the same vessel bring the final product back to Nigeria as PMS (Premium Motor Spirit aka fuel). Similarly, the natural gasoline from BRT is blended to DPK (Dual Purpose Kerosene) just somewhere around Nigerian waters and brought back as imported just to deplete our forex.  Why they cannot blend these product at the various terminals and distribute locally is just the same reason they claim to pay subsidy for fuel gotten through swap deals. These are few of the reasons I feel there is more than meet the eyes in regard to the glorified subsidy payment. What is your view?",

But really in President Goodluck era or regime, fuel subsidy was really paid and that was why we enjoyed the price of fuel at that time but when Buhari came to take over the mantle of leadership, fuel subsidy was removed, and it has not been implemented so when Tinubu came he implemented the what Buhari as already removed. So it was not the present president that removed fuel subsidy in Nigeria.",

Me I been dun talk am say for a country that's paying subsidy, we still dey buy fuel costly for Nigeria dat time wey fuel na 197 +/-. Without this your accusations or findings, e dey everybody eye say the subsidy was a scam form day one and people been dun dey find way to commot am but we never get any president wey get mind like Tinubu to run am. Even Peter Obi during his campaign rally been dun talk am say him go commot subsidy although him be get different plans unlike as tinubu carry commot am without putting in measure to tackle the misuse of this opportunity to kill Nigeria with fuel prices spiking up as we dey experience am now.This subsidy was just a means to settle some elite members of the political godfathers in the country, the subsidy was initiated with good faith but people turn am to wetin e be wey be just another means to the divert public funds for the elite them, those wey dem dey pay subsidy still dey divert majority of our product go neighboring countries and so many other things wey this people dem dey do. The issue now no be say government dun commot subsidy but wetin dem go do concerning the state of our local refinery to help bring product into the market to help stabilize the fuel prices.",

This one self na another big issue. E go shock you to know say government been budget up to 350,000 barrels of crude for our local refineries daily. instead of refining this, they sell it through Bonny waters outside OPEC quota for our country. The oga them make more money this way that is why they will never allow our refinery them work. When I hear say Buhari approve some $1.5 billion money to take work PH and other refineries, I just laugh as I know say na another wasted money. Our country matter plenty o....",

Yes, Nigeria pays subsidy; it was signed into law by the then president Olusegun Obasanjo; back then, subsidy fee was cheap and very affordable and later on as supply increases; the fee for subsidy also increases. Under the Goodluck Jonathan presidential reign; there were multiple cases of over inflated subsidy fee; back them after several consultations, single digit inflation and $ at 158 Naira; GEJ Quoted and said Quoteif you cannot find the source of thievery; you end the source.Naively citizens fell for political agendas and subsidy + subsidy scam continued.Under the APC Led government; they increased subsidy fee to about 500% of actual value in just 8 years. Even after govt claims to have removed subsidy; the subsidy scam continues till today with NNPC pegging a price instead of permitting independent sourcing, independent price company.",

I am fully aware of the oil swap deal  which was held last year so tell me after swapping the oil, what else? did they not reach agreement for something in return? What was the agreement and the product they agreed on returning upon swap? You see these are the questions I keep asking and waiting for an answer.  The government claimed they are paying for fuel subsidy which some few individuals sit at their comfort zone to feast on it.OP the truth was that Nigeria was actually doing that but just some few were eating the money and I was wondering what then the oil swap was for.",

You know say this point wey you bring up, I have heard of it several times before that this is the the government does with foreign countries were our crude oils are been refined. How I had it is done is this way; let’s say the government gave them 100 barrels of crude oil to refine, after refining them, they’ll keep like 30 barrels of the refined oil and give us the remaining 70 barrels of refined oil. This now raise a sense of doubt that who and where are they paying money to for fuel subsidy when the government now own the refined oil and can do anything they like with it.?QuoteThese are few of the reasons I feel there is more than meet the eyes in regard to the glorified subsidy payment. What is your view? Your reasons are tangible enough to question the government who they’ve been paying the money for subsidy to. There’s a very big corrupt practice by the governments and some elites here. I wish the new government can look into this and fish out those that have been benefiting from this fuel subsidy and pay back, the enemies of the nation who wants the country to go bankrupt.",
