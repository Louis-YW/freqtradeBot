No, it's not.You are going to need more proof that just two proof of authentication posts having the same address. There are cases where certain users copy and paste proof of authentication posts of other users, but then forget to edit out the address or social media handles. You have to be careful or you may end up incriminating an innocent member.",

Well, you should know about it  In your example, mia_houston published the address much earlier than rindo did. That's why your example doesn't fit. If it were the other way around, then we could talk about ban evasion.QuoteAgain, if someone publishes your address, it will be after you have published it. In any case, the publication of your address from someone else will be later than yours.So it now goes without saying that if a member publishes an address first, and another member publishes the same address, the member who published the address first can't be accused of doing anything wrong using that since they published the address much earlier. Here Issa56 published that address first, before thefreethinker did, so we can't use this to call Issa56 freethinker's alt.",

We can therefore safely assume that Issa56 is the real owner, and thefreethinker likely posted it by mistake. This kind of thing happens a lot in the Bounty section because there are many bounty hunters that are generally hasty, and this cuts down on the time it takes them to post their reports and complete their tasks.",

And I also don't have any problems in this forum, but because I spend most of my time outside this forum by running several trades through the exchange, so that I don't have much writing on this forum. And I never even cared what you did to all the cheaters on this forum. Because basically I'm also not a person who likes them (cheater). So there's no need to panic and fear if you're really innocent because I'm just asking a question based on what I've seen through the ninjastic.space resource. And asking to get a complete answer, I think it's also not wrong and can be done by anyone. Including you.@YOSHIE, I got that via ninjastic.space and I got curious about this so I decided to ask everyone here. Thank you for providing an excellent answer.",

But at the moment I really think that digging for more newbie bounty cheats is a never ending job considering they will always make the same mistakes by registering other accounts which in the end I don't think will change the attitude of other newbie much.I chose a different way in which I could combine the two to contribute. So far I'd rather get a spammer than a newbie cheat bounty, but sometimes I can also do it when I feel suspicious of someone even if it's a high ranking member.",
