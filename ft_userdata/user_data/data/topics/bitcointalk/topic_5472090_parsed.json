I saw a lot of messages here, like the tool recovery is not working and its true, it's not working and for me never had worked. I tried electrum.... and some other programs but Im not very good on the net, and also Im not a englishspoken, today I decided to write you a message otherwise I will forget this money because a lot of time wasted already for nothing, Of course I have all the information neccesary, like the 3 xpub, encripted share, user share and my wallet password i have all the information I printed on 2016 from my wallet when I created it. Can someone else, give some information?  I dont know really a lot of information.Thank you very much!!!!",

Coinbase provided all customers using that service with repeated written notice of this termination of service. Customers were directed to remove all their funds before Coinbase permanently shut down Multisig Vault service. At all times, customers in possession of their two multisig vault keys were and are able to remove their BTC. Customers who are no longer in possession of their two keys are not able to access and remove their funds.Unless you have access to your two keys, there is no access to the funds you left in the multisig vault.Thanks,Coinbase Supportin the email they told like i can take my founds i have all my seeds and paswords...

I dont think so, because this was the answer after I putted a message in \"Contact us\" by coinbase exchange. I dont really understud the email from coinbase... the answer for me was no really clair. at the moment (2018) i dont see all the emails from coinbase stopping vault multisig, but I found one email, you will see, they informe me...  Dear Valentin,Following up on our previous message and blog post, we will be ending support for existing multisig vaults on Coinbase on April 19, 2018. Please remove all funds stored in your multisig vault prior to April 19, 2018.Because this product is user-controlled, you can move funds with the two keys in your control but you will not be able to access the third key that Coinbase holds after this period. Please ensure that you have access to both keys. After April 19, 2018, access to the multisig address associated with your vault will not be available on Coinbase.If you have any issues, please see the FAQ at the bottom of this message.Kind regards,The Coinbase TeamFAQHow do I access my multisig vault?- Log in to your Coinbase account at www.coinbase.com. You cannot access your multisig vault using the mobile app.- Navigate to the “Accounts” tab from the top of the screen.- Select your multisig vault from your list of accounts.- Press the “Withdraw” button on your multisig vault.- Select one of your other non-multisig Bitcoin accounts to transfer your funds to, enter in the amount to transfer, and any two factor authentication codes if needed. Then press the “Continue” button.- On the next screen, enter your vault password into the password field, then press the “Approve” button.- Once approved, your withdrawal will enter the 48-hour waiting period before the funds are transferred. There is no way to bypass this waiting period.What if I don’t know my vault password?If you don’t know your vault password, you can instead copy/paste the user seed into the password field. This will allow you to approve your withdrawal. The user seed was provided to you when you created your multisig vault.Where do I find my vault password or user seed?Your vault password is the phrase you chose when you created your multisig vault. The user seed is a string of numbers/letters that was provided to you during the creation of your multisig vault. You should have stored or saved both of these pieces of information when you created your vault.What if I forgot/lost my vault password or user seed?Unfortunately, Coinbase cannot provide or recover your vault password or user seed to your multisig vault. This has always been the case for multisig vaults. The multisig vault specifically puts you in control of your own security, and Coinbase does not have access to your vault credentials.Because the vault cannot be accessed without these credentials, if you have forgotten/lost BOTH the vault password AND the user seed, your vault funds will be inaccessible. We apologize that there is nothing further we can do to help in that case.What if I use a group multisig vault?If your multisig vault is a group vault, it requires multiple approvals from different people for each withdrawal. Once you initiate your withdrawal, you should contact the other people who are approvers on your vault and make sure they log in to Coinbase to approve the withdrawal. To see a list of the people who are approvers on your multisig group vault, press the “...” button next to your vault and select “Vault Details.”What will happen when Coinbase removes the multisig vault from my account list?Once Coinbase removes multisig vaults from the account list, it will no longer be possible to access funds using the Coinbase interface. However, this open-source multisig tool will remain available and you can use that to withdraw your funds:https://coinbase.github.io/multisig-tool/Please note that the open-source multisig tool does not support group vaults.If you have any additional questions, please reply directly to this message and we will be happy to help.the problem the open-souce multisig tool is not working, so.... I dont know what to do.... I was silly to put the btc on a multisig, I'm not a PRO I dont know for what I did this.... but I would like to say once again, I have all my passwords... seeds... all... only I need the way to put then in a normal wallet.I apreciate your help",

Thank you very much for your reply, I saw this but I have no idea how its working... The usage is 1:1 same as with the old tool. For complete instructions, visit https://github.com/coinbase/multisig-tool/blob/master/README.mdIn short:download & run the project with npm install and make run (also you will need python3 to be able to run local server)input your xpubs in step 1, then (optionally) go offline and input the rest for step 2. NOTE: For destination address, use P2SH address (starting with \"3\"). Native SegWit (bech32) addresses (starting with bc1) reportedly do not work.raw transaction will be generated. It will send 100% of your funds (minus the fee) to the destination address. You can use https://coinb.in/#verify to verify that it's looking good, mainly if the destination address is matching.broadcast raw transaction using any bitcoin client (for example, run broadcast(\"....\") in Electrum console)you are done!what is npm install? python3 ?  run local server I dont understand??? where is the link to download the project? I'm not very good with computers and internet so all this information its new for me   Thanks again, maybe we found a solution for me !!!!!!",

It'd be advisable to use Electrum with proxy (i.e. Tor), unless you run your own full node and can connect there. Otherwise, Electrum servers can link your coins, and your privacy will be invaded. (Which has already happened as you used Coinbase, but anyway)- Create new wallet -> \"Multi-signature wallet\" -> Enter 2-of-3 -> Enter all your xpub keys.- Now the watch-only wallet will be initiated. Check if you can see your coins there. You can click the \"Coins\" tab to view the UTXOs.- If you do see them, then great, the coins are there. To spend them, install Electrum on an air-gapped device and re-create the same wallet but use xpriv. You can create a transaction from the Internet connected device which can be signed by the air-gapped. Obviously verify the signatures of Electrum binaries.",

One of the keys is owned only by the user. One of them is stored by coinbase and the user has no access to that. One of the keys (which is encrypted) is owned by both coinbase and user. If you own two of the keys, you must be able to spend your fund without relying on Coinbase and without any need to 2FA or email verification. It's weird I didn't receive any update about the vault and they never gave me any keys when I set up my vault. My vault was created in 2015 with 2FA and a secondary email they didn't send me any keys for recovery only the primary and secondary email is my backup to recover my vault.This is weird and now they do have vault recovery on Github that asks for Coinbase, shared, and user xpub keys.@OP I don't think it would ask for a password because mine only asks for a 2FA code when withdrawing after entering the 2FA it will ask if you gonna approve the transaction or not and then the 2nd email will receive a link to approve the transaction.Or check this video below how to withdraw from the vault- https://youtu.be/hM4o-TThT28?si=vHRcWP0sL32y_xcb",

How is that possible? As already said, they no longer supports multi-sig vault. I feel you are confusing coinbase mutli-signature wallet with their custodial wallet.",
