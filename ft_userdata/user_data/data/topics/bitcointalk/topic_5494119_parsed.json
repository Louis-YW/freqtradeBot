ThanksMove from centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges. That might help you in trading. But for crypto to fiat trading, I don't think you have any options available. If you volume is huge, you may consider setting up a company in crypto tax heavens and you can transfer funds from that company to your Canadian account as profit. But I am not sure how the local law works. You may want to get more clarity from a local lawyer.",

Regards to transfers, I think that in some way, transaction fees in crypto counts as tax but with a lot of extra steps, think about it, the tx fees are used to pay the miners and those fees that the miners get, they convert it to cash and when they do it, they likely buy something for themselves that will benefit them and those stuff will involve taxes.",

But you still need to pay income tax because it's one source of your incomes.Although it will decrease the tax you need to pay, but it's not a way to completely avoid paying tax.",

Because they're making it an easier decision for long term investors NOT to declare anything to the TaxMan.But if a user's coins went through a centralized exchange, doesn't the government already know, or at the minimum, can know that that user HODLs Bitcoin?",

ThanksI think the approach is simple because every country wants income from all fronts including the most in the lyrics now. Well. It's simple, if you don't want to deal with the name, tax, just ignore it if your exchange asks to complete the data. It's just that exchanges sometimes make deductions in usually every transaction we make whether you are trading, staking or other always triggers a tax event and that applies if someone's investment is considered to be making a profit.",

You can't escape the TaxMan. But you could also play a game of \"what if I don't declare my Bitcoin Cash Outs\" and see if you win. Probably for small amounts of Bitcoin, Uncle Sam might let that go. But for more than $10,000 which could alert the IRS and AML red-flags, you better be sure that you're keeping the receipts, and you should also know who the counter-party of the trades are?¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",

ThanksI guess that you are talking about capital gains tax. AFAIK, buying Bitcoin/crypto isn't a taxable event. Selling BTC/crypto is a taxable event(if you sold at a higher price than you bought). If you are seeking advice about how to conduct tax evasion, then this forum isn't the right place.Just find a tax accountant in your country and ask him. The other solution is to just move to another country with liberal tax laws and less taxes, or use offshore companies that are registered in \"tax heaven\" jurisdictions. I live in a country, where there's no capital gains tax, so I'm pretty much OK with my crypto holdings here. I don't know if this is going to change in the future, though.",
