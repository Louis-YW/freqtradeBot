Cyrus is official second admin of bitcointalk.org that have ability to nickname changing. Proof3. 50 BTC demanding for nickname changing is an obsolete. (In accordance with posts from Ambatman and Forever 101: there and there)4. Nicknames can be changed several times (Fact: Coolcryptovator's case, there and there)5. The following reason would be good for changing your nickname: \"I don't play poker anymore.\" (Fact: Poker Player's case)Quote from: Free Market Capitalist on January 24, 2025, 03:37:14 PMThe reason I want to change the name is very simple: I don't play poker anymore.6. The desire to change the case of letters from lowercase to UPPERCASE can also be a reason for changing the nickname. (Fact: Coolcryptovator's case, there)",

If this is a drama for you, then you are not telling the whole story. ¬†BTW. All those who changed their nicknames will receive neutral trusts about the fact of changing the nickname. I will introduce this into order of thingsQuote from: i luv chatgpt on January 30, 2025, 06:13:45 PMIt‚Äôs just a name! Tell that to Poker Player, he's been told that many times. \"It‚Äôs just a name!\" But he changed his name anywayQuote from: i luv chatgpt on January 30, 2025, 06:13:45 PMNobody actually cares what names you use herePoker Player he said that this is what is important to himQuote from: i luv chatgpt on January 30, 2025, 06:13:45 PMWhy are we wasting time diving into admin policies and ‚Äúfacts‚Äù about changing usernames?

      "body": "This creates precedent for any member of similar rank to expect their request for a username change (and render their old one as an AKA) to be granted. At least, that would seem fair to me. A consequence of this action as well, is Poker Player's profile now looks special in comparison to other legendary members, considering that he now has a custom title and a profile has customization that is unique in comparison to other legendary members.To make things fair on other legendary members, this change should be reversed, or a standard function should be added for all legendary members to do the same thing. I vote for the former. The decision to give this guy special treatment for such an insignificant reason was a big mistake in my opinion.",
