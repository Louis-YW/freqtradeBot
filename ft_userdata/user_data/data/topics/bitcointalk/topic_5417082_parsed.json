Thank you.I didn't use Polo for many years, so I cannot really tell from experience, but $2k is a rather small amount and they should not cause troubles, especially as their help page tells:Quote from: https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040027873-Increasing-Withdrawal-LimitsLevel 1 accounts can withdraw up to $10,000 USD per day by default. If you have a Level 1 account and enable 2FA, your withdrawal limits will automatically increase to $50,000 per day.So in theory you should be OK until $50k per day. However, also in theory they/anybody may ask for KYC even after the first 1$.Keep in mind that since they're registered in Panama, they can easily work with different amounts than the exchanges obeying EU/US laws.This should help if you don't get better answers from people who have been withdrawing more lately.",

Recently, this guy is also said to have just acquired the houbi exchange, which is also a leading exchange in the world. I also stopped using it quite a while ago. but I didn't hear about the hack that year because I switched to binance and houbi probably from 2019 to now. Kucoin is a centralized exchange but it allows trading and withdrawing when you don't want KYC, but you can only withdraw up to 1BTC within 24 hours with a non-KYC account.",

That amount is already subject to the Anti-Money laundering act in any country I believed.Hard to trust what's written on Poloniex withdrawal limits especially \"without KYC\".But what's your goal or purpose OP? Want to find a trading platform where you can freely at least withdraw $2,000 without KYC? I think such regulated exchanges are not existing anymore based on my own knowledge. Try Kucoin though, I can freely withdraw there without KYC but not on that example amount mentioned.",

Compared to the current bitcoin price, it may not be a very high amount but when bitcoin hit ATH last year, it was actually a very high draw for a centralized exchange with no KYC.
