Imho, as long as bitcoin keeps beating inflation (which he is doing with no problem), its definitely worth it to invest instead holding fiat that losses value constantly.Back in late 2013/early 2014 I also thought that I was too late since BTC price was ~$1k so instead buying 0.1-0.2 BTC I bought shitcoins for a couple of hundreds of dollars. Luckily, a bit later I realized my mistake and that I am far from too late and started buying bitcoin instead. So, don't make the same mistake I did.",

Because I'm sure you must have heard the famous story about \"Bitcoin Pizza\", which is all about a guy who paid 10,000 BItcoin for just mere 2 pizzas back then in 2010. So imagine if had this man kept his 10,000 BTC til today at current price of $34,000 per BTC. By today that man would have been a proud holder of $340 million valued of BTC in his wallet.Henceforth, it's not all about when you bought your BTC, but how far where you able to hold for long that matters.",

First of all, ignore all crypto experts and gurus, no one knows what is going to be in the future. Usually such experts say what people want to hear, when market goes down they shout \"sell it, it will continue going down\" but when market grows they shout \"Bitcoin is a future, buy it!\". So don't waste your time and nerves on watching stupid \"experts\". Secondly, it's not late to invest, at least because price recently and now is below the all time high, if you follow DCA strategy (you may google what it s) you have all chances to buy bitcoin with a good average price per coin. P.S. About current price of Bitcoin (34,630$ per coin) it is on the local top (I assume) therefore if you want to join the market, don't spend to much now, leave more money to buy it after the correction of the price. But don't try to catch the dip, it's impossible, always leave some money for an extra dump. And again - DCA is the best way to collect bitcoin for future with a good average price. Good luck, mate!",

That expert started investing in bitcoin in 2013, and he encouraged his acquaintances to invest in bitcoin, but at that time he said everyone thought he was crazy.What makes 2018 the last chance for someone to buy some bitcoin? Does bitcoin have a specific year that it will only last? Or does it have some sort of highest price, and when that price is reached, there is no more hope of growing again? Providing that bitcoin doesn't have any of this, you are so much allowed and have a full chance of buying and starting to hold bitcoin, considering your age as well. I think you will still be alive and strong when you start enjoying the fruit of your investment in bitcoin if you start now. Or is your place for investment just for a short time holding and then taking profit and leaving? If yes, then I think the era of the quick pump is actually a bit far gone, as the bitcoin price seems to take its time to grow during this period, but nothing still seems impossible. The price can double any day when you least expect it, but that one will be to your advantage if you don't put all your hope and expectation on it.",

In 2020 after the crash it was at that level again even if you did not buy exactly at the bottom you had weeks to buy before it reached 7000.Doing that would put you in over 1000% profit in 2021  and would keep you at 400%  or more profit for the rest of the time. Making 50 000 in profit from a 5000 dollar investment is not a small thing. No other investment offers such returns.If we assume that next bull market will end with a new high, we're talking at the very least about 300% return in 2 years if you buy now. What can you compare it to that will give you even half of that?",

You know now, so plan for the present and the future, don't waste time regretting what you did or what happened in the past. It is true that if anyone had known earlier about Bitcoin or that Bitcoin would be the way it is today, maybe everyone would have taken their strategy on that way. But no one knows what is going to happen in the future, you may be thinking that you are too late to know bitcoin or to invest in bitcoin, this may not be the case if you look at the previous records of bitcoin, how much has bitcoin pumped in every bull season.In comparison, Bitcoin is currently at about half of its all-time high price. So I would never say that you are late to invest. If you see those who are currently holding from 2013 or 2017 are holding for a huge time. I will tell you that you can currently invest your idle fund in bitcoins and also since you are a student you can hold a certain percentage of your pocket money every week or month by DCA management for long term. If you can continue investing like this, I hope you can get a good profit in 2025. Moreover, you can try to hold for a longer time, of course, by DCA management, which will reduce the risk of loss of your investment.",

However, it's better to rely on accurate information rather than following social influencers who might sometimes provide misleading details about Bitcoin. You might be feeling FOMO (fear of missing out) at the moment, but there's no rush. You can invest in Bitcoin at any time, with any amount you have. The current price is still relatively reasonable, fluctuating around $35,000 to $34,000. If you wish to buy now, you can start with whatever funds you have available. By accumulating Bitcoin before the next bull run, you might see a significant profit, as holding onto Bitcoin for an a long period of time might just be able to make you more profits from what you've invested.",

These days are over; nowadays, you need to be wealthy to acquire one whole bitcoin; even $20,000 or $25,000 is an extravagant amount of money for the average person.However, it's not too late to start acquiring. Certainly, don't expect to become wealthy from it, as that would also require a large amount of capital to invest from your side, but you'll be able to experience a potential return of 2x or even 3x of your investment within the next two or three years.
