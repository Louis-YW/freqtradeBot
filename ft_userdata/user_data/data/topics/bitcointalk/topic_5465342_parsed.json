  "content": "WHAT IS SKYTEREskytere is an open source peer-to-peer digital currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world.Decentralized Supply Control Mechanism.Skytere native coin is secure, fast and decentralized, supply controlled and market driven, demand based.When the demand for Skytere rises, the price of Skytere experiences an upward trend.This surge in price motivates miners to participate in the network leads to an increase in the networkâ€™s mining difficulty.The increase in mining difficulty, results in the creation of more Skytere coins.Conversely, when the demand for Skytere experiences a downtrend, the price of Skytere decreases.This price reduces leading to some miners exiting the network. The networkâ€™s difficulty decrease, causing a corresponding adjustment in the coin supply.This mechanism prevents oversupply and helps maintain the stability of Skytereâ€™s ecosystem.- Sketere Coin has max 21,000,000,000 supply, It adopts a demand-driven approach, where the coin supply is determined by market demand.- To encourage miners to participate Sketere, before block 5040, mining reward is fixed 90% block.- After block 5040, mining rewards will be ruduce to 30% from block.- Smartnodes collateral : 800,000 SKYTSpesificationsSymbolÂ  Â  : SKYTAlgorithmÂ  Â  : GhostRiderMax SupplyÂ  Â  : 21,000,000,000Block RewardsÂ  Â  : 5,000PoS RewardÂ  Â  : 60% SmartnodePoW RewardÂ  Â  : 30% MinnerDevelopmentÂ  Â  : 10%Block TimeÂ  Â  : 2 MinuteSmartnode CollateralÂ  Â  : 800,000Download Wallet :https://github.com/skytcode/skytere/releases/download/0.29.33.14/skytere-win-0.29.33.14.ziphttps://github.com/skytcode/skytere/releases/download/0.29.33.14/skytere-ubuntu20-0.29.33.14.tar.gzJoin our discord : https://discord.gg/UGfj5D6hEbWebsite : https://skytere.com/Explorer : https://explorer.skytere.com/",

Templates can be similar if the webdev is the same.Hi. With respect, I don't think this one is a scam like Fulminaire (yesterday) which wiped out my SkyTere wallet. Maybe your are right, but I don't think so.What my research did find is that a number of new projects started in the last couple of months which are all PoW/PoS, XeggeX on day one, identical wallets except for one change in color are all likely from the same group of people. I won't mention those projects, but they are pretty easy to guess.And I don't see anything legally wrong with copy pasta'ing projects over and over again to make money off the coin initial hype, but it is shady and dishonorable to be sure.But this doesn't mean these projects won't become something in future or that the miners/node operators haven't or won't make money.SkyTere and all the copypasta's of it may all become super profitable one day.A Dev using a template to spin up project after project is their business. I don't like it, but I can't call it a scam either.That's my findings. That's my opinion. Doesn't really matter in this case since the FLMN scam wiped out my SKYT anyways.Best wishes,",

There are many ways to safely open a new wallet, get an address, then take wallet.dat or seed phrase and use it only when necessary. The head exists not only to shove food into it.
