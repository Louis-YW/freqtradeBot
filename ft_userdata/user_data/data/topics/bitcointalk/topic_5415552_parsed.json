  "content": "QuoteResearchers have identified climate-driven changes to food availability as a factor behind dramatic historical events that led the oasis city of Palmyra in Syria to its ultimate demise.Ancient Palmyra has gripped public imagination since its picturesque ruins were \"rediscovered\" in the seventeenth century by western travellers. The most legendary story of ancient Palmyra is that of Queen Zenobia ruling over a thriving city in the Syrian Desert who dared to challenge the Roman Empire but ultimately got defeated. Her kingdom was subjugated, and the city was reduced to a small settlement without any wide-ranging importance. This has only recently been overshadowed by the catastrophic events of the Syrian Civil War that saw the archaeological site and the museum plundered and many monuments destroyed.Deteriorating climate and a growing populationNow, scientists from Aarhus University and the University of Bergen are questioning the historical narrative about the final blow given to the city solely by the Roman invasion in 272/273 CE.\"We can now see that food security, always the main concern for a large urban centre situated in a highly inhospitable environment, was gradually reduced with a deteriorating climate and a growing population of the city. The timing of this nexus matches exactly the time of the reign of Zenobia and of that of her husband, Odaenathus, marked by social shifts, militarisation, the rapid conquest of neighbouring lands and the dramatic conflict that led to the demise of Palmyra,\" says Dr Iza Romanowska, one of the authors behind the new study.Interdisciplinary team effort unlocks complex dataThe interdisciplinary research team reconstructed the hinterland of ancient Palmyra -- the area around the city that could provide it with basic foodstuff -- and used modern land-use models developed for dry and semi-dry environments to estimate the maximum productivity of the land. They then ran the model against existing climate records to determine how much food could be produced at different points in Palmyra's history and with what reliability. In order to do this, archaeologists, ancient historians and complexity scientists joined forces to unleash the knowledge locked in the otherwise impenetrable data. The results showed that a long-term climatic shift towards drier and hotter climate caused a gradual decrease in agricultural yields, reaching levels barely sufficient to feed the budding population of Palmyra around the middle of the third century.Innovative new approach -- new anglesCo-author Professor Rubina Raja, Aarhus University's chair of classical archaeology and director of the DNRF-funded Centre of Excellence for Urban Network Evolutions (UrbNet) heads the Carlsberg Foundation-funded project \"Circular Economy and Urban Sustainability in Antiquity\" from which the study stems. Rubina Raja adds:\"While there have been numerous studies looking at Palmyra's history, social composition and infrastructure, it is thanks to the innovative new approach that we are able to look at the history of this important city and the whole region from an entirely new angle. By combining computational modelling with a wide range of archaeological data processed by humanities researchers with deep historical knowledge we are able to consider the circular economy and its long-term sustainability and resilience.\"Learning from the past is keyThe study sets up a research pipeline, including computer scripts and detailed instructions, that will enable other researchers to analyse other ancient cities and determine how often and under what circumstances food security played a key role in shaping historical trajectories of past peoples.\"This kind of study showcases that many challenges which our societies face today had equivalents in the past. Contrary to the often-repeated trope that humans never learn from history, we can and we should learn lessons from the past,\" says professor in Global History at the University of Bergen and one of the study's authors, Eivind Heldaas Seland.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/09/220921141529.htm....For many years, internet trolls have said if the united states government runs out of funding. They can simply invade a smaller and weaker nation to steal their wealth and generate liquidity. The US economy is backed by the US military. Which can happily steal whatever it needs from weaker nations, to render its economic policy sustainable, no matter how dire the conditions.With food insecurity headlines becoming known constants in the media. Is it possible that food shortages of the future could pave the war to violence, war and bloodshed on an international scale? If nations with powerful militaries are unable to feed their citizens in the future. Could it lead to them invading weaker nations in an effort to seize resources, supplies and farmland. In an effort to achieve sustainability?Apologies in advance if this sounds depressing. I try to consider most scenarios no matter whether I like them or not. It might be somewhat negative. But can also be a good source of motivation.",

But doing so doesn't change any situation if there is an energy shortage let alone a food shortage.And food insecurity is at a local all time high right now between fertilizer prices, supply chain disruptions, etc. Some would say it's all part of a plan to increase reliance on government. Others might say its part of a plan to induce war for the MIC. Other's might say it's just how it is because of evil dictators / politicians. Who knows.",

You couldn't even begin to list the adverse effects of having too much food around.That's right, diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. But where do these diseases come from? Anyone who has asked this question will not argue that they appear after eating a large amount of food. But the quality of this food—trans fats, GMOs, and other garbage that is filled with our food in order to increase its quantity—plays a huge role. How many of those present here eat right? I can bet no This means that all this leads to diseases, not only in the current generation but also in the future. Will there be wars for lack of food? What for? Competitors will simply poison people with various filth, which will be called \"food\"And only a few will survive, because in our time, using natural products that have a positive effect on health is very expensive.",

Give the construction to the Chinese and they can build it in less than a year.We have not really reached to the peak of technological advancement, we are not going to suffer scarcity of food. These crisis are man made because we are banning fertilizers, the use of fossil fuel and creating war. There is energy available. All there is to do is to just agree on something and we could all go back to where we left of. Climate change has not really affected anything, we were just feed by all the news like storms, these storms always comes before we even have the concept of climate change.",

In an effort to achieve sustainability?Apologies in advance if this sounds depressing. I try to consider most scenarios no matter whether I like them or not. It might be somewhat negative. But can also be a good source of motivation. If we look at how the first and second world wars can be said that almost the purpose of war is to strengthen, expand and also certainly seize available natural resources. So the impact on the world, we can see today, strong countries over war events in the past make their status as a country that still stands with all the abundant supply of natural resources.It is very possible that when the country has lost the basic ingredients to feed its citizens, it is possible to create aggression back into areas with abundant natural potential but under poor government management, they can become targets. It's just that creating future wars brings tanks, weapons, and nuclear just as a title to scare weak countries into surrendering more quickly.Look at the war between Russia and Ukraine which we can still see with our own eyes, many factors are favorable if Russia can take over all of Ukraine territory. Not only the supply of gas, oil, and natural resources. Rather it is declaring that Russia's power is not seen from a military point of view but by ownership of the resources they claim.As a result, Russia economic growth increased and of course there were losses namely in Ukraine. Then if we talk more globally, this will trigger and motivate strong countries to carry out the same aggression, supported by alliances which eventually did not take long for the US to lose its status as a superpower.",

Once upon a time, the USSR, and now in modern times RUSSIA, tells a fairy tale about how the West wants to \"capture them, their resources, blablabla\" ... To be honest - from the side of an inhabitant far from economics, management and similar, complex issues, an IDEA can look real.The problem is that the times of resource and colonial economies and systems are over!I'll ask a simple question - tell me which is simpler:1. Enslave a country with, say, 100 million people, seize all the resources, and force the population to work for the invader. Or2. \"Buy\" the elite, and for pieces of paper that can be printed 24 * 7 to buy MANAGEMENT of a certain territory?I am sure that a reasonable and pragmatic person will understand that the second option looks more realistic and less costly. Therefore, fairy tales about \"seizures of territory for the sake of obtaining resources\" are medieval concepts! Can you prove otherwise? PS By the way - this is exactly what is happening now. And the Russian elites, screeching about hatred for the West, sold out to the West long ago, for Western money and Western values! Where do the \"patriots of Russia\" take the money stolen from the country? In USA, EU ! Do lovers of \"socialism\" in the West withdraw their savings to Russian banks, and rubles - this will be the answer, who has long been sold to whom",
