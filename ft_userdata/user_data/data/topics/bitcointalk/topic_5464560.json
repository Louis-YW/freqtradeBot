  "content": "The world just keeps giving, after my previous topic about paying your debts with monkeys we go to the next funny one, new home gold bar gifts!Yup sadly, it's gold, not Bitcoin, not even Dogecoin or a 2 by 2 pixels NFT!And maybe it's even worse than that since gold can't be checked by a decentralized network for authenticity evey time, it might be something like this:^ NOT a Toblerone !The article is a bit old but it's the only one out of a few tens I've read that covers every step.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/gold-bars-used-to-lure-chinese-homebuyers-amid-market-slowdownTLDR:Quoteproperty developers are struggling to shift stock is that several cities, in an effort to stabilize the market, have banned developers from cutting prices. Huafa Tianfu, a developer in the eastern city of Hangzhou, has been offering up to a kilo of gold bullion to tempt people into buying its flats, if it were 24 carat the 1kg bar would be worth about 450,000 yuan, or 18% of the value of the accompanying flat.So, in the long version, how and why is this happening:- Economic slowdown, deflation on the horizon housing sales have crashed- The government can't allow the prices to go down that much because it will trigger something worse than 2008, with the main government and regional ones being in debt close to 300% which will be a disaster- Since house estate developers are unable to cut fixed prices, they offer you a deal, giving you the house cheaper in reality but at the same time keeping the price up techicallySo you buy 2 million yuan and you get a 400 000 yuan gold bar, so the price of the house stays at 2 million but you only pay in reality 1 600 000!Now, we all know the Bitcoin situation in China is far than ideal, very far, like over the hills and far away, but could this be some breakthrough momentum when you're not allowed to pay what's worth but what's being said it's worth?Let's look at it:- Most are afraid that the bar will be fake, or of lower purity, total advantage bitcoin.- Gold is harder to buy and once controls are in place no way near a million people a year will be able to get their bars- Not that I'm advocating this but, it's a bit easier to deal with some accounting books once you deal with coins,I mean you can say that you gifted him 1 Btc and then send another 1 btc to some address. Again I'm not defending or advocating for tax evasion! - The government doesn't like the gift loophole but doesn't like Bitcoin either so you got your hands already, but it will like a bit more since they are interested more in gold than in coins- The developers won't have to pay one hundred armed guards to keep safe 1 ton of gold will the clients be afraid to leave the agency carrying a bar in their pocket, it can be done onlineBut more importantly, the seller can just say it's a worthless Bitcoin voucher code, it doesn't affect the price at all and besides, it's almost impossible to check if the voucher has changed owners. If I sell you a house and gift you 100 Pokemon cards I doubt pretty much someone will come to appraise it. Now that I think twice about this I'm really calling for tax evasion here  So, do we have a potential usage scenario or I'm grasping at straws in a turd market full of bear dumps?",

I think this gold bar is no longer a gift; instead, people are paying for it too.But I am truly shocked to see how deflation could also shake the base of a powerful country. I have seen the world facing severe conditions in inflation but did not realize any situation in which deflation could make such an impact, and the strategy to fake the price of real estate in China is really good.I mean, to avoid a more deflationary effect and to attract people, such a strategy is good. I am having such experiences just now (such experiences mean deflation impacts).",

About thirteen years ago some Chinese were swapping physical notes for gold bars, the three years ago, there was a scandal where a Chinese company used fake gold bars to obtain loan. Then 3 days ago China invest in almost 8k tons of gold. Well, as for real estate in China, they are struggling to keep their heads up and this is the reason for the gold. Well it is a good one compared to offering a car. But then what is the value of the gold?",

It's actually the same thing, nobody is expecting you to keep that bar or the car, you can resell them the next day to get your money back, it's not a nonrefundable gift or something like that. Besides, the value of the car is based on how much do they sell that apartment and how much are they forced to declare as value- the minimum fixed price is 500 000 and the real market value is 400 000 they will probably gift you a mercedes- the minimum fixed price is 100 000 and the real value is 90 000 then you are going to get a used vw golf!Quote from: mvdheuvel1983 on August 26, 2023, 03:07:43 PMWhat is China's obsession with gold bars?

      "body": "Is that the reason behind China's increased gold import? Haha, kidding. By the way I wonder, are they going to limit developers to build new houses? Because lowering of supply will increase the price and they won't have to make a shit show like this one.Overall, housing prices are artificially inflated worldwide because it's an easy money to buy/sell and/or rent. People are waiting months to sell their apartment or to rent commercial properties and still don't decrease prices, this really makes me to think that real estate is artificially kept inflated. But I don't understand why does China want to keep it inflated? What's wrong with decreasing housing prices if there is not a big demand? I don't understand what's the point of banning developers from cutting prices?And to be honest, I don't completely understand what's the point of your post @stompix? Why don't they offer Bitcoin over gold? Or it would be better if they offered bitcoin over gold? I think this is done on purpose, they could offer a sportscar or something like that instead of gold that will 80% be fake. A lot of people on Reddit say that Chinese real estate developers are very shady. China remains a mystery for me, I don't really understand what's the life there. I have heard good from some people who have been there but online everyone talks about how terrible and full of scammers it is.",

You bring up an interesting point regarding the sale of items like Bitcoin voucher codes or even added bonuses like Pokémon cards (at collector pricing) in transactions. It can indeed be challenging to assess the value and authenticity of such items in a market that may lack scrutiny. Your concern about potential tax evasion is valid, as these additional items could potentially be used to manipulate the perceived value of a transaction.In essence, it's essential to have transparency and accountability in any market to maintain trust and ensure fair transactions. Whether this situation could be a potential usage scenario or not depends on how it's regulated and monitored within the market.
