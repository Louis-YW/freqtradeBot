The transaction was created, but not sent (or most likely it was dropped from the mempool for not confirming soon enough).Tell him to right click the \"local\" transaction and resend it. Or even better, remove the local transaction and send it again with a higher fee. Use mempool.space to get a fee estimation.",

People here do not engage there except for business purposes, because they believe it is the den of thieves. How about you just submit your transaction id here if it does has since you say it is pending or better still upload the screenshot here. But that wallet privacy will definitely be affected, so you actually Pm him on the forum to help but I strongly doubt he will be with you at telegram.Also be careful because many scammers will be flooding your telegram DM now to say they want to help you do not reveal your seed phrase or private key",

      "body": "Quote from: Reza2020838 on September 24, 2023, 06:33:40 AMOn the blockchain site, when we enter the hash, it says that it is pendingPending as in it sees it and it is unconfirmed, or pending as in it doesn't see it at all and is waiting to hear about it?If Electrum says it is local, but a blockchain explorer sees it but it is unconfirmed, then it sounds like it has been dropped by some nodes due to the fee being too low. The server your Electrum client is connected to has dropped it, but the blockchain explorer hasn't. Or perhaps the blockchair explorer has also dropped it and doesn't see it at all.Either way, what I would do is the same: Simply delete the local transaction from Electrum, create a new one with a higher fee, and then broadcast this new transaction. It won't matter if your old transaction is opted in to RBF or not - the Electrum server you are connected to which has already dropped the old one will accept the new one and should have enough connections with other nodes running default limits or running full RBF that it will propagate sufficiently to be mined. If not, then share the TXID here and we can help.Just have your friend right click on the local transaction in Electrum and select delete. Then make a brand new transaction as they normally would, but with a higher fee. Use the fees box on this page to select a reasonable fee: https://mempool.space/",

Just right-click on the local transaction in electrum and select \"Remove\" and after that make a new transaction. Just take note that when you close and open electrum, it's possible that you connect to a new server which has that transaction in its mempool. If you see the unconfirmed transaction and its status is not local, right-click on that and select \"Increase fee\".",

So, there's nothing to return to the sender. The sender already has full control over the fund. If a transaction in electrum is local, it means that it's only displayed on your device and the node you have connected to doesn't have it in its mempool.With removing the local transaction, you remove that transaction from your wallet, so that you can make a new transaction.",

His friend just consolidated inputs.The friend then went on to make another transaction paying 122 sats/vbyte, which I presume is paying OP, and OP has then sent that output to what seems to be Binance with a fee of 241 sats/vbyte. I would suggest to OP to learn a bit more about bitcoin transactions. In total those transactions paid around 163,000 sats in fees ($40), when the whole thing could have been achieved in two (or even one!) transactions, and paying less than 5% of those fees.",
