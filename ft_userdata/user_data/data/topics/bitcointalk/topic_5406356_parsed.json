It was once less than a dollar, cause of the public perception of it or lack of knowledge. If it falls below that again due to public perception, it is still recoverable as long as the inherent qualities are present, as long as 1BTC = 1BTC.Once there is a chink in the protocol, then we can say it might not be recoverable.",

It would have to be something that would destroy the foundation and system on which it is built. what you say?It's incredibly hard to say with so small amount of data. It depends greatly on what causes the price drop and whether Bitcoin still has a future after that or not. Also it depends if it's caused by some better alternative (although even then the drop should not be that big).However, we both know that this is pretty much a worthless speculation, so any idea is just as good (or bad) as the next one.",

We can never know what happens in the next centuries but I could imagine that for some reason there could be a real crypto winter lasting for a very long time. In this time most of the coins will be lost forever which will make the remaining coins more valuable again. So at some point I could see it even recover from 0 USD, since at the point where it is 1 USD or even 0 USD many coins will be forgotten.",

But then again, we will also stay one step ahead of the game, for sure if there is a treat about QC, bitcoin will have to re-adjust it's cryptography.Banning will not do it, stopping mining as well. It could be the basic foundation, but then again as a I have said, we might not see the price going to $1 because the we will make SHA256 immutable to QC attacks.",

It would have to be something that would destroy the foundation and system on which it is built. what you say?Well your conclusion was very far --why? Because the bitcoin system works decentralized and no one even changes its protocol, if ever it will be changed --that is not bitcoin anymore.About the price prediction, no one can predict it and there are no people who predicted it --unless if, you have a special power to come in the future. But remember this --bitcoin has proved itself that there will be always an all-time high [ATH] without a specific time when it will happen, but will surprise that at the end of the day we have a bull market trend and everyone's yelling on it while you are regretting because you sell your bitcoin at a low price.

Maybe at this moment Bitcoin is not a danger for them, but what China has done regarding Bitcoin is not something that is impossible to expect anywhere else in the world, even in the so-called largest democracies of the world such as the US or the EU.I wouldn't go as low as $1 at all, because if the price of 1 BTC ever fell below $1000, it would shake the market to the point that it would be very difficult to regain the trust that Bitcoin has at this point. Bitcoin was conceived as a decentralized currency, and any prohibition to use it in such a way harms it - and apart from some countries that legally prohibit Bitcoin, there are those that have prohibited the use of the same for payment (Turkey and Thailand), which opens up space for some other countries to do the same.",

Bitcoin dropping to $1 isn't going to make the people forget about that certain problem and suddenly look at bitcoin as an attractive buy.",
