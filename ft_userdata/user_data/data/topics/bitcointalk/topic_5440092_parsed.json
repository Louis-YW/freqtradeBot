People without crypto currency might likely be doing well in other fields but when it comes but it comes to issues politics, policies and economy crumbled of the country, its affect everyone though but some just manage the system because of their position",

      "body": "Nigeria is already hard, and the hardship is caused by bad governance, the government know the problem of the country yet they refused to tackle it, but they are so focused on changing the currency just because they are playing politics with the currency so that politicians who stole money won't make use of it, my question is, how would that money stolen by Politicians profit us that are citizens, will they pay the stolen money to our account if recovered? The answer is no, then why the change of currency?It just made the country rowdy, people are suffering looking for a way to withdraw their own money, it's just so annoying, the set of people that came out with anger to express their griviances by doing protest ends up been shot and killed by military,To me I don't think anything other thing can be done to ease up the hardship, rather than ending bad governance, and the government tackling this issue of subsidy so that the price of fuel can reduce, and let CBN print enough new currency notes so we can have access to make withdrawal at ease, this are my thoughts..",
