And also you can just simply move the topic using the move button on the bottom of the thread. Lock button is also on the bottom part to avoid redundant discussion on same subject matter. You are spamming the forum if you open same topic at the same time even on different board.Make sure to follow the proper format for scam accusation thread to make it more simple to understand! Btw this casino is doesnâ€™t have any representative here. Your best chance to do is to report it on Askgambler since they have the power to file a official complaint against online casino. That amount is already significant how the heck you deposit on that unknown casino using huge amount without doing background check?",

And yet you didn't do as it was instructed. And also one thread is not allowed to appear twice in different board, so you have to lock one which is the first one in gambling board.

A casino can restrict their clients account if they find anything suspicious but after investigation if they return the money they owe to their clients then the casino is doing right thing. Honestly speaking I never heard of the n1bet, the logo seems unknown too to me. On the other hand OP only posted two screenshots and some words which make it difficult to understand the validity of his case. Do n1bet have an account on the forum?",
