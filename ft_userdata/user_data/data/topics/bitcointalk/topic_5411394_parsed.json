So if any gambler losses his money while trying out the site, then definitely he will blame you and your strategy for the loss.Nevertheless I will leave a detailed review soon after complete analysis.

Also you could show where the provably fair page on each casinos you listed too, to prove if the all casinos in your list is really provably fair.Quote from: Chato1977 on August 27, 2022, 10:48:14 AMJust dropping to ask what happened to Bitpro that you first advertise and present couple years ago?after updating from 2020 continuously and does not find support then you created this new one , though it is your rights to presents how many site you wanted.I think they want to make Bitpro bigger and widely known since they still include Bitpro on the pages, I think there's no problem as long as they didn't trying to hide the first project.",

Where Pf.guru only have the list of crypto gambling sites with some gambling related services (Martingale calculator, strategies). Maybe OP has created this new affiliate marketing site to get more reach in the gambling community. His only intention is to gain referrals as he hasn't made the detailed review of any casino. The design of this new site is similar to the Bitpr0, which is simple but good looking.@Stakefast, The rakeback rate is 5% at Stake, but you have written that it is 15%. Does the user receive extra rakeback if they join through your link?",

Design is simple yet enough for it's function and it is also mobile friendly. However, I guess this is still a work in progress as there are some function that is still not yet available such as Martingale Calculator and Probably Fair. Looking forward for more update on this platform",
