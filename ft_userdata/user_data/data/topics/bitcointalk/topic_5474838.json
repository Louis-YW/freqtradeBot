Loads of people are taking the Entrepreneur's approach to life and although its not an easy one, it'll pay off in the long run if we all keep pushing.Checked out your site and I must say it looks great, not too clustered and the user friendly and colors are just perfect, it also loads pretty fast.I also noticed that the number of merch there are quite few and items under the categories are limited. Do you intend to have third party signups to sell their own comodity or its just you doing it all by yourself?",
