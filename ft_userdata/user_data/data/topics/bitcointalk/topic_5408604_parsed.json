RegistrationRegistering at this casino is quite easy, but what is unpleasant is that the display of the main language that is not English must make us choose English first unless we understand the main language of this casino.2. Deposit & WithdrawalHaven't made a deposit here when I will check the available deposit methods, only these 2, I don't understand if there must be other settings that must be done to be able to make a deposit with crypto. Haven't used PM (Perfect Money) for a long time and have no interest in using it anymore just to make a deposit here so they should provide a crypto deposit method, because they provide withdrawal with crypto so it should be available on deposit too. The nice thing about this casino deposit and withdrawal is that the minimum is very low in my opinion only $1 for deposit and $5 for withdrawal3. The game I triedIt's a game that caught my attention and tried it with fun mode so without real money, I can say this game is quite interesting and if I'm not mistaken it is almost similar to minesweeper games. The name is GoGo Banana4. SuggestionsPop up notifications are not fun for players especially if it's not important like thisso my suggestion is it's better to remove it and will only appear when players want to interact with live support.Display language is highly recommended defaults to English5. FinalThe appearance of this casino is quite good and also the loading speed does not experience problems when switching from one game to another including the sportsbook.",

Other than that I do think I will try and edit it later on.Would suggest the particular website to make everything more professional, I did check the site but did not want to actually deposit any money since the site was showing random Arabic language which ofcourse is a big no, since you guys are targetting international audience, that really put me off for accessing this website. ( Might be a Personal opinion ofc please corelate with other reviews)",

I think that anyone's first visit to a casino should focus on displaying offers and promos for new users instead of asking them to join a telegram channel. Pop ups are distracting too. I would want my new customers to focus on registration.The footer section has a few shortcomings.Most of these icons have a white background for some reason. The registration page inquires a lot of person details(full name and phone number).  The currency is set to IRR ( ). I had to google it. Maybe set this value according to user's geographical location.The timer for future events has a very weird design The deposit process seems to be very flimsy for crypto. It seems like a checkout page more than deposit page.  Maybe a static deposit address for major cryptocurency will be more convenient, if majority of your users are going to use crypto.I had the same problem like other users, I wasn't able to copy the address when I clicked on copy icon. Seems to be a JS errorCode:Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The Clipboard API has been blocked because of a permissions policy applied to the current document. See https://goo.gl/EuHzyv for more details.I was impressed with the game layouts and available options to bet on. But equally disappointed with the deposit flow and some parts of the design.I hope that my review will be of some help here.",

I speak of this:watch the game time and see that on the field it says that it is marking a corner and now see this photo:more than 10 minutes passed (the game ended up showing that they were taking a corner) and on the field it was still showing that they were taking a corner. I think the OP needs to contact the provider to correct this, because when you place a live bet I always see how the two teams are playing based on the game data and I watch the game for a while even if it is that way (I forgot the name)",

I did the review on ann thread before where my point is language, (After changing to English, I still got message promotions in the Persian language, and chat support also uses Persian)2. I can't find 2fa where it is a common important thing for security.3. Because we are on a global forum where many people come from other countries and currencies, better to change IRR into $ because many people confusing and must calculate again to $ for how much to deposit.4. I can't change personal detail without inserting a Passport Number.5. I saw Shiba Inu on withdrawal options, but I can't find it on the deposit options, so how? because I can't find the exchange and worry you are not ready like the post above (10 hours for waiting)",

Anyway the first problem i faced once i entered the casino link to register is the wrong language which is persian while at least everyone should get english before having the choice of changing it. Then after registration there's also a bothering window you get from the support which you get even without clicking on it. Beside that you get a link to join a telegram channel and this will make you feel like the casino is not professional and dealing with alot of spam.And once again with the language problem once i logged into my account the igot persian language instead of english, i had to change it again manually and even that, I'm still getting messages and offers with persian Now i will talk about the casino games and betting options. For me i only like to bet on sports football specifically, first thing i noticed is that yas casino support alot of world teams and matches. At this timing on live events i find many teams playing right now this is something impressive. Beside women cup and betting even on ballon d'or event.I also tried live casino since I'm a big fan of table games as blackjack and roulette. I loved that this casino has diffrent language tables. For example an arabic roulette with the server talking arabic it's alot of fun for me. Only fed casinos offer this.For deposits in the casino it's a good thing they have added perfectmoney vouchers but it would be better making it direct deposit from perfectmoney account. Also for the crypto the best thing they did is 1$ as minimum (talking about usdt, btc is 0.0001) amount for depositing so everyone can test the casino.My final review and last points: i liked how smooth and simple the casino to use on mobile better than most of casinos i tried before, so i would say with some improvements and fixing all the small details users facing right now. Surely yas casino will be among the best online casinos.",

I wasn't able to move further because I don't understand Arabic, so I feel it will be very good to make some language changes in the platform in order to make it accessible world wide.  Isn't anyone that can understand and know how to change language to English, so the space for changing language should be written in English language for proper identification. 2:- The Telegram group for basic help and support is a great idea because various complaints can be addressed in the Telegram cahnel and proper guidance can be given to visitors or people who are new to the platform.That's a great idea, but it should be in a universal language, not just Arabic.   3:-  I suggest more Deposit options should be provided, only these two deposit options is not enough as many people might prefer other options.4:- The withdrawal options are good, as one have many crypto coin of choices, and there are other options of withdrawal. And the minimum amount for withdrawal is not bad.",
