So that the administrator is not wrong in choosing DT members.1. It's not the Admininstrator who chooses DT1, it's more complicated than that and it's based on who trust this guy (Admin can ban thought somebody from becoming DT1)2. Murat is not DT1, it's DT2, and that comes from somebody in DT1 trusting him (in this case it's YOSHIE). And since YOSHIE is also one of the best in finding those scamming bounty campaigns I guess that he will take a look into those accusations better than I could.",

Because Sergio Red didn't have any problems before and ended up getting banned after getting reports the account was connected to Kpcian.Likewise with Kpcian, of course it is impossible to sacrifice his account for the umpteenth time after getting the first Red trust by TwitchySeal on 2016-10-01And get the next Red Trust on 2018-04-21 by yahoo62278 and on 2018-04-22 by The Pharmacist.Meanwhile, Sergio Red and Kpcian used the wallet address on February 01, 2018 That means long before they get Red trust.What you should know is that Kpcian is not a Newbie ranking account.If it was a cheat that sacrificed his account, of course they wouldn't sacrifice an account that was much bigger than the rank that was sacrificed.Quote from: KingsDen on October 23, 2022, 07:24:18 PMThe administrator does not choose who will be on DT1 or DT2.
