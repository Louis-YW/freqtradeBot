I can see you've mastered the art of one-liners and have a talent for being skeptical. Your expertise in shilling, sockpuppeting, and deceiving is truly admirable, although I must admit, those aren't exactly the qualities I'm seeking for my project.But hey! we all have our preferences.. right??? While you may view all projects as the same, I'm here to revolutionize the NFT space with asset-backed tokens. If you ever decide to shift your perspective and explore the potential of creating something extraordinary, feel free to reach out.Until then, keep perfecting those half-finished sentences and watching the NFT world from the sidelines.Cheers,Ashish",
