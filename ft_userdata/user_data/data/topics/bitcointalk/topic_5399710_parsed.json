Changpeng Zhao (CEO of Binance) is the second richest crypto billionaire after Satoshi.How is this a fact about Bitcoin and the forum? This has nothing to do with Bitcoin nor to the forum.Anyway, credit to you for compiling these facts, but many of these are hardly facts that people never knew or even care at all. Some of them are too trivial and immaterial to Bitcoin that people don't really need knowing them, or knowing them doesn't really mean people have increased their knowledge of Bitcoin.",

We didnt even knew if he still alive and there is no document specifiying that only btc is his asset. Who knows he might also have some that we dont know. Or he didnt manage to liquidate yet his bitcoin at all.Anyway thanks for sharing this info.",

Or he didnt manage to liquidate yet his bitcoin at all.Highly unlikely that he/she liquidated at all. All the addresses linked to Satoshi Nakamoto, from the genesis block to others which received coinbase transactions during the very early days of Bitcoin; have not yet sent any transaction out. If these were truly owned by Satoshi as speculated, then that would mean they have not sold or liquidated their Bitcoin holdings.The only reason I can think of, is he/she fears impacting the value of Bitcoin too much. If addresses linked to the creator of Bitcoin were discovered to sell, that would sway trader's sentiments a lot and affect the price.",

Changpeng Zhao (CEO of Binance) is the second richest crypto billionaire after Satoshi.CZ contributed nothing than holding bitcoin, he shouldn't be among. CZ created a crypto exchange and make some altcoins look like bitcoin and people can use the coin because of their low withdrawal fee on Binance, thinking it is bitcoin, but not bitcoin.",

The highest price 1 Bitcoin has ever cost (A.T.H) is $68,789 November 12th 2021The ATH was on Nov 10, not 12th.The ATH was $69,000 on Bitstamp and differs from exchange to exchange. Coingecko lists $69,044.77 as ATH, but it's not stating the exchange where they've got that number from.Also, as said, CZ is just another businessman. He's not that iconic for Bitcoin, and because of pseudoanonymous nature of Bitcoin we just cannot know certainly who is the richest person alive, hence that entry should go away.On the other hand, Hal, as first tx recipient, would look better in your list.Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on May 22, 2022, 11:38:16 AM8.

If it's a fact that Satoshi is the richest please reply me, bur if it is a mere speculation that the creator of bitcoin should possess upto 30% of bitcoin, don't bother replying.

By 2140 majority of us here, will be long gone and forgotten but bitcoin mining wouldn't stop till 2140. The only thing we are longing to see is the global adoption of bitcoin, bitcoin skyrocketing to her ATH of $250k or above as predicted. Any other thing apart from that would take care of itself.

Remember that bitcoin is built like other technology, and another thing that is like bitcoin or greater than bitcoin can be induced to world and people will face the new one. For the global adoption of bitcoin, is something that meant to be taking slowly because if bitcoin continue this way, all the world will adopt the uses of bitcoin as a function. Bitcoin is not old enough and it can never be fade up for now, but the adoption is much, and if not government who is one of the barrier of bitcoin it would have speculate than this",
