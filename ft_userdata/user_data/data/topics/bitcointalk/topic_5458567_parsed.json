  "content": "The cross-chain bridge platform Poly Network has been exploited again and it looks like 57 crypto assets are affected. If you're having any assets on Poly Network try to get them off as fast as you can.QuoteIn a July 2 tweet, Poly Network confirmed it became the latest decentralized finance (DeFi) exploit victim after attackers managed to manipulate a smart contract function on the cross-chain bridge protocol, adding it will be temporarily suspending services.In the most recent update, the team revealed that the exploit affected 57 crypto assets on 10 blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Heco, OKX and Metis.Affected assets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NK1v-hvaPKQviZqowtwwOm3swF0vNNN_vhFivbmRTqs/edit#gid=1942611831Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/poly-network-users-withdraw-bridge-exploit-affects-57-cryptoAbout $5m were already transferred out:Source: Twitter/PeckShieldDedaub analytics breaking it down:QuoteDedaub explained that the attack wasn’t complex, as no logic bugs were exploited. It added that Poly Network took seven hours to respond, which cost the platform $5.5 million in stolen crypto. Luckily, a lack of liquidity in many of the tokens prevented further losses.Source: https://twitter.com/dedaub/status/1675516729349292032Poly Network's service is temporarily suspended:Source: https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675591279005106178Stay safe out there guys. Always use your own wallet. Don't leave your funds on 3rd party wallets, CEXs or other providers. (If this isn't the correct board, please move the thread).",

The irony is hard to grasp, lol.Quote from: stompix on July 04, 2023, 01:42:40 PMSecond thing, why was this thing even alive after that $600m hack two years ago? No clue, tbh. I guess some people just don't care. At least as long as they are not personally affected, but when they are, they will cry even harder.",

They are deliberately complicated to make it seem that their existence is justified, while at the same time they are a real Swedish table for every little skilled hacker who wants to help himself from that table. However, one should not ignore the bad guys inside the platform who just want to go on the vacation of their dreams, and how to resist the billions that circle around you and literally beg you to take them Quote from: stompix on July 04, 2023, 01:42:40 PMSecond thing, why was this thing even alive after that $600m hack two years ago? I guess no one cares about that hack, and I doubt anyone will care about this one now - to me this DeFi honestly seems like an ideal platform for money laundering - you just need to know how it works I've always appreciated some other things with the name Poly more",

It makes no damn sense at all!",

I think the reason is that those hacked coins have been returned Nearly all of the $600 million stolen in a huge crypto heist has been returned — but there’s a catchQuotePoly Network said all but $33 million of the $600 million worth of stolen digital coins have now been returned.Hacker who stole from Poly Network could be allowed to keep $500KIn an unusual turn of events Wednesday, an anonymous person claiming to be the hacker said they were \"ready to return\" the funds. The identity of the hacker, or hackers, is not known.There's $33 million gone and that's enough for someone to live a life of luxury for the rest of their lives, but since no one has been held accountable, someone else may have decided to retire early.People's memory is weak and they quickly forget. Perhaps the hacker will decide again to return the 4 million and keep the 1 million for himself.If a person decides to use that bridge after being hacked twice, then he deserves to lose his money the third time.",
