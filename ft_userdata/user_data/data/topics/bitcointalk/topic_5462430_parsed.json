Remember it's a private meeting we just want to know what you'd like to tell him about his invention and related discussion.Everyone gather together and view replies I'm sure many of us have modification and a lot to tell him since we've learned quite a lot from This can bring insight to many of us too I'm very sure.@user soloninja it's a question asked. I actually didn't meet with him. I hope you understand now.Thanks for all your replies so far they're thrilling actually.",

Either he's dead, or he's ran far, far away.But most people wouldn't care about doing that, because then it would not be the real thing.<also Satoshi would probably get lots of notifications from scammers and other low-lives, just like the rest of us get around here.>",

I don't think he would ever reveal his true identity. Not in this lifetime. And it isn't advisable either. He isn't some random guy, who can come up a stage and say 'hey I'm Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin\". Not a chance buddy. Even if he were in this community, if he wanted to he could have but all these years his identity is still a mystery. This community even has a reserved badge for him, I think it was a platinum badge. But sadly nobody ever claimed that. Check this out: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2834773.0",

Well, if you answer me that then I would be glad to know what are the plans that Satoshi Nakamoto in the future. I know that it won't be possible since we know it's been years and no one still know who he is. OP, if you were Satoshi Nakamoto then what will be your answer for my question?.",

Bitcoin maximalists are very against these(there are both valid and crappy takes), so I’d like to hear what the man himself has to say.",

My goal is to see Bitcoin embraced as a global currency, free from centralized control. I envision continued innovation to enhance scalability, security, and adoption. Let's work together to empower individuals, promote financial inclusion, and revolutionize how we perceive and use money.I am not perfect in my creation but it will go a long way yet I'm hoping to come up with better currency while I maintain anonymity or my invention will provide aid for someone else to do so...you already have some others trying to hold grounds with Bitcoin and it's cool\"",

But If I were given the opportunity, I would be eager to engage in a conversation with the creator of Bitcoin. I'd begin by inquiring#is Satoshi a person or a group of people?#what was the main reason around Satoshi's decision to remain anonymous. I'm well aware that this choice was made to preserve the focus on the technology rather than the individual, but I'm curious to know if this anonymity has brought about any unexpected challenges or opportunities. #Then I will also want to know about how many Bitcoin he's worth, since his the creator of the technology, most people would assume he would be the richest of all Bitcoiners.",
