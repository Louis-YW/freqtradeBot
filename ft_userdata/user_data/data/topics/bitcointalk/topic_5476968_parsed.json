I have no reason to believe or not to believe OP but kucoin is shady as hell, so that check outs in my books. It has been so from the start. Right from the start, they just removed dividends from people who bought their token, without any repercussions. Yes, i knew dividends were illegal, but the fact they didn't or didn't care made it really shady. Helpdesk in there is pointless as most of us here know more about crypto then them. So they basically just need to put you in hold and ask for the supervisor. None of them speak decent English and communication is lost in translation. Which is weird as there are currently very capable translation programs, yet they fail in basic English. Just try to find one good review about their helpdesk. I just gave up and left the site. I had better customer support from actual scammers.",

One that comes to mind is MEXC. https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mirror-protocol#marketsI've not used Kucoin, before and hearing about how unfair they are to their customers will not make me not to consider their services. I think that exchanges should be sincere in their dealings and try to make transactions easier for their customers, after all in the OP case, it is not customers fault that Kucoin, has issues with US government, this should have made them to consider withdrawals through convenient means.This goes to show the importance of not leaving your coins in an exchange, if they have any issues then your coins will be difficult to withdraw. We should always remember that if it's not your keys then it's not your coins, always rely on your none custodial wallets, because only you have the passwords and seed phrase.",

This is the reason why everyone here advocates not your key, not your coin and your issue is one of example why users should avoid holding coins on them. Nothing can be done now as they would have changed their policy about MIR. All you can do is be patient and request them to release your funds. The worst they can do is say No to you other than that you would suffer loss, the alternate option is to transfer your token through the LUNC network to other exchanges that support it and then convert to ERC20.",

None of us would believe in you unless you provide proof of your problem. For real, are you being serious right now!Maybe you don’t believe the user but I do and am sure a lot more other users do as you can see with the responses that precedes yours. I don’t know how am sounding right now but, am just surprised you would say so about a user who is only asking for directives.It doesn’t matter if this is the user’s first post. For all I care, it could be that, the user’s enquiries on possible places to get help brought this user here and you wouldn’t expect the user to go about creating some activity rather than trying to achieve his or her purpose.Maybe, after sorting this out, this user would find some more use of this space. It’s cool being curious on your first activity on the forum, so long as it’s directive and not expecting anyone to give you the keys to their wallet, password, loans and other form of financial aids.I think Kucoin have done the right thing in updating you guys on the changes that is to come @OP but, they would do the most to ensure easy processing of these transactions. Perhaps a swap and then have it sent out in some other altcoin. Am guessing that wouldn’t be the case but, you could research on CEX that uses this protocol as, I can’t tell, am not a big fan of altcoins but, your welcome to seek what solution you could find, it’s what the forum is about.",

There is a way to get them off Kucoin to Terra station wallet (desktop app) but then they are stuck here as it does not seem possible to sell MIR on the terra classic chain to LUNC anywhere so that the LUNC could be sold in the future.If ERC20 was still enabled, which has been offline for 6++ months on Kucoin, users would have been able to transfer to another CEX and sell at a loss and claim towards tax. This can't be done now so Kucoin has screwed any MIR token holders!",
