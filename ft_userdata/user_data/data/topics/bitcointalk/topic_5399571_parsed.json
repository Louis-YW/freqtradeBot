      "body": "I agree that saving money is important but it's hard to make a general rule out of it. First, many of us are in different parts of our financial journey and that’s perfectly ok. If you are at a stage where your earnings allow you to save, I would definitely recommend putting some of your excess funds into savings and/or investments because life is very unpredictable and can turn on a dime. On the other hand, if your earnings are so low that saving means you aren't getting your basic needs met, I would not recommend sacrificing your physical or emotional health just to save for your future.",

Person B buys $500 in bitcoin a month, we come back to them in 10 years. Person B will have made so much more profit.",
