      "body": "No demo account like it is in forex, not common in crypto. I have seen demo account on OKX, you can try it, but I am not sure it is for future trading and also possible to have different layout. My advice is that you can use small amount of money for future trading, I remember I used less than $1 to open long and short positions on Binance several times before I started real trading, though it depends on the leverage used, if using lower leverage, the amount of money needed to open a position will increase, but I think $10 is enough for 1x leverage.",

Demo accounts like those in binary options trading are just robots that are set to keep winning and if you switch to a real account everything will change.

Demo trading is not robot enhance except you have a robot on it yourselfQuote from: kamvreto on August 04, 2022, 04:52:39 PMÂ and if you switch to a real account everything will change. It's better to use a real account but use a little of your money to try scalping strategies with high leverage as you wish, it will be better because you can know how it works for real.Lol not for real. I think the difference between demo trading and real trading is the emotion that is involved in real life trading because you are scared to lose your money and that makes you taking irrational decision in trade.Quote from: kamvreto on August 04, 2022, 04:52:39 PMIf you are a professional trader of course you don't need the demo account, but if you are a beginner and hope to win with high leverage I suggest using leverage wisely or just switch to spot trading, don't be too pushy.Sure he is not a professional trader and that is why he is looking to do a demo first before going real. Moreover the professional traders had their own challenges including to demo trade. They did demo trade in their beginning to master their trade.",

You cant really able to bare the risk when you are already witnessing the real deal when making futures.",

Sure go ahead and learn it from the demo accounts as much as you can, but it doesn't have too much to offer you in the end.I think it is expected that not all available apps/software are perfect but we can go on the ones that is more accurate than the others. If we can easily get a profit in demo than in real trade then maybe it has something to do with our confidence. It's just that we are more confident in demo trading, knowing that we can't lose anything. Not only that but we are also dealing with volatile cryptos here so the experience really can change the moment you step in the real thing like the price isn't the same anymore and the fluctuation are now much stronger. Demo still helps as it makes you familiarize on the stuffs that you are dealing with.",
