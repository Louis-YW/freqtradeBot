Conlan was actually a good contender to fight Lopez but the man seemed to be in a hurry and gassed out in the end. Despite the head movement, it just took one shot. Quite a fun fight to watch.  No assurance he can win vs. Gonzalez though, he is also a tough opponent. One can say it's not an easy fight for Lopez.There are interesting matches on the card like Xander Zayas vs Roberto Valenzuela. This is worth watching also.",

He has beaten an undefeated prospect and has back to back wins in the UK.And yet he is not considered a top-drawer with all these good fights, Lopez is such an underrated and his camps know it but until Inoue goes up he needs to fight whoever can give him a good reputation in the ring, one thing that draws me to Lopez is he was never been hurt in all of his fights.This guy has a good chin and body, and he loves to come in he may not have an excellent ring generalship but his moves are imposing enough, if ever Lopez is the real opposition to Inoue's road to greatness.I can see these two clash in the future, Lopez started this idea so We'll see if Inoue's camp is ready to take this idea for them to meet in the ring after they both hurdle their respective opponents.",

Just like coin-investor I also first saw Luis Alberto Lopez against that arrogant hype Gabriel Flores Jr. And the next time I heard him is when he was given his first title shot against Josh Warrington. I was rooting for him but I honestly did not expect him to win in the UK. Lopez is really underrated and I assume he was underdogs against Flores Jr. Warrington and Conlan.Joel Gonzales is another popular Mexican prospect but he always loses every time he steps up in competition. He lost to Shakur, Navarette and Dogboe. One thing is sure though, he is one tough contender so this fight might be 50/50. I doubt Lopez can hurt Joet so he better be ready for a 12-round war because his opponent will keep pressing him.As for Lopez's future, I think he better stay at 126 and try to unify the belts first before considering moving up to 130 for Navarette. Also, an Inoue fight at 126 will give him the biggest money compared to Navarette and Cruz at 135. So he better keep that belt around his waist and try to lure Inoue to move up.",

Personally, I'm not familiar with these fighters, although their names might be well-known. Whoever wins this fight might have a chance to face Inoue if he decides to move up. Judging from their statistics, there's nothing particularly interesting as they aren't KO artists or they only have a low KO rate.Anyway, I think I would choose Gonzalez to win, as he has the height and reach advantage.",

It was clear from the start that Gonzales had no opportunity to win as he does not have that pop that could intimidate Lopez but nevertheless, it was a good fight.One thing i observed on Lopez was that his defense wasn't so good and this is crucial if he fought Inoue in the future as i think Top Rank will be cooking this fight to make Inoue a 4-division champion as Lopez is very beatable.",
