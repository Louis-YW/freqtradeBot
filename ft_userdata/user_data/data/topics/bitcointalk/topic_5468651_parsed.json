      "body": "Algorithmic Trading? It is a new term here. By searching on Google, it is another expression for trading bots, and if this is true, we already have several open source bots and you can trade with them safely without the need to use third-party applications.I cannot trust a bot that is managed from a closed source TG channel, even if there are no API permissions to withdraw.Can you make it open source or website, or are you planning for commercial profit, or is this a trading signals group?",
