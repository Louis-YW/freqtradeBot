      "body": "You site is just straight to the point no much information about the casino if itâ€™s licensed by any recognized gambling body or not, and this wallet requirements which is the only option for login, i understand itâ€™s for privacy reason for Solana users who would not want to link their identity to any gambling place, but again, (just a suggestion though) would it not be nice if you can also add some other option which someone can use for funding, for those who will not want to take the risk of connecting their wallet to the casino due to lack of trust. I believe this might also be the reason why you donâ€™t have much of active players currently as I can see that your last played game is 6hrs ago thatâ€™s if the data is correct, people are so much concern about their funds security.",

      "body": "Welcome to the forum, when I saw the title I thought: your casino only has a deposit option for Solana only. I hope I'm wrong, now if I'm right that your casino only has the option to deposit solana, I highly doubt that this will cause many people who have other cryptocurrencies to exchange for solana to go play at your casino when they can play at other casinos that have the option to deposit the cryptocurrencies they have in their wallet. Another point is what your casino has to offer that other casinos don't yet have and that is what would make you have many customers or no customers.for example I didn't see many bonuses, I'm talking about things like registration bonuses, I didn't see other bonuses, I didn't see TOS, I don't know if your casino will or won't charge kyc, I didn't see a license in your casino, although a license is not something that guarantee that the casino will be trustworthy or not, because there are many licensed casinos that have become scams, but at least with a license your casino does not run the risk of being targeted by governments. In any case, congratulations on the casino and I wish it great success, only in the last 2 months I saw that many new casinos came to the forum, so I see that you will have a lot of competition in this market",

No email registration needed whatsoever, but just simply I'm good to go once connected.Tried some few games like Flip, Dice, Hilo, etc., and everything went smooth. I lose some, but I win some as well. For first timers, there's an initiation fee before proceeding which is just one time only. Maybe you add some more casino games to it.Interface looks slick especially the effects in both winning and losing the round. One thing however is that my Avast antivirus detected the chat part as \"scam\", but did not block the entire site even with the antivirus is still on. Hopefully you can sort this small issue every time I access this website.You also need to add TOS and there are no bonuses for first time registrants. This is something that you need to consider but overall great start!",
