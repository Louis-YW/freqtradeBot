He hires people to make him an Ann, maybe design something, and run a signature campaign, things like that, which most likely will earn him positive feedback. So the business starts to work, and the only question I have here is that if it works by doing it honestly, why are you going to rip people off, but it could be like a backup plan for when the chips are down.

Yet another one is a bitcoin physical collectible owner making name for themselves and even meeting some users in real life and then scamming them (the yogg incident).The fact remains that while dealing with someone on the internet, deal with then with your bag of paranoia.

I just do not think its possible.  But we can fight back by getting the word out about these scams and their shady tactics.  The best defense might be awareness - the more folks know what to watch for, the less these jerks can take advantage and  its like community immunity - safety in numbers.   I believe its a collective effort to keep the space safe. Plus if we make it a thing to always double-check everything, and fostering a culture of due diligence, instead of just trusting blindly, that helps too.  So maybe be skeptical of anything new or anything that seems too good to be true.  What do you think could be done to make these scammers' lives a bit harder?",

That’s often the likely scenarios about some projects that later turns out to be the unexpected or scam projects.I don’t see any reason as to why, a successful business would choose to run away over people’s money and end what could have generated continual and regular funds for the owner. Of course that’s not how someone who hopes to create a lasting brand would think or perhaps, it just wasn’t there line of business at all but even that could be developed on when the going gets good.I don’t know for the Betnomi project but, I think I’ve been around a while to see them conduct there affairs here and they were okay.Most times, you just don’t expect the sort of wins that you might experience on your platform and when your not meeting up your ends to the payment, you become a scam. Not to mention the lots of abusers that would be exploring the platform on different levels.",

Heck if I know.  But it's obvious the people in charge didnt have the skills to pull it off proper. and  If their plan was to take the money and run from the start, they could've done it ages ago - changed their names vanished somewhere off the grid where no one would find 'em.  But they didn't do that, so maybe it wasnt a scam after all.  Just lousy management.",

I know there was a campaign manager suffer from this case, but it's not easy to build back his reputation.2. The creator is really transparent with their bankroll, this will make people know how much the money inside the casino.

      "body": "I remember similar scammers who presented their “projects” in very colorful ways. This was in 2018. A time when bounty projects and sites with shitcoins for investment were created daily, several of them. So, a couple of scammers started an activity here on the forum that was difficult to determine at first glance as a scam. They created websites and created videos with the public, who were supposedly very interested in the project. They rented offices and hired actors who were excellent at speaking and inviting slogans for investing. I remember that our old scammer hunter discovered their location in a completely different place from where they positioned themselves.Everything was very well organized, but all the investors and our hardworking bounty hunters never got anything.  Scammers were found on social networks with colorful photos of a beautiful life.Nowadays, new technologies make it much easier for scammers to create fraudulent projects. With the advent of AI tools, it will do everything for them. And if we say that investors today want to trust something new, it is really very difficult for them to determine future fraud.Therefore, one stable option to avoid falling into the clutches of scammers is to trust Bitcoin.",

You can start a business which looks perfectly legit, hire reputable members to shill for you...1- Your legit looking scam business may actually produce profits. In this case taking it down and scamming people will cost you more than keeping it running. Many people will go after you, you will be a target and for what? Taking down a good business. That's stupid. If you are clever enough to get this far, you can continue to run this business and print money.2- If you are not making profits and hemorrhaging money, then it is inevitable.

I've tried hard to reach them and encourage them to solve cases raised against them, but... well, ultimately, the decision is all theirs.For the time being, I am placing a warning for forum members to use this platform with grains of salt due to the complaints, be it in this forum, or on arbitrators; regrettably, in form of negative feedback. I tried to delay this feedback as long as I can in hope that they'll deescalate the situation by addressing the concerns, but it gets piling instead of decreasing.Allow me to borrow your thread as a list and reference point for my feedback. The amount of dispute on the open cases below can probably also help judging how serious their situation is. As for BC's representative, if you read this, hopefully the list below can help you on navigating the cases you need to attend.Currently, these are the open cases against BC.Game, with the declared fund being confiscated:BC.game asking me to lose intentionally, then confiscating funds by GekkeBelg | resolved | mBTC88BC GAME LOSES DISPUTE AGAINST ME - AND STILL DOES NOT PAY MY WINNINGS by Jannn [a continuation to this thread] | resolved | $3,409BlockDance B.V., BC.Game and its Fraudulent “Operator Verifier” by earlypaco | resolved | $7,111BC.Game cancelled my bonuses and locked my account with $100k+ USD balance by -god- | resolved | $250,000BC.Game - can't withdraw 7.97 BTC by dplay | resolved | BTC7.97Edit:Recent development:[21.11.23] - Case with dplay changed to \"unresolved\" as a result that BC stopped responding on AskGamblers after previously said they'll process the withdrawal immediately. The arbitrator marked the case as unresolved too.- Case with earlypaco marked by CasinoGuru as unresolved.- Case with Jannn marked by CasinoGuru as unresolved.[24.11.23] - Case with dplay got partially solved. BC asked AG to reopen the case and paid the due balance in USDT [124,000]. dplay got compensated with some amount of USDT, although not to what's agreed or desired. Thus, partialy solved, because the player still think he's not whole with the compensation but can't do much other than accepting the offer.[26.11.23]- Case with GekkeBelg got resolved. BC explained the misunderstanding happened that stemmed from the odds provider's side. Confirmed by GekkeBelg that he got the due amount and is satisfied with the result.- Case with Jannn got resolved. BC acknowledged their oversight in details of the terms for bonuses, compensated Jannn in full with the amount due, and is planning fix the details to better convey the terms of bonus.[27.11.23]- Case with earlypaco got resolved. BC paid in full with current BTC rate.- dplay got the rest of his balance as per requested, totalling USD 170,000. Pending for clarification and withdrawal, but for the time being, I am marking it as solved.[08.12.23]- Case with -god ruled as resolved by Casino Guru with the result favoring BC, where the casino has full right to confiscate funds under advantage play.",
