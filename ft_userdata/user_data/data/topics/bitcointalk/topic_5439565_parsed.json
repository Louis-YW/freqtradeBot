Spot price is the actual price of a coin but the future price is derived. You can see the spot price higher at time, while you can see it lower at times. Funding rate is what is used to make spot price and future price not to diverge from each other during volatile market.If the market is very volatile for a coin and it favours the bulls, you will see the future price most likely get to the spot price and later become higher. If the market is very volatile for a coin and it favours the bears, you will see the future price get lower than the spot price. In normal condition of less volatility, the future price is more always lower than the spot price which makes the funding rate more always positive.You can experience this in a very volatile market.Quote from: Synchronice on February 12, 2023, 10:45:31 AMAt the same time, coinbase had way better rates than Binance.

It is related to block time of a blockchain on which you move your cryptocurrency as well as speed of withdrawal processing and required confirmations for deposit before you can trade.Arbitrage: How arbitraging works in investing, with examples",

If you look at the coinmarketcap, you'll see every coin their have their own different value on every exchanges and that is because of the trading volume. If you are planning to take advantage of the rate, you'd better to consider the fees first before doing that and see if its worth it or not, it's legal of course as long as you have your KYC you can be good.",

My dear, this will not favour you, just stick to the price of the different exchanges as you see them. It will not be worth it, they are almost the same, it's you that believes they are not since you are seeing different prices, but are negligible.

Also, a huge price boost made SKL Coin among top coins on Binance chart and it was number one in Gainers section. Its trading volume was significantly increased too. So, the question was, how did the coin that's hot in charts on Binance and is number one gainer on Binance Futures section, managed to maintain such a high difference between Spot and Futures trading?I find it kinda confusing, my doubt here is that, is this done manually by Binance to liquidate users money to benefit themselves?I know what's arbitrage trading but my main point here is whether it's legal to do or not. For example, if I do it with big money, will it turn a red alarm on Binance and Coinbase? Will they consider my actions suspicious and block my account?

Maybe you are right that the price difference is related to internet issues. It could be that his connection is only slow and the price dont update quickly. Or maybe it was just normal scenario since both of them are not the same types, I mean one is spot trading and the other is futures trading.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on February 13, 2023, 08:39:39 AMWhat you want to do is purely legal but to what gain?

It can be profitable if done right but is risky if done wrong due to how volatile this market are. Arbitrage is legal in crypto trading but only illegal on sports betting. All of us aren't the same. You think it's not worth it for you but who knows, it might work for him? Sometimes it also has to do with our luck and not just with the knowledge alone.",

We could say that in spot trading you also don't own it because the exchange has it on its wallet, but with futures it's possible to never have it and still lose money. You buy a contract with fiat money and when the contract ends you get fiat or lose fiat but you never own the coin. That's why the SEC doesn't want to allow a spot futures ETF because they want to keep the scam manipulation going. Futures prices are so disconnected from reality because they aren't real.

There's really no worry about these exchanges if you do arbitrage. If ever you see an opportunity like this, the question is how long you'll be able to do it. Because at most times, the arbitrage opportunities are no longer there and are hard to find. They won't flag you for doing such as it's been there being normal even before. You may try to see on how your exchange(Binance) will react on it but to say that, they wouldn't really care at all.",

All the above, if you do like you have mentioned, did you calculate how long such price differences will exist? In most cases, if you buy/sell in large quantity then prices in both the exchanges will converge as early as possible. When the price gap is not significant or not enough for covering for the fees to pay for placing orders (buy and sell), withdrawing from an exchange and network tx fees then there will be no point of planning for buying in one exchange and selling in other exchange in larger quantity.When something like this is not feasible in large quantity, most people do not like to go for it in even in small quality as well due to the hassles involved in moving funds from one exchange to another. Probably you may try for it in small quantity if you have funds initially in both of the exchanges initially (to save time by not waiting for network confirmation before gaps disappear) and if you are KYC verified (for ensuring not getting locked while withdrawing).",
