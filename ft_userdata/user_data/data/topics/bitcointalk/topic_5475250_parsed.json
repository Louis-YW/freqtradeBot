Who knows what could happen to KAS, maybe it will be like BTC whose hash will increase and will need ASIC soon. I'm not really familiar with the coin but one way to find out which coin is good to mine at an early stage is to keep communicating with fellow miners. See what they are up to.",

      "body": "When big teams create a new project they usually register social media accounts. So you can monitor for new subreddits/twitters etc. created. For new subreddits, you can look here: https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/newNot sure about new twitter accounts. Maybe you can monitor hashtags. This requires scrapping and potentially manual labor to filter out the results. But afaik it's now the most reliable method to find out about new altcoins. Probably though, most new coins are not going to be mineable. Most newly released cryptos start out as tokens, or are designed from the start to be tokens forever, on blockchains like BSC that don't allow mining. Back in the day the announcements board of this forum was all the rage. Now that the space has grown most cryptocurrency users aren't even aware of bitcointalk so crypto teams don't bother that much. But you can still lurk the altcoin announcements board in hopes of finding something.",

As reddit isn't an epicenter for cryptos. In fact it's just everything in there in ungategorized order. And usually reddit page is not a first thing coins do. Lot's of the new projects won't even look at the reddit",

Not sure if there are other websites like that but if you are also looking for some other coins to mine but not during the early stage of it. We've got websites like whattomine[1] too. It is just for your reference and I know that many of the coins there are no longer in the early stage but it's just for your reference if ever you can't find the new ones.[1] https://whattomine.com/calculators",

How can you determine if they will even hit in exchanges?Because the truth is a lot of these mineable coins won't see the light of trading platforms. Only few of these would hit in the market and be profitable. Others, you will just be wasting your resources or your time. I have experienced that in a lot of coins way way back so I already stop mining and stop checking these mineable coins.But if you will explore top mineable coins, why not? If you have powerful GPUs and cheap electricity.",

I am sure that there are way more active miners who are experts on this subject.I too used to look for new mineable coins in Altcoin announcement and jump in early. I made a good profit on coin biblepay which was introduced in the forum and was mineable. Now there are less and less of those new mineable coins as it's easier to generate tokens and list them on dex and the most coming out are not being able to get listed and the ones that are listed has plenty of coins to dump. I used to have a plethora of mining setup and clients for different algos to mine from my CPU and GPU but they have lost their charm now and I uninstalled them.",

Some of these good coins are not noticeable on their early stage and when it finally kick in then its already on top. Probably some here got early on kaspa and congrats to them for finding such gem. Probably we can see some hunter herr who shares their early finding and make a risk on that one. Obviously they are taking risk thats why they earned a lot from searching new tokens or mineable coins.",
