It failed to gain popularity and build a user base. We had DEFI bubble, NFT bubble, meme coins bubble, metaverse bubble ... XLM was sleeping for last 5 years... Did not participate in ony of it. There is no decent dex, no volume, no traffic, no decent project build on XLM, there are thousands of potential competitors. Don't buy it. Its not worth a penny.",

I had a few XLM myself until i sold them one year ago or so. Since then i am not really following the developments around XLM anymore to be honest, but as the other guy in the thread has already said, it seems to be pretty quiet around Stellar Lumens at the moment. That does not really mean though that this project is not active anymore. It is still in the top 25 in terms of the market cap, so it is still a very big project and to be that you have to be active. When the next bull market and the next altcoin season are coming, then i am pretty sure, that XLM will also pump together with the overall market. I am not sure though if it will outperform the general market.",

Not everything they say is good enough to be your basis for how the market will perform. None of them probably said that the price of bitcoin will be up again by $30k and all they say is whatever the news and the trend. But when it's up to the actual status of the market, they have no idea. Don't be too gullible with content creators dictating what coins you must buy because they're just giving their opinion but ask them if they do really trade, only a few of them will legitimately say yes.",

Be good to hear thoughts on XLM, both good and bad? As an investment, i can't see it rising too much compared to potential some other altcoins have. As what comes to fundamentals, they lack developers and adoption. There are potential however as their almost isolated hype team reminds me of NXT community back in time. That mooned before devs scattered to other projects. What XML lacks a lot is community hyping it. I have not seen it mentioned in anywhere.",

Apart from the fact that I mentioned earlier XLM's position at CMC has tended to decline in recent years, and this shows that XLM is having difficulties dealing with new altcoins. With this fact I doubt if XLM will be able to provide maximum profit in the upcoming bull market.",

All investments involve risk and I would strongly recommend that you do your own research and analysis before deciding to buy XLM or any other cryptocurrency.If you decide to buy XLM, I would advise you to consider the option of gradual accumulation through DCA in order to reduce risks and get the best weighted average price to enter the market.

But if it were me, with a capital of $3000 4000 I would split it up and invest in other altcoins or just bitcoin.The potential for XLM to increase in the future I believe there will be, as it still has its own support community, when the bull market returns it is easy to think that it will pump to the expected level, but remember it won't come quickly. And if you have a DCA strategy with this coin go for it, because there is no such thing as perfect price speculation, do your research and make sure you accept all possible scenarios with this coin.",

I don't know XLM's history but recently there are some development within the XLM ecosystem. I remember there was some DEX development but halted due to how the system works a year ago. Right now, they are focusing development of their new smart contract layer/platform, Soroban.The system limitation of what seems to be holding back XLM seems to be resolved by Soroban. Nevertheless, it is still in the developmental process, so it is not yet ready for production or the masses. One thing they focus on besides Soroban developments is developer relations. There are various grants and promotions that specifically attract programmers and builders to build things on top of Soroban.The way I take it is currently they are focusing to build things first, then after the ecosystem is established, an adoption campaign will come.https://stellar.org/blog/a-developers-guide-to-soroban-adoption-fund-programshttps://stellar.org/blog/stellar-quest-live-series-6-fast-cheap-out-of-controlhttps://soroban.stellar.org/",
