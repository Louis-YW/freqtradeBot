      "body": "The only thing ordinals actually affected is the lack or seemless transfer or the fact that they would be feeling up some space and subsequently the blockchain and making full node users wasting disk to download them useless coins. The rest of the other features you mentioned haven’t been tempered, for privacy it is actually intact because they aren’t asking for KYC or even stopping the running of ones personal node. For decentralization they also aren’t on it because the miners still propagate transactions base on fees and mines blocks as usual, if it want for even decentralization they wouldn’t even be on the blockchain because some centralized bodies would have gotten them removed. But bitcoin network decentralization gives everyone the opportunity. For security yes, it is still intact, ordinals aren’t Quantum Computers that we would say will pose threat to the network’s algorithm. Then financial freedom; yes you can still have total control of your coins, send them out whenever you want and how fast you want it to be included in a block, just that you have to pay higher this Time around.Quote from: taufik123 on November 09, 2023, 11:36:01 PMThere is no clear consensus on whether Ordinals is an improvement or an attack on Bitcoin.Ordinals are none of this two, the only clear attack I see on bitcoin blockchain apart from breaking the two algorithms ECDSA and SHA256 or 51% attack. This folks are just wasting their thinking there are attacking bitcoin because sooner or rather than later this naive people paying huge transaction fees for them will stop Let’s not get bother about this ordinals again, we experienced them twice before this year and at most it was 2 to 3 weeks so soon even this will pass",

We still have control of our privacy, we are still decentralized, security is still very high at 6 confirmations, the only issue is the fees, simply as that.I don't think either that we are force to used LN, to be honest, I haven't used it and just rely on the simplest form of transactions.And this is not the only time that the fees has increased because of brc-20 ordinals it has happened before and it just died down without us noticing it. So I guess this is going to happen again, sooner or later than expected.",

It costs time, resources, and most especially money. Only transaction fees were affected by this flood in the mempool, and all of the other things that you enumerated weren't. Give it a week or two and I'm pretty sure the hype on Ordinals, alongside the mempool flood, will get cleared and we will get back to normal transaction fee levels.",

With good control, coin control feature, fee rate customization, you can use a fee rate that is good for you and your capital.You can observe mempools and pick good times with proper fee rates to broadcast your transaction to mempools and wait for miners to confirm it for you.A Bitcoin user, a Bitcoin investor must have other reserves to use. You can not store all money you have in bitcoin and when you need to make payment, you have to either sell your bitcoin at any price at that time or have to move your bitcoin with any fee rate you must use at that time.You can have cash or stable coin in small amount that can be used when you can not use Bitcoin with cheap fee rate or when you don't want to sell your bitcoin at low price.",
