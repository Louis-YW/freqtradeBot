  "content": "On Friday morning, Japan's prime minister officially died after the shooting in the city of Nara. Tetsuya Yamagami is the name of the suspect who made 2/3 of the shots right in the chest which made the prime minister rushed to the hospital and died there. Based on the article I read, the motive behind this shooting was due to dissatisfaction with Shinzo Abe's leadership during his tenure. The weapon used is confirmed to be a homemade shoutgun.In your opinion, apart from the embedded revenge motive, could there be a policy that is truly unacceptable to the suspect, because based on Tetsuya Yamagami background is a former Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, is it just a personal grudge?source : https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62089486 (including shooting seconds video)https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/08/asia/japan-shinzo-abe-dies-shooting-intl-hnk/index.htmlhttps://apnews.com/article/japan-shinzo-abe-shooting-22ec2248d92304deb9cc46b2142402d2",

It seems really strange that he would target someone like Abe and not religius leaders themselves...I mean, it's still a motive that could verry well be the truth, but an odd choice. As for it being connected to Ukraine...sure, it's also connected to the Nazis who live on the dark side of the moon FFS.",

So the prisoner is just waiting around and has no knowledge of when they'll actually be killed. Guess there would have to be larger motive if hanging by death was worth it. Abe was was a nationalist and on the right, is that enough?",

It may be possible that the shooter believed that his mother donated excess money to this group.",

      "body": "My first thought was that the Japanese actually tested some of the genetic so-callled 'vaccines' which were to be injected into Japanese citizens, and rejected them due to 'contamination'.Japan also, unlike any other government, actually asked to see the biodistribution data and found out that the LNP's ferry the genetic payloads straight to the reproductive organs.  (Gee, who could have guessed that that would be the case?)How much Abe may have had to do with any of the above is unknown (to me at this time) but certainly interfering with the depop shot program in even the limited ways outlined above would be grounds for assassination.  Several African leaders learned that the hard way, and many others around the world certainly took note.  That's probably one of the reasons why almost no 'leader' of or within any government will even touch the 'great reset' depopulation agenda.  Hopefully one day the tide will turn and Abe's fate will meet all of the leaders who DID go along with the project at the expense of their native populations.",

It is more common for a bad person to use a truck to crash through a crowd, or to use a knife against innocent people in public. Someone who is determined to harm the public is going to find a way based on what they have available to them. If there are innocent people with guns in public, and a bad person decides to use a gun to try to harm the public, a good samaritan can quickly intervene.",
