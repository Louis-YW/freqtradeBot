True, these ratings are hella low, do they come with big fingerprints on them or what?Joking aside, cool coins, I think a decent crypto collector needs some Doge stuff every once in a while. Still: Any info on mintages? Silver shield usually go with very low numbers if I recall correctly.",

Silver shield usually go with very low numbers if I recall correctly.For the Silver Shield coin, 1501 were minted: https://www.goldenstatemint.com/MiniMintage-by-Silver-Shield-exclusively-at-GSM.htmlFor the BTC and Doge BitPay rounds, I am unable to find a mintage number.They do not specifiy on the main sales page. Guess they were a collab between BitPay and APMEX:https://www.apmex.com/product/228315/1-oz-silver-round-bitpayhttps://www.apmex.com/product/233048/1-oz-silver-round-dogecoin-round",
