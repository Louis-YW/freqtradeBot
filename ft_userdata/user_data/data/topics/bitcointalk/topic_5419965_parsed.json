You can say whatever you want to say, it is your right and you should do whatever you want to do, however wouldn't it be more reasonable if you just came up with \"why\" you think like that?If you think matic is leading all alts, I can point out that ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, DOGE all of these are still above it in market cap. If it is only about the past 7 days increase then OKB is doing better too and many lower level ones if we are looking at that. So, just because there is a coin that went up a little bit doesn't make it lead anything, I am sure I could find some low cap coin and buy 10k dollars worth of it and make it go up %500 easily, doesn't make it any better.",

But I can't say that Matic is the leader in the altcoins market.It's just that Dogecoin is a class of meme coins but its marketcap is around 10-11B$+( https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/ )Whereas Matic's markecap is at 8B$ almost only according to CMC (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/)",

The recovery that happened in polygon is really fast at this moment compared with another project. It's caused by polygon has been trying to expand its ecosystem. The cooperation with meta has proven if polygon must be consired as a very good project. i don't even se any layer 1 project that was making big partnership with major company. I would not be surprised if matic can recover really fast compared with another project in the crypto ecosystem. Matic is still on fire despite the dump that already happened in the market. Matic would be very big in the future.",

The Polygon network is pretty great and their partnerships seem to expand almost daily with some of the largest brands in the world. I like where MATIC is going a lot but I feel like it had such a massive explosion in value it will take some time before the coins get distributed enough to be fair. Right now it seems like a few players are still sitting on massive gains that need to be realized.",
