      "body": "Due to the icy road surface, vehicles collided in a row. In this special weather like rain and fog, is there no management department of the bridge to investigate the road surface? Vehicles will also be allowed to pass. As long as the car in front does not stop and slows down, the car behind will also slow down naturally. Parking and braking is the most irrational behavior.",
