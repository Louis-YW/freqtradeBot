  "content": "So have any of you been wondering what happens to the Bitcoin network if the Atlantic internet cables are cut off?  Gas pipelines on the Baltic sea was just recently blown up so it's not so far fetched scenario to happen is it?Will the network fork?Would Elon Musks Starlink satellites still keep the Bitcoin network up and running if all the cables are cut? Assuming the miners would use that as back up solution?",

So lets assume everything else is gone would BTC really be able to run and produce new blocks with just that small satellite network?I'm having difficulty imagining this scenario because I don't think much would work if those cables were cut.If you imagined having an international banking scheme that relies on planes, the economy has probably already crashed.I think the Internet could probably be launched off satellites if something like this happened so things would be less interrupted/interruptable - but satellite Internet is slow. Blockstream could probably be better resourced than the Internet for doing the downloads too (with the satellite internet being used to query if the chain is still trustworthy and the longest). Blockstream can't receive transactions too so that might be a problem (or it couldn't when I last checked). Thankfully, the cables wrap fully around the earth and if part of a cable is broken it can be repaired (it's not like they actually take up the entire cable and relay a new one in its place, they can float the broken part of the cable up to the surface and fix only the bit that needs fixing there - it's locatable by echo location).",

For sure those countries that had been affected would surely be looking for that son-of-a-b*tch who do cut off those cables and considering on crossing in between international waters doesnt really took to fast whichthe thing you do said that they might able to cut off one of those lines but the other ones had been already patched or repaired already.Dont know on whats up into the minds into those who do cut onpursuing such target or goal on cutting off network connections.EMP is indeed more realistic on making things to happen but cutting cables? It doesnt make sense.",

But there is still satellite so we get the message across on the other side that we are offline as of that time.So probably that is just the worst case scenario, couple of hours and that's it. Internet could be restored right away all over the world even if the Atlantic cables are cut off or being isolated.

Even if BTC was working, you would have a lot of difficulty buying things as merchants imploded all over the place. Assuming you even had service on your device. The large main players have redundancy to keep the local networks up, but everything else would become a disaster very quickly. Recovery, would be somewhat quick however since there would be an outcry to get it fixed whatever the cost.-Dave",

That's why bitcoin's weak spot is such issues.Now part of our lives are in the digital world and all of that requires energy sources such as electricity and internet connectivity. If both are off then all activities will be interrupted and delayed. It is undeniable that if these two things happen to bitcoin, it will certainly have an impact on bitcoin transactions and mining which results in the cessation of all existing systems, which you mention is only China, what if it happened all over the world?",
