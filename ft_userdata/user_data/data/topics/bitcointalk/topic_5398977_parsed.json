  "content": "Hey guys,  I started farming 3.5 months ago on BSC chain. I want to build a profitable strategy from providing liquidity to pools. I have the following coins in my portfolio, which I hold with long-term goals and some of which I have already added to pools:   XRP goal $3 (77% APY) – wowswapBSW goal $5 (45% APY) – biswapSXP goal $8 (19% APY) – wowswapBNB goal $1000 (17% APY) – alpacaETH goal $8 000 (4% APR) – rocket I also have some other coins from the top 100 and some low-liquid coins that I haven't figured out what to do with yet. If you guys can give advice on my targets or new coins I'd be happy to.",

If you guys can give advice on my targets or new coins I'd be happy to. It looks like you are doing well. Yes, Alpaca has some really good APY. The problem with XRP on BNB chain is that it is reliant on Binance to switch back to real XRP. Consider farming on songbird or flare when that is available. Another high APY coin good for staking is ICP, which can net you 28%.",

One thing should be remember that these all coins are top class and don't need to change . You can add more like Cardano but don't change your portfolio. Hope you will get good results in future.",

If you guys can give advice on my targets or new coins I'd be happy to. You have your own price target, and hopefully, your target price can be reached in the next altcoin season and come soon. I see the coins you had to have the potential to go high, especially ETH and BNB. So it is likely that the price for both coins will rise again. But you still have to be patient because we will never know when the price for altcoins can rise again. After all, it will follow bitcoin price movements.",

I am saddened by Cardano because they had every chance to repeat the similar fate of Ethereum, but they spent so much time developing their plans",

Farming is actually just for fun, we don't consider this as a good profiting source. But I believe that having good and high liquidty coins gives us more returns than those coins you have in your pocket.",
