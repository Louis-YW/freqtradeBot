  "content": "A friend of mine who has been doing Bitcoin investments since 2015 tried so hard to introduce me to it but I wasn‚Äôt buying the idea. As at 2018 I was still skeptical about it cause I thought no good can come out of it and it will crash. He kept telling me how it works, but I wasn‚Äôt ready to invest my money on digital currency. I remember his exact words, he said \"I know you can doubt this. Your skepticism and your fear of risk taking are colliding but that‚Äôs okay. It is the hunger you have to invest that will help you grow faster while investing on Bitcoin. The skepticism can stay there, I am not going to try to chase it away for you. You can sit in the corner, be in the background, its thin shadow casting dark and transparent on the wall. But that doesn‚Äôt border me cause I know I can't promise you a pot¬† of gold at the end of the rainbow, but know it's the final decision you make today that will help you in future‚Äù. That day I thought about it over night and decided to give it a try. He showed me so much about how things are being done. From creating a wallet, how to buy and sell bitcoins. I also went on to research more about what I was about getting myself involved in. I‚Äôm glad I listened to my friend and invested in Bitcoin. I‚Äôve never regretted my decision till date and that‚Äôs what gives me so much courage that even when Bitcoin goes up and down I still believe that it will rise again. Although ever since I started investing in Bitcoin it hasn‚Äôt gone this dip before. But I trust it‚Äôs for the best and it‚Äôs a great opportunity for me to buy more and hold. That‚Äôs how I started my bitcoin journey. How did yours begin?",

Don't reuse password or create your password in a template of your own.I checked out all the study guides recommended by tbct_mt2, I can attest that you really need to read them. They would be indeed helpful. You must also note that investing in Bitcoin has it's own level of risk, hence you must be well prepared to bear the consequences when the price drops. Also every investments needs patients and courage. Sometimes it takes a long time for an investment to start yielding profit. But some impatient investors sometimes hurriedly sell off their investment even at loss because their projections is not working as planned. Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme where you just want your money to double overnight, you need to be patient.",

So when I searched on Google, how to make money online, I discovered a YouTuber who was teaching about Bitcoins.I was astonished to see that the value of 1 BTC was around 400-500$. I mean it was completely new for me and seeing a coin whose value is so much, made me interested to dig about the coin.In this manner I was introduced to the coin, and then soon I started gambling in Bitcoins in my initial days before becoming a trader.I guess many people‚Äôs story will be similar like mine, as 80% of all the Bitcoin traders were introduced like this when they searched for a side income.Willing to hear other people‚Äôs story also.",

Damn, you're probably one of the first I know of who started so recently, and actually got something great out of it, well done to you, fair play!I got in before the previous cycle, but being a holder and never really doing much in way of trading, I actually had to liquidate significantly IN 2020 just as 20k was being broken... so I did \"profit\" from that as I wouldn't have ever saved as much without Bitcoin, but I'm today effectively where I started that time, since Bitcoin is more or less in the same range, and I haven't managed to build much more BTC than I had then.Oh, just a regular saver here.

You can bought btc from largest exchange Binance, Coinbase, FTX, KUCOIN if your plan is holding for long time then withdraw it on your personal bitcoin wallet and keep holding OP is sharing about how he entered the market and his experience in the market, he didn't ask us where and how to start investing in bitcoin.

Honestly, whether we enter the market in 2013, 2017 or even now, I don't think it's too late to regret or regret. We are the pioneers of the bitcoin revolution. Our job is to accumulate as many bitcoins as we can and keep them as long as possible because they will help us have a better life in the future. Instead of doubting bitcoin, we should be thankful because if it doesn't drop we won't have the chance to own it for a low price.",

Yeah this is exactly why I was so skeptical about it in the first place. It took me a lot of research with the help of my friend talking me into it, to finally agree to invest my money on Bitcoin. Scammers has made it difficult for so many individuals to invest on crypto currency. They have used different strategies to take money from people using Bitcoin. So the best any body can do is go online learn more about how Bitcoin works so you won‚Äôt fall for any of their scam.",

I suspect I was playing with craacking passwords with graphics cards using a program called hashcat or something like that and maybe that's how I came here via \"hashing\" related words or some such.I was then back at the end of 2018 but in this case to the shitcoinery world. Took about 4 to 6 months to see the power of Bitcoin and since then I have been focused solely on Bitcoin and Lightning Network!I'm 100% hodler for now and I'm focusing in my opsec as I like to do pretty much everything by hand (command line, etc) and since probably the start of the pandemics and with the realisation that our privacy has been under attack in multiple fronts, I've been slowly working on de-googling, keeping my data as private as possible, removing account from sites I don't need to avoid targetted ads, always looking to improve my browser's privacy and sometimes anonimity and stuff like that.I have my own cold wallet made by me using a few tools available on Linux and I'm kinda enjoying the struggles and questions and etc. It's been quite a learning curve since, let's say the end of 2018 (the registration from 2014 doesn't count).",

Another important concept I always try to talk about is Time Preference. Time Preference is a measure of how much importance you give to the future compared to the Present. So, the more you prefer the present, means the more you don't mind about the future, therefore you discount a lot of the future and that is said to be a Longer Time Preference. If you care more about the future than the present, then it means you discount less from the future, therefore it's said you have a Low(er) Time Preference.Have you ever watched a video about an experiment made with kids, where a kid is left sit on a chair, in front of a table with like 2 candies, and he/she is said that if he/she can wait like 10 minutes without toutching the candies, they will have twice as much (or maybe more, doesn't matter) candies they can eat! But the trcik is that they are left way longer than the 10 minutes and after that time, some of the kids of the experiment couldn't hold themselves and took the 2 candies, while others were able to¬† hold themselves and wait for the adult with the extra candies. This is Time Preference. The ones that were capable of not having that quick rush of eating the 2 candies right away when the adult left the room, are said to have a Low Time Preference, because they discount very little the importance what the future had for them (the extra candies). The others that preferred the quick rush of eating the 2 candies are said to have Longer Time Preference because they couldn't hold themselves and chose the quick pleasure of those 2 candies!This is one of the most important things about rejecting the quick buck coming from shitcoins in detriment of waht the future may have saved for us, both in terms of what fiat will be and of what Bitcoin will be!",
