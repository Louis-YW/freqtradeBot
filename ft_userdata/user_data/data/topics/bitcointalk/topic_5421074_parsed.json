  "content": "Hi all,to what extent can the performance and the hit probability of these two tools be compared and what significance do they then have?For example:- we run Kangaroo in multi-GPU mode on several modern GPUs and achieve a displayed speed of 15 GKey/s- we run keyhunt in BSGS mode on 8 CPU threads with about 16GB RAM allocation and get about 80 PKey/s.Is Kangaroo with multi-GPU usage more advantageous and more likely to get a hit, even though keyhunt with CPU usage in BSGS can process 80 PKey/s?From this numerical example, one would think that keyhunt with the 80 PKey/s would have to be worlds better. But is that the case or is it not possible to compare this at all and the given speed rates are completely useless for the comparison?",

      "body": "These are completely different algorithms and it is incorrect to compare them by the numbers shown. A properly tuned kangaroo will always run faster than BSGS.However, the main difference is that if the BSGS did not find the key and finished work, then you can be sure that the key is not in the given interval. Kangaroo is a probabilistic algorithm, and you cannot be sure that there is no key in interval, even if the kangaroo has completed the estimated number of operations.",

Kangaroo is a probabilistic algorithm, and you cannot be sure that there is no key in interval, even if the kangaroo has completed the estimated number of operations.That's true, but:1) I would rather say the biggest difference is in resources needed, as BSGS requires much more memory2) Kangaroo is \"probabilistic\", but with a big enough amount of work done, the chances for a final result are very close to 100%. That's well described on JLP program's page.",
