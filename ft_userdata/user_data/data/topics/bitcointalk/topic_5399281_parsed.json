Karish2return and Thenoss have used same address (0xA07ef5d740D5000C3bc5bba7751f27F9AAefDA47) but if you look Karish2return application, the username is still Thenoss (probably he copied Thenoss application). However his account was painted by DT and he didn't active in bounty anymore before August 2021, I'm pretty sure Karish2return want to ruin Thenoss reputation since Thenoss has been actively expose many cheaters.2. You're connecting the accounts from their transactions, however as far as I can see it's just a normal transactions since it doesn't like the 6 accounts move all of their token to parent address (to save fee). It doesn't have a problem if someone made a trade through this forum, we have currency exchange board for doing that.",

The interesting thing is why @Thenoss edited his applications and hide his address? Does this mean he scared if someone find him using 0xA07ef5d740D5000C3bc5bba7751f27F9AAefDA47 address since it's linked with @Karish2return (@Karish2return account already red tagged, the other account deserve a red tag too since he's the one who control those accounts).Quote from: Karish2return on May 09, 2022, 09:41:41 AMForum Username: Karish2returnForum Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=840344Telegram Username: @sirf2bParticipated Campaigns: VideoBEP-20 Wallet Address: 0xA07ef5d740D5000C3bc5bba7751f27F9AAefDA47Original applicationQuoteProof of authenticationForum name: Thenosshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3470702Wallet: 0xA07ef5d740D5000C3bc5bba7751f27F9AAefDA47https://ninjastic.space/post/60018943Updated applicationQuote from: Thenoss on May 01, 2022, 11:37:21 AMProof of authenticationForum name: Thenosshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3470702Campaign: Twitter, TGIf anyone want to see other applications by @Thenoss, you can check in this link https://ninjastic.space/address/0xA07ef5d740D5000C3bc5bba7751f27F9AAefDA47 Waiting for other users to react on this issues.",
