But I'm still curious about what CZ meant and have questions about the tweet.But right now, the bitcoin price has returned to the $16k mark, which seems to be strengthening for a while. Hopefully, the price will continue to strengthen to return to a higher price.",

The current price level doesn't deserve that and CZ clearly does all this for his cold calculations.",

CZ was not there during Mt. Gox exchange hack, he was not there during many hacks, scam altcoins and manipulations in the past. There is nothing he is doing than to just dominate the crypto market. Without him doing anything, bitcoin price would pump when the right time comes. Stop listening to these people to avoid manipulation and control.",

Mr. Mars did an interview a few days ago and I sincerely can't find any line where not to agree with him, especially the last line:https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/12/elon-musk-reveals-talks-with-sam-bankman-fried-my-bullshit-meter-was-redlining/Quote“I would reaffirm that, if you have crypto, you should have it in a directly-accessible cold wallet. Not in an exchange,” Musk said. “That would be wise.”Apart from stating the obvious and not the SAFU things CZ is promoting, I liked how he characterized SBF, pretty much nailed it.QuoteAnd I know my bullshit meter was redlining. It was like, this dude is bullshit – that was my impressionToo bad too many felt for his bullshit, but at least we don't have any contagion to bigger and more important companies so that the whole world would point fingers at crypto again like bitcoin would be to blame for!Quote from: 2double0 on November 14, 2022, 07:00:22 AMBelow was the reason, some extra confidence was spread in the community by CZ:Yeah, the guy that triggered all this now spreads confidence, we got rid of all our competitors through shady deals and made a lot of people lose money, but now you're safe as I'm the only one in charge of everything.  Love how he has found all the ways to protect everyone AFTER the things he knew for months screwed eveyone.",

That's why I never blamed him for his past manipulation or what he is doing with dogecoin. If we were in his position, I believe we would do so as long as it was profitable for us.

He will buy everything cheaply and it will also protect Binance because more dump from here will begin to have negative effects on them.In any case, according to this article Binance has $70 billion in their reserve. As per the details from Nansen, CZ’s exchange now holds $70,675,000,000 in its reserve, showing its commitment to transparency.
