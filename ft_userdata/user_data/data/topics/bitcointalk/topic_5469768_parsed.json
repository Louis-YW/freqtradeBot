Some food and water of course can be imported from Egypt. Hamas already knew the consequences of this invasion and they went ahead to engage in it. My heart only goes to the innocent citizens who know nothing about this invasion but a now suffering the consequences. But from what I have watched so far, it seems many people in Gaza support this action by Hamas. Many of them believe Israel deserves to feel the pain Gaza has been going through for a long time. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that this is just the beginning of the bombardment of Gaza which means that citizens will face more hardship and scarcity.Many people will die of bullets and bombs and more will be killed by hunger and thirst. The best option for people in Gaza is to leave the place and move to neighboring countries. It is also a time for international organisations to step up their humanitarian activities for these innocent citizens. Children, women and civilian men should not be allowed to suffer and die for what they know nothing about.",

That’s the thing, there are no winners in war. All we see is bloodshed, pain & misery. I’m sure there are people on both sides who feel there is justification for war but it’s never the answer. I hope there is a peaceful resolution soon & casualties are limited. As I said in another thread, images & stories coming out of Israel are very unpleasant.

There were even youth soldiers which consider a big honor to die as kamikaze pilots and many others preferred to end their own life than seeing their nation losing the war.With Hamas is a bit similar, their fighters are trained and mentally prepared to die for their cause, those who do are told to be heros and deserving of an eternal rest and life, since to them defeat is not an option, then decide to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the organization.

The unfolding situation necessitates a comprehensive review of the influential factors.(Also Read: Escalating Violence Forces Israeli Government to Order Evacuations Near Gaza Border)Ukraine's Unexpected RoleRecent hostilities initiated by Hamas against Israel have been noteworthy, not solely due to the heightened aggression, but also because of queries about the origin of the weapons employed. The mystery was unraveled when Hamas recognized Ukraine's contribution in providing them with arms, particularly RPGs. This revelation has amplified concerns regarding Ukraine's part in arming combat zones and the potency of global arms regulation.The distribution of arms to non-sovereign entities like Hamas underscores the pressing requirement for global collaboration to halt the arms proliferation to militant groups. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has denounced the terror attack, extended support to Israel, and upheld Israel's right to self-defense.
