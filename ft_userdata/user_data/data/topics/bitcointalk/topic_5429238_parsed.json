  "content": "I reckon no amount of stricter regulations will stop the more advanced type or the higher level scammers similar to Sam Bankrupt-Fried who, has the political connections and who has wealthy financial backers that can finance their criminal and moneylaundering operations. Everyone should become very much aware of this.I would be shaking my head if we, the commoners of the cryptospace, would support a move for stricter global regulations in crypto. This will only make the use of cryptocoins, Defi and other protocols harder for us commoners, however, it will certainly not make it more difficult for those higher level criminals to create and fund their scams in crypto. Cryptocurrency regulation is currently a focal point for regulators and lawmakers all across the world. Regulators have been tightening the noose around the crypto industry to safeguard consumers from bad actors.The colossal fall of the FTX crypto exchange has alarmed regulators even more, and lawmakers are trying to bring effective and efficient crypto regulation into place.The president of BaFin has censured the current synopsis of the regime that governs the crypto sectors as not strict enough. This points toward the condition where the industry will not be able to keep bad actors in control.Read in full https://bitcoinist.com/germany-calls-global-regulation-of-crypto-industry/",

      "body": "I read a German article about the BaFin conference. It's interesting that the Mark Branson (the president of BaFin, the German SEC) says there are basically two possibilities to deal with the crypto industry:1) regulate it tighter, requiring from crypto-assets service providers similar requirements to to those affecting traditional financial institutions, and thus allowing it to merge with the traditional financial system.2) \"let it burn\", i.e. leave the sector completely unregulated but separated from the traditional financial system, and hope for a collapse due to all the scams and frauds (here he cites a recent article of Stephen Cecchetti and Kim Schoenholtz in the Financial Times, which hope that the crypto industry \"burns\" alone, and argue for a prohibition for traditional financial institutions to invest in cryptocurrencies).Branson prefers the first strategy, and advocates for a global regulatory approach led by the G20.While I generally don't have problems with regulations regarding liquidity and risk (i.e. requiring proof-of-reserves) it is problematic that he also mentions money laundering. Of course money laundering should be prevented too, but KYC/AML is already quite strict for European crypto providers, and he still deems it as insufficient.Too strict KYC/AML is a threat for the security of crypto users, as it would lead to more personal documents stored on servers of crypto businesses of all sizes, only waiting for hackers to steal them and facilitating identity theft. And we've seen recently with the proposed Marshall Warren bill in the US that there are politicians wanting to extend KYC/AML even to miners and potentially to software developers, which would be of course impossible to comply.My opinion would be: Regulate the centralized crypto service providers, apply most of financial regulations to them, but take into account the risks of a too strict KYC/AML for privacy of everyday people and leave a space for small-scale usage with only basic requirements (i.e. phone verification). And don't touch the protocols themselves and their elements, like miners.",

I am quite certain it will not stop the Bernie Maddofs, Elizabeth Holmes and the Sams in the world, who will have the proper connections to develop their scams and steal billions more in total compared to the small ICO, IOU, Defi and NFT scams of the world.Also, ICO, IOU, Defi and NFT are not scams but only mediums that can be used for scams. This is very much similar to bitcoin where it can be used as a medium for scams but bitcoin itself is never the scam. I hope everyone will distinguish and accept the difference in this.",

It isn't rocket science.  If you don't hold the keys you are a creditor.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  That isn't specific to crypto.  If you don't like it, keep your money in a bank.  Whatever regulation they put in place would be redundant given the laws on the books already.  SBF is already in trouble, what specific law would've helped?  A law against Ponzi schemes and scams has been around for a century or so and the scams have been around longer than that yet people are still taken in.",

While I agree with most of your statements especially regarding the \"government-issue\" is not a black-and-white thing and varies a ton from country to country, I need to jump in and with your statement about mixers. While it is ceraintly used by money laundering individuals, it is also the only possible way to create some strongly needed privacy in the transparent Bitcoin chain. I would argue that the majority using these services are doing so 100% legally just trying to protect their privacy and aiming for some fungability to Bitcoin.Check out this discussion if interested: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410526.0@OP: Fails like FTX are just a happy excuse for tighter regulations. What would really work is proper (crypto) education. But I think we are still 5 - 10 years away from this becoming a reality in schools.",

I agree, your point is very valid because mixers can also help to get privacy because all Bitcoin transactions and balances are public. If we buy now some goods and send a Bitcoin transaction to a vendor or a trader, such vendors or traders can view our balances on our address and where we have sent Bitcoin previously. Mixers can help to protect our funds from curious views. Mixing coins for such a purpose (privacy) is very legitimate.",

How will the ultimate beneficiaries of large crime organizations accept money at street level if cash no longer exists? blanket drug legalization would seem a strange way to sell the concept to your average person, so I'm at a loss as to how this is really supposed to play out. It's likely that at least some high level figures of such enterprises also have political influence too. In a world where the gangsters are rapidly running out of marks, it seems all rather unlikely to me that they would simply pack up and quit the game, so what's really going on?",

The cryptospace is a threat to the banking system because it will break their monopoly on the creation of money, moving money, laundering of money and many other things about money. It will also break the monopoly on the government's definition of money. If anyone has noticed, much of the people in the community has considered bitcoin to be a more authentic form of money than fiat.I'd just add that the crypto space is a threat to not just the banking system, but the political system since they depend on the laundering for their power.This is why the are all in favor of things like digital fiat.  It buys nothing except no bills, but allows those in power to control everyone and everything, everywhere.  An Orwellian nightmare for people who are being controlled.Hehe yes, they want complete control over something that has begun to progress and that is trying to move on from their control over the question what is money? They can delay the social development of the cryptospace through spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt, however, they can never delay the technical developments happening around the cryptospace which is presently taking much quicker steps than a few years ago.I also speculate that in the next few years, it might be NFTs that might help on the growth and the more universal adoption of the cryptospace. I am aware that many bitcoiners consider them a scam. I consider it to be another medium of cutural development. This will be very important if we want adoption.",

No excuses.Perhaps they should look in the mirror and have tighter regulation of fiat so that it doesn't lose 99% of its value over a century.  Perhaps they should regulate the corruption of government officials first.Of course, SBF is a scammer who just happened to use crypto.  Just like there are plenty of scammers using the euro and dollar.",
