But I wonder what changes China will make so that it does.China Plans To Sell Lethal Blowfish Drones To Taliban: Reporthttps://www.zerohedge.com/military/china-plans-sell-lethal-blowfish-drones-taliban-reportThe past week has seen multiple reports emerge saying that Beijing is even offering the Taliban advanced weaponry in order to bolster counter-terror efforts in the capital. The US national security website 19fortyfive writes that \"Rather than subsidize education or develop the country, it now appears that the Taliban will use its limited cash to purchase or otherwise acquire Blowfish drones from China.\"The source describes the China-produced drones as follows: The Blowfish is a potentially devastating platform. The mini-helicopter can fire machine guns, launch mortars, and throw grenades. Artificial Intelligence imbues them with the ability to determine who lives and who dies on the battlefield with minimal human input. The Pentagon has already expressed fears that Blowfish exported to the Middle East could end up in the wrong hands. China is also said to be concerned about the security situation as it has its eye on expanding Belt and Road initiative projects in the AfPak region:Chinese officials also fear for the security of projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which have faced several attacks in the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan in Pakistan....",

      "body": "It is true that the Talibans are abusing and suppressing the fundamental rights of the citizens of Afghanistan. The women are now treated like outcasts and second class citizens. Citizens are accused of different kind of offenses and some of them are openly hanged or beheaded. The economy of the country have also collapsed due to sanctions. I read that parents are giving their children sleeping pills to make them sleep because there was no food to eat (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63733683. My heart goes to these innocent people that are suffering from poverty, threat and death just because of their nationality. This is no time for the blame game but the US and their allies left the country without plans making the county worst than what it was before. The only way these despots and tyrants in Afghanistan can be tamed is through diplomacy and sanctions. But from my experience, any country that is insecure will never develop. Afghanistan is threatened by many militants and terrorist group and the government needs all the military assistance to reduce or eradicate these threats. It is very clear that these military assistance will never come from the West, that is why the Talibans are tilting towards China. Regardless of how powerful these drones are, they cannot be compared to the superior military products of the United States.",
