  "content": "Hi AllI currently run x10 S9s @ approx 140-150Th and i'm with Virgin Media 100MbÂ  Broadband (just done test and it's 97.38 Mb/s, 9.94 Mb/s).The prices are now ridiculous and they only offer deals to new customers and all my deals/offers are ended and i'm paying x3.5 times what a new customer would get.I'm looking to swap to Vodaphone Superfast 100 Broadband (as another comparison for the same price as Vodaphone a new customer with Virgin would get 213Mb).I have to say i have been with Virgin for years and it's been quite reliable but the costs are a rip off imo, i culd be a 'new customer' again after leaving for 1 year and get back a great deal!How do i know what i need to check? I'm pretty sure my IP Box freezes with my provider set up i pay subs too due to my miners and it's now unusable (Bee movie works perfect but the GUI/interface etc freezes on my provider i pay).Also when changing i could be left with no internet, could a MiFi sim card unit work temporarily or would it eat too much data?This is something i have always wondered but have been to scared to change tbh but in these tough times i have no choice....Thanks",

This is so you can test it's network reliability and is not intended to make this some kind of transitional migration step, but it happens to make the MiFi + SIM unnecessary.If the test passes you can cancel your Virgin plan and move the whole farm to Vodafone.",

About the speed, I think 10mbps is enough to run 10x s9 units the internet speed is not a problem just make sure your internet is stable.",

About the speed, I think 10mbps is enough to run 10x s9 units the internet speed is not a problem just make sure your internet is stable.So approx 1Mb/hour per S9. So only 240Mb every 24 hour approx?That's absolutely nothing!!",

Are you going to switch to a modem with a sim card?Just ensure you have stable internet and low latency because if you don't have stable internet, it could lead to hashrate spikes in your pool dashboard.",

      "body": "Keep in mind it's not just bandwidth it's latency.How long does it take for the round trip between your miner and the pool.Depending on where the pools stratum nodes that you connect to are and which providers they are peered to and who your ISP is peered to can make a difference in stale shares.Will it matter? Depends. Probably not that much but it is something to keep in mind.If one place has their stratum servers on one of the big cloud providers, like Amazon, Google, MSFT more then likely there is a direct peer to their network.If they are using some place like pair or linode or vultr your transit may be longer.https://www.netnod.se/ix/what-is-peering-Dave",
