(FTX shaked many users' trust about exchanges)Do keep in mind that Trust Wallet was bought by Binance around July 2018[1], so the tweet from CZ should have at least a disclaimer for transparency sake (at least for the \"usual\" user in the crypto world).As for a service where you can buy crypto I can't stop recommending Bisq[2] or Robosats[3][4]. There's some recent talk about Bisq here[5] that you could check if that spiked your interest. The best case scenario, at least for me, is to have your hardware wallet separated from a service that also allows you to easily exchange coins since that mostly often means that some data is being exchanged that you might be unaware of.dkbit98 made an interesting thread[6] regarding open source hardware wallets that you could check if my reply spiked your interest regarding such devices. Hell I would even wait for the review of n0nce regarding Foundation Passport v2[7] since it looks like an interesting device.[1] https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-acquires-trust-wallet-a-secure-mobile-crypto-wallet-360010790652[2] https://bisq.network/[3] https://github.com/Reckless-Satoshi/robosats[4] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405549.0[5] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416294.0[6] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0[7] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382675.msg61139184#msg61139184",

I agree with the suggestions above - Bisq, RoboSats and AgoraDesk are the best fiat to bitcoin decentralized exchanges at present. You can also use them to trade altcoins, although there are various instant exchangers for altcoins but I can't recommend any as I don't use them.

The problem with those instant centralized exchanges or swap platforms is not just their wrong claims that they are non-custodial (which they aren't), it's also the fact that even though they advertise themselves as being non-KYC, there have been many instances where users have complained their coins got frozen and the exchange process was stopped because there was a need to undergo KYC. The argument they use in those situations is it's not us that are asking you to verify your identity, it's our partners. It makes no difference for the end-user who does it. Bisq or RoboSats has no KYC - period.",
