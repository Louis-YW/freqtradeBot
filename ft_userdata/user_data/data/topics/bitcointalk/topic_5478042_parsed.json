So, stable coins even if they are centralized but if they're not backed by the government then they might have some problems towards compliance. If there's a stable coin that's decentralized, that's what I'll use and that's DAI. If there's another one that proven to be decentralized, I might use it as well.",

The intentions of the governments are clear, they are not happy that investors on this market can avoid their fiat with the use of stable coins, as even if they are regulated they do not have the same level of control they would have with their fiat or a CBDC, so they are doing what they can to destabilize those coins and then claim their CBDCs are the best alternative, however those coins are incredibly dangerous as they will give governments control over your finances like never before, and personally I will never use them regardless of how much they promoted them.",

I have two options. It's either USDT or USDC. I think these two are the ones that I'll take from these centralized stable coins. IMHO, they're much better than CBDCs because they're one of the actual stable coins that can be said as a cryptocurrency. Unlike with CBDCs, they're not real cryptocurrencies but just made to compete with the stable coins. Anyway, that's my take on your question.",

Previously, I had high hopes that CBDC would launch soon, but not as expected, the government needed a lot of time to research as well as appropriate economic market conditions to deploy it, but it was clearly of interest. Their interest in blockchain technology or the crypto market is growing.",

Beside they are centralized and can be easily manipulated at any time, that should be the type of coin we'll hold for long. Anyway stable coins like USDT are much more preferable to CBDC because, CBDC might experience inflation due to fact that they are pegged with the countries fiat currency, inflation is one of the top disadvantage of CBDC and they can be easily manipulated.",

Now that the government might take advantage of it, I really don't care but I know this will have a ripple effect in other cryptocurrencies, especially the ones that I am holding. This is the first so we really have no idea what could happen. But, most popular stablecoins had been in the industry for a long time so I don't think changes will affect that much or better, it will not even happen. Most traders and investors will keep on using what they are accustomed to and even if USDT and other stablecoins are struggling in this era, I don't think there will be much of a change. And, I don't think governments can force it yet, so people will have the option of what they want. Plus, CBDC has to fortify its reputation first, there are so many questions coming out, especially about privacy.",

Granted we've never really seen any implementations so far, but I highly doubt they'd replace stablecoins in the future. I mean, unless there's a law or regulation they'd implement, otherwise most people would probably just stick to what they actually know and have used for a long time. Honestly, I'd probably use whatever is the most useable one out of the two. Naturally the closer to the price of USD, the better but either way works really, and I reckon most people have the same mindset.",

Yes, as a place to invest in a bad place, in my opinion the same as USDT, CBDC and USDT is a manifestation of Fiat itself, so Stalacoin is not a place to invest.But in terms of use and regulation, of course CBDC is certainly far better than a private stablecoin or issued by a particular company or press, CBDC is much safer because it is supported by the government of the country itself in running it, so I think if indeed CBDC can run USDT/USDC it Or other stablecoin so I chose to use CBDC, but keeping CBDC only limited to saving my money before I invest in the Altcoi or Bitcoin project.",

They are just payment bridge and if they will foster adoption in crytpo, they are more than welcome just like the Paypal and the rest, many centralized exchanges today used PayPal and many more for p2p trading and this help to onboard many people to crypto as adoption but replacing USDT and USDC, I'm not sure about that even when stablecoins are centralized with lots of controversies, investors are smart when it comes to decisions making, never trust the government but you know that CBDC might just be one of the ways the government might want to fight people that evade tax.Stablecoins have audited and are becoming more transparent as of recent and I like how many of them are been probe by the Security Exchange commission over the last few years, they are open and I love that but CBDC will remain private and you will hardly know what is even happening underground. The deppeging of stablecoins particularly USDC and USDT have even reduced since they started the transparency and auditing because people have begin to know what is backing their assets, it wouldn't be much of headache as compare to CBDC.",

You can store your stable coins long term if you want, but since you are not really holding fiat directly but instead you are holding the token of a private company that is supposedly backed by enough fiat, anyone that chooses to do it is taking a massive risk, because if at some point it is demonstrated this is not true or the company behind the coin suffers some financial issues, then the parity with the dollar could be lost and its stability will become nothing but a distant memory.",

What they should do is to embrace the already existing stable coin, in other not to have a replicated or duplicate stable coin. In the cryptography currency market. It will surely give scammers the opportunity to create there own stable coin, that will have a resemblance of the newly created one, in other to attract people.
