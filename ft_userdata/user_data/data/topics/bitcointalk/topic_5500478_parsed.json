Secondly bitcoin supply of 21 million coins limit makes it very strong and no other cryptocurrency has these feature. Thirdly, due to it massive mining network, bitcoin has a high level of security and decentralization around it which cannot be seen in the others. I don't think any other cryptocurrency comes close. Lastly, unless a second bitcoin will become a good store of value, then I don't think that there is ever going to be a second bitcoin.",

But our world is constantly evolving and we cannot predict what will happen in the future. Satoshi was able to create bitcoin and bring surprise to all humanity, so I wouldn't rule out the possibility that someone will create something great or better than bitcoin in the future. But it's about the future, things that haven't happened yet, what we need to focus on now is bitcoin and it is unique.Grateful and thankful to Satoshi, focusing on bitcoin are things I think we should focus on instead of thinking about things that are not possible or have not happened yet.",

Two bitcoin can not exist in this world.I agree. I mean, Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology already. It will take another 10 years for everyone who can think, who can use their brains properly, to realize how amazing it is, how helpful it is to the world. Will there be a better technology somewhere in the future? Maybe. But not earlier than a hundred years from now. That's why we have all the right to be saying during our life-time: \"Two bitcoin can not exist in this world.\".",

And that's why there are fake Satoshi out there, many of them claiming because of the aura of that name.

Bitcoin is Bitcoin and as you've said there are two types of coins, if it's not BTC then they're altcoins. However, there is this wrapped version of BTC that they keep on making but it's still an altcoin and not Bitcoin because it runs through a chain or another network for which Bitcoin, the real one isn't there. There must be only one Bitcoin and there won't ever be another Bitcoin. I guess that this is different from the typical discussions about the \"next\" Bitcoin that many altcoin enthusiasts are talking about. So, settle with that. Bitcoin is going to remain as-is and the rest that are not BTC will be altcoins or any of their kinds.",

It should automatically be a shitcoin too.What we need (and is possible to exist) is innovation. Something new. Something fresh. With ideas that can address all shortcomings in Bitcoin and bring something new to the table.For example I always found Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins innovative and interesting (coins like IOTA, Nano, and Obyte) but they never got to anything interesting enough to be able to solve any issues. And these projects all have certain flaws including centralization and premine. But at least, they are different and innovative without repeating the same thing trying to create \"second bitcoins\"; and that's what we need.",

Do you think there will be another coin that can compete with bitcoin and if that is the question then I think it is impossible. But in terms of market capitalization, there is actually ETH as a competitor but it is not able to surpass Bitcoin in terms of price. It is certain that there will not be a second, third or subsequent bitcoin because bitcoin itself has shown reliability that other coins do not have.Bitcoin is in a separate dimension from other coins and does not have the same place, it is not about position but rather the advantages that bitcoin brings. Bitcoin can produce different cycles within a certain period of time and bitcoin is always a force in recovering before reaching the Halving and that is why bitcoin is considered the best.",
