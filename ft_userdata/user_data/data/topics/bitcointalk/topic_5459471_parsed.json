The problem in our society can be listed as follows: Money spent on marriage ceremony is enough for the new family business start up. The process of marriage enacted by some religious organization are far from reality and becomes more difficult for young people to follow it. The ladies of this generation are full of high expectations that can not be met and that has led some young guys to believe in making money first. Another issue encounter with delay marriage saga is that  some family have failed in their parenting and that has created another vacuum in successful marriage. Some are afraid of marriage not because they are not well to do but due to the history of failed relationship and other people's marriage. Some young people are afraid of what the future will be, considering the economy situation of the country.My take on the whole thing , is that there should be a means of educating young singles and families about parenting, and living in love.",

But marriage is about accepting Responsibility, and also Compatibility, I believe most of you here have came to my wedding and  my Child Dedication and witnessed how it was. I got married when I have settled for less meaning I have came to accept reality that 1 Age is no longer on my side, 2 I know that is my core Duty to father a Child, 3 Someone gives birth to me so I must do so 4 Accepting the responsibility 5 Compatibility (Companionship). If you understand the meaning of companionship you will marry. Before I was thinking I still had time to spend and flex my life but after I came to draw some analysis about marriage and singlehood I instantaneously changed my mind look for Compatibility when I got it i then say no need to waste time. After which I boiled out to see her parents and every thing began without wasting of time, not that i had Millions or Billions but just managing as others out there.In summary when you are ready to accept responsibility you will get married not even money that will hold you down because marriage they said is a blessing from God. Proverbs 18:22 \"The man who finds a wife finds a treasure, and he receives favor from the LORD\". So do you still need money to marry when God said when you find a wife you find money.",

Permission granted if you feels that is enough for you to take bold steps then no issues we are together. Marriage is sweet when you have learned to knows the core values of marriage, I believe you get more blessings when you believe in that scripture that takes about marriage.I am always encouraging young men to start settling down because age waits for nobody and besides if you waiting till 40 years before getting married would help train your children in school if you don't settle now and have your children and use these money we used for flexing and start taking good care of your families.This where most of our people blamed uncle for not training their children mainwhile their father had the chance to give birth to them earlier, but didn't take bold steps but was late to marry. We need to train our children when we are young and active making money to be able to provide their needs and not when we are old.",
