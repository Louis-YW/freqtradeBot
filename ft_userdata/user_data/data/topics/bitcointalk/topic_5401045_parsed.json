  "content": "I am not quite sure where to share this news, however, Opensea marketplace is more on topic in service discussion than altcoin discussion. In any case, does everyone remember the hype on NFTs when many of them were selling for more than $500,000 per piece? Yes, there were BAYCs and Cryptopunks that were sold for excessive amounts of money. I argued that because of the way the marketplace is created, it was very easily manipulated by one person to wash trade the NFT by himself using 2 different wallets. However, there were people telling me that it was only fud hehehee.A grand jury has indicted the former head of product at non-fungible token (NFT) platform OpenSea on wire fraud and money laundering charges after an insider trading scandal.Chastain was previously accused of using secret Ethereum wallets to purchase NFTs based on confidential information that they'd soon be featured on OpenSea's home page. He was allegedly responsible for selecting which NFTs would be featured on the homepage, according to the indictment. From about June 2021 to September 2021, he sold these pieces for two to five times his initial purchase price shortly after the value jumped from a front-page feature, according to the DOJ's indictment.Read in full https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/149685/former-head-of-product-for-opensea-indicted-after-insider-trading-scandal",

However, it can be one of the ways very much similar to those other ways launder money like through bitcoin and other coins. It should not imply that it is bad and it should be banned. Cellphones are used as detonators for bombs, kitchen knives can be used for murder. Should they be banned as a consequence?NFTs are art and they have become part of culture of the cryptospace. Some of them will certainly have value if the community continues to support them and there are presently Defi platforms that are being created on how to unlock their value and create liquidity for them. The next years of the cryptospace will be much more interesting hehehehee.",

In case of the OP news and Wazirx, they have fully control on the NFT marketplace that’s why it's easy for them to highlights the NFT collection that they want to hype. This is not possible for normal trader like us and just like what Mk4 said, it's just a waste of transaction fee.This fraud transaction in NFT is always been point out by many user during cryptopunk saga. Nobody cares on it so now they are just holding worthless NFT.",

You buy a $300 000 gorilla jpg, and by mistake you sell it for 3000, and here you have your loss which you can claim on your tax files while of course, you bought that gorilla from yourself and the $300 000 are still in your other account.Quote from: bbc.reporter on June 03, 2022, 04:18:16 AMNFTs are art and they have become part of culture of the cryptospace.

Now, what if they get NFTs in this and they become tradable and you can freely trade pokemons by paying money and some will simply strat milking the game for this and in every pvp game you will face guys with zero walked km and 0 pokemon caught but with a full line of 15-15-15 with either mewtwos and zacians. It will ruin everything!You're going to see thoudsn of bots faking GPS coordonates to milk the daily gym drops, you're not going to be able to hold it for an hour and you're going to look at the screen and not understand how two gyms 10 km apart were taken down by the same 6 group of players with weird names in one minute apart.Make a fun game, make sure NFTs won't destroy the game, then try and see is 99% of your player base won't raise you the middle finger!Quote from: bbc.reporter on June 06, 2022, 03:34:01 AMThose famous celebrities are not to be underestimated in bringing more people in the nftspace and from there, they will also see and enter the cryptospace.How many failure do you want me to list?  The celebrities got they money, the buyers ended with, pics they can see on the net!",
