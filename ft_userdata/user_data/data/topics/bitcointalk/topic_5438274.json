  "content": "As an Agricultural Extension Administrator into technology, I deem it fit identifying with fellow agriculturist here on this platform since it is our local board, I believe we all can relate very well here irrespective of our geographical location and ethnicity, we can deal and start showing the world how blessed and good we are in agricultural production. If possible I would want a situation where by we can start trading agricultural produce here with a top ranked and reputable member as an escrow for transparency and credibility. Those from the north, south, east and west can relate and deal here with payment in btc.¬† I would like to see us grow our trade on our local board patronizing our very own local commodity here since we are all in the same country.At first, I would want to kick start with my offer to purchase 1ton of cassava sterm and the variety as follows; TME 419, Fine Face, Dixon, Farmers' Pride, Sunshine, Game Changer, Obasanjo II, and Poundable. Any of the above variety is ok by me.¬† I would also vouch for a reputable and high ranked member as an escrow for the deal. Do well to snap and send¬† the picture of your product here for view.Your opinions, contributions and suggestions are all welcomed.Let's deal!",

I will make a call for the trade of the stems but how do you calculate in Tons? Let me know how to describe the quantity I want to the person who will go get it from the bush. The flood ravaged a whole lot, destroyed properties¬† worthy millions of naira, displaced people from there homes, destroyed farms ie agricultural farms, fish farm and lots too numerous to mention. A whole community deserted as a result of the flood then. Many people are still suffering as a result of the flood. Some are still yet to recover from the shock as the flood took them unawares which led to them being unprepared and as a result, many properties got destroyed.Let me digress a little for a clearer understanding. I would not be using tonnage so as not to get you confused. I will bring it down to bundle level for easy communication and understanding so we could flow¬† very well.The cassava measurement should be a total length of¬† 4 to 6 feet long,40 sterms per bundle and should be any of the varieties as earlier mentioned.",
