  "content": "I have been using this trick for quite some time for different websites including bitcointalk and ChatGPT also, it kinda converts any website into a mobile app that sits on your home page like any other app. Technically speaking it's not like a native app but still it does pretty well. It works on iOS only since it uses Apple Shortcut Application to do so, which itself is a very powerful app if you are an Apple user. Anyway, let's start and give it a try.Prerequisite  - Shortcuts App:Before starting just make sure you have Shortcuts app installed.If not you can search it on the App Store or just click below image Step 1 - Image for app icon: Download the image below and save it to photos, we will use it for our App Icon.You can use any other image too but I like this one since it's kinda official logon for Bitcointalk.https://talkimg.com/images/2023/09/06/mPhP2.png Step 2 - Download Shortcut:Download this shortcut from iCloud https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/97dcbfe75e074ad19077f20304342d74Above link should automatically open the Shortcuts app. If not then copy paste below link in Safari browser and then click Open in Shortcuts Once open you will see below screen, click Add Shortcut   Step 3 - Run shortcut:Once added you will see a new shortcut added on the Shortcuts app.Click the this shortcut \"Make app from URL and follow the promptsa. Enter the app name preferably \"Bitcointalk\" b. Enter the URL (this URL will be used as a homepage for our app)    I like to set it Show new replies to your posts. as my home page but you can use any bitcointalk link    https://bitcointalk.org/ or https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=unreadrepliesc. Select the image you saved in Step 2 for the App Icon,  Click Done    It will open a safari browser and show a popupd. Click allow to download configuration profile   Step 4 - Install profile:Now go to iPhone Settings and on the home page you should see Profile Downloaded (If not available on the home page then Settings -> General -> VPN & Device Management)a. Click on Bitcointalkb. Click Install   Congratulation just open the app Login for the first time and enjoy your Bitcointalk as a Mobile AppPro and cons: - You don't to need to enter URL every time to you open bitcointalk - It's running in a full screen, no browser URL or extra buttons - To Remove the app go to Settings -> General -> VPN & Device Management ->Bitcointalk  and click Remove Profile - There's no hidden scripts or any thing, it's just running Bitcointalk as a fullscreen Media Clip in a Safari Browser - No back/forward buttons? You don't need, just swap your screen left or right to move back or forward",

      "body": "In Andriod, we can only create a shortcut of the website and it will appear on the phone screen. However, i never knew that in iPhone this can be done at a little bit advanced level. Anyways, in both cases, it would not be a perfect alternative for an app, other than that it has a desktop (phone screen) shortcut. A true app is generally more compatible to the phone and may have some additional features too.Quote from: shahzadafzal on January 15, 2023, 06:07:20 PM- No back/forward buttons? You don't need, just swap your screen left or right to move back or forward I really like this feature and wished I could try it out but for that i need to spend some dollars or bitcoins to buy an expensive iPhone",

I have been using this trick with other apps like ChatGPT and multiple Facebook logins and it really feels like you are using a real app.Having said that those who have multiple logins (Alts), will find the real power of this trick. Thank me later",

Currently we only have the option of using bitcointalk on the mobile browser or make a shortcut of it on the phone desktop as told by the OP. The experience from this function is very limited and therefore i only use phone browser for view-only purpose.",

I have never really thought that this process could be annoying for someone.https://jaybates19.github.io/bitcointalk/ <- This is the responsive version of bitcointalk with night mode feature. It's quite easy for admin to do some HTML/CSS manipulation, that includes for him to change tables with CSS grid and flexbox, change image version of gradients with CSS gradients and just some line of codes are enough along with dark color codes in CSS to have a night mode on this forum. I think that this could be a real deal.By the way, the digital world is changing, user interface is evolving constantly and this forum that represents one of the most innovative thing of 21th century - cryptocurrencies, shouldn't have an user interface that was created decades ago.",

You are not wrong though but in this case your browser (window) is independent. It will have its own session and cookies and not affecting your existing browser logins. Also it runs on full screen and links will open in the same window.For example when you merit Bitcointalk will open a new window but in this case you stay in the same app and you can simply swipe right to back to the post or topic you just merited. Same goes to all the external links it will open like a popup and you just click done/close the popup and go back to your bitcointalk. Yes it’s not a 100% mobile app. We all know this but I’m talking about my personal experience and I really like using this trick when I’m on mobile and gives a much better experience than a normal browser window.Quote from: libert19 on January 22, 2023, 07:10:09 AMAs long you have visited the page prior, you can move back/forward similarly.

So it's potentially very dangerous to run third party apps let alone apps outside of Google Play. Anyway I will recommend don't use appsgeyser or at least don't login to your bitcointalk account from such apps (you can use it for viewing and reading as a Guest).",
