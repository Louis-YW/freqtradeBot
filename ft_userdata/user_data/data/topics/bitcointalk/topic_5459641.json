      "body": "Advice: Bitcoin would rise significantly within the next 2 years irrespective of the approval of spot ETF. Therefore, you might just buy your Bitcoin at any time and hold it unless you are referring to trading it in futures upon the spot ETF approval.Quote from: _act_ on July 13, 2023, 07:46:17 AMHow can I get the news directly from the SEC in a matter of a second? Is it through their website or which news?The first issue is that SEC through sec.gov doesn't provide such needed service, they can share updates on their website and on interviews. What you are requesting might be difficult to get as this would further rely on syncs to make it as fast as you desire into your device even when a news outlet wants to deliver it directly to you. Even if you get updates from reliable news sites, the news outlet would still add other write-ups which would further delay the pace that you want. Meaning that you should erase the mind that any news outlet could deliver the news in that same second, that is not possible. But if it's 'scheduled news,' I can assure you that https://www.cryptocraft.com can update the outcome on their website within a few seconds. They don't write stories like the regular news outlets, they just update the actual release.The only responsibility from you is to visit the site regularly when you know there is a likelihood of such spot ETF news. By then, they would have shared the news time or indicated it as tentative.",

But if you've got a friend or someone you're connected with working with them, that's one way that you'll have the news about these approvals or rejections as soon as possible. Other than that, the typical financial news that are found in the US are also quick in determining these news because information are being spread to them whenever it's needed a media coverage and press conference.",

      "body": "Your excitement for the bitcoin spot ETF is apparent. The joyful anticipation of the bull run and a crypto future better than ever! It's quite touching. The SEC makes announcements on their website, but that's not a time-optimized approach. Even if you're hooked to your computer hammering \"refresh,\" a delay is inevitable, annoying, and unavoidable. Unfortunately, media outlets often get such information first. Their regulatory contacts allow them to break news first. Not fair, but that's life, right? Subscribe to the SEC's RSS feeds or follow them on Twitter. They may update faster than their webpage.",

We shouldn't also underestimate the connection of these crypto news outlets because many of them have insiders that give them relevant information. So they might also be one of the first to get the information. Constantly visiting or getting updates on SEC's website could also help. Approving bitcoin spot ETF is a massive plus to the bitcoin system but I think we should be prepared for the bull run regardless of the outcome of the bitcoin spot ETF reapplication of Invesco and Wisdom Tree. I will suggest you forget about SEC and adopt the dollar-cost averaging investment techniques.",

How can I get the news directly from the SEC in a matter of a second? Is it through their website or which news?To find out classified information before others, you must have a source within the SEC, which means you have to get a job at that agency or you have to find a way to become friends with Uncle Gensler Now seriously, I take it you think that the possible approval of spot BTC ETF might cause bull run, but somehow it doesn't seem to me that it's wise to wait for that very moment when you can practice the DCA method today and prepare for that moment. When (if) this happens, you should count on many people to want to react like you, and that means that most CEX could go offline under pressure from clients, and fees could go skyrocketing.However, it should be taken into account that after this news the market will react positively, but also that it will not be long-lived because who can say with certainty that large investors will really invest billions in such a fund? Examples from some other countries where such an ETF exists have shown that large investors are not too enthusiastic about it, although we can hardly compare such a market in Canada with that in the US.",

The SEC officially rejected the proposal in March 2017.July 2017: Grayscale officially filed an application for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCQX:GBTC) in July 2017. Three months later, Grayscale withdrew its application to the SEC and chose to list its fund on the OTC market.January 2019: Bitwise proposed the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust in January 2019. The SEC rejected its proposal about nine months later.June 2020: WisdomTree submitted an application for a commodity fund that would invest up to 5% of its assets in Bitcoin futures. WisdomTree followed up by proposing a separate Bitcoin ETF just this month.December 2020: SEC Chair Jay Clayton stepped down from his position. In January 2021, President Joe Biden nominated former chairman of the Commodity Future Trading Commission Gary Gensler as Clayton’s replacement.Quote the link below and you will find that more than 10 ETFs have already been rejected.https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/bitcoin-etf-proposals-the-sec-s-long-history-of-rejections-1030261105Even when the first US BITCOIN ETF is officially announced, the moment will rise by 10% to 20%, and this will be followed by a rise, but it is in the long term. Such news will spread quickly, and the trading bots will be quick to take advantage of the easy profits. your only chance is to know the matter before it happens, and it is information that is difficult for the average user to obtain without having relationships. guessing and assuming that Bitcoin will rise during the next two years is the best solution.",

Examples from some other countries where such an ETF exists have shown that large investors are not too enthusiastic about it, although we can hardly compare such a market in Canada with that in the US.This is right,  so far so good, The market has been positively moving and no signs of a negativity.  Since they are friendly and less difficult, having regulations in the same process they'll do a great deal for these investors. It also supports Bitcoin adoption in very good way. Sure we'll see investors investing billions. In Europe they have taken this to another level, they have embraced crypto more unlike the United State. ETF will definitely thrive in Canada more than the United States of America  who are normally leaders whenever it comes to such innovative technologies and ideas. This is unlike the United States. As for the original owner of the post, you will need most importantly a first hand information from a journalist or reporter who works with the company.",

If they approve it I guess you're just looking to ride the short term spike that will occur as it gives some added credibility to the crypto sector. In practice however it's unlikely to be much more technically sophisticated than what we use now to gauge price movements. Maybe set yourself up some Google news alerts if you want the news more timely.",

Is there any reason to believe you'll be able to buy enough if they ever got approved though? I agree with what has been mentioned above, just buy Bitcoin now and DCA if the price moves against your liking. I mean, even if you can buy it asap as the news is released, you'll likely lose to bots or something similar. There is no reason to increase the risk of not getting some sats at the right price just because you want a guaranteed return from ETF news IMO. By the way, as far as I can see from their official news page shared above, there is no mention of any approved ETF from their side. I guess they won't change it just for Bitcoin ETF and other media will likely be your source for any confirmation of ETF approval. CMIIW.",
