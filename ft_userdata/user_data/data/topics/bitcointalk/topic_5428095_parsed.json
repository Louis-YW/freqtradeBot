  "content": "I am making this topic to clear up any rumors for anyone that comes here by google. Everytime I reference a game in this, it is about 3 card poker with a total number of 6 \"players\" hands and 1 dealer handThere is no difference between a slot machine and a table game that uses an automatic or continuous shuffler. Lets look at the industry standard for an automatic shuffler, the \"I-DEAL PLUS\" https://www.sggaming.com/Games/Shuffle-Master/Shufflers-and-Utilities/Single-Deck-Shufflers/i-Deal-Plus-7817^Above is a link to the manufacture's website, as you can see the product details are locked behind being a SG customer.1. The machine can sort a deck back into numerical order in about sixty seconds with the push of a button in the settings menu.2. The machine can recall the last 5 or 10 [I forget] hands that it had even if they were not dealt. For example if there is only one person playing, and the dealer. The machine will be able to tell you what player 2-6 would have gotten if they were playing3. The cards are not \"randomly\" shuffled, every single hand that will be dealt is per-determined when you turn the machine on, and click the red button three times to randomize the \"seed\" which than determines if the machine will have a \"winning\" or \"losing\" night. 4. If you notice how things change when a hand is added or subtracted that is because the shuffler knows what hand the dealer is getting, but the machine cannot account for it until the second hand after the number of hands changes. So if you beleive the dealer is going to get a good hand on the next hand, adding a hand on the next shuffle you will get the dealers hand. However now the machine knows that hand has been added and accounts for that on the next deal, so that last land is no longer the dealers. Roulette: There is not much I can say about this besides have you thrown any ball in your entire life? Do you have a general idea of where its going? Enough said there. There is even a name for a croupier that can put the ball exactly where they want it, they call them sharpshooters. Blackjack:Unless you are getting a hand shuffle, than you are competing against a stacked deck because when the automatic shuffler is turned on, you guessed it, you hit the red button 3 times to determine the seed which is than used to shuffle the deck. Most of these shufflers are old and very temperamental. They are supposed to not let a deck shuffle if it doesn't have exactly all of the cards it is supposed to have, but the older the machine the more likely it will slip up. In a standard 8 deck game, the shuffler should know there are 516 cards. If you remove a 3 of hearts and replace it with a 3 of spades, the machine will give a red light and it will tell you that a 3 of hearts is missing and that there is an extra 3 of spades. The machine has a general idea of where it puts the cards when it shuffles them, but it is not exact.The machine should not give a green light if there are 515 cards but sometimes it does, sometimes it will even give a green light with only 512 cards.",
