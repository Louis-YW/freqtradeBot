  "content": "I have recently meet a few people that are just not watching any football match of the World Cup because they feel that the Qatari government has ignored many of the most basic human rights. I already knew that in most emirates of the area, there are several classes of workers. The elite does not really work or they just manage at high level or do politics or get paid as \"local partners\" of foreign companies. A second level, Muslims but not of the elites are mid-managers. Europeans and Americans are despised, but they are necessary for skilled jobs. For example, if there is a queue for a restaurant, the locals will be seated first even if they arrive last. Obviously, Europeans are willing to put up with the shit but the price is two to three times their salaries at home. An now we get to the last tier: Pakistanis, Indians, Bangladeshis, Philippines,... the moment they arrive, their passports are taken from them and they are stuck in the country for periods of 5 or more years. No air conditioned in the barracks, misery salaries, medieval work conditions... I do understand that some of us will decide not participating on this. The Cup is filled with blood.",

Imagine the game of Football that's suppose to be a game of joy and happiness, bringing people together but as soon as politicians sees that opportunity on how they can get more money for there selfish reasons the whole thing turns out not just a game of football that brings happiness but how to make people suffer or even spoil the heart of men.When they (government) take this world cup thing too personal it makes people who wishes to watch it to say NO to the government, and if you think of it over 400+ workers have lost there lives in this year's world cup but the government or should I say the politicians just kept mute or instead they only voice out there losses which they know quite alright that they can get x3 of what they invested, with all these happening I don't think some people will have that joy in participating or engaging themselves in watching this year's world as it happened back then in 2014 when Brazil was the  host, they were having a massive protest even when the games were on.",

Since Qatar is not in support of the LGBTQ community, as it is regarded as an immoral act in the Muslim Sharia law and security guards at the tournament are being deprived of some rights, naturally, the world cup would not look pleasurable and some view it as a tainted world cup.  Personally, I don't think outright snubbing of the game would change the situation of things on ground but what is most mind boggling is where the Qatari organisers say the world cup is open for all and claim no one would be discriminated against, yet they remain adamant on laws against homosexuals.

The Cup is filled with blood.FIFA made a very big blunder by giving Qatar the right to host this world cup. The news coming from that country since they grabbed the hosting rights is not pleasant. There have been reports of violation of the fundamental rights of immigrants workers. Injured workers in most construction sites have not received proper health care or compensations. But football is above religious and tribal sentiments. People would always watch matches because they want to support their country or enjoy the fun that football brings. It is true that some persons might choose to boycott the competition because of these abuses but the world cup is very attractive, hence very difficult push aside. Qatar prepared well for the competition but they also made the tournament less interesting and exciting because of some cultural and religious rules. I hope FIFA have learned from this mistake and should always carryout a comprehensive analysis of proposed host nations before host rights are given.",

Yeah, a boycott by some population would help and having some pwople get to speak up but, it only helps to prevent future occurance on hosting the cup in areas where there are several rules that won't be accommodating of people of all religion.Without even looking at the human rights part of it, how about the prohibition of alcohol situation. Like, we've got Budweiser as an official sponsors and from what I've heard and have been trying to notice, I haven't seen fans around the stadium, having a drink from the brand.At most what they get is there name displayed on the screens and billboards. How do you make money off the population in Qatar then. I think that's some of the aims of sponsorship but No, not in Qatar with alcohol.I understand its a Muslim nation and tradition but, as much as you've got rules of this nature and your trying to accommodate a population such as that, you've got to be open to different behaviours.",

The part where immigrants passports are seized from them once they get into Qatar is what should be looked into except if the immigrants from those countries you mentioned know about it before going there. Then that will be an agreement and it must be honored. If anyone is not watching this world cup because Qatar is the host, that person is only denying himself the excitement of the world cup.

It's very hypocritical for people from Western countries to try and act like they're saints. Qatar has been hosting a very nice world cup since but since it was announced that Qatar would be the host of the world cup different people have been fighting them. Human rights are trampled on in every country of the world including the UK and US. Qatar never said you can't go to Qatar if you are gay, just don't bring flags and all what not. Whoever will not be watching the world cup should know that they would not be missed. Sports brings people together and so far in this world cup it has done that.

Let no country or external body impose regulations on individuals they do not govern. If you can't live by their rules, simply boycott it.
