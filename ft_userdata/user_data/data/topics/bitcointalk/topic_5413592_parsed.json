Will after this bad news investors will continue to HODL the LUNC coin?Why are you asking this just now? Isn't it that when the original Luna has dropped together with UST, that's already a sign that people should have their enough from these projects? And now with the arrest, it's obvious that you should have just dumped the token when it was pumping.After that problem they've got, there's really no more credibility on the people behind these projects. Think of a stable coin that has dropped to zero, damn, that's already a total red flag.",

The arrest of DK will put more risk on the project LUNC, I don’t know but if LUNC can’t survive from it’s current correction most probably we will not see its pumping again in the coming days, if you recently bought LUNC, better to cut loss now.",

We can’t tell the future trend correctly, if you didn’t trust this project anymore better to sell now and regret nothing.",

I know some persons that had made some good profits from the rise of the Luna even though it looks literally a big risk to investors who might see it as an opportunity. This is a bad news and this could create an end for this project and the partners. Some many investors had already been in a big loses since the first dump of terra and now things are getting worse.",

Just after the article was posted, 2 of their shitcoins LUNA and LUNC dropped double digit percentage which is a good thing and they deserved to get arrested after what happened in their previous project.Fate of Luna Classic? I just hope that it will be removed in Binance and other huge exchanges. Do Kwon is simply trying to regain the trust, but he can't and will never regain it after what happened last time. There is no sense in holding their shitcoins and traders will just use these coins as a pump and dump coin.",

It is better to take exit because its price may fall further in coming weeks unless you have invested small amount which you can afford to lose if LUNC crashes again and makes new bottom. The idea of Burn Tax was not bad and some exchange had supported it but if DU Kown is arrested then massive selling is likely to happen & some exchanges may delist it.",
