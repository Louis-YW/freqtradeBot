  "content": "If Trump fulfills his previous promise to establish a national reserve of Bitcoin and deregulate, perhaps Bitcoin will enter a new age.     1. The United States' purchase of Bitcoin as a reserve will drive up the price of Bitcoin, while also driving other countries and large companies and financial institutions to buy Bitcoin, further pushing up the price.     2. All spot, futures and options transactions of Bitcoin are liberalized, and the market can influence the exchange rate through Bitcoin transactions.     3. When the price of Bitcoin rises to a very high position, its volatility will become smaller, and Bitcoin will be more conducive to trading and hedging. Its use value is prominent.     4. Bitcoin may become a tool for inter-country payment. This is very important. For example. The BRICS countries hope to get rid of the US dollar and use their own currency for settlement, but they cannot reach a consensus. Russia once exported arms products to India and received Indian rupees, but they found that no country was willing to accept rupees. If the contract is settled in Bitcoin. Russia can use the Bitcoin received from India to buy the products it needs from China or North Korea. To achieve this scenario. Bitcoin must be maintained at a stable high level. And it must be recognized by most countries. The BRICS countries want to create their own digital currency. In my opinion, this idea is difficult to achieve due to the different demands of all parties. Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin without selfish motives, which is the most fair to all parties. Early Bitcoin advocates tried to promote the use of Bitcoin for daily payments, but this is purely a game and very inefficient. Bitcoin is only viable in large payments.     5. Most Bitcoins will be concentrated in the hands of countries, large companies, financial institutions and wealthy people for value preservation and transactions. The degree of concentration exceeds that of gold, so that few people can own a complete Bitcoin. Early Bitcoin investors can deposit Bitcoin in reputable financial institutions to obtain stable returns.",

Like Senator Lummis said, the US plans to acquire 1 million Bitcoin over a 5-year period...that's a massive amount, almost matching Satoshi’s holdings. It’s a good move, especially since it won't be a one-time acquisition if it ever happens. Every time there's news about it, Bitcoin will only get more bullish. So, with statements like this, betting on Bitcoin for the long term, just like the USA, is a solid choice.https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-reserve-asset-following-trump/QuoteSenator Lummis proposes the US Treasury to acquire 1 million Bitcoin over five years.The strategic reserve aims to reduce national debt by half by 2045 and position the US as a financial innovation leader.",

      "body": "If Trump follows through on his pre-election promises, it will be really positive for Bitcoin. There is no doubt that the Bitcoin market has had a positive impact since Trump's promise and the price of Bitcoin will move in a positive direction after the promise is kept. But it is difficult to say that the Bitcoin market is somewhat stable. Because no matter how high the Bitcoin market reaches, it is a bit difficult to get a stable situation from the Bitcoin market. After establishing a national reserve of Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin will increase slightly and the number of customers will also increase. Again, due to the increase in customers, the price of Bitcoin will increase a little more. That doesn't mean that the price of Bitcoin will just keep going up, of course we will see both ups and downs in the Bitcoin market like in the past. The Bitcoin market is inherently volatile, and it may not be possible for us to change it.",

If Senator Lummis' proposal is approved, apart from a brutal FOMO and price increase, it will be the culmination of the normalisation of bitcoin, where it will no longer be a rare thing linked to drug trafficking that you don't know if it will be banned, but something that the fucking US government (and others who will join in) has in its reserves.",

But if they could help ease the regulations on bitcoin then good but this should not mean we are giving up control.It would seem pointless that Satoshi created a decentralized currency for it to be totally given to an authority anyway. But the government could do a lot of things without having to assume full control of bitcoin. Let's see how can Trump improve bitcoin in general in the country.",
