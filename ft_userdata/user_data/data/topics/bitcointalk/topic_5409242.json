For example for the past couple of years about $7 billion of Iran's money is stolen by South Korea through SWIFT and they are refusing to give it back.\"The goal is to replace LC with smart contracts using the blockchain technology (without needing a third party) to handle payments for import/exports and have better guarantees from the other party. Basically replacing SWIFT.\"From what I understand there is going to be a domestic centralized exchange where miners could deposit their bitcoins (apparently not limited to miners only). They can either sell it there and receive fiat or CryptoRial or credit for imports through the provided channels.The target for imports is said to be \"places where mining and using cryptocurrencies are common\" naming \"Russia, India, China and South East Asia\".The article still didn't mention what cryptocurrency was used or whom was the $10 mil trade with.",

More importantly, once there is a critical mass in crypto, people won't have to trade in and out of it, they'll just settle up in crypto.  Then there is much less need for an exchange whether p2p or centralized.  This type of use if it is even real is a first step in having large amounts remain in crypto.  If you buy something from ABC and they immediately trade it for fiat, what's the real point? The more controls that are put in place the more likely it is to occur.  For example, when Stripe and PayPal banned the Trump campaign in Jan 2021, the obvious answer was to just switch to crypto.  Ditto for other places that are getting hit by Visa such as pornhub's parent company.  Ditto for banks that are denying loans to firearms companies, gun shops or oil companies.  Ditto companies that are being black listed (or grey listed) on ESG grounds.   Jen Psaki said that people who spread “misinformation” “shouldn’t be banned from one platform and not others.”  She wasn't talking about just social media, she was talking about the entire realm of the digital world including online payments etc too.  The end result of this will be to drive people to places that don't want to or aren't able to censor them and crypto is one place they'll end up because while it is nice to see \"free speech alternatives\" to some of these things, as long as they are centralized, they are subject to legal pressure.(No comment on whether this is a good thing or not with regard to it being Iran of course).",

Of course, a state will probably pay it (with the note that even national currencies' value is manipulated a little), still, using entity3 or, better, an independent \"value\" instead of entity2's whatever, makes more sense in my head.Quote from: pooya87 on August 11, 2022, 05:11:09 PMThe amount I mentioned above was the total in multiple countries not SK alone ($7 billion in SK), and it is not a \"story\", there has been a long conflict over this money for the past 4 years and they still haven't given it back simply because US doesn't let them!This is for example part of this long drama last year:https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2021/02/24/south-korea-agrees-to-unfreeze-1-billion-in-iranian-assets-following-tanker-seizure-by-tehran/Complicated story.
