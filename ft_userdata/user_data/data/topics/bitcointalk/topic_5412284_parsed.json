  "content": "I've got gripes about Kucoin's usability and want to air them here.One thing I noticed the first time I used Kucoin is that there are two different accounts you have: Main and Trading, and there's absolutely no need for that to exist.  I say that with confidence because no other exchange I've used has anything like that.  Transferring funds between main and trading accounts is time-wasting, and recently I found I have to reload the page of the account I just transferred coins to in order for them to show up.  Kucoin, get rid of that shit, please.The worst offense is the withdrawal process, though, and it's only gotten worse over time.  This is the process:1. Move traded coin from Trading to Main account.2. Initiate withdrawal by clicking the withdrawal button.3. Click a pop-up confirmation.4. Select the coin's network from a drop down menu, click it and then click OK.5. Enter withdrawal amount.6. Enter your trading password.7. Go through the SMS verification.8. Click another confirmation pop-up.Kucoin, that's too many fucking steps.  Why bother having users click on a network for coins where there's only one network?Why so many confirmation clicks?  When people want to withdraw, they've already initiated the process.  All of that clicking, when it's done many times over a long period of time, is an enormous waste of your customers' time.  As is the existence of a trading password.  As is the existence of the dual-account structure.My experience with Kucoin has only gotten more cumbersome with time, and I'm going to bring this thread to their attention.  What do you guys think?Edit:  Well, I sure as hell can't figure out how to contact Kucoin quickly, so perhaps I can't let them know about it.  I started up a help chat, but the response I got was that they couldn't understand what I wrote (it's a bot and the link I put in it might have triggered that response).",

I don't know if they are required by regulations to do this or their own decision because of hacking attempts.On OKX which I use often, you can check (mark) either funding or trading account or both for withdrawal. If your fund is in trading account, you do not have to necessarily move it back to funding account before you will be able to withdraw, just check your trading account and you will be able to withdraw it. Some exchanges are using this now, even Binance is now using such feature too, but spot and funding account on Binance is different if compared to other exchanges and it is the most perfect for me, on Binance, you can trade directly with your funds which is the spot account.@The PharmacistIf Binance can do that, I expect other exchanges should be able to do that, I mean if you paste the address of the network you want to use to withdraw on Binance.com (I do not know of Binance.US), the network would automatically be selected. You can also check either funding account or spot account during withdrawal. But if you transfer money into your Binance account, it would automatically be in spot wallet, funding wallet is for P2P, Binance Pay, Gift card and Pool. It would be good if other exchanges like Kucoin can also be like that.About email, sms and 2fa verification when you want to withdraw, it is for the security of your account, in a way hackers will not be able to attack you personally. It is annoying, but I like it because of its security, especially the 2FA verification during withdrawal.",

There's absolutely no need to have two types of accounts if you're trading crypto.  It's simple: deposit crypto, it's in your exchange account and when you go to the marketplace section, the exchange knows damn well how much crypto you have, so....why have a trading and main account-type system?  Every time you have to withdraw funds from Kucoin, you're going through numerous, unnecessary steps that have no reason to exist, not even for security.  Again, I mentioned that you have to click a pop-up two times just to confirm that you want to withdraw a coin.Quote from: Oshosondy on September 04, 2022, 08:00:33 AMAbout email, sms and 2fa verification when you want to withdraw, it is for the security of your account, in a way hackers will not be able to attack you personally. It is annoying, but I like it because of its security, especially the 2FA verification during withdrawal.I never said anything critical about any of those things.  I merely included the SMS part in the list of all the hoops you need to jump through.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on September 04, 2022, 07:44:24 AMThey have a thread here on the forum. Thank you for mentioning that; I didn't even think about  it, but I'm also wondering how responsive they are to stuff like this through their bitcointalk account.  And I'm not totally slamming them, either.  It's just that every time I use their exchange, I feel like it was about 5x harder than the typical ones I use (which aren't numerous, but they have simple mechanics).  Anyone use TradeOgre?  That is probably the most stripped-down, minimalistic exchange I've ever seen.Quote from: hugeblack on September 04, 2022, 08:46:12 AMGenerally, there are many beginners, so the many steps to withdraw are a good idea.That's ridiculous, as it assumes people are retards and also makes everything I've described here harder than it has to be--and that isn't going to help any newcomers.  I mean really, why not have customers have to click a pop-up confirmation 4, 5, 6 times?\"Are you sure you want to withdraw?\"Click-->yes\"Are you absolutely sure you want to take the crypto off our exchange?\"Click-->yes\"Just checking: these coins are going from our exchange to your wallet, right?\"Click-->yes\"OK, last time.  You want to withdraw your coins?\"Click-->yesSee if you've got arthritic fingers on your mouse hand in about 30 years and get back to me.  Well, I'll be dead then but follow up in this thread anyway, eh?",

Also I will use Binance.com (not Binance.us) as an example. On BinanceIf anyone send you money, it goes straight to your spot account, you can be able to trade with it (spot trading like using bitcoin to buy USDT and vice versa).But on you Binance account, you can be able to transfer coins from spot account to margin, future, funding account and vice versa. That is how it works on Binance, but which it is your preference.Binance later, which was last year or so, make spot account for trading and withdrawal which is what you want, while its funding account are for what I have mentioned above like p2p trading.On OKXProbably how Kucoin might be too, but I do not know. On your OKX account. If you received coins on your OKX account, it would be on funding account. If you move it to your trading account, it would be available for spot, margin and future trading. Very different from how Binance exchange is.Assuming you have $1000 in your funding account, you transfer $100 to your trading account, only the $100 would be available for trading. Assuming you opened 3x cross margined leverage perpetual long position for BTC at $20000, the liquidation price would be at around $13333. If bitcoin reach $14000, you can be able to transfer more coins from funding account. Like if you transfer $100 in addition to make it become $200, the liquidation price would be around $6667, which was around $13666 before the collateral transfer.Money in the trading account are only affected during trading, your funding account money is intact and unaltered. It makes trading more flexible towards trader's preference, unlike only going for isolated margin or future trading if a safe account (funding account) is not available.I believe you are a spot trade, like selling bitcoin for a stable coin after massive bull market, and buying bitcoin back after massive bear market. It is just a guess. But if so, that is why you think trading account is not necessary. But exchange like Binance, make it the way you want as it advance it, I am not sure if Binance.us is like that.",

But I'm afraid, it's the standard practice by the major exchanges I have used. It could even get worse with Binance where in addition to what you wrote, they might add email verification, or even tell you to take a quiz before performing the withdrawal. What a heck!The processes might seem too much, but a good level of accountability (wallet to trading account) and security (verifications) if I must say.",
