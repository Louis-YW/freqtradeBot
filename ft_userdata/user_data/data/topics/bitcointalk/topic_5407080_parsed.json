  "content": "Samsung recently has announced that it has started to produce it's new 3 nm (nanometer) mining chips. So there is a big improvement, as the mining chip would come on with increased performance of up to about 23% and 45% more energy-efficient.QuoteOptimized 3nm process achieves 45% reduced power usage, 23% improved performance and 16% smaller surface area compared to 5nm process.The leaders of Samsung Foundry Business and Semiconductor R&D Center are holding up three fingers as a symbol of 3nm celebrating the companyâ€™s first ever production of 3nm process with GAA architecture.What do you think about this news? specially about the timing that we are in a bear market (perhaps though the release will be in the next bull run?) And once is full gear and has been released will miners move to this new technology? And how about their marketing it with cheaper and greener?Edit added the link: https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-begins-chip-production-using-3nm-process-technology-with-gaa-architecture",

      "body": "depends on who actually owns the machine that physically made the chips. not who is using the chipsin many cases over the last decade. the inventor of the machine capable of making smaller chips, sells the machines that do it to many industries. so although samsung may use its machine/chips for phones. the machine that does it can be mass produced and sold to its competitors which ends up being in a factory(foundry) where asic chips are then made on the machinethese machines are very expensive usually multiple billions and i mean mega billions to be built. so this is usually where different 'end product' companies 'rent' the machines for a few days/weeks/months/a season to get their chip designs made in batches, and then use them chips in a separate factory for their own products to have the tech, without the huge multibillion equipment cost of buying the machine",

      "body": "The semiconductor industry has always been building mega feats regarding nanoscale levels. I remember that AMD made 7 nm processors before, and the industry research is on 3 nm already. That's amazing if you think about it. The manufacturing level that they have and the engineering design are good since you can fit more and more parts in a minor chip. More powerful. It doesn't directly affect the cryptocurrency market yet because it's still in the prototype phase. Once it launches, that's going to be one of the things to look out for. Maybe that's a sign already that they are moving into the mining area.",

And then the big players get their miners 1st. It's sadly going to be a long time until miners built with these get into the hands of people like us here.But tech does keep progressing. The larger question is what will the costs be by the time we can get our hands on some of them.-Dave",

Seriously this news brings us more previews of the future of computers, it took them only 2 years to produce new ones. Our world is really fast when it comes to computer evolutions.",

Come to talk of it, mining with app directly from phone show's how reliable and. Environmental friendly the app would be. Then it means that the greatest challenge of mining has been settled being it the energy consumption and environmental degradation. This means that mining would be environmental friendly now as against it's back drop. But however, does this really mean that you can mine any Coin with the Samsung mining phone or otherwise because there are other mineable coin on blockchain. So OP I think you should update us to know more in this development. This is a big achievement by Samsung company.",

If i were in their shoes i would create a new mining company apart from samsung for the miners production.Let's follow this news closely because i'm sure Bitmain will not stay there just watching.samsung is an end-product company. usually there is another company behind them that makes the fabricators(the chip machines that make the chips)one that fabricator makes one, they usually make more and sell the machines for multiple bilions to other companies where other companies rent out the machines to end product businesses to use the machine in their rental time to batch produce whatever chip template the fabricator is handed. whomever is the fabricator. they would need to price the rental slots in at the right price else places like bitmain wont rent out time to make asics on these.usually smart product makers wait a few seasons/batches where the fabricator has started getting money in via other corporations, which then reduces the rental costs. so dont expect a winter 2022 batch being 3nm bitmain chips..anyways a lower nm means less electric overall. but electric is not a significant chunk of cost for the most economical asics farmstake the $0.04c electric regions.the 2021 gen of bitmain asics were 110thash at 3.25kwhEG$12k hardware = 0.69 an hour (cost spread over 2 years)13cent electric an hour=$0.82 an hour cost. (16% electric 84% hardware)so even if they can make the chips use 45% as much electric. .. if the physical chips are more then an 8th higher than the cost of last gen chips. the math makes them less economicalEGelectric =13cent -45% =~$7centif hardware goes up to $0.75 an hour from 0.69 = $13,125 hardware (not spread over two years)yep if hardware becomes just $1k-$2k more than last gen. then its not cheaper to mine for the most economical minershowever it does play better for the people with higher electric grid costs, but then they are not as efficient anyways but their percentage of electric:hardware moves in their favourEG$0.12 grid cost per kw = $0.39 per hour asic electric cost.. vs the 0.69 hardware ($1.08 (36%:64%))so bringing their electric down from 39cent to 22cent brings their cost down to 91cent which if hardware cost was equal to last gen is a 16% overall cost saving",

The Canaan A921 using chips from Samsung was the 1st 7nm miner to market beating Bitmain by almost 6 months. Not sure if they did the chips for the A10x series but AFAIK they make the chips for Canaan's A11xx and A12xx miners. They made the chips for MicroBT's M10 & M20 series and I'd think probably the M3x series as well. As I said above, last year they also became a 2nd-source supplier for Bitmain after TSMC slashed mining chip production to free up production for more valuable chips.",

(and i can predict you want more drama of you quoting an exact price to a cent to pretend that because i rounded it must mean you are smarter..nope. just means your being anal in a topic thats about next gen chips. not last batch asic hardware)if you cant understand that i specifically mention which batch or year gen of hardware i speak of is because yep things change. whats next for you.. will you try and quote a post from 2012 where i mention that the network is 100% GPU mining and try to cause drama to suggest that im saying that 2022 is gpu mining because i said '100%' sometime, in some post.. .. no.. things change..
