Now, Lomax and both banks involved reportedly don’t know what happened to the money.After providing documentation and wiring instructions, both banks have agreed to investigate the situation.If it is about a missing check in the mail then what do wiring instructions has to do with that? There's not a system in place where they can see if a check got cashed or not? Quotethe article mentions she moved addressit doesn't say that. here is what it says:According to Lomax, she recently sold her home in Rio Vista, California, after raising her kids and living there for 29 yearsWe don't know how long ago she moved out. But lets just go with your assumption.Quotethe article said she put funds into an account she doesnt use muchit didn't say she didn't use it much. i don't know where you got that idea.  it just says she deposited it into a \"smaller bank\" just because Farmers & Merchants. might be a \"smaller bank\" does that mean we should immediately assume she doesn't use it much?Quotethe article mentions family waited the 60days before questioning location of fundsi think you might be misunderstanding the article because it doesn't say that at all. i'm sure she was questioning them over the phone IMMEDIATELY. but it certainly doesn't say she waited 60 days before bringing up the issue.Quotedoes it now make sense logically and more common senselydont just read some media story and believe it like a religion. think for yourself using research and other source information to come to an INFORMED opiniondoes it make sense that someone that saw $120,000 their lifetime savings disappear straight out of their bank account would wait 60 days before calling the bank to ask about what happened? no it doesn't. but maybe it makes sense to you?  Quoteyou argue that the family wont have been told these things over the phonei wouldn't expect it. but i guess its possible. i just know that some things banks don't go into over the phone. but they tell you they'll send you a written letter explaining their decision. so you just have to sit and wait.Quoteyou argue that the money went missing instantlyshe said the money went missing immediately poof gone. on her screen one second then gone the next. what about that is hard to understand about her story?Quoteif the funds vanished on day one then a different conversation would have occured. not the conversation that fits into standard citibank closure practicewhat is \"day one\"? wouldn't that be the day her atm machine wouldn't give her the money? and then she goes home and logs in and watches her $120,000 change to $0 right in front of her eyes? you don't believe her story it seems like. that's fine but just admit",

Once those 60 days expired, her daughter said she was told the money had been returned to its “rightful owner.”now instead of just reading article on face value alone. you need to add the context. and that means reading bank terms and conditions of what they do when accounts are frozen where she cant make any deposits or wire transfers due to a freeze.. .. standard practice is that a cheque is printed and sent to the registered address on the account within 60 days (which article admits the daughter waited before querying)then logic appears.. now why would a cheque not go to a new address.. logic suggests she did not update the new address so cheque would go to old address..then it says when daughter after the 60th day was told the funds were sent (but not received) the family sent documentation .. again logic suggests they sent proof of new address along with details of the old transactions.. and NOW the bank is probably cancelling the old cheque. investigating to ensure it was not cashed by the home buyer of old address.. and if all clear.. they would THEN (near future) print a new cheque to go to the new addressQuote from: larry_vw_1955 on September 22, 2023, 01:59:39 AMwhat is \"day one\"? wouldn't that be the day her atm machine wouldn't give her the money? and then she goes home and logs in and watches her $120,000 change to $0 right in front of her eyes? you don't believe her story it seems like. that's fine but just admit when accounts are frozen. you do not see an available balance. because THE ACCOUNT IS FROZEN. you are not allowed to use an ATM or wire transfers. the account is in administration.. the letter and subsequent communication suggests the funds would be sent out.. where the only error suggests funds were if you follow logic of the hints about entire scenario. that the cheque possible went to old addresseven margeret is saying her fear is that \"they sent it somewhere and someone is going 'whoo hoo christmas came early\"there is a chance. that the home buyer done what is called a chargeback scam. where they would claim the funds sent to the seller were false and they want a refund.. however this is unlikely due to how escrows work and other things. and also how the bank informed the family they were going to send funds out in 60days and funds were sent in those 60 days.. just not to margerets new address..so i think its more likely a wrong address postal error than a buyers remorse chargeback refundhowever this story might get juicier if the house sale was done privately without escrow agents and the buyer did chargeback scam her.. however the article makes no mention of the terms of the sale so i assumed it was done properly/regularly via escrow",

HOWEVER the funds came from another exchanges hotwallet and not the users previous exchange deposit addressthe thing to remember is if you are putting funds into a central party/middleman its always best to read their terms of their holding rules and ensure you know how to get funds out and ensure they know how to send you funds that go to your new address rather than something they have on record that has not been updatedan idea i had YEARS ago is instead of people having usernames and passwords. people use a unused bitcoin address as a username. and they sign a random(per session changed) message from an exchange to prove ID to login. and if there were any fund exits. the funds go to the login address. whereby it prevents hackers claiming coin not belonging to them and funds always go to intended usermany hackers previously have hacked normal usernames and made withdrawal requests to hackers address.. however if exchange account ID is the customers withdrawal address. its one less bureaucratic problem of hacking/bad withdrawals and makes funds truly accountable to true owner",
