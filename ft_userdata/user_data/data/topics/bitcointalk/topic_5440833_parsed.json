Use https://whattomine.com/asic and input your hash rate and cost of power, it will output the current profit or loss.ONLY if you can mine at a profit should you continue investigating...No matter what, there are NO guarantees in this business.If you are a registered business in the USA one huge perk is that you can take the cost of equipment as a tax deduction.From the section179 site: QuoteNews Alert: The 2023 Section 179 Deduction Limit for Businesses is $1,160,000Jan 2, 2023 – The Section 179 deduction for 2023 is $1,160,000 (this is up from $1,080,000 in 2022). This is a full $80,000 increase from last year. This means U.S. companies can deduct the full purchase price of ALL qualified equipment purchases, up to the limit of $1,160,000. In addition, the “total equipment purchase” limit has been raised to $2,890,000 (up from $2.7 million in 2022). The deduction can include both new and used qualified equipment",

I don’t know your mining cost, for example, my friends in Russia have 17-20 thousand dollars for 1 bitcoin. They use asics 70-100 terahesh. If the price of bitcoin falls to 15,000 dollars, then I think that your mining will be unprofitable, and if you buy bitcoin, then lose 40% of your investment. But bitcoin is easy to sell and invest in a profitable project, and non-profit ASICs are very difficult to sell quickly and at a good price.",

      "body": "With the current interest rates and the proximity of Bitcoin to the average cost of mining, which is about 17k, and the lack of expectations of new ATH or any price higher than 28k, what is the potential return from all this risk?It's not just about buying miners and making a profit but how long do you need to recover the capital, factoring in the depreciation factor and your ability to get rid of the mining rigs.Another thing that can cause you to lose is energy price fluctuations.there wasn't much left for the next Bitcoin halving.For methods, you can use your bitcoins as collateral and buy hardware with them, or go to the bank and borrow money from them (I doubt they'll give you that).You can set up a small company and try to sell the shares of that company to other Bitcoiners/",

I'm looking for tried-and-tested methods of financing these operations.What do you say is a method will really help you with these plans? Then what kind of miners would you buy in the plural some pieces of these miners?      Because you know if your electricity consumption is cheap, let's just say it's 0.06-0.08 $ kwh if you can say that it's okay you are planning that, but if your KWH per hour is higher then I think the ones will just ignore those You are thinking of a plan, even if we say that you really have to buy miners but if you lose electricity you will earn it it is best not to continue because you are wasting time, tired, money for sure.",

I don't seem to see any legitimate Cloudmining these days. Also, you will need quite a bit of capital here, but you can afford it.But you know that the risk of doing this is quite high. This is just my opinion and suggestion, maybe you should have a feasibility on this matter first if you are serious about your plans. So that every step you take is at least smooth and your electricity as well must be cheaper too.",
