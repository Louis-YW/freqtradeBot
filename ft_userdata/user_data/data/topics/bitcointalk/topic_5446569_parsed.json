And what should assure us that the said person on the deed didn't have full access to sell the property whenever they pleases?",

All the NFT owners for that property will have a say via a voting system. If we reach over 51% then we can sell. However, Vanguard will be using a Lawyer/Solicitor who will have a full list of NFT Holders for that property. We as a company alone will NOT be able to sell without permission of the Lawyers/Solicitors after the voting has been finalized. This protects all NFT Holders. So until the they have given us approval we can't sell.",

So until the they have given us approval we can't sell. So there's no specific individual with sole control over selling the property? Everything has to be approved by a solicitor, who took the decision based on majority voting? May I know how this translates into annual taxation? Technically the holders owned part of property overseas, yet they're not the legal owner, what should be declared on their assets on annual tax report, then?",

After all, investors should always do their own DD, that should include other fees and unexpected factors that came with the investment they choose. Talking about your own tax, I understand the land tax and utility bills, and any other fee that might occur on the whole renting properties are tacked by your 4% buy and sell tax?Also, do I understand you correctly that you're an Switzerland based company who will manage properties in Dubai?",
