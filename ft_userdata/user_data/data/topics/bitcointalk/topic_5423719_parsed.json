  "content": "Hi all,i remember reading somewhere regarding a bitcoin puzzle that someone had found a private key and deducted the prize money not only from the corresponding bitcoin (mainnet) address, but also correspondingly from Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin SV or maybe others.Let's say someone finds a valid private key from the well-known 32 BTC puzzle. He can quickly take his reward from the the Bitcoin address. Is there a known open-source tool that additionally to Bitcoin mainnet spits out all possible addresses from other networks from that private key? At best, it should also make an API call to query an online block explorer and check whether the respective address also is funded.For example mass balance-check forBitcoin (BTC)Bitcoin Cash (BCH)Bitcoin SV (BSV)Ethereum (ETH)Litecoin (LTC)Dogecoin (DOGE)Dash (DASH)Zcash (ZEC)... or others you may think ofOf course, this should all work on the local computer and not on an online website, because you never enter private keys on an online platform, because the operator could know and abuse its content. If anyone knows of such a tool, I would be very grateful.",

So, if you find a private key of a bitcoin address funded before those hard forks time, you should be able to move the forked coins as well. A bitcoin private key isn't a valid ethereum private key or a valid Dash private key and you can't use that private key to move fund in those blockchains.",

A bitcoin private key should work for all bitcoin forks as well.The most popular forked coin is bitcoin cash (BCH). The bitcoin cash fork happened on August, 1, 2017. Any bitcoin transaction made before that date exists in the bitcoin cash blockchain as well.So, if a bitcoin address has received fund before that date, it has received bitcoin cash as well.",

Since a lot of shitcoins like Ethereum and DASH have copied bitcoin where it matters (ie. key generation and elliptic curve, namely secp256k1) a bitcoin private key is always valid for those shitcoins too.The only thing different is how they generate the address. For example IIRC Ethereum computes the keccak256 hash of the public key and truncates it to produce the address. Otherwise the private key and public key are both the same.",

I've seen empty results for funded addresses (maybe funds sent to pubkey are ignored).Also, most of the Forks are really not worth your time.

This is the result I getAs you can easily see, there is no trace of a balance display here. I can click to the generated link of the associated address, yes, but that's not the way that to go. Quote from: MixMAx123 on November 28, 2022, 04:07:57 AMI think you can manage over 1000 coins.It's great that the tool offers countless coins in one list, but again, what has already been said is valid --> it doesn't help with the problem this thread is about. Please scroll up again and read this carefully.Quote from: MixMAx123 on November 28, 2022, 04:07:57 AMTo do this, the desired coin must first be selected.Please click on \"Settings\" and then on \"Import New Coin\"Now a list of all coins that can be selected opens.This behavior is also not affected when I click on SETTINGS --> Import Coins and select e.g. BCH and BCD. This allows me to select BCH or BCD in the dropdown field at the top left, but the balance is not automatically displayed as you had shown in the screenshot.Quote from: MixMAx123 on November 28, 2022, 04:07:57 AMIf everyone is not available or you separate the internet connection, nothing can of course be displayed.You mean my internet connection is the reason the tool doesn't work as advertised?Quote from: MixMAx123 on November 28, 2022, 04:07:57 AMHowever, it is correct that the account stand query is only implemented for a few coins.In your screenshot shown here, Bitcoin (BTC) is selected in the dropdown field and the balance display is visible in your screenshot. However, this is not the case for me.Quote from: MixMAx123 on November 28, 2022, 04:07:57 AM@Citb0in Please don't say things that are wrong.Now please explain to me what I should have said that was not true.No offense, but it gives me the impression that you are the author of this tool and feel personally attacked because I said the tool was not helpful for the intended use. Throwing a tool you developed into the room, but it doesn't fit the matter, seems that happened before already on another thread. I appreciate your work and dedication to creating such tools, but it doesn't change the fact that the things I mentioned and also that the tool doesn't do what it was about in the topic. You can consider my criticism as constructive. For everything else I would suggest to open a separate thread for the tool and discuss it there, otherwise it becomes offtopic here.@LoyceV: Thanks. Appreciate your feedbackAfter understanding the principle thanks to your answers and reading a little bit about these forks, the suggested web address should be useful. For example, if I enter there the address 1FRoHA9xewq7DjrZ1psWJVeTer8gHRqEvR, I would see the credits of all the forks. If it wasn't for the problem that LoyceV just mentioned. Is there anything alternative to this website, maybe something you could run locally on your own computer and query all the forks by account balance? Otherwise, I'll settle for https://findmycoins.ninja/, which ends up doing exactly what I was looking for.Thanks to all for the helpful advice.",
