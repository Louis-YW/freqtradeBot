  "content": "Good afternoon, forum members. Now I'm working on my own token, presale, earlier in 2022 I've launched several projects, after the events of TerraLuna, FTX the launch of new tokens became irrelevant, now in the season of altcoins and memcoin boom the launch of new tokens is relevant again)).Test launched a week ago to test, everything still works. Looking for an investor partner to launch. The amount of investment needed is $7500. Implementation period of 1 week. Payback x3-x5 of the investment. All the technical part I undertake, for the project found ambassadors, bloggers to promote, marketing channels, site placement are all found. I know how everything is arranged) as a guarantee for the investor before the sale will give a pledge in tokens in advance. The project is not a scam, hanypot, etc.  There will be a full audit, verification of the project, prepared documentation.If interested, send a message in pm or in Telegram.",

Lol.I will explain to you why 1 week, the presale will take place 1 week, that is why such a period is specified. After the presale, the token is automatically placed on decentralized exchanges and liquidity is poured into it. I, as a developer, will have a developer's wallet, which will receive a part of the funds after the presale for the development of the project and from this money I will return to the investor. Liquidity is 60%, 35% blocked tokens, 5% marketing. That's exactly why I specified it this way.",

Ohhh, you only have promises and no documents here.I do not think you are stupid) I wonder how you determined that this is a scam, without asking a single question and without looking at the project?)) I will provide full information to the partner. About the preliminary tokens equal to zero you are right, but I am looking for a partner exactly for presale, it all goes through a smart contract, at the end of the contract automatically adds liquidity to the pool and sends payment to the investor. Nothing depends on me in manual mode. For example if I set price 0.005, then investor will get 5.000.000 what is 25.000 in dollar terms. That's all. Just about my account, I used to sit, but I lost access to the old account. You guys are looking at the situation from the user, but not from the developer, these are different things, you need to clearly understand and know the whole procedure. I do not reproach you for anything, but it's a little different than just buying a token.",

In this forum, the most powerful thing to guarantee is reputation, you even created this topic with your low-rank account, so I don't believe people will easily trust you. BTW, can you provide a little information about the project you want to create? is it related to Web3, Memes, anything else?",

About altcoins you are indeed right not all will blossom. Having guarantees x3 yes sounds doubtful for potential investors and my rookie status does not inspire confidence either, I understand that. For the investor I will tell you everything in order, saying it publicly is not my plan. Many alts while launching not having experience in it make lots of mistakes and this leads to failure, I have a background as a developer and have experience in launches know how to avoid them. How to use market levers, promotion, sales, attracting user traffic I know it all first hand as a developer which helps increase success rate. Thank you for your feedback.

I think that the main thing is that everyone can make a useless token, you are also right. But not everyone can make a presale, turn a useless token into a worthwhile asset. I'm going to do everything according to developer protocol. It will not look like some people think, they will create a token and go around trying to sell it to everyone. No, the placement will be on the starting marketplaces, pouring liquidity, blocking tokens so the price won't be lowered by the sales, according to to tokenomics, then there will be promotion. Increasing the community through activity, possibly rewards, collaborations. For the partner I will tell everything in detail and transparently. There is also support and agreement with cryptocommunities in Twitter. It is not in my plans to reveal all the details. In short, memtoken",

It's like a game of cards, all on luck in the case of investors at the initial stages of payback always. Look at all the funds that invest always before the start of the project, at the output have x10 x100 of investment. I do not remember right now, it is Solana, for example start in bear market. I think that the main reason of this is that many strong projects started in bear market, I can't remember now, for example start in bear market.",

Yes you are a winner in life and champion of crypto in the world)) Weekly turnover and x3 investor is exactly what I am saying, only it is possible on the other side of crypto, not on your side where you are a pro buying a token and waiting for the price to rise, but on the side when you sell it) developers are always on the plus side remember this mate.About the newbie status I know, enough people have already said it to you if you haven't noticed champion)) Earlier I had an account but I can not restore access. And honestly did not sit here much, occasionally visited, but there is nothing really sensible, all that they say here I already know for a long time.

Because everyone can see that you are either delusional and lynig to yourself or lying to us. And frankly i don't care which one you are.Why don't you just do a token sale for your project and see how many people believe you. Except you can't really promise any growth because that makes the token an illegal unregistered security.If you however are delusional and lying to yourself and not to us, ask yourself, why not take a loan from a loanshark. I mean with that interest you can pay it back in no time? Oh i see, the reason is that you don't trust yourself either?",

That's all. Just about my account, I used to sit, but I lost access to the old account. You guys are looking at the situation from the user, but not from the developer, these are different things, you need to clearly understand and know the whole procedure. I do not reproach you for anything, but it's a little different than just buying a token.The problem does not lie in the smart contract, and ensuring that the money reaches the investor or the other party with whom the smart contract is created, but rather in guaranteeing the value. content.Our skepticism about your words comes because of the guarantee of profit in a short time, which is a very good thing to be true. If you do not guarantee the price, but rather guarantee the arrival of the currencies, then the next question will be, do you guarantee that those currencies have value when sold, if so, then some may take risks. Again, $7,500 is not a small amount for a random investment.Thank you for your question, after reading it I realized what my mistake was, I will write about it in my next answer.Regarding your question, I understand your skepticism, about as may seem unrealistic term of 1 week, and about whether tokens will have value. Look, I've been in this game for a long time and the first thing I want to do is to protect myself as a developer and my team from losses. All do so it's true, all funds, projects, exchanges first of all protect themselves from losses, even in cases of failure they are always in the black. What is important for the overall safety of the project, the price of token, your own investments, your partner's investments? It is important to keep the price at the same level and not allow the trader to drop it. To do this the presale tokens will be blocked for 6 months, which will protect against the collapse of the price, according to to tokenomics, the investor tokens will not be blocked and as soon as the presale is over, 75% of liquidity will go to decentralized exchanges, 75% is specified so that at the start token price was higher, many give 51% liquidity, but then as experience shows the project does not live long. After that partner can sell tokens and take their x3-x5 . Tokens not involved in the sale will also be blocked, to keep the price. In turn, I will receive a percentage of presales on the purse of the developer, in order not to touch the liquidity and develop the project further. After presales I will not be able to influence the liquidity of token, I will not be able to take it away that is the difference between clean project and fraud, as I said earlier the project will be audited, verified, distinguishing mark, there will also be ama for buyers, which will positively affect the image of token. The sale will be held at launch pads (not like someone in telegram said to buy token and trying to sell you a blank) they also have their own organic traffic which is positive for the project. So I can say that the investor will be protected from losses",

      "body": "Dear forum members, due to the large number of questions I want to say that perhaps it was my mistake to publish such a message from the account of a newcomer. I did not think, my fault, my mistake. I am a developer, have experience in launching cryptocurrencies, cryptogames, took part in web3 application development. I look at this project from the developer side, understand that, that's why many think it's a world of x3-x5 in 1 week. I guarantee to secure investor funds, there are developer methods for this, developers are always on the plus side understand this. From the perspective of the average cryptocurrency holder this seems unrealistic, but if a developer is reading this, he knows what I'm talking about.I am open to questions and criticism about my project and to prove my professionalism to you, I am ready to answer your questions.As there was one interesting idea, but about it a little later)",
