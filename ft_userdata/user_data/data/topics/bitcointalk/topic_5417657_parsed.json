Thanks to tranthidung for pointing that out.Its called swap but the process is same as using the centralized exchanges but here you may pay more fee than the conventional centralized exchanges. I would still prefer the Exchanges than swapping platform cause expensive also the trade will not be instant since the coins has to arrive to your address since its happening onchain whereas with exchange its just instant if you go for current market price.",

So I wondered what would be the fastest way to do that.....The fastest and the safest way should be using a centralized exchange like Binance. It shouldn't take long at all if you don't ask for a price way higher than the market price and it is also risk-free. I personally wouldn't experiment new platforms with my funds unless I'm a 100% sure that they are legit. Fees shouldn't be an issue as you would also need to pay a significant amount in on-chain transaction fees even if you are using a decentralized platform.",

Moreover, the signatures of this platform can be seen under many posts on the forum. Perhaps I will join recommendation this excanger.OP, you can use the BestChange exchange service (free Internet-service) to convert BTC to ETH. To do this, just click the green signature under my post (or under the post of another user with exactly the same signature).You can learn more about BestChange in this thread - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3309245.0.",

They usually skip quick educational tour or trading tip notifications before starting. Then they get scammed and have to learn from their own experience together with loss.Quote from: NeuroticFish on October 20, 2022, 02:44:44 PMAnd what if one just picks an available offer? Are they so bad?They can be taker and pick one of available offers to start trading. It saves their time but maybe a given rate does not suit their interest.In addition, depends on account and payment method, trading limit can be low to 0.01 BTC. It is explained by a general low trading volume on Bisq exchange too.Quote from: https://bisq.wiki/Frequently_asked_questions#What_are_trading_limits.3F_How_much_bitcoin_can_I_buy.2Fsell_at_once.3FWhat happens if the person buying bitcoin does a chargeback after the bitcoin has been released from the multisig address?Bisq only supports payment methods for which chargebacks are not easy (e.g., this is why PayPal and credit cards are not supported). But there is still a little chargeback risk with banks. If a bank executes a chargeback after the BTC has been released, there is nothing a mediator or arbitrator can do.Bisq's goal is to make this scenario as unattractive as possible, using three primary mechanisms:Account aging requires newly-created fiat payment accounts on Bisq to have lower trade limits, and those limits are increased over time.Account signing requires higher-risk payment methods to be signed upon verifying the integrity of a trader before account aging kicks in. Until such accounts are signed, buy limits are set to 0.01 BTC.National currency payment methods which are found to be used for chargebacks are quickly removed.",
