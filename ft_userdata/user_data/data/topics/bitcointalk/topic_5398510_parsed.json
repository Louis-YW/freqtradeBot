I assume tiffany didn't produce it that way. If so how is it attached to the clip?Yes Here is the coin they used: https://www.goldenstatemint.com/1-oz-Bitcoin-Silver-Bullion-Round.htmlFor some reason, it also seems like the coin was plated to make it look like the clip (more matte) and not the usual shiny surface.And correct, this was done 2nd-hand by whomever made this.Was obtained in a larger lot of items that was part of a trade I made.I am guessing some sort of strong epoxy/glue... doesn't appear to be welded or anything like that.",
