And this way as well, you are at peace with yourself since you already know that you have someone who knows exactly what you know about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, and that if anything should happen to you, she will know how to manage all your crypto investments well just as you would have.",

It is impossible to tell when people will die. You can write down your seed phrases in your personal diary. Because if you die surely your family members can check the diary. You can do more, write in a diary and tell your family's trusted person about Bitcoin, that you are investing. It is better not to tell anyone the password/private key of the wallet. Tell your trusted person that you have written down all your investment information in this diary. You can keep the diary in a locker at your home. You can follow this method if you want. Many have given advice, many more will give advice, whatever you think is best for you, you will do it.",

Surely, you must have talked about it a number of times, even if in passing. So they must already have an inkling that you have Bitcoin. I'm even thinking that if you're vocal enough about Bitcoin, somebody in your family must have also been convinced about it and is into Bitcoin himself/herself. When you die, they will certainly go over what you've left, your notes and all, and they will find it.",

Everything you will do depends on your trust in your family members.

For me, I prefer to keep the seed for myself and I do not prefer to give it to my family because they may not be able to preserve it well because they do not have sufficient experience. Therefore, I sometimes think of writing the seed in a file and encrypting it with a strong password. I can give my wife the password and ask her to open the file after I die to recover the bitcoins in the wallet using the seed.",

The first choice which has already been giving by the first commenter which is about the use of locktime mechanism so your posterity can have access whenever you are gone unexpectedly.2. This second choice has to do with trust, which is a rare commodity. If you trust a family member so damn we'll be it your daughter or son and you wouldn't want them to wait for years due to a locktime after you're gone before having access  to your asset you can reveal your seed phrase to that very child. Reasons behind this choice is that my children don't have to be suffering facing financial hardship for the next 5 years or more after am long gone before they start enjoying my wealth depending on how many million blocks I set-up for my locktime encryption.",
