  "content": "Happenings around the world currently are making me feel that nobody is trustworthy. Some persons are very fortunate to have persons around them to whom they can entrust some valuables in their hands and they are guaranteed that those valuables are in safe hands. The world is gradually losing trustworthy and faithful men. Now you don't know who to reveal your financial and other secrets to because of fear of the negative consequences. Materialism and selfishness is now the key driver of people's actions and most people are ready to go the extra mile to become wealthy or become comfortable. Humanity has lost the virtues of pity, mercy, or compassion and has embraced pride, covetousness, and an unquenchable taste for money. I can across some of these stories and I am just imagining who one can trust. 1.   Mother encouraged his elder son to kill her younger son for money rituals  : A suspected internet fraudster confessed to security operatives that it was his mother that encouraged him to kill his younger brother for rituals that would make his fraud business prosper. He poisoned his brother and with the help of his mother they harvested the needed body parts that would be sent to the witch doctor for the rituals. He was arrested by security operatives during a stop-and-search operation.  2.   Woman killed and beheaded friend for money  : A devout Christian woman killed her friend and decapitated her body because she planned to forge her dead friends will. After killing her, she arranged a will document that leaves 95% of the deceased wealth to the killer. The killer wanted to repair her house and she knew that her friend had the money because they had a close relationship.3.   Man pushes son off a cliff to claim insurance  : A man was executed by the government because he staged an accident in a mine to enable him to receive compensation from the company. He murdered his son and planned to use the money to repay his debt and impress an extravagant woman he met online who always asked for money.4.  Wife accused of killing her husband for insurance money  : The accused hired an assassin to kill her husband because she wanted to claim insurance money. After the killing, the killer and the woman rearranged the crime scene to look like a robbery and the woman instructed the killer to remove the hard drive of the house CCTV, but she didn't know that the camera had a memory card as backup. The neighbors of the family testified that the couple had three daughters and it was a peaceful and loving home.5.   Husband kills wife for money:   A man shot his wife, locked the door, went to his office and later called the police informing them that his wife is in danger. He did this because he knew that his wife registered him as the nominee of her life insurance policy. He wanted people to believe that his wife was killed by thieves so that he can claim the life insurance benefit.Money was the root cause of all these crimes. For me, nobody knows about my financial status except my  wife. I think she is trustworthy. Do you have anyone you trust?",

      "body": "That's true trusting someone is extremely difficult now and you never know and you can never tell who'll cheat and deceive you. Sometimes your closest ones are the first one to cheat you as they know all your secrets,weaknesses and strength . They exactly know where to hit you , so trusting someone is not a good option in today's world.Everything and everyone is about money,personal motives, selfishness  and personal gains now, even blood relations are killing and murdering each other for sake of money. This is really unfortunate and sad but that's the reality.",

      "body": "The truth is that, ultimately, you cannot trust anyone. I was always quite an introverted person who hardly opened up to others. After having my trust broken quite a few times, with a few of those being extremely major offenses causing undescribable issues in my personal life, I find it extremely difficult to wholeheartedly trust someone again. Generally, I tend to be picky about the people I have in my life. I don't simply want to hang out with someone just for the sake of having someone to have a beer with, but to be able to express your opinions and feelings, to have someone understand you and have a proper conversation with. Trust me, I've had trouble finding the right people at my age (24).I'm currently living with my girlfriend, and I think I can trust her enough, and also hang out with a colleague who's one of the best friendships I've had so far, and he's quite older than me (37). It's sickening that all these articles you quoted are murders for the sake of acquiring money. Money should be a tool for a better and healthier life, not the ultimate goal. Unfortunately, such examples are a daily phenomenon.",

This is a personal experience, that my family is very harmonious and gets along at all times. All you need is a high tolerance.But people's circumstances are different. I can not say that the family is a person to be trusted. Sometimes some people hate their family for some reason, and eventually the family becomes an untrustworthy person.",

Just that one needs to use caution when disclosing information and protecting their privacy. Due to the widespread practice of ritual and societal passion for money, our world is evil. I wondered how we got here because everyone is afraid of the next man. It's very bad when family members don't trust one another. individuals who should be cooperating in order to accomplish a common objective.",

Imagine a mother could be so mean as to volunteer to aid in the death of her child just so she could live a life of comfort! So sad! Personally, I trust easily and tend to learn the hard way but after an incident which would have caused dire circumstances, I buckled up. Its funny that the people you call \"close friends and family\" are the ones who hit you the most. Well, it's normal, since whoever can hurt you is someone who has enough knowledge about you.",

You can be exploited if people find out that you easily trust. Trust is earned and even after it is earned, it still has to be under observation just like loyalty because it can be easily broken. I don't trust anyone so that dissapointment can be avoided, I also do not trust myself, because there are situations that can come and I cannot say exactly how I would react. So with that in mind, I have an image of how quickly someone can break my trust if they are pushed to it, or under pressure.",

It's quite unfortunate that the society we find ourselves in today is full of people who are not worthy to be trusted with anything because of who they have become. PS, I would suggest that the word trust be abolished because trusting people have made me do things I never wanted to do because I never knew that they will turn out to be betrayals and not trusted fellows. If a mother can take the life of his son in other for her other son to make money and a wife took the life of her husband because he trusted her with his bank details what else do we need to trust people for? I will only trust someone with my lips but I can't trust anyone with my secrets no matter who the person is to me.",

Trust shouldn't be considered a weakness because it actually a side of people being respectful, honest, and loving their fellow humans. You can't trust, someone, if you don't have respect for or love him/her.Nevertheless, there is a span for trust just like there's a span for love. There's mindful trust, slight trust, and blind trust. Lastly, trusting someone doesn't mean you don't have to be conscious.",

It's always shocking when a parent kills a child or a child kills a parent. There bond there should be above everything else. I'd never hurt my child, I'd rather take the hit myself. People who murder their own children must have lost basic instincts that are coded into our DNA. To answer the OP's question, I trust my wife because we've been together at times when we both had nothing and we've managed to support each other.
