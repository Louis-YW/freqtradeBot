Seriously do you intend to elicit discussion from this thread? If you do, so do you think the items that you will update daily will be followed up? Well I see more of disorganized thread if you are going to update news items here every single day and expect discussion and contribution.",

Most threads discusses betting in sports but if you are just posts news, not even related to upcoming matches to bet on its just not going to help. Every sports already has a thread here. I think will make more sense if you update those threads particularly and maybe they can figure what to do with the info you got.",

Most of the news I've shared were discussed on the respective boards. I've just combined it, someone who isn't much into sports related activities could get to know something happening in the sporting industry. If this isn't necessary anymore I would lock the thread based on the users interest.",
