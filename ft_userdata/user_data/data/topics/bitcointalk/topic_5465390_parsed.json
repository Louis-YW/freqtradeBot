I didn’t mention about any form of selling. Since you post thread on services section, This means that you are paying someone to do service for you or else you are just asking a survey which I suggested to move this on gambling discussion thread so that user that involves in gamblign will easily find your thread.Judging on how you take opinion here seems like you are very hard to deal with.
