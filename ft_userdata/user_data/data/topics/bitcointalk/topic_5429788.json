      "body": "1. How much does it cost to purchase a course?The price is significantly discounted, generally ranging from 80% to 95% off the original price. Due to some technical reasons, please email us to obtain a specific quote and course samples. Additionally, volume discounts are available if you purchase two or more courses per transaction. For more details on the purchasing procedure, please refer to question 8.** We also offer a price matching policy to ensure you receive the best value. If you find identical products at a lower price from eligible competitors, we'll match that price. Just provide proof of the competitor's price for further negotiations.2. Can I be assured that I will receive the courses I paid for?Absolutely. We stand by our promise to deliver the courses you paid for. Not delivering as promised would ruin our credibility and make our customers unhappy, which is not worth doing for this kind of \"special\" business.Additionally, we are active on the open BitcoinTalk forum, where all users are encouraged to share both positive and negative feedback. While we don't actively seek publicity from satisfied customers, our primary focus is on delivering quality service. If any negative feedback does arise, please be assured that we will promptly address it constructively to resolve any issues. We are proud to maintain an excellent track record with zero negative feedback from our customers.3. Are the course contents complete?The course materials are sourced directly from the original sellers by dedicated poker players, and they have paid serious money for the courses. These players tend to be quite thorough, striving to obtain comprehensive content. We have confidence in the quality and value these courses offer.4. Will I receive updates when the original course creator updates the course?Generally, poker course updates are rare because poker rules remain largely unchanged, and there are limited incentives for creators to update older courses. However, if updates do become available, they will be provided at no additional charge to previous purchasers. In exceptional cases where obtaining updates involves significant time and expenses, a small fee may be required.5. What format are the video courses in?The courses are provided in MP4 / FLV / TS video file format. We recommend VLC media player for playing video files in Windows 10 / 11. VLC is one of the most popular video players and it is also freeware.6. How will I receive the courses I purchased?We will provide you with a download link that will be valid for 7 days.7. What if I encounter problems with the courses I receive?We will promptly fix any issues you may encounter. In the rare case of a quality issue that cannot be quickly resolved, we will offer you two similar courses for free.8. How do I proceed with purchasing after completing a price inquiry and course sample request?Step 1: Email us the course list you'd like to purchase and the payment method you prefer.           ** Please note that providing your preferred payment method is necessary to generate an accurate invoice. However, this does                not obligate you to make the payment.Step 2: We will email you the invoice.Step 3: Make the payment.Step 4: Courses will be promptly delivered after the payment has been cleared.9. What is the course exchange procedure?Step 1: Email us a list of the courses you have and the ones you want from our list.           ** Please ensure that you have already obtained the courses and also verified that all the content is complete.Step 2: If we are interested in any of your courses, we will email you back to discuss further.           ** As long as the value of the courses you have and the courses you want are reasonably close, the exchange will proceed. If there               is a significant difference in value, or if you haven’t specified the courses you want, you will receive appropriate store credits which               can be used toward purchasing courses from our list. Step 3: Send us the courses we agreed to exchange.Step 4: Once we receive your courses, we will send you the ones you requested.10.
