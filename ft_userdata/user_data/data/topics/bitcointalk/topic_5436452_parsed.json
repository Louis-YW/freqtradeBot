  "content": "Hello,I guess I been scammed by a scammer who used a typical \"pickbuttering\" scam scheme (please correct me If I spell wrong). So, a scammer contacted me via Telegram asking to buy tokens because he can`t buy direclty from exchanges. First I was sceptical , but slowly he convinced me, so we agreed to make a deal. I sell him pancake tokens, he transfers me USDT. Then he reccomended P2PCoindex.com platform for this P2P payment, I check reviews on internet and found both positive and negative reviews. Website is here: https://p2pcoindex.com/      Then we tried small test transaction on P2Pcoindex and all went well (I guess this is how they work) and then we opened 2 trades for full amounts we agreed. After both trades been opened I been asked from P2Pcoindex.com Live support to pay various fees:1) First I paid transaction fees. Transfer had ot be made directly to their wallet adress (this was strange);2) Then after transactions been \"confirmed\" and time came to withdraw they said now I have to pay 3.5% withdrawal fee (this was never mentioned before). So I had no choise but to pay this...3) Then finally when I wanted to withdraw they said I have to pass KYC verification. OK, so I sent my Passport photo and selfie and they answered: \"We can`t identify your passport ID number\". I asked is it because of not good enough photo quality or other reason? Thyey did not answer just said now there is an option to pass KYC for me IF I pay 650 USD to them and my documents will be forwarded to UK (United Kingdom) National cyber cecurity centre (NCSC).Please advice me what to do now? I was scammed I guess?Thank you,",

Also, the domain is not even a year long and I already see people claiming it to be a clear scam in other forum. Sad that you fell for this.Quote from: Platonicus on January 23, 2023, 10:22:32 AMthere is an option to pass KYC for me IF I pay 650 USD to themJust, just dont do that. I hope you got a sensible mind and can understand the differences between right and wrong atleast. Which legit exchange asks money for a KYC?Quote from: Platonicus on January 23, 2023, 10:22:32 AMI was scammed I guess?Unfortunately yes, and you or we can do nothing about this now. The money is gone but if the scammer on tg gave you his bitcointalk userid, you can post here so he can get tagged!",

      "body": "100% SCAM.It seems that the other party that transacted with you is scammer or has a relationship with this scam site, do not send money to them and try to find out where they sent your coins, most scammers are lazy and send them directly to centralized platforms, if you are lucky enough you may be able to contact the support team and freeze their wallet.Currently, do not send any money to them, and try to convince them to sign a letter for you from an address with credit and collect more data about you.They have your IP address, a copy of your passport, a copy of the email you used and the password. If you have used that email or password on any site, it is better to change them immediately.",

I was scammed I guess?Thank you,Do not send them any money, this is a scam P2P platform, and after I reviewed their platform, it turned out that they put a stolen License for another platform on their site from Gov.UK, the number of the official P2P SERVICES LIMITED company is 09865631 and it is another platform and not this scam platform, In addition, the domain registrant's information is all fake and not real. The customer service team took a stock image from the Internet, and they are fake people. Also, this trick by the scammer who messaged you on Telegram is not new. Most scammers message people under the pretext that they cannot buy from the exchanges and they make some small transactions at first to make the victims feel reassured, then they trap them and send them a scam P2P platform that they may be a part of it to steal the funds of innocent people.[1] https://suite.endole.co.uk/insight/company/09865631-p2p-services-limited?page=overviewQuoteDomain name: p2pcoindex.comRegistry Domain ID: 2702676640_DOMAIN_COM-VRSNRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.namecheap.comRegistrar URL: http://www.namecheap.comUpdated Date: 0001-01-01T00:00:00.00ZCreation Date: 2022-06-09T23:27:23.00ZRegistrant Name: Redacted for PrivacyRegistrant Organization: Privacy service provided by Withheld for Privacy ehfRegistrant Street: Kalkofnsvegur 2 Registrant City: ReykjavikRegistrant State/Province: Capital RegionRegistrant Postal Code: 101Registrant Country: ISRegistrant Phone: +354.4212434",

As they are attracted by tempting offers, they prefer to keep everything confidential. But their thinking is the most effective for scammers, evidenced by the fact that the OP herself has fallen prey to scammers.",

Money comes and goes, and thank God he scammed you with this amount.Some may lose larger sums in trivial fraud, but you have to learn from the lesson and not cry over spilled milk.You still have a chance to track down the scammer if he leaves a trace, you can try to get more information that might lead to his discovery.The most important thing is that you have learned the lesson, and the money will inevitably be compensated.",
