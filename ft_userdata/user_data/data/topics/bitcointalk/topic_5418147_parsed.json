  "content": "Nigerian Flood VictimNigeria was flooded from the month of September 2022. The flood started from the Northern part of the country and the month of October 2022 the flood sank thousands of houses in the southern part of the country. Particular my home state (Bayelsa) which is highly affected more than any other parts in the country. Deeply AffectedSo as a flood victim in the forum, I am asking to know if it is wrong to ask for the support from the forum users. Or will the community go against if I asked for the support from the community in this situation? I am asking because I am deeply affected by the flood. I have lost properties, though I raised up  some of the properties because there was no vehicle movement to pack the things so I left them there, and lodged in a hotel and since no one was around in the compound, arm robbers came in and stole my valuable properties. As it is I am out of funds.High cost of LivingThe road that was connected the East and South has been broken into three parts so no fuel and food stuff comes in so the people who sells at the region increase the prices of goods and services x5. Fuel that was sold at the rate of $0.39 per litre is now $1.9 and fuel price determine any other goods prices in the country.https://floodlist.com/africa/nigeria-floods-bayelsa-october-2022My compound MeMy room the flood is going down now.",

As it is I am out of funds.of course, it's fine if you're looking for support here on the forum. Community means sticking together when trouble happens. the problem is that good intention to help someone are often misused, so a good part of the members have become a little distrustful when it comes to donations. I would suggest you, considering you are from Nigeria and as far as I can see, your local is quite active with several established members, you should start from there. Invite some other members from there to action, so try it together.You must be transparent with all of the donated money.Quote from: Agbe on October 24, 2022, 11:49:08 AMFuel that was sold at the rate of $0.39 per litre is now $1.9 and fuel price determine any other goods prices in the country.OMG, $39/l  To be honest, in Europe the price of fuel has been $2 or more for a long time.",

It is not wrong or forbidden to ask for help, although I would ask a question about what would be sufficient help for you? Given that you are in a sig campaign that pays you $220 a month max, are we talking about a few hundred $ or much more in the sense that it would change your current situation?An alternative is to ask for a loan from those who provide such possibility on the forum, although before that I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the rules before you ask for such a service.",

I didn't faced such worse scenario so I can't really or imagine the situation but I witnessed such natural calamities and people stuck in their house and many people even lost house due to floods and got the accomodation in the neighborhood.But people nearby who can helped by giving foods, accommodation, or anything if possible so together as community may help to survive anything then being fedup with the situation.Also don't forget this is public forum so you won't get much help and it can actually give bad impression so just don't give up because everyone is on their own.",
