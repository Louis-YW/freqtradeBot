Quit with the comparisons and suppositions that when USD crashes/the economy crashes bitcoin will be able to pick it up and rise in value. You can't suppose that especially when economic crashes happen and everyone is going to scrape the bottom of the barrel. People will sell everything they own, including bitcoin, if given the chance. So there's no reason for you to think that just cause USD's coming down it automatically means that bitcoin's going up. Just cause your neighbor lost their electricity cause they can't pay the power company doesn't mean that you'd get the power she's supposed to get.",

IMO the influence of the BRICS on the US dollar is greatly overestimated. The dedollarization is not happening anytime soon. The greatest enemy of the dollar is really the FED and stupid government policies like the covid lockdown and then stimulus. Leave the economy alone, let people trade - laissez faire FFS!It's not the war in Ukraine that's killing the dollar, not cryptocurrencies, not BRICS, not the Saudis, and not the global warming. It's the money printer that's doing it. QuoteAlthough it will not happen instantly as the US Government will bail out packages in order to maintain the dollar value, however, the question is for how long?That's it, the bailouts are killing it. They should companies to suffer consequences of taking too many loans. Instead, they think everything can be fixed with enough printing. Not anymore.Bitcoin is a strong and safe store of value. The only reason it reacts to the markets is because people who trade stocks also trade bitcoin and they treat it as one. Traders aren't the only ones investing in bitcoin though. If a big crash happens Traders will dump everything in the first stage of panic probably crashing some exchanges to the extremes, like in the Covid crash. Maybe even to 10k if we se S&P go below the 2022 lows and then below 3000, we could see bitcoin at 10-12k. I don't think that it will happen before the next bull run. The way I see it, US economy will go through a relief stage when the FED stops increasing rates and this will correlate with bitcoin's halving, presidential election and ETF approval. If there's a big crash coming it will come after that. Maybe in 2025?",

Although it will not happen instantly as the US Government will bail out packages in order to maintain the dollar value, however, the question is for how long?It was just a matter of two or three days ago when people were investing in US dollar instead of BTC because of good returns from it. Millions of market cap just vanished in few minutes. People were finding another source, proof is bond yield were increasing. Point is you said dedolarization seems obvious just due to BRICS or debt ceiling or high inflation etc. But tbh I think that will not happen because US dollar has huge market cap and huge solid base which can not be shook by such programs which do not even finished 50% even. Coming to economic crash then nothing is for sure that either BTC will reach to 1 Million dollar or not because it seems so fictional. Tbh, I pray that economic crash will not happen. Because even as a holder of BTC my life is highly connected to social and physical world if economic crash occured then it will not be a good thing for everyone the sentiments will change. Crime rates will increase.",

We will see.This could be the reason why most newcomers are advised to get Bitcoin now to take advantage of the price growth when that time comes.Some food for thoughts: The earliest adopters of Bitcoin didn't believe Bitcoin's price will get as high as $20K when they consider the 21M total supply and the zero interest in Bitcoin at the time. As the price goes higher, Bids will get thinner as the window to get good profits for each bitcoin get shortened. But since $100k and $1M are psychological levels, I won't be surprised if it reaches those levels and beyond. You don't need to buy $1M BTC, you can still get in sats denomination.",

Instead, the rich became richer, stocks have increased and the same goes for Bitcoin for which it is not a coincidence that the halving and pandemic did occurred on the same year. While we're expecting that the pandemic will do no good to Bitcoin, it was actually the opposite that happened. I know that someday that Bitcoin will reach $1M but yeah it could happen during a great crash of USD or when is inflation is on another level of its high. Global crisis could be the biggest factor why it will happen just as said. But you know that it's Robery Kiyosaki who's always been a bitcoin bull.",

I would lean more on the possibility of the crash as a result of the housing market bubble popping and the continuous money printing of the Federal Reserve but that don't mean that bitcoin is the ultimate safe haven asset because if US economy collapses, that's a major economy and it's going to lead to a market volatility that even bitcoin market will be affected because people are still scrambling on what to do which causes fluctuations as some will be buying because they want to safeguard their finances while others are selling because they have other obligations/responsibilities.",

But apart from these circumstances, there are other reasons that are more relevant and make sense if I look at them, namely because many countries are still trapped in bad debt. , especially in the midst of rising inflation and rising interest rates which gradually led to a financial collapse and the rest of the Federal Reserve was judged to have failed to deal with the inflation situation.And for BTC at this time the optimism of institutions and investors is getting stronger and Historically, we admit, the price of Bitcoin has always increased and happened gradually and that is a fact.
