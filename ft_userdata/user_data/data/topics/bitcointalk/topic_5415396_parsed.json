(NNPC) sparked controversy this week when he said thieves from all levels of society were stealing 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Mele Kyari even accused churches and mosques of keeping stolen fuel, an allegation religious groups rejected. Kyari addressed a weekly ministerial briefing in the presidential village on Tuesday and said up to 95% of Nigeria's oil produced at the Bonny Terminal was being stolen.Quote from: Don112 on September 29, 2022, 06:33:01 PMSOLUTIONSo your solution is basically to do the right things, how about you think first about what's preventing those and how to get rid of the blockage?Because 60 years of independence and half of the countries on that continent are going backward not stagnating or god forbid going forward.",

However, let's face it, at this point the continent is so dysfunctional and corrupt it is hard to see much of it becoming successful. The few successful areas tend to be within exclusive neighborhoods and inside gated communities that need constant security because they can border communities where there is absolute poverty. Unfortunately rich politicians stealing huge amounts of wealth and running away to live overseas seems to be an endemic problem to this continent, but maybe other countries could step up to stop them getting away with it so easily via the banking system.",

Organised and sustainable agriculture would be a useful place to grow from, and then growing industry once food and water stability have been reached throughout the continent or on a community based system.Young leadership is good as long as they're not too impressionable and have good supports with knowledge on how things can be implemented.A lot of countries have gotten where they are now because of failed attempts at socialism, China as an example is good proof of how a huge population can become wealthy and developed over a short period of time and the same dramatic change could likely be done elsewhere, it just isn't.",

Economies and job markets aren't doing the best at the moment. Due to the choices we've made and the things we have chosen to support. We can have anything we want in this world.

The change people need starts with themselves. Africa's major problem is greed and religion. We spiritualise virtually everything and this has made us believe it will take God to fix the country forgetting that every country we envy today is a product of their citizens making everything count. Good leadership is also a factor but i believe we need to reset our minds if we must embrace change and innovationI believe Africans are not like that but I can only see to their face that they are kind. It's also impossible for Africans to be greedy. How come when they are one of the weakest or the poorest? It's only sad that despite of their kindness they are not blessed as the other countries.There are those who have a good life but I don't think the wealth that they obtained can be called as a blessing because they only get it from taking advantage of others. It maybe true that each continent is equal because it's also said that god created everything to be equal but maybe some prefers to stay the same and they don't want to try more harder.

Yes, they are culprits because they aid most corrupt leaders to keep stolen funds in Western banks. We have seen western multinationals engage in so many shape practices that have affected the economy of Africa. Issues like giving bribes for contracts, tax invasion, and environmental degradation due to oil exploration have been affecting Africa negatively. I also see it as the highest form of irresponsibility to blame the West for Africa's underdevelopment. Africa's greatest challenge is nothing but poor leadership. Africa has leaders whose only agenda is to steal from the people. They make the people poor so that they can buy their votes with peanuts during elections. Even South Africa which has been Africa's shinning light is not declining both politically and economically. Africa is blessed with a very youthful population but most of them are not educated. Africa has the highest number of out-of-school children and there would be no development without a skillful population. The government has failed to invest in education at all levels and this has led to a high rate of crime.",

Because after all the contribution of the West can also have a good impact as long as we take advantage of what is really needed and do not give excessive freedom when the West helps in economic growth. Such as requiring western technology and knowledge resources to encourage the banking industry, distributor management and all of that must be under the control of a legitimate government.

But the fact is that at this time it is not working as it should. Corruption is caused by the government's dissatisfaction in getting the budget, it is unavoidable that every country will have corruption cases if they do not unite their common goals in building the country's economy. Most of the corruptors prioritize personal interests above the interests of the people who should be prosperous with large sources of wealth.Currencies don't always weaken, but will slowly become worthless if they can't generate land taxes to pay off the bloated debt.",
