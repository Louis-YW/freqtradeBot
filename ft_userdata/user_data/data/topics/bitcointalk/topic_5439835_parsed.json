Your question doesn't make sense. Take note that it's not possible to have a decentralized stable coin at all. If bitcoin price was stable, it could no longer be decentralized and would be something like tether. For making the price of a coin stable, someone (or a company) must have full control over that.",

The government and the banks really puts a lot of pressure on the people and impose unnecessary taxes in the name of development of the nation. This is the reason for which many people don’t want to give away their hard earned money in the form of tax and hence they look for decentralised way of managing their finances. Bitcoins provide this and hence many people use the coin. Bitcoins price cannot be fixed, if it is no more decentralised. To make the price stable, some governing body needs to manage it, and here it cannot be possible.",

Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of volatility in the Bitcoin price is an important factor to maintain interest and investment interest in the long term.High volatility and price fluctuations in Bitcoin can provide benefits for traders who can take advantage of market trends and buy at low prices and sell at high prices.

An example of this is stablecoins, but no one invests in USDT unless it saves the value of another investment, and so on.As for the answer to your question, as long as there is interest in something, people will continue to use it, and assuming that the price of bitcoin will be stable, people will probably continue to use it due to the cheap fees compared to other methods.Volatility is good for those who want to trade, the increase in value in the long term is what distinguishes Bitcoin more than volatility.",

Most of the persons are in the crypto because it has to offer the decentralized feature and you can control your holdings without a paperwork and no questions asked. As far as my concerns, I am here to enjoy all the benefits of this. Since use of bitcoin I have been able to transfer the funds overseas to my family without any problem. I hardly do transfers via bank now. Whenever I used to do it via bank, you had to give justification about it. Plus, depending n the size of transaction I also had to let them know the \"Purpose\" of my transaction. You know for example, if my transaction is above 1K USD then they would start asking questions. On the other hand, it may happen they would block some transactions for tele verifications. Very common practice when you send money from USA to Asian countries. Probably the transaction would go on hold for 48-72 business hours. Used to be horrible experience in the emergency cases. Now imagine how happy I am when sending the same transactions with the bitcoin? Just grab the wallet, put my passcode, clipboard the address and send with low fees. Literally happens with my finger tips and nobody ever knows about it.  I would care less about the bitcoin volatility if I have this much freedom from it.",

And yes, people will still use it, for both transactions (payments) and as store of value.Now there's a huge inflation around the world and afaik the banks started offering some interest for the deposits, which pay for their fees and maybe more too. But some years ago, when the inflation was much lower, we've reached the point one person could deposit his money to banks and then pay some more as fees. And inflation was still eroding the value of those money.So Bitcoin has its very good use even if it doesn't make (many of) its investors rich.For me? Yes, it would still be my favorite. Bitcoin allows me know that my money is really mine. Bitcoin allows me get paid for this or that side jobs without caring about my employer's identity. Sadly in my area I can't buy much with Bitcoin, but maybe we'll get there too soon enough.",

And people won't see a reason to buy Bitcoin if there were no Volatility from day one. If by no volatility you mean no more increase & decrease in price that will probably mean no sign of life. What we should be talking about is moderate volatility that occurs most times (or moderate fluctuation with occasional massive fluctuations) rather than zero volatility/fluctuation because there will always be fluctuations in the price just like there is also fluctuations/volatility in fiat currencies like dollar.Bitcoin price will always fluctuate, especially upward, and this will help make it a good Store of Value which means your investment would be inflation resistance long-term... and this is one of the main reason Bitcoin is deflationary. Trying to keep it stable (which they can't achieve)  can weaken the security and usefulness of Bitcoin. All the Bitcoin principles combined makes Bitcoin secure and attractive.",

This is due to the current trend of holding onto Bitcoin, which hinders mass adoption. To promote the use of Bitcoin, it is important to encourage its acceptance by merchants and raise awareness among traders. While there are services that enable Bitcoin payments, it would be beneficial to also facilitate the conversion of Bitcoin into fiat currency for merchants.",

That is the beauty of the bitcoin. If it should be stable then there would be no more value attached to it. The volatilities makes it unique and different from others. The ups and downs makes it real. Actually, like I have always said and most comments here too says that the initial plans of Satoshi Nakamoto was to make bitcoin equivalent fiat in a digital way but the early adopters sold too early to the whales and they took over bitcoin and started the investment mentality which made this new generation think bitcoin is an investment option. Since then the idea has been bitcoin investment so far and that has been the game but I believe it would get to a time when everyone individual will be in possession of bitcoin and on daily basis, everyone would be trading on bitcoin which means that bitcoin has been globally recognized and adopted as an alternative digital currency then the mentality of bitcoin as an investment would definitely be done with.",

Ignoring the flaws of this exercise and answering the question frankly...  I would probably hold about 1/10,000th as much BTC if it were pegged to some specific USD value.  Sure, I'd still want some for trading over the internet, but as an investment, no way.  It would be worthless.  One of the things that initially attracted me to Bitcoin was it's low valuation for the solutions it offered.  If there was no value angle, I likely wouldn't have learned enough about it to know how it could change the world.  I think it's Bitcoin dressed up as a get rich quick scheme that enabled it to be so powerful as a disruptor in the financial space.",

Before the volatility stepped in, I can't say for sure if people bought bitcoin but, there were those who still picked interest for the fact that, it was a currency to serve a digital purpose of paying for transactions.The original intent of Satoshi was to have it serve as a currency and that has not yet been taken completely from bitcoin. Bitcoin still has its currency purpose though impeded but, will come to light some day and its other advantages such as, having payments on transactions sent across the globe and advantages of decentralisation come to lame light.People won't lose sight if what is important and would see the need to buy or accept for a means of payment.",
