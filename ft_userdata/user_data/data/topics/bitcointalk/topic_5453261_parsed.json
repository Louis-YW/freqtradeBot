Please assist with good response.You can't use your trading strategy in forex to Bitcoin immediately, you have to backtest your setup when it's your first time in that pair. You have to bear in mind that each currency pair has different market habits andÂ  volatility. Some traders use different strat when they want to trade crypto, and I also notice with my batch mate that he only scalping in forex, maybe that's the best trading technique in forex. But in crypto, swing trading is also best. If you want to trade Bitcoin, I recommend Binance since this is the best trading exchange out there.",

A trader can not prefer to trade stable coin for a stable coin to make profit, that is even not possible for profit making, traders trade unstable and stable coins pair.If you are on a spot market, you will prefer to trade BTC/USDT pair. Also if you are on a future trading market, you will prefer to trade BTCUSDT. Even if you go for Coin-Margin which is the one that is different, that does not mean that it is not risky like others mentioned too. But spot trading is not as risky as future trading.Another thing is that a trader can have the knowledge about market, indicators, charts and others, but how the profit is calculated using pips and lots in forex is not the same as crypto trading which requires little and easy calculations. Not that the calculation in forex is difficult too though.",

Please assist with good response.Forex and Bitcoin are different things, the indicators that work with forex might not work with Bitcoin due to its volatility. The forex market is far less volatile than crypto market and that's why many forex traders face losses when they start crypto trading. The crypto market is the most volatile market in the world and anyone who's unware of its volatility should first learn about it before starting trading.Although, the parameters of your indicators might not work for crypto, but the indicators are still same, once you learn to modify the parameters in a working way and develop a good strategy then you will have a good time trading Bitcoin. Basically the technical indicators are same for crypto and forex, Â you only need to set some good parameters and winning strategy to take advantage of the volatility of the market.You can try some good crypto exchanges as they offer valuable services and the option to set and modify the indicators. You'll learn the market if you devote some time to it, instead of executing the trades in the start it's better to learn and master the volatility of the market, and once you reach a good level of understanding then execute your trades.",

Dont use forex apps for bitcoin trading. Use an exchange app like KuCoin or others as supported by you local community and in your country. Again dont look at signals, they are mostly fake picks done by malevolent people trying to make money off your panic situation. Listen to those and you will lose your money.You should first visit your local country section of this forum and see what app they use and then create an account there/pass KYC so you can start trading right away. Learn trading from articles on the internet and youtube and start with dummy trading first. Never trust the words of any person on the net, learn the methods on your own and decide on your own to buy and sell.",

Because there are lot of pseudo trading apps available on Play Store and app market which claims that you can make money and all you need to do is to predict the future movement.I consider spot trading is the real trading where you buy a crypto on an exchange let's say Binance and wait until it rise then you sell it so at the end you made profits and this is how the trading works and just learn basics about trading before jumping into it.",
