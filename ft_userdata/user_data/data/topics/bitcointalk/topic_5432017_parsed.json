      "body": "You are welcome onboard the bitcointalk platform. As  you can see your account is a new bie. This makes me believe some organization disguise themselves coming onboard this platform to promote their products by raising up chats to attract the attention of participants.  I see this is more of an advertisement than just to win bonus promo. With such an account, you can not be able to upload graphics for proper view because that will explain your casino and passes across information about your casino. So therefore, I would advise you register a copper member account so you could be able to upload some pictorial contents which would be more attractive to participants on this forum. And lastly, I searched to see if you already have an existing presence here but non which will give you a difficult time promoting and also gaining the attention of participants to patronize your casino because most casinos with large volume of participants are all recognized here so I would also advise that you do a signature campaign for  atleast  two months engaging a good signature campaign manager who will promote your casino campaign very well with good management skills.",

I mean, if we want to unlock the full bonus we need to wager 500*500=$250,000, and wagering that amount with a $500 depo is just impossible.

This is kinda like expert options or any similar price prediction platform but for crypto. Although, the entire platform does look newly built (lack of community/followers on social media), you guys claim you already have 4k+ active players and rewarded 10m+? When exactly did this platform started?What I would like to see implemented would be the integration and log-in through hotwallet since you said you have partnership with one of them (metamask). If done properly that would make your platform semi-decentralized. Also, if KYC is optional, I think it's best to make it easy for new users to sign-up by removing the need to include your phone number.",

The concept of the game Predict888.com is certainly original and I think it will find interested users who are regularly engaged in trading, by the way there is a mobile game Blitzionare, but there is just trading for a decrease or increase in real time and for a short period, and Predict888.com offers a more advanced option.",
