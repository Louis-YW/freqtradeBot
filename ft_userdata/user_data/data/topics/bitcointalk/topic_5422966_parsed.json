Maybe buy what you want directly there so that you will not worry about huge fees of bitcoin or get hassle with xrp and doge. Although I never used this feature but you can test out or maybe ask a guidance to their support on how you can execute this since provably this one could help you save up some fees.",

I agree 100%!Holding your Bitcoin on a third party wallet is never a good move, if avoidable. A third party wallet can be an exchange or even a casino. It really does not matter which platform it is on as long as its not in your own wallet, its not really YOUR Bitcoin. Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins. Although having said that, I do suppose the risk goes way way down of anything happening to your coins in a third partys wallet if the third party is reputable and has proven itself to be very trustworthy through the years.",

      "body": "If you want to hold BTC, then keep it in your own wallet. If you send a doge to a casino to exchange bitcoins, I'm quite confused why you are doing this way? If you really want to hold, can't you just use the Fiat-BTC exchange and send your BTC to your wallet. Are you thinking about fees? Whereas in casinos generally every deposit requires TO before being able to withdraw money. If it is not controlled, of course, before reaching TO, the money may run out.Well, try to use BK8, there is an options to withdraw BTC without fees, but maybe you will find a different rates from BK8 and exchange price. At least, you can get free trx fees from there. About deposit, only 3 options for crypto so far, with USDT, ETH and BTC. you can request withdrawal after 1x TO from your deposit.",

I usually purchase crypto using fiat on exchange.To be honest, I did not quite understand the meaning of your actions. Do you use cryptocurrencies with cheap deposit fees, then bet to win back the amount of fees, then you use a casino exchange to transfer funds to bitcoin and withdraw money to another casino? Did I understand everything correctly? In my opinion, this scheme looks unnecessarily complicated and unreliable. Firstly, your bets may turn out to be unsuccessful, and secondly, some risks may be realized at each stage of the execution of this algorithm, even at the final one - not your keys, not your bitcoins. I think it's better to pay fees and keep bitcoin in your own wallet.",

I'd say casinos have more higher chance to collapse rather than centralized exchange because I've seen so many casinos get abandoned and hacked, it will become a dead casino. Are you want to risk all of your funds just to save few dollars? it's similar like how many people want to stake their coins for few percent of interest and take a risk to lose all of their coins.",

I do regular bet on casino whenever I like to kill time and at the same time hold Bitcoin. I only hold what I can afford to lose and I’m not an addicted gambler that’s why I can control all my bet in the casino.Indeed, OP, your action is not only complicated, but risky too. Holding a chunk of money on Casinos have multiple downsides, like getting restricted for abusing their TOS. Some Casinos have got complicated rules and it'll surprise you to know that if by some reasons whatsoever, you stop playing games on that casino for a certain period of time they'll ban your account and the funds will be history. As it'll be linked to their doormant account rule. Unlike wallets no matter how long, your money will be there always under your own control. Always play safe.",
