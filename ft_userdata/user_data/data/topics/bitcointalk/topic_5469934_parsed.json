  "content": "It's a common saying that hard-work and consistency pays and that is the story of Gracy (The Managing Director of Bitget) as she bagged an appointment into the Forbes Business Council.It is important to note that the Forbes Business Council is one of the leading and respected organization globally and members are selected for the council based on the depth and diversity of experience in leadership, management, customer engagement, technology and growth.Her appointment is significant because it will further solidify and position crypto in a good light which of course it's expected to have a positive ripple effect on mass adoption. Her extensive experience and expertise will be invaluable assets to councils discussions on key issues like; Decentralized Finance, blockchain innovation and diversity in technology which will put crypto in spotlight and while perhaps highlighting and establishing ethical standard and best practices in the ever evolving industry.With the opportunity available to members of the elite business communities which includes; Connections, visibility and growth, I'm optimistic this development will bring about a more positive landscape in the crypto world.Do you share the same sentiment or not?",

Media companies have their way of spinning things up, mostly sharing the side of the stories they want us to hear.Â  But I've checked out Gracy's background inputs in contributing to Bitget Exchange's growth and by extension, the Blockchain Cryptocurrency space. Moving from being a TV host to an investor in Bitcoin in 2014 as claimed in her video I saw, to co-founding 2 fintech starts up. Her experience in market expansion & corporate Development displayed daily in her key responsibility in Bitget which has made the CEX to move from where it was before she joined to the top 5. futures trading platform and top 10 spot trading Cryptocurrencies Exchange. These could place her as a perfect candidate for such an appointment or we wait to have the caterion for appointment, right?",

I'm not dissing anyone who gets promoted, and I think nothing wrong with Bitget or Gracy but anybody who paid attention in crypto space since years can know that there's nothing special about Forbes.I can't see honestly why this is a win. It's a normal everyday life. Forbes is not exactly A grade, it's regular grade business company that accepts payment to say stuff for rich people.",

Forbes is not exactly A grade, it's regular grade business company that accepts payment to say stuff for rich people.In my honest opinion, I think more people needs to hear about crypto from top companies like Forbes. Forbes may not be perfect but certainly one of the highest rated when it comes to information dissemination. Imagine the face of CZ and GC in the front cover of Forbes magazine. This will certainly enhance adoption and bring more people to the space. Remember when more people knows about crypto and are willing to accept it (Am not talking about trading) then it gonna be the beginning of revolution in the financial institution which is obviously going to be a win for crypto.",

Forbes is for sure very highly rated but it accepts payment to publish literally anything you want.A good top-rated source researches even paid articles to make sure they're not promoting scams, which happens a hell lot in Forbes.Cover and lists of Forbes is paid. You want to know famous scammers before they get caught? Read Forbes list. Proof:https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/06/forbes-30-under-30-tech-finance-prison",

These organizations are looking for profits, and whenever there is a possibility of obtaining profits, they will invest their money. As for introducing Bitcoin, everyone who has authority and investments knows about Bitcoin and will not. Another investor's opinions change his investment convictions, but whenever he finds a safe and possible way to obtain profits from Bitcoin, he will act, and this may happen either with an increase in the market capacity for Bitcoin or the approval of an ETF.",
