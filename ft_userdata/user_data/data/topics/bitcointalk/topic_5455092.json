      "body": "Was typing a reply before the thread was locked and later deleted.. will drop the reply below am sure the user will see this thread. QuoteLike you want me to go to this website and claim free Bitcoin worth $2200+ just for free, and this offer is valid for 50 people online, which is about $112,000+ total, that's what you want to give out for free... This lie is too good to be true. Even without going into the site, I can explain how all this will work. If you want someone to create an account on one of your broker sites that has no real users or real-time money on it, then the person will have to use the promo code, which will immediately deposit the audio funds into the user's account. When you try to withdraw the funds, your system will request a withdrawal fee, which the user will have to pay. So that they can be able to withdraw, which, in a normal sense, is meant to be deducted from the withdrawing balance provided they are off the same network. This kind of scam is old-fashioned.  Newbies should all just be careful with anything they see online, and one thing that can make one fall victim to such a scam is if the person is very greedy and eager to make money. If not, it is very obvious that the entire thing is a pure scam that could easily be identified and avoided.",

Your comments remind me of how children behave. One of the ways to push children away from harmful objects is not to expose them to the object. If you show them such an object and warn them not to touch it, they will be tempted to check why you told them not to touch it. Deleting the quote is essential because members might want to try the platform.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on June 05, 2023, 10:24:49 AMThis type of scam has been on going in the forum for 4 years or even more.

I will leave a tag just in case the come back and post.When the projected profit from an investment becomes too high, one needs to be careful. When a site or crypto firm is offering free money, people need to be more than careful. The economy is hard during this period so even a dollar now is precious, so losing a dollar now will be very painful. Thank you, OP for sharing this important message, because greed and misinformation will always attract some members to these crypto platforms.",

In fact, it's probably one of the oldest tricks in the book. He has created a fake exchange. Once you register an account and apply the coupon code, a fake balance will be displayed in your account. You will think you have bitcoins, and try to withdraw them. That's where the actual scam begins. The site will ask you to deposit a certain amount for \"security reasons\", \"network fees\", \"verification\" or whatever else they have come up with in the meantime. Since greed is sometimes stronger than logic, some people will deposit the asked amount and that's the amount they will get scammed for. On top of that, there is the threat of identity theft if you submit any documents to the site for KYC verification.",
