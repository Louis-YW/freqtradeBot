What would we call people who go against this rule? Gamblers? High-risk takers, or just plain stupid. I'll bet on Bitcoin. Would you?Putting all your money into one thing is never advisable, even if the thing is not Bitcoin. It's always advisable for someone not to have overconfidence to the extent that it could lead to that person's foolishness. Putting all your hard-earned cash and investment into Bitcoin means you have handed over your life to Bitcoin, as your blood pressure will now be regulated by how the price of Bitcoin goes up or down. Anytime you see a great deal in the market, the doctor will have to be called, or you will have your Prinivil and Zestril in your hands all the time .",

What would we call people who go against this rule? Gamblers? High-risk takers, or just plain stupid. I'll bet on Bitcoin. Would you?Anyone who already knows the rules and has also read the experiences of others but decides to put all of his money into Bitcoin is only acting on their own choice, and you would not tell them how to spend their money; perhaps they have already read the rules, so let them be at risk for every result they get from their actions. It has been discussed several times that one should not put all their funds into Bitcoin unless they have better plans for other sources of income; otherwise, the person cannot hold their coin for a long time to earn profit. I think Anyone who is not following the rules is either relying on other sources of income or perhaps they have already made the agreement to sell off as soon as they have any arising need for money. So, my point is that whoever chooses that part already knows what they are in for.",

I quite agree with this take. The Bitcoin Core software has been around for quite enough time already to probably exit the “beta” phase, but Bitcoin’s current age is still quite young to exit the “experimental” phase knowing how ambitious of an experiment Bitcoin is.",

But this is just investment advice for everyone. Of course, I have total confidence in Bitcoin as an investment, but it is always better to play by the rules. Investing what you can afford to lose is the rule of the game. But if you are a high-risk taker, you can be lucky to earn more but you can also lose all.

Last year the Central African Republic parliament made a law reversing the statute that made Bitcoin a legal tender in the country. So bitcoin is not a legal tender in CAR for now.",
