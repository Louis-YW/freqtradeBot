  "content": "What happened:: Hi everyone. I don't mean to look impatient here what so ever but I have been an avid gambler recently at Rollbit. I've lost around $40K+ USD the past week playing on the site. While losing the money I just mentioned, I had withdrew $4k to keep some into my wallet as I gambled the rest. I was gambling on evolution baccarat. I withdrew $4k, was pending, then turned into Contact Support. This is a common thing but it usually goes through very rapidly afterwards. I check later, still on contact support, next day it's still on contact support. I ask support why it's still pending. They give me bland responses like \"We have No ETA to when the withdraw will come in\" or something like \"We are waiting on the provider to reach back to us.\" Now, why would the evolution (i assume they mean evolution as the provider) to let the withdraw go through when I had withdrew $20k everyday right before. I obviously didn't cheat and I just played legitimately and withdrew some balance. They keep giving me these bland responses. It's been a week since I had withdrew and it's still gotten absolutely no where. I'd like the withdraw approved as I've never had this issue on stake as well.Scammers Profile Link: RollbitReference Link: Rollbit.comAmount Scammed: $4000Payment Method: EthereumProof of Payment: https://i.imgur.com/XKc7ZuV.pngPM/Chat Logs: https://i.imgur.com/bhrdzbE.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/d5xG7mp.pngAdditional Notes: Edit: Resolved, ty everyone for the help!!",

      "body": "I understand correctly from this image that you did another withdrawal after the pending one, amounted $101, and it went through, while the $4,000 isn't? And all that you play is baccarat? If I may give it a guess, maybe your multiple withdrawal in a day --and quite significant amount too-- trigged their system and they're sorting this out. 7 days+ before today will place the withdrawal on 19th, the same day with your other two withdrawals. But this is a lot of assumption from me, and it'll be better to hear from rollbit themselves.I am notifying Rollbit Razer about this, but it might take him some time to notice my PM. Please update us if there's any development from your side while we're waiting for Razer.",

I guess they are reviewing his game history for the said provider for the potential suspicious activity because the casino will just mention their own security team if the problem is with that multiple withdrawals instead of the game provider that reviewing his agame logs.@OP. This is not worthy for scam accusation because the support provide you a valid reason for the delay of your withdrawal.",

Am glad to hear OP's issue has been resolved and the he can now withdraw his money plus the bonus you gave him as a goodwill gesture.I don't want to spread bad vibes but you said \"we dropped the ball in this one\" am interested to know why this hasn't been fixed as soon as OP has informed your customer agent about the issue! Didn't he (the agent) report it to you? What if OP didn't know about bitcointalk and didn't create this thread? I believe he would have to wait for much longer.Again, am not trying to spread negativity or anything like that, I just want to understand how things work on the back end especially with customer service.",

It looks like an agent who didn't know the job to do. To be honest, It can get pretty annoying. Once in a while I bump into such customer service agents and at certain points I start thinking that they are even very under qualified for the job. Their responses usually don't help at all and when you ask for the expected time they think the issue could be resolved, they just end up giving you a reply similar to that done by chatbotsI hope Rollbit try to improve on how customer support interact with players, and the answers should be direct and transparent. I can only imagine how long OP would have to wait if Rollbit Razer was not notified.",

      "body": "Quote from: Rollbit Razer on June 25, 2023, 06:56:56 PMHey ultrathegoat,[...]Thanks,RazerThank you for your very prompt reply and swift action addressing this issue once it came to your awareness. If I may add and be blunt, I have to agree with khaled 0111 and JeromeTash, one thing that bugged my mind when I first read OP's screenshot was that your customer service department could have been nicer to their... well, customers. Granted, we only saw snippets of it, so we don't know the full context and the flows of their discussion, but this whole situation can be at least minimalized if the customer service handled it a bit nicer.Moving up, I understand that the situation is an interdepartmental miscommunication? Your security team missed the reply from the provider and your customer service department didn't escalate OP's case to the security team? I believe Rollbit can learn a thing or two from this issue.That said, for OP, if you can confirm that you've received the withdrawal --as well as the bonus-- and don't have more things to add, it'll be nice if you can edit the thread title and marked it as solved and lock the topic. The button for locking this thread is at the bottom left of the page, while you can mark it as solved simply by adding \"solved\" or the likes on the title through editing your first post.",
