  "content": "It was after Donald Trump first publicly announced his interest in Bitcoin and other crypto coins during his presidential campaign last year, that the price began to surge high. As the time he made that publication in July 2024, Bitcoin price was less $70k but later later moved to a little above $109k January this year after he was sworn in as the president of the US. On Sunday, he announced the creation of a US Crypto Strategic Reserve which Bitcoin and other few coins are part of the project. I strongly believe that when this is finally implemented, it'll have a major positive effect on Bitcoin price which is likely to make it go higher than the current ATH and that's where my question comes in. How can we as Bitcoiners and the crypto community position ourselves to make the best out of this latest development that's about to hit the market?https://x.com/Vivek4real_/status/1896391535568244874?t=w68v7SMaEOUGVtEAM189IQ&s=19",

How can we as Bitcoiners and the crypto community position ourselves to make the best out of this latest development that's about to hit the marketYou can not control the market, can not control news and if you plan your investment or trading with uncontrollable news, you will lose money easily. Especially if your plan is purely trading that is more risky than investment and more vulnerable with news than investment.This won't help you by chasing news as it firstly affects your emotion in short term that can cause fear, uncertainty and panic sell, and in long term it can result in psyschology issues as well. The more news you read, the more psychological effects you will get in long term and you will more likely have bad and worse and worse decisions in trading and investment.With trading, panic sell is not worst as if you trade with leverage your leveraged positions can be liquidated.",

It has always been the case that if you owned Bitcoin while it continues to mature, you have won in the long (4+ year) run. There's nothing you need to do if you own Bitcoin.

Your emotion and decisions will be up and down with his posts on X, it's not good too.Trump can flip his words very quickly and after you panic sell, Bitcoin can pump when he flips his words. Bitcoin is strong and won't be killed by Trump so don't let his words make you panic. The best way for avoiding panic is don't follow his account on X and his posts on X. Purchase bitcoin, store it in your non custodial wallet, and ignore news from Trump as most as possible, to hold your bitcoin strongly and like your plan, you will get profit in this cycle or next ones. If you plan to hold your coin in this cycle only, make sure to have good exit plan within 2025 year.",

Although it happens in the short term, this makes traders worry about pump and dump when they are not looking at the market or the latest news about the crypto world.But there is no need to worry if you are investing for the long term, over time Bitcoin will gradually rise, because its adoption is getting wider and starting to be recognized in large institutions. but if you are a short-term trader such as scalping, day trading, you should be careful, the market is very volatile lately.",

We just have to buy, wait and watch, but if cycle breaks then things might get ugly because no one reall knows what is next, maybe we can see a election cycle.",

Then wait for good news from them to take profit, that's easy.",

The crypto market is large and so he interests is solely for himself and his inner members benefits. It's known US has the world power, so it's traction to entertaining the usage of crypto will certainly bring much demands within US and the world, that's what will cause the price surge higher but not instant but in consistent demanding.",

What you should do during this period of uncertainty is to stick to the general principles of holding, go long term and DCA when you have the opportunity to do that, sell when your profit target his reach and do not ride on news they are just short term influence and nothing more",
