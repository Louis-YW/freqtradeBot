  "content": "Bitcoin is a QT, Bitcoin is art.As any piece of art, its beauty gets brighter and greater as you understand it. Unlike many contemporary art examples, Bitcoin's beauty can be experienced by most people. That's the main goal of its decentralized character. Bitcoin is art because the process of understanding it is entirely subjective, and it goes through several layers. This layers are only to be discovered if you are able to surrender your ego, and decide to submerge deep into the rabbit hole. Its surface traps you with your own greed being reflected, so at first you could see it as a speculative asset, or simply as magic internet money. But it is just a thin layer of what Bitcoin is underneath.Each new cicle Bitcoin has successfully proven that its value is real. Understanding this, requires the observer to question what is value, what is money, and how our system works. No art piece before Bitcoin have achieved this level of self reflection and awareness in a more effective and decentralized way. But there is more, as value is just one of those layers you could see if you decide to understand Bitcoin. When most people get to understand the layer of value, Bitcoin is already unveiling how it could be the solution for other problems that many though unsolvable.Since genesis block there were keys hidden into those other problems that Bitcoin could fix:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FepmTreWYAY6Pao?format=jpg&name=4096x4096There is a correlation between economic crisis and wars. War has been though as a escape, as a perfect smokescreen, but each war only further deepens the hole. Bitcoin doesn't like war, as its price action has proven each time they succumb to their madness. Bitcoin is art because when you as a Bitcoiner realice this fact, you can't no longer be in support of war as it will affect your bags and your wealth. Bitcoin means of expression is through truth, and truth is tough. But again, this chicken and egg situation between war and economic crisis is just another layer, and the rabbit hole goes way deeper.  Bitcoin is art because when you get to the point of understanding all this, you'll ask yourself if Bitcoin is some kind of magic; If it was created by aliens, or by an artificial intelligence. But the only real and logical explanation is that it was created by an artist. Bitcoin is such a powerful Graffiti on the central banks walls, that the artist haven't had the need to speak for years, as this art piece is strong from within, and it speaks loud and with eloquence.Bitcoin's expressiveness reach is now knocking on climate change doors, presenting itself and standing as a solution for the most crucial problem in humanity's history. All this, while most of Bitcoiners haven't even recognize it as a problem yet, Bitcoin is already solving it. But proposing itself as a solution for climate change is just another layer.Bitcoin is an ever evolving powerful work of art without any aesthetic limitations on what it can accomplish. The most ambitious and powerful global graffiti timechain.  Bitcoin is freedom. Art is freedom.Bitcoin is art.",

No Narratives needed for it to be a currency nor an art piece. Although this definition runs short as what art is: \"creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.\" Bitcoin is a minimalist code which is speech. A Creative speech. a technically proficient code. A beautiful code for a currency. A code So powerfully filled with conceptual ideas, that evokes all sort of emotions. Bitcoin is Art because some perceive it just as a digital currency. Some others as a store of value. Bitcoin is art because those who are against it because of their own fears, subjectively perceive it as a ponzi, and when their paranoia exceeds rationality, they even feel Bitcoin as a weapon. This is why Bitcoin is art.",
