  "content": "While this may not be as big of a deal as it seems, since this is the first time that the US supreme court rules on a case involving cryptocurrency, it's probably worth taking note. Coinbase winning a legal battle in no less than the supreme court and against the lower courts in California will have significant implications. For a brief backgrounder, Coinbase faced a couple of cases in California involving a user who lost money and \"deceptive advertising.\" Coinbase, then, argued that the cases be dismissed because it's part of the signed user agreement that such complaints be settled through arbitration. The request for arbitration was denied. Coinbase then appealed and requested that while the appeal is in progress the case proceedings be stopped. Once again, California’s district courts decided against Coinbase.Coinbase ran to the supreme court. There, with a close 5-4 decision, Coinbase prevailed over the California district court's decisions.Sources:1. https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-supreme-court-halts-coinbase-cases-first-crypto-ruling2. https://blockworks.co/news/coinbase-supreme-court-victory",

      "body": "Any special reason why you have posted the thread here and not in the Legal section? Here it is supposed to get more exposure but being a bit technical I think it will soon be buried below many other threads that are easier to answer. Going to the topic: as I understand it, the issue is that there is an arbitration system enabled to resolve disputes between customers and Coinbase and what the Supreme Court ruled is that the judicial actions have to wait for the arbitration verdict. If the customers act as plaintiffs and do not like the outcome of the arbitration they can file a lawsuit but later. Arbitration is cheaper for companies than going to court, and as it is a preliminary step, I understand that if a certain percentage of customers see that they lose, they will think long and hard before going to court and possibly losing more money. At first glance, it does not seem so important, except for what you read at the end of the first article:QuoteThe court’s decision affords Coinbase the same legal treatment typically given to all companies under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act of 1925.",

Well, i do not think so, that winning this case will make any impact on the Market if that's what you mean by significant implications. Because, these cases are not new, and even when the SEC took hard actions against Coinbase, the Market did not become more volatile but became volatile when Binance was sued by SEC. The point is, it may not put significant implementations on the market/coin base. And, still, these exchanges will face more regulations but for the moment, i can say US authorities are in full favor of the crypto industry, it feels like they are the true adopter of crypto (hehe) which is not, well, we all will see what are there plans in making crypto so famous (in a positive way).",

Self custody is so important for people to learn, but i think this case is a little bit different. The person who filed this case, Abraham Bielski lost ~ $30,000 in coinbase, though that is a lot of money to keep in an exchange, but many sources say scammers got into his account to steal the funds, he didn't lose it because coinbase collapsed or that they were hacked, i think he lost it because he has bad operational security and this person will probably also lose their funds if they control their keys.",

Their plea was that the court should halt the proceeding of California district court civil cases because they bypassed the standard legal process a client should follow to seek redress. The standard was that the customer will seek the position of arbitration before he would seek redress in a law court. Coinbase informed the client to go to the standard arbitration as stated in the terms of service but they moved faster than their shadow. Some of these clients and government officials see infringement as an avenue to ripe off crypto businesses. California district court hands are tied for now because they will have to wait for the outcome of the arbitration before they go ahead with the legal action. The matter might be settled by arbitration or the case will continue in California district court. This case shows the importance of the terms of service of any organisation.",

Not convicted. Just my theory, considering EDX markets will probably blow coinbase out of the water, or even acquire coinbase. If I were to actually bet, it'd be that coinbase either ceases operations or is acquired by EDX/whichever exchange is monopolised by the US Govt./Wall street/(Insert ruling class here) by 2028. Next year might be an extreme but I certainly wouldn't say that it's impossible as a black swan event - Coinbase ceases operations, liquidates assets, merges (at least some employment) into EDX over some deal.",

The way I see it, if a coin was made to scam people, it will remain tainted until the end of its days. There's no bringing back Tera Luna, there's not going to be a new bitcoin exchange run by SBF and we won't see Bitconnect with real value. Since value came up, you say that if tokens have value they stop being a ponzi scheme. That's interesting.Don't scam coins have value? People are buying them not knowing what the real value is, but they pay to get them, so these coins must have value before they implode, it's just that this value is faked. All coins listed on exchanges have value, but it's often value derived from trading and false promises.",
