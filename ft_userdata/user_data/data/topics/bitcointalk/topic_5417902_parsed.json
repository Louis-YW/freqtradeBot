The free plan is only for OKX users. Cleo.finance partnered with OKX via their API broker program. Within this program, cleo.finance receives part of the trading commission as a reward for the trading volume for managing to bring to OKX.  And we also decided to share that reward with our users via the cashback program - traders can earn up to $6000 per month by just trading through cleo.finance. And the cashbacks are deposited directly to traders' OKX accounts. How much is cleo.finance giving away? Sharing anywhere between 25% - 40% of the trading commissions we receive from OKX with the users. The rest is used to improve and run the platform. Here is more information about this program.",

I just want you to make this clear for me. Not at all. We are a technology provider, not a market maker/prop trading firm. We do not resell your data in any shape or form and you retain ownership of your trading ideas.As for personal data - we do not collect any. If you choose to sign up using google/facebook account, the basic data (email, name, last name) are stored securely on Auth0 - our authentication platform. When connecting to your exchange account we use solely the API key credentials needed. Cleo does not request and neither of the exchanges supported provide any data as to who owns the exchange account.",

Is it possible to set up a stop loss which works more like a trail stop loss order, mostly based on if the price reaches the target price or not.For example, assuming I bought BTC at $20,000 and my target price is 10% for profit which is $22,000 (on a risk reward ratio of 1, my stop loss is around $18,0000). Once the trigger price hits $22,000, I would like a new stop order to be placed at $24,000 and stop loss at $20,000.if BTC price keeps going by 10%, and so does a new target and stop loss.
