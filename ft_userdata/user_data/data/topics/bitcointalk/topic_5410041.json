  "content": "I travel for work a lot and I have worked on contract in 3rd world countries where poverty are very high. In most of these countries and specifically in the more rural areas, people are very poor and they lack the infrastructure and resources to have access to Banking services and/or the Internet.    (Some people even struggle to get electricity and clean water)Now, most of these people rely on the land to provide them with an income... and they live in a constant \"survival\" mode.. where they live from hand to mouth. Now, in Africa I have seen people using cellphones to make digital payments using a centralized payment method, called MPESA ...so even with very limited resources, people are still able to make transactions. (They charge cellphones with small solar panels and/or petrol generators for the community) We (1st world countries) should find ways to make payments on Bitcoin easier and more user friendly, so that payment on ALL phones can be possible. (not just fancy smart phones)  We should also find ways for people with those phones to execute tasks that will enable 1st world countries to pay those people with \"cheap\" micro payments. (Lightning Network) ...example : translation services / typing / spell checking / sorting of data etc...etc.Let's brainstorm ideas to develop software that will tap into the opportunities that will enable micro payments on a global scale, so that we can pull in a forgotten section of the global economy.  Do not give them fish... rather provide the hook ...line... sinker... and they will fish for themselves.",

(They charge cellphones with small solar panels and/or petrol generators for the community) We (1st world countries) should find ways to make payments on Bitcoin easier and more user friendly, so that payment on ALL phones can be possible. (not just fancy smart phones)  I use centralized payment methods (Revolut), I use mobile banking, and I use Bitcoin.Sending money through centralized system is very easy, since the centralized system can always find simple ways to get in touch with its other users, and if a bad transaction happens, they can even undo it, since.. it's centralized. Compared to that, mobile banking is already overly complicated (even card payment is).Bitcoin is - or should be - on the same level as mobile banking. You know the recipient addresses and you send an amount.LN should be like credit card.Now, as I said, centralized payment systems are much easier, no matter what we simplify. Giving them a centralized system based on Bitcoin is not really a step forward (not your keys, not your coins). And if we add on top the fact that Bitcoin comes with various fees (and I talk about conversion from/to fiat) and its price is fluctuating a lot... I am not sure it will help them. They don't afford to lose any penny.",

If you are lucky enough to have power in your building, then you must provide a service to the community around you. (obviously at a fee) They share transport to the nearest town to buy food and to charge their phones, if the Spaza shop (Tuck shop) offers that service and to buy airtime. Some even provide a charging station or kiosk to charge your phone, but it is very expensive ...compared to 1st world countries. The culture is a lot different to what some people are used to... so sharing your bed or car or household appliances... are not strange to them. (They also have something called \"Black tax\".... where the one with the job... will support any family member or members as a kind of payback for what was given to them) ....very interesting concept. In any way.... they make a plan, no matter what their situation is... borrow...beg or steal... they get it done.    Oh, to answer your last question.... yes a lot of 1st world countries are dumping very good phones in 3rd world countries... so the phone quality are getting better and better over time.",

It's easy to say, but I think it's much harder to do given the level of political corruption and the attitude of most of the world towards Africa. It is obviously in someone's interest that Africa remains an undeveloped continent for as long as possible, and that it can serve as a dumping ground for various waste (including that from nuclear reactors). Giving people the ability to be more efficient in payment methods will not solve the problem because people should first be provided with normal living conditions, the right to free primary and secondary school, and fair and democratic elections.
