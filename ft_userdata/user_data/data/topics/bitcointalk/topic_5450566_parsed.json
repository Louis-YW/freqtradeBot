All they will noticed is that they will feel like using money for gambling, even if the money is for another thing. And they will be losing it all the time because they gamble frequently.",

It was the biggest loss in my life and the next day once again I managed to arrange money, so that I can recover my losses. Further I did the same and lost everything during the midnight of Saturday. My house was located close to church and the next morning is Sunday. Every Sunday used to go to church, and that Sunday I was sitting and crying when the Sunday mass is going on. I wasn't able to control myself and my room was locked. Different thoughts were running around me, but somehow I managed to come out those days.",

I have been lost about 0.1 BTC in 2018 when playing dice. it is very painful when at the time today I compare it to the Bitcoin price. Because at that time the Bitcoin price (in December 2018) is still around 3k-4k. I lost about $400 in dice. It's regret for me now. So I think (old players) will definitely regret and most likely if they revenge for the loss, they will back to the casino. But, It will different situation that possibly will get more lost if still play like past,",

I may have lost much more nowadays in just a single bet in my entire session, but it doesn't really push away the fact that it was my first \"big\" loss when I started gambling. I lost a few dollars beforehand which was really nothing since it was spread out through various games, but losing that much in one poker game was kind of big for me. In comparison to that, I can't even remember the biggest amount I lost, goes to show how that memory would always be in my mind even later on really.",

As for sports betting, the results are more positive.But I think the player has more to lose compared to what he remembers because he will usually play at several gambling sites, the reason is because each gambling site offers different things and also the benefits offered to players will vary, and also the length of time he plays will be affect the amount with which players plays.",

As for me I don't think I have lose enough money at once that made me regret gambling but if we're to accumulate every penny I have used in gambling and loss that might amount to something more substantial but they weren't used at once for gambling. The highest should be around $50 - $100 dollars and I'm sure that's the highest amount I have ever wondered at once and after that experience I learnt to take my bets bit by bit and not let the greed of winning everything once get the better of me again.",
