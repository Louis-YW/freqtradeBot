It should show you 1 BTC either way and as far as I can remember, there's no display for USD (or any other fiat) currently.Now, if you think the final balance in BTC does not reflect your transactions, then that's another problem. You can start by trying to check your addresses in a block explorer and see if the balances match or not.",

How do you mean by new price of bitcoin?Do you mean bitcoin is dollar equivalent? Like changing from 27,234.26 to 28, 187.25?You are using the bitcoin network software and not an exchange.Â  0.1125 btc could only change to 0.1222 btc when you own more bitcoin.",

The value that appears there is the real value, if what appears in bitcoin core is different, then it is most likely a synchronization problem.bitcoin core is not a wallet for beginners you can use electrum for now",

Why is that?

This means you will not be able to spend Bitcoins with it. Make sure you own the seed phrase or the private keys, before you request Bitcoins to be sent to this wallet.You will be able to check that address value in $ or any fiat currency.

Why is that?What is \"Bitcoin Core 2\" application?Are you using \"Bitcoin Core\" or another client with a suspicious name? Because Bitcoin Core doesn't have an official \"2\" variant.As for your bitcoin balances in the overview, it wont automatically get interest/deductions based from the market price.Even in other clients, your (for example) 1.00BTC wont become 1.01BTC just because Bitcoin's price rose, it doesn't work that way.",

      "body": "It is unlikely that Bitcoin Core will ever gain fiat display capabilities because that information is only with crypto exchanges and 3rd-party APIs that in many cases charge a high fee for access, so API keys are not practical (neither are the rate limits). Besides, it undermines the notion that Bitcoin is independent currency, that does not need the dollar or any other fiat currency in order to be meaningful.",

If the application is not running properly, then you have to update it from the bitcoin core website or you can use google play store to update to the latest version of the app. There are some times that the app is not synchronizing to show the bitcoin Ballance in the wallet because the app need to be updated.",

So I think it's not a problem, unless the sum in BTC changes. Moreover, some wallets are now testing functions like \"showing the balance in USD\", test failures can also be the cause of price changes.",
