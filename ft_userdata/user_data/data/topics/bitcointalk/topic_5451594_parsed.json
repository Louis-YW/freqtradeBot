  "content": "Today I saw this user advertising 1xBit and I wrote a red tag on his profile for it. Not that it will add much to the bad reputation he already has, and that does not prevent him from participating in scammy campaigns like that, but I saw that he had no tag for the fact of promoting 1xBit and I wanted to leave it reflected. What happens is that I don't see how to reference it. I have looked at his last posts in several pages and I don't see his application, I have looked at the 1xBit thread, now closed and I don't see his application either, and then I have looked at his addresses in ninjastic.space and I don't see any of them related to the application for 1xBit campaign.Do you think it is enough to leave the tag without referencing? If not, can you think how to reference it properly? Finally I thought I could use this thread as a reference, using a screenshot:",

I think ninjastic.space only record the Bitcoin address from the original post, not the edited version, that's why you don't see any of his address associated with 1xbit campaign. He also deleted his application.But, you can actually use this thread as a reference since you've captured if he is currently wear 1xbit campaign signature and avatar.",
