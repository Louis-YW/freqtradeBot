  "content": "Alik BakhshiFuhrer Putin criminalFinally done! The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Putin for kidnapping children in Ukraine. Now Putin cannot appear in countries where the jurisdiction of the ICC operates. Even the talks with Ukraine that Putin insists on cannot take place. No one dares to negotiate with a criminal. I wrote earlier that Putin is a criminal for orchestrating the mass doping of Russian athletes at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.03/18/2023Putin criminalRussian President Putin cannot avoid a judicial investigation, and strange as it may seem, not as a political hooligan (1,2), who violated international treaties and is guilty of the deaths of tens of thousands of people, but for a crime in the field of sports, specifically for the massive use of doping by Russian athletes and substitution of doping samples by FSB officers, which qualifies as a criminal offense. Putin, of course, denies state involvement in the doping scam, but the matter is complicated by the fact that the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), held in Monaco on December 3-4, decided to extend the suspension of the Russian athletics federation until two conditions will be met:First, Russia must pay all bills related to the IAAF's costs of detecting the scam, and it will also be necessary to pay the costs of monitoring compliance with the conditions for restoration.The second condition, the most unpleasant for Putin, is that by December 31, access to the samples of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory must be provided, and according to the results of the recheck, all those responsible will be punished.There is no doubt that among the culprits will be the former Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, who from the very beginning of the doping scandal has been suspected of organizing the mass feeding of Russian athletes with illegal drugs and who can pawn Putin. In this regard, Mutko should fear for his life. No one is guaranteed from an accident, and, as Woland said from Mikhail Bulgakov, \"A brick for no reason at all will never fall on anyone's head.\" An interesting fact is that Mutko somehow threatened to go to civil court for libel, but something prevents him from taking this step. The fact that Mutko would not have dared to commit a crime without Putin's instructions is indisputable. The organization of power in Russia, created by Putin, is such that without his knowledge, not a single civil servant is free to disobey. The Nazi and revanchist Putin, like Hitler, uses the sporting achievements of Russian athletes to raise the spiritual component of the Russian people, as proof of the exclusivity and significance of the “Russian world”, in the protection of which Fuhrer Putin found himself and defined his life as the goal (3.4). But what is surprising and known in advance, these good intentions, like Hitler's, will end very sadly.1. Putin and his new world disorder. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/35844.html2. Who is Putin? https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/32817.html3. Putin is the shepherd of the Russian world. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/36544.html4. Great Russian chauvinism, and Putin is his Fuhrer. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/21133.html07.12.18",

Because Putin does not have any reason to leave his country, specially in war time.Even if Putin left Russia to visit a country which in theory is supposed to comply with the arrest warrant, (like Venezuela), the arrest is unlikely to happen due to the fears of escalation of the hostilities and in the Venezuelan case, Russia is such an ally of this corrupt government that they would rather not to comply and not to bother the Kremlin.",
