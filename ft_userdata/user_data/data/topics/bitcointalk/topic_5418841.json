      "body": "Honestly, this should be labeled as a stupid idea, but based on my own perspective, the most important thing is keeping your safe keys, well secured to an extent that you alone have access to them, transfer of tokens from one wallet to another is a big risk, most especially if you're doing it all the time, we've got to be extremely careful about that too, As you're aware changing wallet to another could easy mix things up for you, so it's not a good practice.Others might say it's a good idea because to some extent, it will prevent anyone trying to monitor your access code to your phase keys, but still not the best practices, hence keep your phase or Private keys well secured. This is my take on this",

I usually differentiate the main wallet from the one I use to trade on the dex exchange or link it to a new site.",

Is this for safety or privacy purposes because it doesn't make sense to transfer token to different wallet if the wallet is not compromised or exposed to possible hack. This move is just a waste of transaction fee and at the same time too hassle to do if he have multiple coin stored in his wallet. But it really doesn't make sense for to change wallet regularly for whatever reason.",

It would be like changing your phone number or email address every month. It would be extremely inconvenient and would make it much harder for people to reach you. Furthermore, the frequent transfer of all coins and tokens creates added risks. The more times you move your coins around, the greater the chance that something will go wrong.I think it would be safer to have a few major wallets for different purposes. For example, one wallet could be used for day-to-day transactions, another wallet could be used for long-term savings and investment, and another wallet could be used exclusively for ICOs.",

I believe with doing that, it is likely to be a miss up at some spot at the phrase and this is confusing if that happens. I have experienced a miss up in phrase sometime, it is really difficult to sort out. Be sure you write your passphrase somewhere only you know because you may need to get the exact phrase again to input it in the phrase if you missed it.
