      "body": "Your account has rightly been tagged (whether it is a throwaway or not) because accounts sellers and not looked upon positively in the forum. Also there is no way of even knowing if the buyer will ever get to use any of the alleged accounts you claim to have. They do not know whether you will take the money and run because you might really have zero accounts.Quote from: accoountseller on May 07, 2023, 09:36:30 PMI am selling a few old BitcoinTalk accounts with a high rank, they are not in a signature campaign and I still post every now and then on them to keep them \"active\".
