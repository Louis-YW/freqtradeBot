  "content": "𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐍𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚 e don tok say dem wan Change Nigerian money from 𝐍𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟑 dat go 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 $𝟏 𝐔𝐒𝐃 𝐞𝐱𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 rate equal to 𝐍𝟏.𝟐𝟓 Today nai I come received dis news in my WhatsApp and as I read am finished omen di thing sweet me for belle. So I come dey make some research about am. Nai make I bring am come here make deliberate am. Na like dis di matter go.Na di new agenda and policy for di Naira. CBN come announced say for dem to do Health Economic debate, dey have to enlighten di General Public di thing dem want do on di November 2, 2023. And for dem to kick start di process, dey have to unveil di 4 point agenda as a package to di citizens. And di thing dem wan do na:Better Anchor Inflation Expectations,Strengthen Public Confidence in the Naira,Make for Easier Conversion to Other Major Currencies,The Reverse Tendency for Currency Substitution,Eliminate Higher Denomination notes with lower Purchasing Power,Reduce the cost of Production, Distribution, and Processing of Currency,Promote the usage of coins and thus a more Efficient Pricing and Payments System,Promote the Availability of Cleaner Notes,Deepen the Forex Market,Ensure More Effective Liquidity Management and Monetary Policy,position the Naira to become the ‘Reference currency’ in Africa.These are the things to discuss in the economic submit. As it is said, and di discussion of the agenda were coin from other African countries which Ghana is also implementing it in their country now.In the 𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 new money will be use to replace the old money and di policy wey the CBN want to do be say, dem go remove 2 digits (zeros) from the old naira and create the new one so if you remove 2 zero from #1000 then you go know how much go remain and that is how dem want to do. And in the process of implementing this change the two currencies go coexist which will be called old naira and di new naira. Example:50 kobo   Half koboN 1   = 1 kobo coinN 2   = 2 kobo coinN 5 =    5 kobo coinN 10    = 10 kobo coinN 20    = 20 kobo coinN 50 =    50 kobo coin or note***N 100   = N 1 noteN 200   N 2 note**N 500   = N 5 noteN 1000 =    N 10 noteN 2000*   = N 20 noteThat is 2 zeros have been removed from each naira to create the new naira. And according to di CBN all the assets that connected to naira will be 𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭ed. That's if the house was #5000 monthly as of the old naira it will be #50 from the new naira policy. And in the transition period prices of things will be stated clearly in both the old and the new naira. Example: if the goods are sold in #3000 in the old naira then it will be #30 in the new naira. And this change will start effect from January 2024. The old naira go stop after 5 months of implementation of the new naira currency. Exchange rate: N to US$ will be like:N125Or N130Or N100 to US$1.   N1.25 = US$1Or N1.30 = US$1Or N1  = US$1Dis action discussion was taking by the CBN which was directed by the president Tinubu to reduce the suffering of the citizens. How una see this matter we dey come up now?Sources: CBN https://www.cbn.gov.ng/FAQS/FAQ.asp?Category=Nairahttps://thenationonlineng.net/naira-currency-redenomination-still-outweighs-redesigning/",

If I get two currency of the same unit of measurement but come get different value, wat am I getting at, like how e go take sup.

I think if the government focus on making sure our refineries are working properly, the country will not more depend on importation of fuel and this will help the economic situation of this country and it will play a very significant role in stabilizing our currency’s value and also create job opportunities among Nigerians.",

No, I no sure because as that period nah for their own enjoyment alone them no go want make their fellow Muslims suffer.The worst part of the matter be say, way thing happen for time of cashless policy nai go still happen again so that Christians no go for celebrate the Christmas wela.This country don reach the extent way Christian nai go rule us, since way nah Muslim start to dey rule, the country no dey in the right shape like the way e been dey before way GOODLUCK EBELE JONATHAN dey rule us, as of that time things good well well, but because of say good person no dey last, them comot am for seat, and since then nai country bad.",

The country don't need all these to strengthen the economy but a productive government. I wouldn't believe anything that these people are saying because anything that they do successfully, is to benefit themselves only and not for the benefit of the citizens.Quote from: Agbe on September 11, 2023, 11:10:02 AMposition the Naira to become the ‘Reference currency’ in Africa.How is this possible, when Ghana cedes is has value than the naira. We don't produce anything that other countries depend majorly on,and that if we don't sell,there will be lack of it. Our refineries are not working. If only one can be put to use,it will help to reduce some unnecessary expenses and the money will be uses to tackle one problem. We have abundant natural resources but the government is only focused on crude oil. Common farming, we can't and the country imports almost all that we eat. Making Naira the power currency in Africa is a dream and I don't think it will be easy to achieve because there are other Africa countries that their currency is valuable than ours and their economy is in a good shape than ours. For example South Africa,only if we can make proper use of our natural resources and stop corruption or jail/kill any corrupt leader that stole money doing his stay in office,so that any leader that gets into power will be useful.",

E look promising on the outside but this nah pure scam and another means to suffer the poor masses.This is not scam at all. What I probably think that you are thinking is that some people will lose if naira is denominated, but no. This is how it would be, money that everyone is having will be divided by 100. For illustration:Anyone that is having ₦50000 in bank or at home, or you have a property worth of ₦50000, or you want to buy an item that is worth ₦50000. The ₦50000 will be divided by 100 which makes it ₦500. So the amount of naira that you will spend will be less and the amount of naira that you will receive will also be less, but in a way that it is as of before which is now.We are not the first country that has done something like this. Ghana, Germany, South Korea, China and many other countries have done something like this before. If you can remember very well, you will remember when Ghana did it in 2007.",
