Apparently, he now faces 109 years in prison for tax evasion.The interview which was posted earlier today already has 1.5m views.Ver claims that Bitcoin has been hijacked by the state and fires shots at Theymos, although he doesn't name him directly (I haven't seen the whole thing, so not 100% sure on this though).Thoughts?",

      "body": "I'd have to watch the entire interview first. So far, however, and although this man has always been so full of himself, I don't think it's fair. I don't know the nitty-gritty of the law and the facts of his particular case/s, but every country in the world has rich and powerful people who are also tax evaders themselves. Not a single one of them is sentenced to more than a hundred years simply because of it. So, if Ver will face 109 years in prison for it, it's certainly not just about tax evasion. Quote from: Eclipse33 on December 11, 2024, 01:33:14 AMA man who is peaceful, not a US citizen and according to Roger the claims are pure fabrication. If Ver renounced his US citizenship only in 2014 and yet he accumulated his vast wealth in Bitcoin years earlier as a US citizen without paying taxes, is he not liable for tax evasion?",

When renouncing his US citizenship he also owes an 'exit tax' (several other countries have the same thing) and even more to the point - he is liable per the tax codes as they were during the years in question. Just because the codes have changed since then make no difference tho Ver is insisting it's 'not fair' because penalties for some things were lowered since then.",

It is one thing to escape laws or taxes that are grossly unfair and unjust, but that doesn't apply in this case. Ver is simply a tax cheat and tax evader. Everyone should pay their FAIR share of taxes. I hope he rots in prison. If one wishes to pay less taxes, there are plenty of ways to do it through means that are perfectly legal. They are called tax loopholes, err I mean tax strategies commonly used by the wealthy. But I guess this fool was too cheap to hire a good tax advisor.",

As for FTX, I wouldn't exactly say that 25 years is a small sentence, but the bigger problem is that his closest associates received sentences as if they had stolen ice cream from a store.As for taxes, the saying goes that in life you can't escape from two things, one is death, and the other is paying taxes. If you are not intelligent enough to know how to avoid paying taxes, then don't play with these things - some will obviously learn the hard way.",

If you watch the video, it is quite clear that he considers himself the second most important person after Satoshi, and that is why they want to destroy him in any possible way.",
