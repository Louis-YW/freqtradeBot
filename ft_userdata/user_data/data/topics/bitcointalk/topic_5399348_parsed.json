  "content": "Gambling have brought me big wins as well as drastic losses. If my entire statistics is calculated this used to be in loss. I've tried different plans to keep me away from Gambling, however I wasn't able to do it. In the beginning I never mind when I experience loss, because I was single and now I have a family. I used to gamble without fear.In recent days whenever I get into gambling I used to experience some changes in my body. Particularly stomach pain and I myself found the difference while gambling and not gambling. When I wasn't gambling I never have such issues and I myself checked Google and diagnosed the below. Does anyone have similar experience. Atleast for my health I need to give up gambling.Irritable bowel syndromeAlso called: IBS, spastic colonPeople may experience:Pain areas: in the abdomenPain types: can be recurrent in the abdomenGastrointestinal: change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhoea, inability to empty bowels, indigestion, nausea, passing excessive amounts of gas, or urgent need to defecateAbdominal: cramping or discomfortAlso common: anxiety, depression, discomfort, loss of appetite, or symptoms alleviated by defecationGoogle",

      "body": "I haven't had bowel disorder before even when I was a gambling addict. What I experienced when I was addicted to gaming are:emotional stressstaying up late at nightmood swings, after losing betbecome not trustworthy by familysold some personal belongingsUsing money I supposed to use for other important things to gamblea time I felt like to kill myselfBecause of the last reason, I quit gambling for a year, I was addicted at the time, but the one year quit made me realize I can never win but lose more unless I take gambling as fun and never use the amount I can not afford to lose. I started gambling again after a year, I lose and I stopped again without getting addicted. Later, I use only the money I can afford to lose to bet and I do not bet often, just on a match or 2 or 3 matches weekly or even biweekly.I bet once in a week but sometimes it can be twice, if I have $100, I can use only $1 to bet and the more money I have the lesser will be the percentage I use to bet. Gambling is fun but can be deadly. If you take gambling as fun and never stress yourself about it, this can be psychological, if you think you stop gambling and the symptoms stops, I will advice you to quite gambling for now, but do not think that is what is causing it than stress or you are a gambling addict and it is giving you stress.",

I guess it depends on the person, and to the amount of stress we are undergoing to. Although I don’t experience what was mentioned in the OP, I am very much aware that stress could really trigger pains. In fact, there a lot o studies that prove the correlation of psychological stress and physical symptoms.",

Never been irritable before, during, or after my gambling session; just the same old me laughing on how dumb I am to still play but it gives me enjoyment. Perhaps these symptoms are to those chronic gamblers who are always in front of their computers, poker tables, or machines most of the time, or those who have prior medical condition that becomes connected to what they're experiencing after the thrill of gambling wears off.",

Let's see, if you don't gamble, you won't have the problem you mentioned. But problems will arise if you gamble.Means it looks like it's time for you to leave gambling because it will make you uncomfortable gambling. I don't have the experience you have because I don't gamble very often. So my advice, stop before it's too late because it's good for your health. Take your time with your family because that's the most important thing right now. Every second of the family is the best for us.",

Ofc mental and emotional stress can also cause problems but it might be best to take a look at your diet first and foremost before saying it's due to gambling. It may be due to a sudden addition to your diet or something. Have you tried doing a checkup? It might also just be due to stress/nervousness or something since I myself have felt that but not really in gambling, but the emotion itself can sometimes mess up your bowel movement. Anyhow I don't think I've ever experienced any physical changes when gambling, emotionally and mentally well, that's almost an always event kind of thing.",

There was never a time in my gambling experience that I felt like killing myself, not like I had the most successful bets, in fact my statistics ended in loses as much as that of OP but, I had just me to worry about. My income wasn't steady and it was all about making an extra cash with just a few $ and its often loses.When it comes to changes in your body as OP describes, most of the diagnosis given didn't particularly relate to have originated from bad gambling habits. I think your condition @OP is more related to the fact that, your irritated at the habit and this originates from the fear that comes rushing in your nerves once your at the point where you get to stake on predictions.Pehroas it's time you get yo see gambling for a fun time or give it a break. It's hardly some means to a second income or job.",

But based on some articles in google about stomach ache, it has connections to your brain which has more connection when you're doing something ~ gambling. Here's some quote from this article Quote from: https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/symptoms/stomach-painAnxiety also releases a stress hormone (cortisol), which causes the body to produce extra levels of stomach acid. That acidity causes the lining of the esophagus to become irritated, and this can lead to stomach pain....Anxiety is very serious thing, I don't want people to have that. I guess you need to visit your physician as this early to prevent more damage in the future.",
