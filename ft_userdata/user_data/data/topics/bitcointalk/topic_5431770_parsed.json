This must be done to turn the wheels of the economy in your neighbourhood and save them from bankruptcy, at least you give them space to live.",

A customer will want the best product with the lowest price, while a supplier will want to get a income with the lowest cost. You can't blame if there's a customer don't want to buy from retailers since they don't have a lot money and want to use their money to invest or other thing. Actually those retailers need to lower their price if they want to compete against a big company.",

      "body": "We have to pay attention to the economic circulation around us, I totally agree with that. But sometimes things like this become a separate war for us. I will give a little description of what happened to me personally. Buying at dealers around the house is much more expensive than buying at wholesalers or something, so the choice is when I need a lot I will choose to shop at a store that offers lower prices, unless my needs are few, I prefer to shop around the house.Sometimes our humanity is at war with our needs too, that's what gets difficult. When shopping we will definitely take into account the money we spend with what we get. And also we all know everyone is in a phase or heading in a more difficult direction in the future.Maybe this is what traders around us need to pay attention to, they have to raise prices that are not too far from the prices offered at large wholesalers to attract buyers around them. That way we will mutually benefit each other, we as buyers will not go too far to shop, and they as traders will not lose their customers.",

The thing though is that most of the shops increases their prices as well sort of to recover what they have lost during the pandemic.And that's where others try to look for cheap alternatives, because of the steep price that the stores around them are offering.For example, let's say there are food shop that you offer food for around $7.00. Now the price is $10.00. So as consumers you look for more options and try to extend your $7.00, or even your $10.00.",

One is inflation. It is inflation that reduce value of currency to buy adequately but now the quantity to buy is reduce and the money is not available for more purchase and sellers goods perish because of low patronage. Another point is Digital awareness and we can't change that. Sellers everywhere take advantage of advertising of goods online so buying in neighborhood may not be important if online seller can deliver your goods to your house.",

This must be done to turn the wheels of the economy in your neighbourhood and save them from bankruptcy, at least you give them space to live.the issue is that although SOME customers have moved to online purchasing groceries straight from distribution centres rather than a local store. its actually the local leases and state/county taxes on local businesses that have choked those small local stores out of business. EG initially 9.6% footfall drop of revenue. but 60% increase of bills and rents. store gets 1000 foot flow. online equivalent does 8 deliveries an hour for 12 hours(96)imagine a tin of baked beans only cost £0.15 to makean online store has an distributor lease/tax cost average of £0.05 and so sells for £0.25 (£0.05 profit)but a local store has a £0.20 business lease and state tax rate average so sells for £0.40 (£0.05 profit)here in the UK many towns have lost lots of local stores due to business rates, which then pushed people that normally shop locally have no where to shop locally. many people prefered to shop locally before-after work when carparks were free and businesses had things they can see touch smell and decide on buying.it was not that a customer decides to shop online \"for convenience\" as many dont want day old groceries picked by a stranger. or choosing clothes they cant touch or try on in the stores changing rooms before purchase.. where by instead they have to \"order and hope\"and having to pick a day off to get delivery.. it was a push to go online because stores closed because it was the local stores that became a premium price compared to online due to their physical costs and higher lease, local parking and taxes.things like:by pushing local stores to be a premium and unable to compete against their online competitor. the local store dies. even if they had the extra 10% of footfall back in the town centre.. that wont be enough to cover the 60% premium required to stay afloat",

Ever since the prices of necessities soared to an amount a regular salary cannot handle anymore, people look for options. Online stores are mostly suppliers who are directly selling their products to the people near them. The question of \"why?\" comes out. Simply because the retail stores are closing down. No one is buying in the small shop so the big shop will also feel the effect of it. That's the reason why they are forced to sell their products themselves. Chain reaction.",

So it would also be better if conventional traders/retailers wanted to use the online shop application to order their goods so they could compete at a price that was slightly cheaper than what they usually sell.I am a person who very often uses online shop applications when I want to shop for needs such as clothes, motorcycle parts, but I still buy daily necessities around my own environment or at conventional traders/retailers. I know this will make conventional traders/retailers look very miserable because they feel a decline in their sales, but that doesn't mean we have to blame the online application developers, because these parties also provide better service and according to what consumers need.QuoteIf you are a person who has money to shop for daily needs, I suggest you buy from merchants around you instead of shopping online whose stores are far from your place. This must be done to turn the wheels of the economy in your neighbourhood and save them from bankruptcy, at least you give them space to live.Your suggestion is not wrong, but they (conventional traders/retailers) must also see more opportunities in running their business at this time, because there will always be competition from various parties and those who do not update and still maintain the old way of doing things. trading or trying to expand their business with old methods, they will fall behind and go bankrupt in the end. So for now they (conventional traders/retailers) have to use new methods in order to further develop their business and avoid bankruptcy.",

But the economic challenges are also affecting buyers and most people are looking for places they can buy goods cheaper. Apart from selling goods at a discounted price most online shops have variations of products that can serve as alternatives. It would take government intervention to protect these local shops from unhealthy competition from these bigger multinationals. Government can subsidize the price of some essential commodities in these local shops and the cheap price would attract local customers. It would also be good if the government reduce the tax imposed on these local shops because it would also assist the to become competitive. Most businesses in my area are closing down because of multiple or sometimes double taxation.",

I can't bring myself to buy at a store that doesn't have what I need. In terms of economic growth, we really have to encourage micro-entrepreneurs who are around by helping to buy goods. But they also can't rely on just one stream. Because now technology provides instant choices for shopping.However, as someone who knows enough about how the bustle of microeconomics goes, it is undeniable that you often hear complaints from conventional traders about increasing online trading, which on average shifts the position of the offline store.",
