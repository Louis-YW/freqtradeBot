And this happens when the country can't fulfil their foreign currency debt obligations.The last default was on the 27th of June this year and the reason is obvious (western sanctions).",

Rubles is not scam but the government behind it that abusing it to fund their war which the citizen is paying. I think there’s a high probability for the 4th or more to happened unless they stop wagering war and burn their resources while other countries sanction them to inflict economic damage. Russia is a great country, their government is just focusing on military growth for war.",

But so far, the US, Nato, and Ukraine have been unable to stop Russia, let alone make them fail badly. To be fair, the Russian economy is not immune to the impact of those heavy sanctions. But the EU's economy is not much better, if not worse, than Russia's. If the ruble is a scam, then all currencies in this world are government sponsored scam schemes.",

Some countries in the EU seem to have different issues from one another, like energy, climate, and so on if those media reports can be trusted. But I don't think it is remotely similar to what Russia gets from sanctions etc. I think fiat in general is susceptible to manipulation regardless of who issues it.",

But if we are to consider the reasons, we might end up generalizing that all fiat currencies are also scams. They may differ in degrees, but since they are all operating under this questionable fiat monetary system, then they are all fraud in one way or another. First and foremost, these fiat currencies are not backed by any commodity. They are of no intrinsic value. In the absence of any enforcement coming from a powerful entity, these currencies have actually no use value.",

Ruble isn't actually a scam any more than any other currency. The 2022 default isn't a currency crisis, Russia's debt is in foreign currency/assets so they couldn't print more ruble to pay off the debt if they wanted. If their economy can't support the amount of debt they have, then ruble crashes along with the Russian economy. Chance of Russia's economy recovering to avoid future defaults are dependent on how long they choose to occupy Ukraine. Their currency will be strong as long as they keep up energy exports and the price of oil doesn't crash.",

Corruption seems to run deep in that country and everyone is willing to screw over their neighbor to get rich themselves. In such a society there is little cohesion and the rot starts at the very top - leaders do not want people that could unite against them, so they try to split people up as much as possible and apply pressure to individuals in the nastiest ways. Unfortunately until Russians free themselves from such dicktators they will be unable to heal this problem.",

You will never be able to pay the interest that you are owing to the bank on the first dollar that is lent. For example, if $1 is lent to a government at 1%, interest, will the $0.01 come from if that is the only $1 that exists? The same principle applies at scale. USD have had their defaults, including the global financial crisis and the great depression, as well as crisis' in between. Other fiat currencies are ongoing largely irresponsible monetary policy, including USD, GBP, EUR, AUD, CAD, and more that are controlled by the west. The east have gained dominance in economic power however themselves and the rest of the globe using fiat currencies will all experience the same fate.",

Lol how much did you lose in forex for you to think that the ruble is a scam. Countries left and right have defaulted and all that, we don't call them scammers too do we? Economic turmoil is bound to happen at one point in a country's lifetime, it's not something that they have control over especially since the world is ran on fiat and finite resources. To single out a single currency just cause they defaulted, during a crucial economic situation too is just a little stupid in my opinion. Cause if that were to be the case we should start calling every country who defaulted as scammers, USA included cause they are basically just dragging things out with the end game either them repaying their shit which is going upwards of a trillion now by the by, or not paying it outright and letting the whole economic world fall down.",

But so far, the US, Nato, and Ukraine have been unable to stop Russia, let alone make them fail badly. Over the past nine months, Russia has only been able to partially capture the small town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Now the Armed Forces of Ukraine have advanced and seized the strategic elevations in the north and south of Bakhmut and are shooting Russians there like in a shooting range from artillery. The occupiers suffer heavy losses, but they do not dare to withdraw precisely through the PR of the capture of this settlement. The Russian army in Bakhmut is now in operational encirclement. In the past few days, only near Avdiivka, the situation has become more complicated. In other sections of the more than 1200 km front, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are cautiously and systematically moving forward. This is especially true of the southern front, where the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is greatly complicated by continuous minefields. Therefore, the Russian occupiers have been stopped for a long time and are suffering a military failure.Russia is indeed a territorially large country and its depletion cannot be rapid. But a serious rebuff from Ukraine and international sanctions continue to do their job. Therefore, the Russian economy is slowly moving towards collapse.",
