  "content": "Zaprorizhzhia nuclear power plant in the city of Enerhodar has been attacked again with t serious shelling by the Russians,which several radiation sensors were damage and a small fire on grasses nearby the fire station close to it.     This same plant was seized by the Russian troops shortly after they started the invasion of Ukraine in March 2022. The plant was under control of Russia but they allowed the Ukrainian staffs to operate it.  The UN security council on Thursday Mr Grossi called the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to be allowed to inspect the plant. Earlier the US and China both called for UN expert to visit the plant but its like the access was not given.    Russia and Ukraine are both blaming each other for the recent shell. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky insist that only if Russia withdraws it military completely from Zaprorizhzhia will guarantee the restoration of nuclear safety for the entire Europe.   If the nuclear plant is destroyed,this could lead to disaster in the EU countries and might bring a high decline in their economy.

      "body": "Kharkiv has always been a rather popular Ukrainian city, even though it might not be a big strategic location. But because of its popularity in Ukraine, I would think that Russia would take her before a lot of other places. Popularity, and because she is so near the border.",
