In today's world people are so mean and self centered that they dnt feel any need to help anyone in crisis.",

But this is only visible when you need them the most and What broke my heart that day was when I see the people I used to care, leaving me behind and did not only ask if I was OK but act as if I am nobody to them. That's why after that, I don't care about others anymore except for a few that are truthful and if I ever help someone about anything, I won't expect the same help from them anything. Helping people is good and the only bad people that are not greatful are mostly the one who are not deserve our trust.",

We'd all like to do better and think that we're beyond reproach, but at baseline there is some level of what I would call \"self preservation\" that might exist during times of crisis. Seems ingrained in human physiology  -- consider it to be on the same note of the \"fight or flight\" response when humans are subject to fear, uncertainty, and shock.We can only hope the time of crisis moves quickly. We're a very fragile species.",

Such life should be discourage in the society.  We should not only show up when things are working, we should always stand in good and bad time.Before you conclude that someone doesn't want to help or assist you, it is important to ascertain or investigate if the person has the capacity or the means to reach out. This is because I have had such experience when someone became very angry with me because I failed to assist him. But the truth is that I didn't have the necessary resources to help.Good and selfless people still exists, although they are very few. I have been privileged to have had contact with some uncommon people that are willing to sacrifice their comfort for people to survive. There are also very selfish people that derive pleasure in seeing people suffer. They want to always be the boss, hence they would never give people the privilege of rising to their level or above them. These set of individuals are only friends when there is plenty to spend. But when you have issues or problems you would hardly get assistance from them.But I have learnt never to expect much from people because you would always be disappointed. I keep less friends, work hard, keep my expenses low and rely on God.",

Some people do not know how to ask for help, it is not a sign that they do not have their own problems that they are dealing with. These problems can become overwhelming that even if they are generous persons, they may need to reduce generosity, so their own situations don't turn bad in trying to help other people when it is no longer within their capacity. Generous people are not singled out from the effects of a crisis, so don't expect much from them.",

Such life should be discourage in the society.  We should not only show up when things are working, we should always stand in good and bad time.Success has many friends and failure has many enemies, I guess this is nature. If you have money,people see you to be successful and they will come around you to enjoy with you because you are generous.If things are not working out for you or you are facing some financial crises,people will think that you have failed in life forgetting that its only a little challenge that you are passing through, they will turn you down like you are shit to them,especially those same people that you assisted.To know the real people that loves you,it is when you are in crises,they will stand for you and assist you but those that don't care about you but cares only about your success,when you are in crises, they will mock you and run away from you. You should also run away from them forever because they are fake.Generosity also depends on the individual, some persons only give when they know that you have and can also give them back,the moment they notice that you don't have anymore,they will stay far from you so that you don't ask from them. While some persons,even if you have or not they will always give to you. The last set of persons, if you have or not,they will never give to you.",

That's really kind and compassionate act by you that you think of helping others and think about charity but some people are not like you ,they dnt like help others or give anything to anyone. They like to keep their money to themselves and just keep on saving and accumulating wealth. It is right when you help someone that gives you feeling of satisfaction.  It is rightly said you can see true face of your friends and foes during hard times .",

But in this day and age, there are many people whose behavior is unpredictable, they are very good at acting. Sometimes some people are deceived and do not know that they are being used.

Once all you have is gone, you won't be as able to earn more to give away, right?Besides, some people don't really want your help. For example. Some churches provide trips to African poor nations, so that the church people can help those poor Africans. But they place more trouble on the poor Africans, who feel that they have to be hospitable towards their foreign guests who are supposedly trying to help them. So the Africans spend their last little bit of money taking care of the needs of their guests.Make sure those you are helping want your help, and that your donations aren't being siphoned off by the organizers of the charity.",

Lastly let me blow your mind, if you want to please everybody, you end up disappointing everybody, just do your best and leave the rest.  All I'm trying to convey is that everyone, rich or poor, needs assistance at some point. Some individuals let you down when you most needed them. It could not be money, but rather care and attention. Giving money is only one aspect of generosity. However, everyone should care for and show love to their neighbors if we are to attain world peace. Do not be reluctant to assist them in both good and bad times.",
