  "content": "After years of interruption,  I am studying internals of bitcoin again,  starting with block header format.  I wanna see in real life,  from blockchainfo info, I can see contents of certain blocks in a web formatted output,  but nowhere seen the block header.Is there a way to see block header from live public block chain? Any utility?Following options are fine for me:1. Using some utility dump header2. Using some utility fetch (from public chain) entire block including block header write my own parser. Thanks",

I think i will do it in linux later for easier. I see in windows, it does download lot of blockchain files in *.data format although i am still not sure how those *dat files are organized.My end goal is to be able to parse whole block.",
