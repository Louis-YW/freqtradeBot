Welcome to the fascinating world of solo mining What is it about ?The BLOCK SOLVERS project was created to enable solomining as a group with a limited number of 10 participants and a small stake of only 0.001 BTC. We will rent SHA256 hash power through MiningRigRentals (hereafter abbreviated as MRR) and directed to the SoloCK pool with the hope of mining a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain. The number of participants is limited to 10 so that if a hit occurs, the payout amount of approximately 0.625 BTC per participant still remains attractive to each of the participants. The minimum stake per participant is only 0.001 BTC (=1mBTC). Thus, we have a total of 0.01 BTC available per run. With this we can run with a hashrate of e.g. 5 PH/s for about 10h, or 10 PH/s for about 5h, or 1 PH/s for about 42h. If the participants wish so after arrangement to run a higher hash rate for a certain round,  then we could increase the stake per participant to 0.003 BTC instead of the 0.001 BTC. With the total of 0.03 BTC in the pot we could engage a run with enormous 50 PH/s for approx. 3h. However, at least 1 PH/s hash rate will be rented for our runs. As a rule, the stake per slot is 0.001 BTC and with that we can run for 26h with 2 PH/s.What is the background ?Most of you certainly know Willis' block partys which exist and take place for a long time. I myself have already taken part in them because I would like to land a block hit. I love the competition and in a group it is even more exciting and fun. Unfortunately, the stake of 0.01 BTC seemed too high for my circumstances, I just can't afford that in the long run. In the last few months I've been doing my solo runs on my own, but that also at a hight cost of expense in the long run. So solomining as an individuum is really exhausting.Since I know from experience that it is not easy to invest 0.01 BTC as a stake per run and to participate in the long run, I would therefore like to offer an alternative option. This project Block Solvers is an alternative option for group-based solo mining and allows to participate cheaply and regularly. That's why the minimum stake of 1 mBTC (0.001 BTC) and maximum stake of 3 mBTC (0.003 BTC). Together as a group, we are stronger.What else is there to know?Although my offer does not directly compete with Willis' block partys as he is an old hand and trusted member here on the forum, I certainly did not want to start this project without his blessing. Willi is a long time and valued forum member and I respect the diligence and commitment he puts into his own Groupbuy Block Partys. That is why I contacted him beforehand and told him about my project and asked if he sees or even has any objections. In such a case I wouldn't have started it. Fortunately, Willi had nothing to complain and gave me so to speak green light for this. Thanks a bunch @Willi9974. I am fully aware that I do not yet have a special trust status in the forum, which is why there could always be justified doubts and concerns. But I don't want to leave it untried. If it doesn't succeed, then at least it was worth a try.  On the other hand, I hope that the project will succeed and run regularly, simply because it's a very small risk of only 0.001 BTC and even the worst pessimist and doubter would be able to cope with that   I can't put 6.25 BTC in escrow services as you really can understand, I just don't have that amount. But to provide a little bit of trust I figured I could transparently show everything here in the thread anytime someone feels the need to see it. Although the blockchain already reveals pretty much everything publicly. But I could also post screenshots from the MRR portal if there is interest. Of course, again, these would just be screenshots that anyone could fake, but I'm offering this transparency anyway. Also, I will list all transactions of each participant here in the thread for each run, so that everyone can check that they were valid transactions and I was not faking the participant list. If I post excerpts from the MRR portal history, don't be surprised if our MRR account starts with 0.00000875 BTC starting balance. I had transferred 0.002 BTC from my own wallet privately to our MRR account once, so I can start a test run and set up the pools/servers etc. The trial run was successful, everything worked as expected. There are a few Satoshis left (=0.00000875 BTC) which are still in the account and will be used for our group during the first run. If we actually find our first block and all participants get their reward as expected, the trust will raise and the thread will probably stay alive for a long time which I hope so.Conditions of participation / Procedure :If you want to participate, first check this thread on page 1 in post #2 to see if there is a free slot available for the next scheduled run.If there are free slots for the next round, then please first send the minimum stake of 0.001 BTC to our group bitcoin address at MRR:bc1qtyvxwhwctneje9zjvqkzvp6yqtnqc3xs0sf6vdand only then post the completed participation template here in the thread for registering. Pre-bookings (announcements only) without payment cannot be considered.Please fill-in the desired round in the participation template.It needs 3 confirmations for the amount sent to be credited to the MRR account.We use FIFO (First-In-First-Out) so simply said first come, first served   If someone has not made it for a run, simply queue and wait for the next run.Each run is executed sequentially and never concurrently, so one round after another.The payout address used on the soloCK pool is as follows. I assure with the signature that I am the owner of the keys and therefore the owner of the address:Code:Message: \"This bitcoin address is owned by citb0in@bitcointalk.org and is used as payout address for the solomining group BLOCK SOLVERS.\"Bitcoin address: \"1BTC4ALL6a2K1d4Ac4JjNJX7pgfRaaaZNd\"Signature: \"IC3+y9XCDP8bVJOWMGAs8rJvzSVfKoZMtGzTptCTgmgPcpxTxl2BCdoXGwYghtTwn6PS4iq3h+xCcnL8DcsAZAQ=\"When participating, you have to enter your Bitcoin address to which you wish to receive the payout in case we solve a block. The payout amount will be paid out proportionally to the members of the corresponding round.The payout takes place at the earliest after 100 confirmed blocks from block hit, this is defined by default in the Bitcoin protocol. This means that if we get a block solved, the reward will be sent by the coinbase transaction to the above payout address and only after another 100 blocks can this amount be used to sent the winnings to the participants. This is equivalent to about 1 day. I would like to mention this for the sake of order, because some may not know.And last but not least, please vote for a hashrate in PH/s that you would prefer for the corresponding round. This will be voted and announced before the start which hashrate we will start for the respective round. The information in the following overview may vary depending on market prices, but offers an approximate guideline for our voting:QuoteFor the standard rounds with 0.001 BTC stake:10 PH/s for approx. 5 hours5 PH/s for approx. 9.5 hours2.5 PH/s for approx. 19 hours2 PH/s for approx. 22 hours1 PH/s for approx. 50 hoursFor the rounds with 0.002 BTC stake:.20 PH/s for approx. 7.5 hours10 PH/s for approx. 9.5 hours5 PH/s for approx. 19 hours2.5 PH/s for approx. 41 hoursFor the rounds with 0.003 BTC stake:.50 PH/s for approx. 3 hours25 PH/s for approx. 6 hours10 PH/s for approx. 10.5 hours5 PH/s for approx. 28 hoursChance calculation to hit a block in solo mining using different hashrate examples:at   1 PH/s --> 1 in 267.342 per block or 1 in 1.857 per 24hat 2.5 PH/s --> 1 in 106,937 per block or 1 in   743 per 24hat   5 PH/s --> 1 in  53,468 per block or 1 in   371 per 24hat  10 PH/s --> 1 in  26,734 per block or 1 in   186 per 24hat  25 PH/s --> 1 in  10,694 per block or 1 in    74 per 24hat  50 PH/s --> 1 in   5,347 per block or 1 in    37 per 24hFor this reason I personally favor higher hashrates and accept the shorter runtime for it. The chances are then simply better.

I manage all data about the group, the runs, the individual deposits with information like name, amount, TXIDs, etc. in a spreadsheet in Libreoffice Calc, so that I always have insight. There I also manage the individual rentals with corresponding details like start/end time, hashrate, costs, etc. I will try to keep the hard facts of each run clearly organized on post #2, so that there is no need to search laboriously in dozens of sub-pages of this thread. So all the info about the runs will be here on this thread in post #2.This is the API URI for the live report of our runs:Quotehttps://solo.ckpool.org/users/1BTC4ALL6a2K1d4Ac4JjNJX7pgfRaaaZNdThis can be queried at any time by anyone (even with a mobile phone) and shows the status of the current run but also the historical runs. Anyone interested in learning to understand the meaning of these values and how they are interpreted, can read my HowTo (in german). The most important and entertaining values are \"bestShare\", \"shares\" and \"bestEver\". If you have any questions about this info page, just post them in the corresponding thread. Currently, of course, the link goes nowhere because no run has started yet and no historical data is available. As soon as we start our first run, the data will appear under this link. In addition, I will name the individual runs with the help of the worker names clearly and meaningfully. For example, if we should start our first run with 2.5 PH/s and 19h runtime, then as suffix the worker name will be as follows:.RUN001-2500THs-19hFor example, if the second run should start at 5 PH/s for 10h, then the workername will be:.RUN002-5PHs-10hAs a result, we have a static and therefore fixed live report URL that does not change and can therefore be saved as a favorite in anyone's Internet browser on the PC or mobile phone to see at any time how the current run or the previous runs have gone. Based on the worker names, you can then distinguish and see the hashrate and duration used for the respective rounds.Wishlist, Comments, Final WordsIf there are any change requests or further ideas, I am of course all ears and open for feedback. Let's decide and vote together and I can gladly implement the results into the thread here by updating it. Finally, despite my due diligence, a short disclaimer: I cannot accept any liability for damage or loss of any kind, please only participate if you agree. Despite the obligatory disclaimer I still want to assure that I will manage this project to the best of my knowledge and conscience as I myself am very interested in a long-term and hopefully successful cooperation. In conclusion: In case of a block hit I would be very happy about a small donation as a thank you for the organizational administration effort, my address can be found in my profile If there are any questions, just let me know. I look forward to an adventurous and hopefully successful experience. Let's go miners ! Let's mine those blocks . . .",

Fasten your seatbelts, it's about to start .......EDITOur maiden flight is launched at 05:07 PM and the cloud layer has just been broken. We launched 2.5 PH/s for a total of 20h and 38min.At the beginning the takeoff jerked a bit because the diff was not adjusted immediately. Hashrate can and will fluctuate during the run. So don't be surprised if we get up to 4-5 PH/s  provided by the rig owner for a short time due to the bumpy start. Because the overall result after the end of the run must correspond to the advertised/promised average rate of 2.5PH/s. This means that the rig owner sometimes turns on the tap a bit, so that more hashrate flows and the average hashrate thus equals the booked hashrate. This then always oscillates a little above and below. Just follow it in the live feed. Enjoy the great view and stay tuned...==> Live API URI on SoloCK Pool <===May the force be with us",

      "body": "@mikeywith:Thanks for your feedback, really appreciate your thoughts. Your suggestion is justified. We had already talked about this in the original post in the German subforum, CoinEraser also suggested that. I had thought about that as well, I think Willi would certainly support that as well. I also thought about a solution of using MultiSig with Willy together and stuff like that. However, following dilemma remains: Because with an escrow service, I would never get the opportunity to build up my trust status step-by-step. I would always be dependent on third parties and the trust in me would not grow a step through it, regardless of whether we hit a block or not.I just have to go through it and hope for trust. I can't force it in any case. Hopefully, some will dare to do so because of the low stakes. I myself hope of course that we will solve a block some day, on the one hand because I wish it anyway, but above all because then I will get the opportunity to prove whether it was right to put trust in me. So if we get the first block hit and I pay out all members, the trust would increase very strongly and rapidly, we are talking about high amounts after all. In such a case, of course, I also wish that the corresponding winners leave a positive feedback on the boards trust system. On the other hand, I could also be a bad boy and in case of a block hit I would keep the reward myself and never show my face here again. Yes, everything is conceivable, and as a participant you are right to worry about that. However, due to the low stake of 0.001 BTC, the risk is very very small. I think that's why the response was so great and it started very well so that the boat was quickly full. Without trust, of course, this does not work. Therefore, I had also stated in the disclaimer, if someone has doubts please do not even join.At this point I can only emphasize once again that I run this time-intensive project with the best knowledge and conscience and will do everything to make everyone happy. I try hard, I like to learn and I am open for everything, also for criticism. Members from the German forum may be able to attest that I am very dedicated and have a steep learning curve. I hope that I can continue to make a positive contribution to this forum and that this will make some of us happy with a potential win.Quote from: mikeywith on November 05, 2022, 02:12:04 AMNice detailed thread, perhaps you should sum it up, you know, we human beings nowadays don't seem to have enough mood to spare on reading long threads.I would like to present everything as clearly and transparently as possible to those who are interested, so that no questions remain unanswered. Otherwise, I will be confronted with DM and recurring same questions. By the detailed explanation and description, the interested person can divide the time and read through if interested or not. This is not intended for someone who has no time to invest for reading and understand what this is all about and how things work. I myself would not send bitcoins to a complete stranger without knowing the details. Everyone is different, some want to know only superficially, some with details. I prefer the latter, because that covers both sides  Quote from: kano on November 05, 2022, 03:59:50 AMWell, we've been running a fun run like this on kano.is since early in the year (0.0006 per person x 10)The main difference is that on kano.is you get to see all the stats, not just 'at the moment' with no history and the false luck stats of that other solo pool and it's false claim of anonymity.

You have already received a very accurate and true reply that hits the nail on the head. By the way, CK speaks clear and transparent words on the bottom of its website:QuoteThere is no need to worry about passwords, logins, withdrawals, authentication or pool wallet hacks. You remain anonymous apart from your btc address.Everyone knows that in Bitcoin you are not anonymous but pseudonymous. Despite this, I prefer to mine with my own address on a pool and know that any profit would be transferred directly to the address I provided. Correct me if I'm wrong, but on your pool you can't mine directly with your own address but any profit goes directly to a bitcoin address controlled by you --> 1Cz6q6YqxmXbV8aFnQKFftMykFFBdt1Jtw. If you die in an accident or something else bad happens, your users would have a long time to hope for their profit payout. And as for the \"anonymity\" issue you always try to pick on, if I'm not mistaken then you require your users to create a Discord key so you can exclude them from the timeout limit which you created where they get kicked when not identified. The user who registered on your pool gets an ID from your website and you unlock him for Discord use. So you have a direct assignment of all your Discord users to the corresponding account on your Kano website. Masks down, right? So I don't understand why you are trying so hard to defend the word \"anonymity\" when you yourself are doing everything you can to break it. We all know you have personal disputes with Con Kolivas (CK pool). I would politely ask you, in the interest of all forum users, to keep your personal differences with -CK- to yourself and not hijack and abuse other threads with content about CK and his pool to do so. I hope and thank you for your understanding.@jbrogan:Thank you so much for joining. You're registered and ready for rounds #002-006.

Ask in Discord.You can also get simple support on the Bitcoin talk forum here: BitcoinTalkHowever, use Discord for all support if possible, since Discord is interactive.Secondly, sorry but that's how discord works, if you don't have a role, you can be timed out.Oddly enough, there's people who join and don't get a role and stick around without that happening also.I don't even know why people without a role get timed out, you'd have to go ask Discord.The 10 minute thing is simply a setting that says you can't post until 10 minutes after you join.While you have no idea about dealing with spam, hackers, bots and such, that 10 minute setting I have enabled seems to stop that happening in the Discord channel.Over the many years there's been very few such issues (but not zero)Quote from: citb0in on November 05, 2022, 09:46:16 AM So I don't understand why you are trying so hard to defend the word \"anonymity\" Odd you should say that. I'm not defending it anywhere, I'm pointing out how it doesn't exist.Quote from: citb0in on November 05, 2022, 09:46:16 AMI would politely ask you, in the interest of all forum users, to keep your personal differences with -CK- to yourself and not hijack and abuse other threads with content about CK and his pool to do so. I hope and thank you for your understanding.And yet ... I'm not doing that.You seem to be the one ranting at me for some unknown reason.I noticed you glossed over the fact that you get false stats from that pool",

Fasten your seatbelts, it's about to start .......EDITOur maiden flight is launched at 05:07 PM and the cloud layer has just been broken. We launched 2.5 PH/s for a total of 20h and 38min.At the beginning the takeoff jerked a bit because the diff was not adjusted immediately. Hashrate can and will fluctuate during the run. So don't be surprised if we get up to 4-5 PH/s  provided by the rig owner for a short time due to the bumpy start. Because the overall result after the end of the run must correspond to the advertised/promised average rate of 2.5PH/s. This means that the rig owner sometimes turns on the tap a bit, so that more hashrate flows and the average hashrate thus equals the booked hashrate. This then always oscillates a little above and below. Just follow it in the live feed. Enjoy the great view and stay tuned...==> Live API URI on SoloCK Pool <===May the force be with us    citb0in Musk ...Though to the Moon for this trip Good concept - which has been around for some time, but if it is a well oiled machine it should be a nice way to Gamble on the Block #crysx #cwi",

Unfortunately no block hit  The total diff submitted was 40.72 G which is quite good. This is so far just below the best value from run #001, where we had 2.54 T as best share. In run #004 we had a hashrate average of 5.1 PH/s, which equals 102.03%, so we did really well.Maybe we can do one more run so we can enjoy a nice Christmas present ?
