What do you think is the reason? Has bitcointalk lost it's charm? What charm exactly mate?  Are you forgetting there's an altcoins session on the forum. If you check properly, you will find so many new project creating Ann threads over there. The reason might just be simply because there There are so many failed crypto projects over the years and there aren't any more trusted altcoins projects available. Because of this, more people are beginning to adopt Bitcoin instead, which I think is good news.",

      "body": "One reason I can get is the fact that these projects actually found out that the Bitcointalk forum just as the name implies has shifted its focus totally to bitcoin only related issues and the alternative cryptocurrencies are not getting the attention they deserve. And for a wide coverage of their project they go to maybe other forum to advertise their projects and works. I don’t see this as Bitcointalk losing it charm but rather it’s members putting their focus fully into bitcoin only. There is this dashboard that shows the number of daily registered members (I can’t find it yet) and it is still increasing which shows that this forum still has its charm",

What do you think is the reason? Has bitcointalk lost it's charm? There are projects that made announcements in the forum but the market is bearish and those new projects haven't gotten much hype in the market which is why you are seeing them this way. Another possible explanation is that there are so many marketing options available right now that new project don't want to spend their time designing an announcement thread for their project. Whichever case there is bitcointalk is not only an announcement thread for a new project. There are other useful aspects of this forum that should not be overshadowed.",

What do you think is the reason? Has bitcointalk lost it's charm? Transparency!!!Transparency plays a pivotal role in the evolving dynamics of crypto project announcements. On Bitcointalk, the scrutiny is intense; a single comment from an established member can swiftly expose any discrepancies, potentially derailing a project’s launch. Bitcointalk still has a big matured audience and the stakes for transparency have risen.In the current landscape, a significant portion of new crypto projects falls into the trap of being perceived as scams. This is largely because many fail to articulate clear goals and transparent token distribution strategies to their users. Bitcointalk community members are increasingly demanding a higher standard of information, and platforms that can meet these expectations effectively become the preferred choice.While Bitcointalk has historical significance, but yes the charm of Bitcointalk for new crypto project announcements has diminished.",

If these are the projects you mention, then there is no harm to the forum, considering the reputation of most of these \"crypto projects\" which mostly only contribute to the fact that the average person gets a very distorted image of Bitcoin. In fact, the less they are promoted here, the better for the forum's reputation and even better for all those desperate people who serve as cheap (or even free) labor in their bounty campaigns.Quote from: libert19 on November 29, 2023, 07:37:57 AMWhat do you think is the reason? Has bitcointalk lost it's charm? If you have a legitimate project that you want to advertise and promote, then this is definitely not the case. However, I think that forums as such are increasingly losing their charm, considering that new generations want something else like FB, Telegram and similar things. But in the end, as I already said, it is not a bad thing for the forum.",

Bitcointalk is a Bitcoin Talk Forum and mainly for Bitcoin.Altcoins in the past, made their announcements here because VCs, Labs were not common and had big capital for cryptocurrency investments like we saw since 2020 bull run. Big altcoin projects have other places to build their communities and raised fund for their projects but does it affect Bitcointalk?I think it is good for Bitcointalk because there will be less spammers join the forum. There are still altcoin projects have their bounties in Bitcointalk but they are not big ones.Altcoins even they are big and top altcoins, can die and lose their top positions. Bitcoin stays at a first position since 2009 and Bitcointalk is a biggest, most iconic cryptocurrency forum.",

Yeah most of them either ended up as failures of downright scams. You are right they losing their habit of coming here, but they are doing this because they are getting \"Victims\" to scam here with their vaporware and rugpulls.If you have a community which is hardened enough to call out every other scam from the core and expose their red flags, you would not want to come there unless you have a legitimate project at hand that you are proud of.I would rather see a handful of legit projects run their ANNs here than a multitude of scams run their bullshit.",

Many platforms and channels have emerged for project announcements, such as on social media. They prefer to promote their projects there because they know there are many potential victims. We know that most emerging crypto projects are not beneficial, as their sole purpose is to take investors' money. They avoid announcing on Bitcointalk because they know that veterans and experts in evaluating crypto projects are present here.",

What do you think is the reason? Has bitcointalk lost it's charm? Too many shitcoin and scam projects has made altcoins lose its appeal on Bitcointalk. There are two theories:1. There have been too many disappointments and scams when it comes to new altcoin projects. Even if the altcoin project is really interesting with an awesome team, people on Bitcointalk will no longer want to risk their time/money.2. Most projects are not good enough to pass our community scrutiny. Thats why they are not going to expose themselves here on Bitcointalk in the first place. Social Media is more blurry in that regard. As long as something is trending, people will believe it is good.",

First of all, bitcointalk community is more vigilant when it comes to altcoin projects, meaning scambusters will check almost all new projects and if there are some red flags (and in many cases there are), altcoin reputation will immediately go down the toilet.2nd reason is that in the past those altcoin projects simply didn't have any other platforms to promote crypto, so where else to go other than bitcointalk. Situation changed now and there is plenty of competition that wasn't popular ~10 years ago.3rd reason is that bitcointalk community is generally not altcoin friendly and focused more on bitcoin, meaning its a waste of time and money to promote altcoins here and it still baffles me how bounty managers still manage to sell campaigns to their clients.Last but not the least, forums are not as popular as they used to be 10 years ago (I would say that golden age of forums was 15+ years ago when fewer people had access to internet meaning more quality discussions) so its only natural that bitcointalk is not as popular as it used to be,",

Bitcointalk still remains the number one place that projects do launches but what you have to understand is how often people gets information to come here to announce their projects I can freely say that most project that came here to launch is either a direct reference or maybe such people already had knowledge of this forum will make them to launch their project here. Then secondly most project doesn't have that enough fund for marketing, basically for a project to gain audience here is when they run an promotional campaign and this could be signature or bounty and for bounty's I think they need to hire a manager who is well exposed to this forum. Otherwise those projects only announces themselves on social media especially Twitter (X) and any other social medial platform that allows promotion of cryptocurrencies.",
