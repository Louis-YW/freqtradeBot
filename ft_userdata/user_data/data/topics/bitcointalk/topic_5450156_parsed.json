As you've said that you've reinstalled it to fix the matter, it's likely that the case was the version that you've got and you've missed the update. That might be the cause of delay as to why Electrum don't open on your case but then in conclusion if it's the latest version and you're sure of it, take it that the suggestion of the friends we've said in here that it's a plausible hardware issue where your PC is the culprit of its delay. If you've got some other laptop or desktop, you may try to have some experiment for which can validate that it's your PC that's causing the delay.",

If you're sure the capacity of your computer shouldn't be the issue since Electrum is a light wallet.You can try this method. Uninstall Electrum and copy your Electrum folder from \"C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Electrum\" to the desktop of your computer. Once you've done that, try reinstalling the Electrum wallet and make sure you don't delete the folder from C: because it contains your wallet file.",

So I don't do what you did, like installing and uninstalling it.They just had a recent update though, you may want to check it and see if it an fixed the issues?And I'm assuming that you are using Windows as OS?",

The program hangs in the background, and each new click can cause an unnecessary load.In any case, if there are any problems with the launch of the wallet, I think you should think about reinstalling the system before it's too late. Maybe the computer has a virus that prevents it from starting, and soon the same problem may repeat itself, despite the fact that you updated the program.Do you have Windows 10 or 11? Since working on early versions lately often causes problems,I say this because I have a laptop with an old version of Windows 7, which I'm too lazy to replace. The laptop lies unnecessarily, but every time I turn to it, it keeps hinting at me to install a new version of Windows. Although all my working machines work without problems, only on Linux,",

The plan is that today I will try again on my smartphone before I try to make it on my PC, hopefully there will be no problems like yesterday again.When you create a wallet on your smartphone, does the application suddenly appear on the main screen?The solution is that you can repeat again with the condition that when you enter the stage (Do you want to create a new seed, or restore a wallet using an existing seed?) you select the option (I already have a seed).Re-enter the 12 word seed that you have saved and proceed as the application commands.If you create a Multi-signature wallet initially, it will ask you for your GA code and password later. You only need to enter it if you have created it once.This is my experience on the latest version of Electrum.Since my smartphone doesn't support screenshots, I can't show the steps via pictures.",

I wonder what version you are on, is it the latest one?  Assuming it's the last one, If you have an old OS, an outdated one it'll probably cause issues when lunching electrum. It could be anything that causes the problem tho but I'm glad that you fixed it with a Fresh install again, but try to have a back up wallet in your device so you wouldn't need to use your seed phrase if your wallet will have problems again in the future to minimize the risk.",
