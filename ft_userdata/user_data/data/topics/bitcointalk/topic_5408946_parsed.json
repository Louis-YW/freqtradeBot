A link to the github sourceMany exchanges only show #1 and #2, at most.With some coins having ambiguous names and/or ticker symbols, you could be confident with this extra information that you and the exchange were both using the exact same coin, and your client was properly synced relative to the exchange's client.Curious if any currently open altcoin exchanges provide this level of detail?",

Not a place for reseach. Places where you can find all above informations are:https://coinmarketcap.com/https://www.coingecko.com/https://www.livecoinwatch.com/https://coinpaprika.com/And many more. Having this data on exchange is not as important as exchange volume/liquidity/reputation/fees.",

Pretty cool imoI hope this is what you were looking for.",

I currently have 166 coin clients installed, but most of their blockchains are dead, and very few are still listed on an exchange.I'd prefer to find an exchange I like and work backwards to see what coins they have available, rather than find a coin via a third party then figure out the exchange(s) to use for it.I know it seems like a weird approach, but remember my perspective is like that of a multipool operator, rather than a retail investor.",

What if the exchange volume is fake because there are many incidents proved that most exchanges fake the trading volume and also report fake prices just to boost the coin sales for a while.",
