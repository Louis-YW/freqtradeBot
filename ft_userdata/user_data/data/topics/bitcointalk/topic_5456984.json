Your topic should be under beginners and help or possibly altcoins discussion, for I can't think of Bitcoin having any other projects or even Web 3 projects that it could connect to.Most scam projects can easily be detected by their numerous fake promises, which could sound too good to be true, not even having any good use cases, but yet you can see the project being hyped by many paid advertisers. But most projects these days appear to really be true, with great potential for team planning and developing real things, but at the end of the day all they are actually after is to rug pull and run. So one just needs to be careful before they make any investment in any project; personal research should be done in order to reduce the risk of being a scam victim.",

Check any HoneyPots using Dex Analyzers like TokeNSniffer, WuikIntel, HoneyPot.is etc3. Check their activities in TG, Twitter4. Check their Tokenomics and justification if they want to hold some tokens5. Check initial tradings of the coin and find out any trends like they are purposefully pumping to dump or other patterns.6. Importantly, their project should have Sustainable Earning and Return to investors Model else it will be like Octopus eating himself7. Invest only you can loose if you trust the project.",

Yes new projects have some red flags that we investors are putting into it, but the reality is, we don't know if a particular project is a scam or not until they will do it. Though there are still some projects that are obviously a scam, I always give them the benefit of the doubt. I guess it's because I'm not investing into new projects that's why that's  the way I think. If only there is somebody who can predict the future, and tell which are scam project, and which are not then nobody is getting scammed in investing into new projects by now. We've seen projects in the past that has a kind of legit, a bit trusted, active developers, and yet they still scammed people.",

The background from the developers matters a lot in this case. As long as people behind the project has very good background and they will be doing something stupid to destroy their reputation. Just try to remind you that as we have hundreds of new projects come everyday. This is very difficult to knew whether the project used fake identities or not. Quote from: krishnaverma on June 20, 2023, 02:04:31 PM2) Asking about the project on forums like bitcointalk where more experienced members can give proper advice. Many people in here have been experiencing in the altcoins project started from icos trend a few years ago.

The airdrop hunters are spamming their tweets. Yes this is really happening so I suggest to never use their social media presence as a major metric in assessing a project's legitimacy. Some people use it as reference if there is enough hype to invest in a token but for short term only. They buy before the train takes off and sell when more hype is created  - pump and dump purpose only for short.",

What tips you will give to a new investor to identify scam projects early ? Aside from the mentioned points for altcoin investors to avoid scam project, we still have a few red flags which i may likely point out which is promises on a certain % profits when listed, because we have some pump and dump scam that already promised a certain predetermined coin value.This is all a plot to sway investors into putting down huge amount into the investment and coin during the pre-sale period and at the end the coin when listed will get dumped by the team who will pull an exit one on everyone,",

The project's tokens are sold exclusively through the site, which can sometimes be freshly registered. The number of Twitter followers is fake. The project's website is single-page and some information is presented as pictures, not hyperlinks, when you go to which you can check the information provided.

I think first of all it is important to mention, that even if you do your own research as thoroughly as possible, then there is still a chance, that you will become a victim of a scam. So only invest money into crypto that you can afford to lose completely.My second recommendation would be to never invest into meme-coins. 99.9% of them are scams or dead within a few hours or days.Also don't believe the follower numbers on Twitter. Followers can be bought or boosted with airdrops for example.",

He won't have any measures to compare one coin to another, because he doesn't know anything yet. For that reason, I would advise him to start investing only in Bitcoin. And only when he gets used to it and experienced about conversations involving altcoins I would suggest him to select some altcoins for his portfolio, following the guidelines mentioned by OP on this thread.Some things can't be rushed. Time is needed until the investor learns and understands the difference between a promising and unfavorable coin/token, until he learns what is a coin, token, stablecoin, memecoin and their respective features such as PoW, PoS... If you supply too much information at same time, trying to help, he will just get confused.",

It is necessary to research everything before deciding to buy, there are criteria about team, community, token, potential, ... for basic assessment.
