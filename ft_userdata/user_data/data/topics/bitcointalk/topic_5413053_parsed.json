If it's a question I would recommend that you check out these threads various P2P marketplaces where mentioned aside form Localbitcoin:Re: Buying crypto in USA or canadaHelp: A list of LocalBitcoin alternatives (P2P marketplaces) While if it's a guide; firstly you could make some amendment by starting with the topic name, rather than \"Hello guys\" you could use \"few things I do to avoid been scammed on Localbitcoin.\" And again the guides you provided are like the basic warning most P2P EXCHANGES give as soon as you're logged in.",

The person on the other end could always try to trick you. The most common scheme i see is either the chargeback scam or the fake notification for payments in order to trick you to release the escrow. You can look up threads about this in reddit and/or bitcointalk.Quote from: noorman0 on September 10, 2022, 01:36:09 PMI prefer decentralized p2p exchanges like hodlhodl.comHodlhodl relies on centralized servers, can ask KYC, ban countries, so it's not decentralized.",

Check them out!QuoteBut if I will do any fraudulent activity and any security institution will ask information so Binance or other exchanges will share my information.I'm afraid sharing of information isn't done strictly on the basis of fraud. I guess massive amount of personal information are shared in the name of national security. And I guess many of these privacy breaches are in line with mere fishing expeditions.",

I shocked when I see Kucoin in the list.But I think for P2P KYC should be  compulsory to stop the fraudulent activities. Due to KYC the fraud ratio comes down.
