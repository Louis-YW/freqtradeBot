  "content": "What happened::delay payment and block my account Scammers Profile Link: trustdice.win Reference Link: my login on trustdice: Laki21000 Amount Scammed: 2138$ USDT, my current balance is 800 dollars on balance, 1338 on withdrawal pending. https://imgur.com/a/OtxLB4L Payment Method: TRC-20 USDT Proof of Payment: https://imgur.com/a/fQf5DBl PM/Chat Logs: https://imgur.com/a/fQf5DBl   (Here are all the screenshots that are needed, I will add screenshots in separate posts if necessary)  Additional Notes:Hello, everyone, I registered on trustdice in early November, made bets, played sports, for my entertainment, I love American sports, I bet on American football, NBA, it happened on European basketball, there were no problems, but every time everything became delay payments more and more often, first for a day, then for two days of payment. As a result, this Saturday I made a withdrawal for 1338 dollars, and I had 500 usdt left so that I could play more, make bets, but I still waited for the withdrawal, I could not restrain myself and decided to bet on American football, and I also won and I became 800 dollars on the balance sheet, and 1338 pending for withdrawal, as a result, they have now requested KYC, I successfully sent the required documents, but they ignore me for the 2nd day, they don’t answer, they say wait, they didn’t even write to me that my documents have come for consideration, I’m very worried, I am an ordinary player who found this site on bitcointalk, I was in the gambling section and was looking for a suitable site for betting, I see there are a lot of good reviews, there are also a lot of good reviews on trustpilot. I actively bet for a whole month, won, lost, but each time they began to withdraw more and more slowly, I'm not an abuser, I didn't use bonuses, because I don't know how to wager them, I received their internal currency and staked it, made bets and that's it, in the end, when my amount reached $ 2,000, they decided to freeze me. If everything is decided and my money is withdrawn, I will be happy, because I won it honestly. P.S I'm sorry if I wrote something bad, I'm writing a message through a translator, I don't know English. _____________________After 2 weeks of discussions TrustDice made a withdraw of my funds with a bonus of 100$ USDT, however I ask everyone to come here and read the entire message thread so that you understand everything",

      "body": "Hello there,TrustDice team here. We are experiencing a high volume of withdrawals at the moment due to the world cup. While most withdrawals get approved instantly, some withdrawals require manual inspection. Please be assured that your withdrawal will be accepted if everything looks good. Best,TrustDice Team-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Final Update Dec 19, 2022:Upon reviewing OP's submitted info, we discussed with our sports provider as soon as possible to re-evaluate the decision. As a result of such discussion, we have decided to unblock OP's account, return the confiscated funds, and have informed the OP at the first opportunity. We also sent $100 withdraw-able bonus to OP's account to compensate for the inconvenience caused by all the these.It is our understanding that OP has initiated a withdrawal, which has been approved. As the below TX id suggests, the transaction has now been completed:https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/603bc06c1665a40215a4e01e163f1bc9c32ab83e5f800be2592bb4be186fcda5This means OP has received his full balance, plus $100 bonus.We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused and will work hard to improve our sports betting anti-abuse systems.Sincerely,TrustDice Team--------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Bitcointalk community,Throughout this entire thread, we discussed with Mr. Pmalek about this case for days. However, as Mr. Pmalek started to distort our words and put words in our mouths, the conversation gets increasingly non-constructive and unproductive. Having this type of conversation is inconsistent with how we do business, therefore we eventually decide to stop participating in this thread.Here is an example of how Mr. Pmalek distorts our words.We said: Quote from: Coinbox1 on December 13, 2022, 04:03:39 PMI no longer watch NBA these days, but when I did, delays of over 10 minutes were rare. Then Mr. Pmalek started to distort the meaning of that sentence:Quote from: Pmalek on December 14, 2022, 07:56:23 AMYou just said in your previous sentence that from your experience NBA matches begin later than expected, even if only 10 minutes. No, we didn’t say \"NBA matches begin later than expected\". We said “delays of over 10 minutes were rare.\" In English, when we say something is \"rare\", it means the thing is very unusual. It doesn't mean the thing's opposite definitely always happens. So when we say \"delays of over 10 minutes were rare\", it means \"delays of over 10 minutes\" are very unusual. It doesn't mean \"delays of below 10 minutes\" definitely always happens. For everyone's reference, here comes a ink to Cambridge Dictionary. Sadly, instead of examining his own behaviors, Mr. Pmalek decided to strike first and accuse us first. This is his accusation:Quote from: Pmalek on December 14, 2022, 07:56:23 AMDon't try to twist my words please. But let's take a look at what he said:Quote from: Pmalek on December 12, 2022, 03:08:21 PMI am familiar with the MLS, NBA, and NHL (I can't say anything for other leagues/sports), and they always begin with a delay. That can be as little as 10 minutes or even up to 30-40 mins.So they clearly include NBA. And that means the delay of they. So Mr. Pmalek did mean \"NBA always begin with a delay\". And we understood he meant it and we asked a follow-up question. But it is where he claims we twisted his words:Quote from: Coinbox1 on December 13, 2022, 04:03:39 PMTherefore, could you kindly provide a reliable source of statistics supporting the claim that NBA games \"always begin with a delay\" and \"can be as little as 10 minutes or even up to 30-40 mins\"? As explained above, his sentences did mean \"NBA always begin with a delay\", then, strangely enough, he accuses us of saying so. So forgive us that we have to refute such false accusation. In addition, we notice that Mr. holydarkness is also behaving in a similar manner. --------------------------------------------------------------------------Make no mistake, someone else's behavior won't affect OP's case. We still look forward to resolving this issue with the OP, who’s been labelled as abuser by our sports provider initially. If anyone can find following information, please feel free to send to info@trustdice.win so we can forward it to our sports provider for them to reconsider:- The actual time the game was delayed.- The exact score and countdown at 3:54 a.m. (UTC) on December 1, when the OP placed his bet.- The exact time the timer started running and the actual length of the game.Sincerely,TrustDice Team",

Too many results in the favour of underdogs should make you a lot of money. 😉Sorry about off-topic. Sometimes people are too impatience and you have to deal with them.

Now I see that trustdice just blatantly cheated me, I gave them all my data, I played with them for a whole MONTH, withdrew money, and as soon as they had the opportunity to steal my huge amount, they did it. In the past they have withdrawn 1000~ usdt, now they seem to be having a hard time when they need to cheat players.",

I understand you mean that I put the original result on the result? i.e. known in advance? do you mean it? And I, too, am shocked by these statements. Yes, I'm ready for you to provide it, however, I no longer trust you because you can now provide any screenshots, edited, created specifically to mislead. If you are talking about the NCAA American Football Carolina Troy match, the last match, then how can I know the result in advance?)) Yes, I placed this bet at the end of the match, I placed it live, I watched this match. What kind of delays do I use explain? I have no idea what it is, I will repeat again for all users. I am an ordinary player, a gambler. I sit and play for my pleasure. I am ready to listen to all claims, I give the green light to the provision of my personal data if it helps to return my money won in an honest way. I played at many bookmakers, but to lie so blatantly and make me guilty of what I did not do is nonsense. I bet on popular matches, I took screenshots of bets and posted them to the public, I bet exclusively on the NBA, European leagues, and American football, do you think it is possible there, as the bookmaker’s representative says, “late bets”, on championships that are top 1 among all, where I THINK it is unrealistic to do. I still think that the screenshots will be ridiculous, or fake, but I agree to provide them.Please note. I just calculated my balance and I'm up about ~$1,300. We can assume that I spent the whole month that I bet with them, I was about in the red, or stayed at the level of a slight minus, I want to remind the community that the whole month that I bet, they calmly all withdrawn money to me, without problems. As soon as I got a plus, which of course is unprofitable for trustdice, they love it when players only lose, but do not want to honestly pay out the winnings, they begin to come up with incomprehensible rules that I violated. Judging by because he writes search5, he compared them with other casinos, so I went to them, and they have the same line, so they take matches, odds from the supplier, well, why didn’t the odds supplier limit me limits? why didn't the supplier return the bids at the moment when I allegedly violated the rules? right because I did not violate anything and these are inventions that do not just want to withdraw money to me. I'm not hiding anything, but I had one return bet. Yes I registered an account at the beginning of November and it was the second or third bet after registering, I remember that I bet on Sacramento Golden State, Sacramento won that they would win in the first half, then the bet was returned, I don’t know if it was a mistake , however, they gave me a refund and I did not write anything. There has never been a return since.PS My subjective opinion is that the bookmaker simply decided to take my money under the pretext of violating the rules, as soon as I got a plus they decided to confiscate the money. If I was in the red, I would be sure that I would continue to sit and play with them further, I am 100% sureQuote from: Coinbox1 on December 06, 2022, 03:02:54 PMit is making a bet after the time when information have become available, including the outcome of the event, that was not available to those making earlier bets. It is considered cheating.Please tell us how you can know the result in advance in American football? in nba basketball? Am I at a match? I live in America? no. I live in Russia, I place bets from a computer while watching the broadcast, it’s physically impossible, even if I assume that I made late bets, then I need to be at the stadium or at the match itself, but then I’m sitting at home in Russia, I even have US visas no, and how can you make late bets, in the nba? top 1 basketball championship, where points I think are counted instantly after the throwMoreover, I watch broadcasts on Betfury, but I sit and watch broadcasts there, because they have broadcasts, unlike your site, it happens on roletto, and then I find out about the NBA timeout only after 1-2 minutes, because everything practically delayed broadcasts, but what am I talking about, you made charges that do not belong to me. nonsense!",

Quote from: Laki21000 on December 06, 2022, 03:30:09 PMYes, I placed this bet at the end of the matchSuch conduct is standard late betting abuse, which our T&C forbids, and he agreed to not engage in when he signed up. He has publicly admitted that he engaged in activities that violate our T&C, thus I think there is no need for further explanations. With that being said, as the OP insists, I have forwarded OP's request for private info disclosure to our CEO and will update this thread if a permission is granted. Thank you.TrustDice TeamAhahahaha, are you serious? I use a translator, you are a Russian-speaking trustdice administrator, and you understand everything what dirty games you play. I meant that I bet on the ncaa carolina match three, when there were about 10 minutes left until the end of the match. If the translator does not translate well, I will describe everything in more detail so that you do not think something is wrong. You are a Russian-speaking administrator, and you know that I am Russian and use a translator, what a dirty game of you? https://imgur.com/a/PeDmXEcIf you turn on your head and think that I wrote it, it is clear that I did not put it when the match ended!, my words mean that the match was still going on and nearing the end, this means that there were about 10 minutes left until the end of the match.Late bets - judging by Wikipedia, these are bets on which you already know the outcome of the event, I didn’t do this and I didn’t bet it. You are taking my words out of context. I deny it completely, I didn’t put it, I’m an ordinary player, and you just decided to blatantly lie and deceive, attributing that I violated your conditions.",

As wikipedia explained, it is making a bet after the time when information have become available, including the outcome of the event, that was not available to those making earlier bets. It is considered cheating.This abuse practice particularly takes advantage of latency of internet and servers. Due to privacy concerns, we find ourselves reluctant to publicly disclose the OP's betting time stamps. However, we do have time stamps that clearly show OP only bets on games after or right before the game ends, which constitutes the late betting abuse that is forbidden by our T&C. We strongly advise against this, but if the OP approves to share his betting information publicly, I can discuss it with our CEO to see if we can make an exception and disclose some of his betting data, which overwhelmingly indicate late betting abuse.Thank you.TrustDiceSurprise, surprise, @Coinbox1 lied again.After analyzing OPs bets, the pattern is very clear. OP is betting on mispriced(+EV) lines during the timeouts/halftimes/delays.

Why don't they make returns? if not late bid? Just laughing. I'm also very curious how they then accept these overdue bets.... Why don't they make refunds? if it's late bets? @coinbox1, why are you silent?",
