US regulatory team is not favoring Crypto exchange and might be they thinking of ETF which will not be totally decentralized like crypto exchange.I haven't used this exchange as it was not allowed to do kyc in our country. I hope no one lost in this exchange as they allow customer to withdraw fund which is honest decision.",

It is sad news because Bittrex still has a chance to grow its business.But I don't know. We don't know the real reason that made them close their business. But at least Bittrex gives traders or investors the opportunity to withdraw all their assets before December 4. This could shake up the crypto market. We don't know who else will be next.I remember I made huge profits from Bittrex and that will be a great memory. Well, at least I thank Bittrex for helping me get those profits before I moved to Binance. Goodbye Bittrex.",

It didn't come as a surprise when I first read about the news, they had before now expressed interest of leaving the US after they were charged to court by the SEC some months ago for operating as an unregistered exchange.On the other hand, the window given for withdrawal of funds to me is a short one and should have been at least by the end of Dec, 2023, the Dec, 4th 2023 rather interprets how much they are in a hurry to leave the US and, I can't blame them for that.",

People that died or got incarcerated ECT.Could they possibly make more money from inactive accounts after winding down, than they would have made if they are still operating, this is a very strong claim. I know every centralized service that winds down, would surely have accounts that cannot withdraw their funds and the service would probably claim it, but does the amount really sum up to something substantial? There is no way to even be sure it does if you agree to that.There is currently no deadline on Bittrex withdrawals and i believe so many people who haven't used the exchange for a long time would try to log in and withdraw what they have remaining there after receiving the email, except it is dust that is below the minimum withdrawal.",

I thought Kucoin and Binance were launched in the same year and despite having similar operations like launchpad and token burning, even as Binance dominate, they remain relevant till today because they houses more low cap projects and many of them done well in performance. If Kucoin can survive all that, then they don't have excuse go fail, look even Houbi that was sold many times is functioning well.I like the way centralized exchanges are bitting the dust, it will bring more innovation about decentralized exchange that will be faster, secure and more easy to use like the way people value centralized exchanges. Especially now that CZ is not longer the face behind Binance, dex can do better to improve their services, they will get customers.",

It's not because another centralized exchange is about to die; it was because Bittrex played a central role in my newbie years. Although I ditched it a long time ago, the news evoked some nostalgia. One of my largest Bitcoin purchases in those early years was made there. And I also made some nice money with the platform. I can still remember those years when admission to the exchange more or less means the project has some potential or legit. And listing there is almost always followed by a strong pump. Bittrex wasn't as cheap as the likes of HitBTC back then. For an altcoin to make it to Bittrex means a lot.",
