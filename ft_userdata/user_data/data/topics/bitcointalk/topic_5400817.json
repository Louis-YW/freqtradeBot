In regards to the Bitcoin holder. This whales are institutional investors that keeps on feeding by the retail investors sold Bitcoin. They might be planning something that's why they are loading again but this kind of move is not good for retail investors that always play as an exit liquidity for whales.",

So, this current region where Btc has been revolving might be the bottom of this bearish period. Nevertheless, when Btc continue to dip, we are going to expect more accumulations. Bottom price wouldn't fall below $20k most probably, judging on how investors are reacting with the current Btc position.",

What is the maximum about of BTC these wallets can collect before their price increasing power diminishes? I believe probably when they buy almost the entire supply.One would think that would happen when they own near the total minted supply. We're already at 13 million out of 18 million collected by these wallets, maybe they got to get their hands on 1 or 2 million more BTC to push us out of the water.",

For every price drop notification I get a notification that the price is rising again, it's really funny. What surprises me the most is that so many big investors said they would buy heavily around the 20,000 USD barrier, but now they must have switched to 30,000 USD.

I suppose that when it started to fall it was because at least some of those people moved their bitcoins into liquid supply to sell them. I mean, this does not guarantee anything either. It's normal to have people buying if we are at a low price for this cycle, but you never know if some of those people who are buying are going to sell in a month or two because of some future event that we don't know about.",
