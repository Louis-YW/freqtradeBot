      "body": "The fourth element is now complete, bringing all four elements together. What's next? The fifth element is coming 100%, and the question is, will there be even more artworks beyond this fifth element?By the way, there's only one edition of the Water artwork left, and one is open for offers. To access the fifth element of Earth, you'll need to have all four artworks.And remember, while there's a 100% certainty of a fifth element, there might be even more artworks coming in this series, not just the hidden fifth element. These series will be very powerful ones. This is growing, and the only way to stop it is my death, but even after my passing, this will continue to flourish.",

Each flame symbolizes the fight against oppression, with Volcanic's legacy burning bright, purifying the world and illuminating the universe.I want to highlight the ongoing series because I'm currently collaborating on the fifth Element with my sensei. As a reminder, to unlock the special/bonus edition (fifth element), you'll need to possess the four artworks: water, earth, fire, and wind editions. This collection serves as the key to enter the Altar and claim the fifth artwork in the series.",

      "body": "Someone seized them all—the entire Earth Elements series—at the Bitcoin Citadel in Germany! Enchanted by the fire, he was captivated by the series to such an extent that he acquired every piece and now eagerly anticipates the fifth element. With three fire, three water, and so forth, only three sets of the fifth element exist. With 2/3 water already sold, his acquisition of all the initial pieces means that only the complete 3/3 set remains to obtain the fifth element. Otherwise, collectors must trade or assemble the complete series to acquire this masterpiece. He resonated with the essence of these series, understanding the narrative, and now eagerly awaits the fifth element. It was a delight to provide him with these artworks, and I'm certain he'll share an image with all of them together. Thank you and congratulations.",

      "body": "Hey everyone,The time has come for the fifth element! I'll be posting about it soon in a special thread. To collect the fifth element, you need to have matching numbers from each of the previous elements I created. The collector who has all the 1/3 numbers is okay with sharing this with the community, but there are still some matching numbers left, specifically, all the 3/3s are still available.For the 2/3 elements, there's a bit of a challenge, you'll need to make offers to the collector through Scarce City, because the Water 2/3 was SOLD at the Bitcoin conference in Miami.So, the fifth element is out there, but the question is: what comes next? Where are the collectors, and why did the four elements awaken this mysterious figure? And who is he? Why does he have this particular color? This is just the very beginning of the series, the story starts now, and there's much more art to come. The Pandora's box is open!Thank you to the collectors and congratulations on acquiring these unique pieces. All of them are interactive, with integrated Bitcoin wallets Looking forward to sharing more soon! BTC",
