      "body": "I would guess that they will try to expand as much as possible to lower the chance of any type of crash they could have and this prevention would help them more than it helps their customers. This defi structure would not be ideal for the customer because they can't be holding them accountable, they will say it is decentralized while also still profiting from each trade but the money will not be in their pockets.Basically it is the same profit but less responsibility for them and if anything happens the customers can't just knock on circles door and ask for a refund for their mistake, because circle will just go on with their day like they had nothing to do with it.",
