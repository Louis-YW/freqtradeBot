It may be able to heat hot water tanks.Our mine has 100kwatts of spare power. if a tank pulls 6kwatts we could do at least 12 maybe 15 tanks.Thus 12 x 200 = 2.4phAnd if we use m50s++12 x 250 = 3.0ph",

I set to normal speed and used the whatsminer's tool to lower watts to 3100 or less.  results below:So I save 300 watts and drop from 96.0 to 93.8.2 at this setting would likely be to hot for the cooler.but I do know that setting on low does 88.1 and 2850 watts which would be good for the cooler as 2x2850 = 5700 which is under the coolers 6000 watt spec.",

The cooler has the ability to heat in the winter and warm a pool in the summer. My partner \"buysolar\" has been doing solar setups in New Jersey for 20 years. We may work the angle a few ways.Also we may do a single whatsminer m50s+ overclocked if they supply a proper psu to do that.https://www.whatsminer.com/src/views/product_details?id=15&name=WhatsMiner%20M50S+what matters down the road  is how good the cooler is. It could be a bust.  which is why we got the m30s+ to test it just in case we don't like it.what I have found interesting is:'normal' and 3100 watts = good'normal' and 3050 watts = good'normal' and 3025 watts = testing now>>>> edit : now doing:unit 1 >>  92.509 th 32.56 watts a th and 3011 total wattsunit 2 >>  92.490 th 32.62 watts a th and 3017 total watts'normal' and 2950 watts = fail'normal' and 2900 watts = failthis is not to complain but may mean the cooler will struggle with 2 m30+ on normal and 6100 watts. Typical designed just a bit wrong and yet they push 2 whatsminers as a fit with the cooler. Likely need a quart more liquid and a little bit bigger radiator to be perfectnow on low setting I did 88 and 2875 watts which is 32.67 and 2 of them would be about 5750 watts.so low setting may be needed for the coolers.I will post back to see if I can play with settings a bit more.Maybe with a day of burn in I can set lower than 3025 watts on normal.",
