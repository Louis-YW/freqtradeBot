Thank you for your interest in Empire.io. We do reserve the right, yes, but in most cases it is only in rare cases like suspicious behaviour or fraud, for extra security. Each situation is handled on a case-by-case basis. The average user will rarely be asked for any documents. Hence, we are very relaxed on KYC.",

It's like admitting that yeah, there are rules but you are shady enough that you don't need to care about them. That if you exit scam, no one knows where you are located anyway so you won't get caught. Yet in your info section you seem to be complying with regulators in same way every regulated casino is obligated to. So how is this \"relaxed\"? I totally understand that you need to market and brand yourself somehow, but this is misleading. Even if you felt relaxed about kyc, it doesn't mean anything. You are not offering anything more than any other casino in terms of \"relaxed\" kyc. What part of this is very \"relaxed\"? : https://empire.io/help-center/help-terms-and-conditions/amlAnd your only link to the site in the picture seems to be a referral link.

That if you exit scam, no one knows where you are located anyway so you won't get caught. I agree, what's with your KYC that is unique compared to other online casino operators here.Quote3.11.  We have the right to carry out “KYC” (Know Your Customer) verification procedures and access to your Member Account may be blocked or closed if we determine that you have supplied false or misleading information. We reserve the right to block / delay processing of withdrawal requests until requested copies of valid photographic identification, proof of address and/or credit/debit card are provided to our satisfaction (KYC).There are other ways and means to brand your casino but why use a unique word that doesn't differentiate from other casinos when it comes to account verification Anyway everything is good in your announcement thread you've done your assignment you just need to launch a promotion not really right away.I also noticed that the widget of the license is not working better take it out or configure it correctly.",

      "body": "Sharing the same concerns with o48o. What do you mean by ‘relaxed KYC’? What happens if someone wins a huge amount on your site? Will you be able to release the funds immediately without requiring the player to do any verification? This just puts the players at risk of getting caught in the middle of KYC verification process without the certainty that they will ever get their funds. At least be clear on what that relaxed KYC means before people deposit some money on your website.",

Why did you mentioned VPN friendly instead of players allowed from all across the globe? People will use VPN to multi account and this might lead to problems in future. Moreover also impressed to see that you have less restrictions on KYC. Will leave a detailed review soon once I try the site.",

But what is quite confusing is that you have a tag line as paradise for high rollers and also relaxed for KYC but withdrawals over $2,000 will require additional KYC, and for high rollers it will be easy to pass the withdrawal limit but they will be constrained by these rules.And what one of the members suggested here by giving bonuses to forum members is a good thing, so forum members can try your casino and give an honest assessment, by the way good luck for your casino development.",
