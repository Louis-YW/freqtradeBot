Even when they are revealed, make sure they don't know you are talking about yourself.Much of my private info remains hidden even though I don't give dishonest answers. I'm always conscious of the fact that the \"evil one\" can ask questions to understand you and use them against you. I know innocent questions when I see them",

The NSA AI computers are sophisticated enough that they take all this info into account, and can actually, often pinpoint certain classes of users that way.So, it's really nice to use VPNs and make a bunch of accounts in all kinds of forums, just to throw NSA computers off. Too bad there aren't enough people who do this to really mess with government thinking and tracking.",

      "body": "Well, yes I believe in honesty when it comes to my day to day life and when it comes to answering questions. I certainly am answering truthfully with questions on the forum. A daily practice that has made my well being centered, as I do not like to pretend I am something I am not on the internet. That just doesn’t feel right for me. Just like in my real life, I try not to give away too much personal information, however I speak openly when I make posts. Being honest is the best route to go, with doing that there is transparency even when it comes to the internet.",

And servants of the LORD have power over it.Everything is based in spiritual ideals. But, there is a balance. Consider King David in the OT. He was twice called by God, \"a man after my own heart\" (1 Sam 13:14; Acts 13:22). Yet David was one of the bloodiest of all killing machines at times.God doesn't always destroy evil instantly. He allows evil so that evil-doers have a chance to repent. It's His way, the way of love. But He DOES destroy evil that will not repent after a sufficient time.This is part of the spirit and the Spirit.",

If you don't use a good VPN, the NSA will add your info to their databases.So, why should anybody care about that? One major reason why. Most people haven't been clearly told that this will be happening. It isn't in any agreement that you have with the people who gave you your IP address.Now that you know that you are probably tracked, what info do you want to spill about your private family life? The NSA has it. Give it to the rest of us.",
