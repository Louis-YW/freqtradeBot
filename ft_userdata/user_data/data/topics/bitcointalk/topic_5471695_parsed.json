Our society is not perfect, such cases must be eliminated in the bud. The state should take better care of its citizens and isolate normal people from such non-humans. Society creates evil, society must prevent such cases. Strengthening systems that support mental health, education and social services is critical, as well as developing a culture of empathy, understanding and kindness within communities.",
