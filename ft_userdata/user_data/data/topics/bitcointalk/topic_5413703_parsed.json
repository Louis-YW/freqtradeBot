They were just lazy to check the reload event LOLI would say that it was programmed that way so that nobody ever runs out of time, and it's an easy way to scam as many people as you can because nobody would bother to reload the page you did. It's shameful how there are just too many bots on Twitter right now, and a lot of accounts are going through the verification process even without having a large audience. Just a few days ago, I noticed a twitter account with only 85 followers carrying the verification badge and the same twitter was participating in twitter daily follow trends.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on September 17, 2022, 04:44:41 AMConsidering the .com version is not owned by the real LooksRare team, this verified twitter account obviously hacked.

And it looks like this is a very common thin on twitter now.Because you have more expertise and exposure, I can tell you that there are thousands of crypto rookies who have no idea what the real website looks like and just put their money in, believing that all verified pages are legitimate. However, in the real world, a verified page should only belong to a trusted individual/company; however, nowadays, you do not have to submit KYC to be verified; instead, you are usually verified automatically if you have a large audience or at least 10 million tweet impressions for at least 6 months straight or more. I've seen people offer verified pages for as little as $1000 with less or more followers, and it makes you wonder 'what the fck?'",

Or even less well known but still 'known' it's not just that person who has access to the account.Assistants or even people who were just hired to run parts of their social media lives have access. So although a lot may come from them, other things may be tweeted / posted by someone working for them. If they get fired / quit after a fight passwords will probably be changed / access removed.If they left under friendly conditions that might not happen and they would continue to have access. They then find out scammers will pay well for that information.....-Dave",

Obviously they do not have time to manage social media accounts and post whatever update they have available. But you are right a lot of time having access by others cause the trouble. The actual owner even not aware of it unless it become viral.",

This does not contain any weight for the brand.No identity or documents are required to be submitted; you simply need to go through the verification process, which, as previously stated, is usually automatic. However, early last year, the Twitter verification was bypassed, and the verification process was put on hold for several months to increase security. I'm not sure how it's been handled recently, but there is a trend in my area. Our local comedians are selling their verified pages for a good price, then returning online to inform their fans that they have been banned and must create a new account, get verified, and repeat. Scammers are out there buying verified pages at low prices.",

Not everyone wants to submit KYC to Twitter for verification because their database is easily compromised. If Twitter imposes KYC for verification, I'm sure the majority of the crypto Twitter community will fail it. After all, this is social media, right? You will also be verified if you have a large and active community. My younger brother is a verified TikToker; he earned the badge as a result of his large community and engagements. It's social media, and the only way to avoid being scammed is to not believe everything you see and to pay close attention to verified pages.

Obviously crypto owners will not take KYC positively and in that case when someone have a verified website, verified influential other social platform like YouTube, Facebook; they should take it as a reference for their verification process. I don't know if Twitter has groups or pages like fan club or a celebrity, if they have then may be they can ask legal paper from the lawyer of the celebrity to check if they gave the permission.It's all up to them how they will improve their platform. The current process of verification badge is surely failing the image of having it considering the numbers of scams are happening from verified blue badges accounts.",
