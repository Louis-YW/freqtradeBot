      "body": "TBH, it has nothing to do with the inflation but I would say that this is a bullish point for Bitcoin as people are moving their funds into cold storage or to non-custodial wallets for long-term custody/holding. Before the start of the Bull Run, the on-chain activity was already indicating the shortage of the accumulation supply and this was the biggest reason  I'm supper bullish for this cycle that the market is gonna hit $200k in BTC.The capitalization market is gonna hit almost $7T to $9T, and with this capital with the current dominance of the Bitcoin target seems like a piece of cake but this net capital amount in the market is really optimistic it depends on the regulatory developments are gonna happen in 2025. Hoping for the best here.",

This fud has created a stress among the investors, and besides this market is now in bullish state, and many hacked has been occurred also, plus people are more educated too, so they prefer to use non-custodial wallets. One thing I know suspect is people might not prefer non-custodial wallets especially for the BTC coin, due to the high fee on transaction.",

      "body": "You have to realize that institutions and funds are constantly buying bitcoin and this is public data, data that we know about. We don't know how much rich people are buying and believe me, they are buying because they can't ignore the fact that ETFs got a green light in the US while they are still restricted in the EU. Chances are Europeans will be allowed to invest in the next 12 months and at the same time we'll be past halving... Smart people were telling us to buy bitcoin when it was below $20k and now people are waking up that this was in fact one of the best opportunities in making a profit in their short lives. What I expect to happen is a supply squeeze that some bitcoiners call the god candle which will happen when there's not much bitcoin left on exchanges and s large market opens to bitcoin, like China or Russia. Anyway, good times ahead.",

Long-term holders and institutional investors, in particular, may be taking a more strategic approach to their Bitcoin holdings, viewing them as a strategic asset allocation rather than a short-term speculative investment.Bitcoin is definitely much more than a short term speculative investment indeed, because for me, the market seasons must be in effect at any given time and the rush to withdraw HODLings either to settle pressing matters or reinvest or trade affects the profit an investor should gain from it. That's why long term HODLing is more rewarding in more ways than one and with BTC still retaining its value with a good noticeable profit margin for the investor.BTC ETF is sure gaining traction by the day with much more than individual investors grabbing a share by investing in value rather than get- rich- quick investment like shitcoins.There might just be the notion that the ETF has done way better than the Ordinals initiative since the launch till date, but this is an argument am not ready to begin.",

Outflows up, outflows down. It really just has to do with market conditions. When people think Bitcoin is gonna go up they move off exchanges. It's just short term changes in market sentiment. It's not news when outflows go up while Bitcoin price is going up, especially heading into a bull run.The general long term trend of more and more Bitcoin being locked up for long periods of time is good. But these weekly numbers are meaningless because you can literally just watch the price and know that this sort of stuff is happening.",

It could be that the exchanges are changing wallets or people are withdrawing them and putting them in in custodial wallets. It could also be that people now prefer to invest in the ETF more than keeping funds in centralized exchanges.Quote from: The Cryptovator on February 28, 2024, 07:54:56 PMAny point of view I don't see any relationship between Bitcoin and inflation.

But I don't think this could reduce inflation anyway. Governments control the economy, and they are responsible for inflation. Bitcoin might not reduce a country's inflation but it can help shield people's money from losing value during inflation. Bitcoin can be used as a hedge against inflation mostly in countries that are going through currency devaluation or loss of value. Instead of keeping funds in local currencies which is losing value, some people prefer to keep their money in Bitcoin to protect their funds from losing value. Such a person will end up making a profit from the increase in the price of Bitcoin and save their money from losing value. An example is Nigeria where even with the restrictions placed on Bitcoin, Nigerians were still embracing it because it was the best to curb individual or household inflation.",

Currently any coin looks attractive as the market is recovering and BTC is heading towards a new ATH again. If BTC will reach $100,000. Not a suggestion but just a reminder. For beginner traders, it is a good idea to try daily trading to find out how the market will fluctuate. When you experience a loss, you will immediately improve your skills and your skills will develop faster than if you just trade in the long term, which does not require special skills. in technical analysis on the market.One-day or long-term trading depends on the type of trader, whether he acts conservatively or is a risk taker. The more willing traders are to take risks, the faster they become experts compared to conservative traders and are ultimately able to navigate the market and find the answer that BTC is best for investing.",
