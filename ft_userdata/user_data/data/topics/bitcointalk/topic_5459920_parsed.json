  "content": "This is a question for gamers, do you still buy individual games on Steam? Or buy a game pass, or Both?I'm thinking about buying a game pass since it's much cheaper than buying individual games on Steam, even after a big sale event. Sure after your subscription period is over, you can't play those games, but one single AAA title can cost $60 which is a 1-year subscription on the game pass...Gamers also rarely repeat games they finished, so why bother buying them? What do you think, and what's your experience? Thanks.",
