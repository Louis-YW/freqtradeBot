  "content": "Is the Bitcoin ETF storyline still alive or is this presently dying? It appears there are 2 top crypto executives who are trying to be positive, however, do they really know anything? Mike Novogratz has a Luna tatoo on his left arm and mama Cathie Wood has been making the wrong investment decisions since 2022.Do they have real information that we do not know or is this a warning sign that they are desperate?All eyes are on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as it mulls a number of applications for a spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), and two leading names in crypto are now publicly predicting that the agency will eventually give them a green light.Mike Novogratz, CEO of crypto investment manager Galaxy Digital, claimed this week that such a financial product will launch within the next four to six months, citing inside sources. “Both of our contacts from the Invesco side and from the BlackRock side gets you to think that this is a question of when, not if,” he said during an earnings call on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.“I think the SEC, if it’s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once,” said Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Investment Management, to Bloomberg on Monday. Wood’s own Ark21 Shares ETF is technically first in line for potential approval on August 13, though most analysts expect the SEC to postpone this approval date.Read in full https://decrypt.co/151809/spot-bitcoin-etf-sec-approval-michael-novogratz-cathie-woodAlso, is the present pump on bitcoin caused by speculation on Ark's ETF application which is scheduled for approval on August 13?",

Wood’s own Ark21 Shares ETF is technically first in line for potential approval on August 13, though most analysts expect the SEC to postpone this approval date.[/i]SEC did not approve any Bitcoin Spot ETF because they did not want to do it or they had to reject approvals with pressure from Democrat party and White House.I agree with Cathie Wood that when SEC approves a first Bitcoin Spot ETF, it will open a new gate, put a case as reference to approve more Bitcoin Spot ETF applications later. The first is always the most expected and most hardest application to be approved. Later applications and approvals after the first successful application will be more easily. Like a first Bitcoin exchange, a first Bitcoin Futures ETF ... already helped Bitcoin market and adoption a lot.",

So most likely they are betting on the etf being delayed until the end of the year.There was some crypto framework that was put into place today and it hints at perhaps an etf approval is likely. However it’s all a guess. This move we had earlier looked organic however and maybe someone knew something ahead of time.",

The SEC has previously rejected Bitcoin ETF applications so there's no guarantee they will approve this one now. And I think there's a possibility that the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF might be delayed until the end of the year. It seems like they might want to observe how the crypto market performs in the months before making their decision.However, overall I personally maintain a positive outlook. Eventually, they will be approved and will serve as a catalyst for the industry.",

If anyone gets approval for that ETF, it will surely be the company that has the best connections with the US government, and it is certainly not some secondary company that reduces the value of the assets it manages by almost $35 billion in a year.",

But I am also careful about these companies that are behind the application for bitcoin Spot ETF approvals. If they can cause the price to rise they can also make the price drop. I am happy that these applications and hopefully future approval will create more awareness and make bitcoin more popular but I am scared of putting too much power and influence in the hands of powerful corporations. These firms can be used as a manipulative tool of the government. But I am also confident that bitcoin can gradually become independent and free itself from all these influences. It might take some time but you cannot put bitcoin in a box.",

In the past the SEC always delayed the decision as much as they could and at the end they just rejected the ETF, probably it was just a way to gain some time, they never actually had any intention of approving it in the first place. Now many things are changing and there are important funds behind these bitcoin ETFs so they can delay it again but at the end I think they will approve them. These companies want to make money, and if they waste time and resources for an ETF approval in case of denial they will want clear explanations, not just some stupid answer like they did with Coinbase.",

I am primarily thinking of BlackRock and Fidelity, but also of many other smaller companies that are waiting for their opportunity in this business. In the event that the SEC approves such an ETF, the media will certainly do their job, and those companies will certainly allocate some funds to promote this way of investing in Bitcoin even more.Talks about BTC ETF are one thing, and even approval for futures ETF - and spot ETF is something completely different, because in the event that investor interest is high, it means that demand will probably exceed supply.",
