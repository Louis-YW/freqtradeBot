  "content": "Posting this thread here as I have been asked again and again on the safest or the best way to peel and sweep a loaded item. I also noticed newbies asking whats the best way. It all depends on how safe you want to be or how fast you want to sweep.          A few years back I wrote a thread on how to sweep a paper wallet withour ever exposing your private key onto the internet.This is the SAFEST way that I know of that I would recommend for high value items such as Cas coins or Bitbills.        https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5303860.msg55941150#msg55941150   For low value items I have used hot wallets such as Mycellium or Coinomi, as I was willing to take a chance with a lower amount of BTC.    But anytime you expose your private keys to a hot wallet, then you also take a chance that your BTC can be at risk. If your computer is infected with malware or viruses, then it is a race against time to see who sweeps the BTC first.    Well by doing it as follows, you will never expose your private keys. I am also posting a visual diagram I made to explain the steps and the full thread link is below it in case you want to fully dive into that rabbit hole on the full explanation!      I am sure others have their way of sweeping and I recommend they share their way and experiences....so please do so and share with the rest of us.",

Just curious how would the electrum wallet know what the balance of the public key was if it is not connected to the internet in some way? I tried doing that in the past and I could not sign of on a tx as the electrum was not able to determine the balance on the public key without connecting to the internet in some way.   That's why the way I posted you use two seperate electrums, one as a hot wallet and the other in cold storage....the hot wallet one will tell the cold storage one the bitcoin balance without the cold storage one ever being exposed on the internet.",

I then make sure im updated to latest OS build, then install a Coinomi apk, and use that to sweep. I just think, if a fresh device can in some way be corrupted (less a dodgy Coinomi apk), with a smart stealer, within the first and only 5 minutes of internet awareness....we'd all have many more problems to stress over. Feels 'safe' for me.",

I lost access to over 100 XCP/Bitcoin NFT's.    Damn sorry to hear that...so did you use their website to do this or thru the app? I am not familiar with free wallet to be honest.   So after you swept onto the wallet, you discarded the Private key?   I mean when you did sweep didn't it indicate it had the balance or no? I figure once you did sweep it would indicate the balance and then you throw away the private key? If not how did this go down?   Thanks for sharing your experience by the way...hopefully other do not use it either after reading your thread.",
