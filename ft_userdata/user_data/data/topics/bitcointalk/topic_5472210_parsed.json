  "content": "I don't know if it's only in this part of the world but from what I have seen, it's becoming very difficult to find someone who had a great bond with his father while growing up.I understand that the father is the breadwinner of the home and that this demands that he work very hard to provide for the financial needs of the family. I also know that because of the nature of most work our fathers do, it doesn't give them that much chance to become available for the emotional, psychological, and the rendering of certain discipline to their children, but I think this shouldn't be enough reason why they will not bond with their kids once in a while.I grew up in a house where my dad was always busy with work to the point where we only see him three times a year and because he feels he has been sending money across for upkeep, he doesn't seem bothered that the kids have missed the role of a father in there lives.I also know so many youths that we grew up together that had similar and some, worse off experiences growing up with their parents, and now that we've grown and some of us have started a family of our own, some have started repeating this circle in their homes.How do we balance the part of providing finance for the home and the responsibility of being there for our children as a father? Abi  if we de provide for the financial need of our homes, e mean to say we don fulfill our role as fathers?",

E good to take the words of our elders serious. Our parents get a vital role to play in our lives and not just to provide. No parent go wish make him Pikin do bad or end up being a failure and this one your father give you nah beta advice but the thing be say, even if you marry from family you feel say dey bad, nah you get the right to change the status quo. Sometimes, families wey people dey regard as good and well behaved fit get one comma inside. This nah my own thinking Sha and I no go wan make you go out of wetin you don hold hand from your father.  And to the op, I feel say for children to benefit from their fathers in terms of attention and all that, it all depends on how the father balance him schedule. Some people dey say work choke nai make them no fit get time. The truth be say time dey for everything but nah how you take arrange am na mata. E no go make sense say because you be breadwinner, you come lose that quality time you sopoz spend with them. What of when you grow old when you no fit go out to provide and you need them to spend time with you? Them fit no get that chance.",

But talking about myself, i think the moment  i always about getting really close to my father was the period  I lost him and most times, children don't really avoid their fathers because of the nature of their jobs but rather because of the way our fathers seemed strict and I think thr fathers of this present generation are already changing the narratives of fatherhood as I'm already seeing more of fathers getting really bonded to their children",

All I know was that, me and my father dey very close and a day doesn’t pass by without us seeing each other unless he travels out of town. But make I still chip in small; for d society wey we dey, if father no get provide for family dem go day na bad father or an incapable person, and now again dis same society na him go still blame you if you dey focus on looking for money to feed d family with your type of work not permitting you to meet your family always. My question now be say; make him leave the work come sit down for house dey look the family and make dem all die of hunger or lack all basic amenities, sometimes no be their fault and if na understanding family dem suppose understand and na d mama go play vital role for here for d children not to think of their father as an irresponsible man or leaving the job of his fatherhood to them and focusing on making money only.",

Abi  if we de provide for the financial need of our homes, e mean to say we don fulfill our role as fathers?  Parenting as a whole is a duty that everyone needs to fulfill. The right fulfillment of this duty depends on the way we manage the affairs of the home generally. The mother is naturally close to her children and it's much more easier to bond with her than the father. The fathers on their own end have a whole lot of duties to fulfill but a good father even regardless of these duties would make out time for his family.  There's no harm in a father being available to play some necessary roles in the physical child upbringing. There should be avoidance of situations where a child would grow up with questions pertaining to his father's availability in his life. The availability of both parents is really essential in a child's upbringing. It goes beyond financial providence and all. The same care a mother gives to her child, if the father is able to place half of it on the child, it'll do the child an extra good in his growth and well being.",

Despite how far they mostly communicate with each other and that person will be the easy way to the father maybe some people are often next to their mothers because of the much love they got from her.

Mothers lives to support their children at all courses they can and the mothers are endivoired in backing up her kids whether on their wrong or bad deeds so the kids tend to grow with their childish thoughts that the mothers loves them most because she could support them on whatever basis while the fathers are strict to them because he wouldn't tolerate any form of misconducts of the children.I grew from a family where when I was a kid, I was what we locally known as \"the trouble maker\" and my mom has always been a reliable wall for me to lean on whenever I have misconducted out there. She would always defend me even when I misconducts within my siblings she always shields me from being punished and my dad would keep saying to her that... Woman, you are misleading your children with bad manners and I would feel like he is hating my mom because she is being my defense on same note, I am loving my mom more than my dad.Now I have grown and my mom still does the same things with my junior ones including my nieces, nephews and junior cousins which I could realize all those times she had been backing me up was all wrong home training and when I cautions her about it she lives to tell me that I hate my siblings and Junior relatives right in their present and The kids are generously developing fear and hatreds in me.I have come to observe that this is an acts of most mothers in my neighborhood and it is of all tendencies that it is generally a deed in most places in the societies.",
