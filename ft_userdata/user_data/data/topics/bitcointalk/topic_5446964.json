  "content": "Bitcoin was originally designed to allow everyone to participate in mining, but now ordinary people in Bitcoin cannot participate in mining. The computational power is concentrated in several large mines.Both Bitcoin and Ethereum can theoretically be centralized through huge amounts of money.Can a new blockchain technology be designed to optimize Bitcoin blockchain technology from the bottom.First of all, this blockchain technology must be that one person can only own one node. Otherwise, if a person like Ethereum has enough funds, it means generating enough nodes. That's how to go to the center. Bitcoin also means that a person can use huge funds to generate huge computing power, and that's how to go to the center.The blockchain technology that I will design next is truly decentralized.First, copy the underlying code of BitcoinThrough face recognition technology, each person can only generate one node, a private key, and a public key.By setting an upper limit on the computing power of each miner, it is possible to mine on a mobile phone without consuming too much computing power.If we are interested, we can design such blockchain technology to run on mobile phones together.",

You have a system where every single person on the network must be identified. Of course a system can be designed that puts limits based on identity (distribute mining rewards evenly, only allow one address per person), but then you have no privacy.

In addition, he does not have a mining mechanism like Bitcoin, and may also be a token for making money rather than doing a good job in blockchain",

This may be another development direction of blockchain, which can prevent legal elements from using token transactions. The most important thing is that everyone can use mobile phones to mine, so that blockchain data can be distributed on everyone's mobile phones. Is it safer and more accessible for ordinary people to participate",

The absence of a central point which intervenes in the market to keep what it considers as balance. What you propose might sound as a good idea in your head (I strongly disagree), but it's by definition in favor of centralization, which contradicts with the title.Quote from: yingyush55 on March 31, 2023, 12:41:36 PMA person who owns 100 other people's facial codes is stealing other people's information. If it is approved by others, why not?Because then a facial code market will be created, and what you're trying to prevent will inevitably happen; that is, to mitigate from an oligarchy of minters.",

Is that better than protecting against data breaches really?Stealing my facial images or videos cannot be obtained through face recognition, just as you cannot use photos or videos to recognize faces on your phone. A face can generate a corresponding string of codes, but this code cannot infer what a person looks like.Not to mention that a government authority would then have the REASON to strap you down to a chair, peel your eyes open, and make you stand still while they scan your face to extract blockchain data. This is a terrifying idea.The government has tied me to a chair and left me standing with my eyes open, unable to scan my face and extract my blockchain data. What is the difference between tying my body directly and asking me for my bank card password? If this is a security risk, then you know that your bank card password also has the same problem.You are now just being delusional, if the government does that very thing to you they WOULD be able to access all your blockchain secrets immediately (assuming people actually used your insane face id chain) it would be trivial as THEY NOW HAVE COMPLETE ACCESS TO YOUR ENTIRE REAL FACE AND HEAD.As for how is this a bigger security risk than a bank? It is just as insecure as a bank, BITCOIN is way more secure than this scheme because private keys can be stored OFF OF YOUR BODY.The government can force me to perform the facial actions required for face recognition, and similarly, it can force me to say the bank card number and password, or the private key of Bitcoin. In terms of absolute power, no encryption technology will work. Bitcoin is not stored outside of my body, it is also stored in my brain.I dont believe you or anyone truly remembers their private key if its any good, the real security of a private key comes from the discrete log problem and opting in to remembering it is your way of attaching a biological security vulnerability to it. There is nothing in bitcoin core that forces you to memorize your private key, its 100% optional.",

But then you have something very different than Satoshi's idea. You have a system where every single person on the network must be identified. Of course a system can be designed that puts limits based on identity (distribute mining rewards evenly, only allow one address per person), but then you have no privacy. Also this relies on the idea that no one can spoof someone's identity through whatever identity recognition system is used.The reason Satoshi used PoW is because you can't spoof processing power. And of course he wanted to avoid the hassles and issues involved with identities.Regarding face recognition, there is no privacy for the unique node. This may be another development direction of blockchain, which can prevent legal elements from using token transactions. The most important thing is that everyone can use mobile phones to mine, so that blockchain data can be distributed on everyone's mobile phones. Is it safer and more accessible for ordinary people to participateIf you destroy the whole concept just to make it more accessible you haven't done anything good.Sure you can do one-id-one-vote mining but in order to do that you are going to have to rely on trusted third parties, and then you no longer have decentralization. Facial recognition wouldn't work well because you'd have people stealing other people's faces and generating fake faces and whatnot.Also at this point you wouldn't be \"mining\". There would be no point in PoW mining if this is your setup because the idea you've set forth is to make the minting process available to anyone so you're not using competition for resources any more. You're using a identification system, where it is decentralized and secured through IDs. So in your setup there is no mining, there's just running your ID node from your phone and you are participating in the transaction verification network.Anyway, since the essence of your system is based on identification what you really need is to involve trusted third parties that can verify IDs. There must be a whole legal apparatus put in place in case someone steals someone else's ID on the network. At which point instead of creating a more decentralized Bitcoin you've created a centralized trust-required crypto-banking industry with universal basic income. That's a very different thing.",
