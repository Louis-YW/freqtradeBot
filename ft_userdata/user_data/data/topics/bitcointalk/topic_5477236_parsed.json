I think it may be the \"change address\" you mention. The balance on the explorer is lower than what is shown on my trezor. My description was a little unclear as I was calmly panicking.This question posted on the Trezor forum is similar to what I am seeing and the response from Trezor leads to a post about Change Addresses.https://forum.trezor.io/t/bitcoin-change-being-send-to-a-new-address/14262I am 95% sure that is the correct situation, but I have a nagging question about why I can not see that \"Change Address\" from within the Trezor, even if I do an export to a CSV.",

QuoteI am 95% sure that is the correct situation, but I have a nagging question about why I can not see that \"Change Address\" from within the Trezor, even if I do an export to a CSV.Well, it's probably because they want to keep the GUI as clean and neat as possible, and that makes sense, it's like checking your hard drive space, it won't bother you with all the details, it would just sum everything up and tell you that you got x filled and y empty, if you need more details -- you going to have to dig further.If you still want to see your change addresses you are going to need to use another wallet or use coin control which is easier, just do as if you were going to send some BTC, and you get that setting icon that allows you to use coin control, that would display a breakdown of your balance, this address holds x BTC and that address holds y BTC, it's been a while since I used Trezor but ya I am sure that would work.",

Is it a known Trezor oddityThere is no data you can read as a source.I learned this because I experienced the same thing with different coins.It just has nothing to do with BTC.There was dogecoin in the wallet.I sent some of it to the stock market.Then I looked and it showed the remaining dogecoin in my Trezor balance.But there are no doges that need to be included in the exit address.In other words, the system created a new doge address and sent the remaining balance there.You can collect coins at a single address in Trezor, and you have to pay a fee for it.However, when you send it, it warns you that this account belongs to you.It warns you that you are sending it to yourself system",
