In addition, there are reports of Zelensky henchmen buying million dollar mansions in Switzerland.I very sorry to state that I don't trust the source of this news therefore the information might not be true. But of course such things can happen in any country. This is because corruption and mismanagement of funds are global citizens that can be found everywhere. It possible that some political officeholders even in Russia are benefiting from the war in Ukraine. Many of them would be making money from arms deals and contracts, while some through soldier recruitment and financing. My country is currently spending so much money of the military because of the fight terrorist and the highest form of corruption can be traced to the defense ministry. These heartless government officials wouldn't want the war to stop because they are making so much blood money.",

My question is, aren't all governments that fight terrorism really terrorists already? After all, they force people to pay for their fight against terrorism. Besides, there wouldn't be many terrorists if there was an easy way for potential terrorists to correct government corruption.The point is, how do we get rid of all the terrorists, the ones not in government as well as the ones IN government? It seems like terrorists are fighting to become the government. How does that happen?",

And western mainstream media are not going to cover it either. So the only outlet are not so legit looking news sites which gives it even less credibility. Not saying it's true or false news.",

And western mainstream media are not going to cover it either. So the only outlet are not so legit looking news sites which gives it even less credibility. Not saying it's true or false news.So, one of the problems is to figure out who is the fake news. Here's one method.During all the Covid emergency from 1 or 2 years ago, Dell Bigtree of The Highwire showed us how. He went and got clips from a whole bunch of major news networks, and from all kinds of news announcers, that showed them saying word-for-word, exactly the same thing at the same time.Now how coincidental is that? Others besides Del have done it (not necessarily about Covid) and posted in Youtube clips. Somebody high-up joker(s) in the whole news cabal, is(are) dictating what news should be heard, over and over again by the dumbed-down public. Why are they doing it? It's training, otherwise known as indoctrination. And they have found methods that work on the unthinking public. Covid was simply one of them.The garbage Ukraine news fed us by the US media is more indoctrination. And it works. But some of us are a little smarter than believing them.Another method to see the true news...Congress To Sneak $37 Billion Ukraine Aid Into Must Pass Omnibus BillQuote from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM_N-tha2fAAs opposition to Washington's Ukraine blank check mounts, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has signaled that the next huge check - nearly $38 billion - will be conveniently hidden in a year-end, must-pass omnibus bill. It's a way to keep the gravy train flowing while sparing Members the inconvenience of having to face voters. Also today...White House to send more troops into Ukraine. What could go wrong?Congress To Sneak $37 Billion Ukraine Aid Into Must Pass Omnibus Billhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM_N-tha2fA",

That's a big point. What is the reality of the shopping spree? Is it:1. Simply a show to get people to recognize the Zelenskys;2. That the Zelenskys really think that the war is won already by US participation;3. Simply that she needed a break from the war and didn't really think about what she was doing... how people would view it;4. An example of the kinds of places that the money is really going from the US?We might not know the answer, but this shopping spree seems top be a slap in the face of those in Ukraine who are fighting and dying for their country. Up until his last days, Hitler lived in reasonable luxury. Are we to expect that these might be Zelensky's last days?",
