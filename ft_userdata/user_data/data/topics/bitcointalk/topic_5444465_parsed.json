What about new project? I think allocate some small fund for some higher risk project should be okay as long as we understand the risk to it.Quote from: swogerino on March 11, 2023, 10:19:14 AMQuote from: FireDAO CY on March 11, 2023, 09:49:39 AMIn my previous topic, I'm wondering about is launching project during the bear market a good idea?

Buy a coin that is in top 20 on CMC, i believe that if you buy coin that has already a good or top record on CMC or coingecko  you can earn when bull season start,you can select them for safety, many projects are now scam and there are also new project that is not successful yet don't fall into scam and use some tracking apps to tract the record of every coin so that you can have an idea what coin is legit and scam.",

Good idea. Top 20 on CMC definitely have stronger fundamental. Maybe will pick a few and look into it. Keep some good coin and ready for the next bull. No idea how long the bear will stay. Have to be more cautious as some say the bigger bear is yet to come.",

We have seen this last bull market especially on the time where everyone wants to invest on a hype project. Project product is also another thing that contribute to that demand. Project utility is important as people base the project future or see the market demand for it. At the end of the day, Seeking for those gems are hard and investing on them is always a gamble. There's a lot of things that can happen on project and on the development, The best thing we can do is to just pick the project among other project which we think that has a great future a head no matter what trend is in.",

So, what kind of project will be more benefited in the next bull??I agree with the statements of some people in this thread. A bear market is of course always a bad thing now matter how you turn it, at least if you were invested in cryptos before the market went down. Even if you have lost money by the falling prices, a bear market can still be at least partially a good thing, because it gives you the chance to invest into good and already established projects, that are usually way more expensive. I bought some Cosmos (Atom) a few months ago and now after the last dip i also bought some NEAR and some Osmosis, because i think all 3 of those projects are to big already to completely disappear but still have a chance for a x10 in the future.",

But for NFT, when it's bear, you're hardly find any buyer to buy your NFT if the one you're holding is failing. After all we need to understand what's the product that we are buying. Trend definitely is the thing but we need to know how to identify a good one. That's why we're here to discuss with each other.",

Alot of efforts need to be done to understand the market and projects as there are so many projects that need to filter to identify whether the project is a scam or not. High risk high return, that's why it's worth to take.Perhaps can have a look at FireDAO as our project is targeting the for long term and to create the biggest community in the decentralized world.",
