This is natural considering that it was a tough year for crypto.And why Bitcoin survives, even when the crypto market crashes like it did in 2018 is because Bitcon is the market leader, Bitcoin determines how the crypto market goes in the future. What's more, not everyone gave up on their Bitcoin, there were still those who kept holding and even bought more Bitcoin, that's what made Bitcoin last until now.",

I remember when it was at $19.6k at the end of 2017, which was the peak, and later fell to $3k in 2018. But don't forget that Bitcoin reached a new peak of $69k in November 2021 and also fell later to $15k in December 2022, which was an even larger difference than what happened between 2017-2018Quote from: Blurr007 on April 17, 2023, 02:07:28 PM1) would've other crypto's survived during that time ?.Yeah, most of the crypto survived, of course; It's not something bad or unexpected, though. That's how the crypto market works, and it's normal for this to happen. The huge volatility of Bitcoin's price is well-known and expected to happen.Quote from: Blurr007 on April 17, 2023, 02:07:28 PM2) Why do Bitcoin survive during crypto winter and other crypto's finds it difficult to cope ?.They all survived, but since Bitcoin has the most potential in the market, no one can take its place. You will see once again when Bitcoin's price starts to rise, other cryptos will follow its path and gain more value. Mostly all cryptos follow Bitcoin, whether it's an increase or decrease in price.",

Many investors only invest in some of the these alt coins because of its profit and once it starts facing crisis there’s no more confidence in it anymore and they pulled there funds off it which results into the death of the coinQuote from: Blurr007 on April 17, 2023, 02:07:28 PM2) Why do Bitcoin survive during crypto winter and other crypto's finds it difficult to cope ?.Because bitcoin is the most stable cryptocurrency or rather the only stable coin. It is decentralized unlike the dump and pump coins created. The reason this alt coins do not survive is that during the bearish period people become scared to have their funds in them and consider transferring it to bitcoin which kills off the coin. Also most of these coins are abandoned by their developers once it is in crisis (sadly that is what centralized tokens faced). Most of the smart contracts tokens built on an existing blockchain of a coin like the Ethereum tokens suffer lose or death when it’s parent coin suffers crises. Take the case Terra Luna and the doge meme coins for example.Bitcoin is the only or most used cryptocurrency for payment purposes and this create/drives the supply and demand of it which makes it impossible to die off. It’s use for cross boarder transactions gives it the stability to survive eve during bearish periods",

I suggest that you shoul use coinmarketcap and check the coin history. Most of the top 100 tokens are the survivors of crypto winter.Quote from: Blurr007 on April 17, 2023, 02:07:28 PM2) Why do Bitcoin survive during crypto winter and other crypto's finds it difficult to cope ?.Because Bitcoin is Bitcoin. It will not die because there is no team behind it that holds the majority of the supply. This is the advantages of Bitcoin among other token. Satoshi is the one true developer that dedicated his life for the sake of his creation. He never touch all his Bitcoin despite the price sky rocket a lot.You can use Litecoin as an example. Charlee Lee sold all his LTC token during the last bull run and other altcoins team slowly unloading their token that cause the dip on every altcoin.",

Altcoins/tokens with similar foundations survive downtrends because they actually have some form of value. Altconis/tokens without one of these attributes fail once the hype has left the market.",

      "body": "During the crypto winter, which is the bearish period of the cryptocurrency market, other cryptocurrencies survive. However, these cryptocurrencies are often hit harder than Bitcoin and depreciate significantly. This is possible because Bitcoin has a special status in the crypto community, with a large number of investors and institutions interested in and investing in it. Besides, Bitcoin has been around and used for a longer time than other cryptocurrencies, creating a sense of stability and trust around it. Some cryptocurrencies are better able to cope with the crypto winter, like Ethereum or Ripple. It is important that these cryptocurrencies have real value and use in some practical application, in addition to having a large community and interest of investors. In summary, Bitcoin survives the crypto winter and is harder to deal with because it has a better standing and surrounding trust than other cryptocurrencies. However, other cryptocurrencies can cope better if there is real value and interest from large investors and communities.",

Also this price point was a available for a very short period of time before it started recovering afterwards. If some cryptocurrency didn't survive the winter, that means there is community support available for that cryptocurrency. So it's all good. Some people might have lost money due to this but it didn't do much damage in the crypto market for sure. We obviously don't need thousands of cryptos in the market. So if some cryptos die during such period, that's good for the market.",

People were thinking that if they trade in crypto world they will be rich within months. However, the sudden crash of market in 2018, and the news of bubble busting destroyed their hopes. Many people have lost their initial capital in that crash.In that crash only few well-known coins survived, but most of the coins that had no good use cases were totally bankrupted. The reputed coins like ETH, LTC, XRP, and some others, have survived in that crash. In 2021 most of the surviving coins reached their all time high including the king of the coins Bitcoin.Bitcoin survived because it's the backbone of the whole crypto world, and it was the crash of Bitcoin that made other non useful coins to flee away from the market. Bitcoin in such scenario is always the best choice for investors, in 2021 when Bitcoin reached its all time high, with it many others coins were pumped more than 10x to 100x in that bull run. This time some coins that were vulnerable caused the market to crash badly, one of those coins was Terra Luna, it caused a lot of stress in the market and many people have lost Billions because of its unwelcomed crash. Many exchanges were bankrupted because of Luna, and after that crash of FTX made the situations even worse. Bitcoin fell to $15k-16k levels with that bear run, and many users gave up on crypto, but now the market is recovering, and if things go well then the Bitcoin will reach all time high this time.",

Many people believe in Bitcoin as the most valuable of them all, even after the 3500$ crash many whales still held their positions, as if nothing is happening, they knew that these tough times would pass and they are right, those who are not strong enough sold their Bitcoin and left.",

Nevertheless, Bitcoin has managed to persevere due to the unwavering support of its community.
