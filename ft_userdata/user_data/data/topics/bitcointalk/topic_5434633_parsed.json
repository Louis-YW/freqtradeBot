I‚Äôm still a newb in this space I've never seen any coldkeys on ebay myself, but I could have missed something. I'm pretty sure most customers were here on the forum, but there could be stragglers ofc.I'm about to post the full list of coins and addresses of all keys in his Mongo DB dump he gave me from the website (No customer info, no worries lol), maybe someone can analyze how much BTC has been left unpeeled. If I have the serials of any cards NOT peeled, I MIGHT be able to find the specific customers email address as well, etc... Thanks!",
