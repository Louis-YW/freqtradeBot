You can find everything you need here[1] (and here[2] if you're interested in knowing more about the lightning network). The site is maintained by a very well-known and respected figure[2] within the bitcoin community, so you don't really have to worry about the quality of the information.[1] https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html[2] http://lightning.how/[3] https://github.com/jlopp",

This is the first step to looking around, communicating, understanding in which direction to step, and then, probably, deciding on education on other more targeted resources.But at the moment, if you consider yourself a complete beginner, communication on the forum will give you strength and understanding of what to strive for.",

In general terms, I’ve found this forum itself to be useful, although it’s reading information here is not a linear guided path, and you need to learn to separate the wheat from the chaff. Books are likely a good source for thematic linear information, and people can recommend a series of them that align more to your concrete areas of interest. Documentaries and video (i.e. by Andreas  Antonopoulos) are a good complement, providing they aren’t part of the influencer sphere that will just shill whatever they are being paid to shill.Getting back to the forum, besides the residing amount of thematic treads, one of the mayor benefits resides in being able to interact with the bitcoin community, and ask whatever you are unsure about out in the open (as opposed to some closed communication through social media which is a high risk practice).Sidenote: También existe una pequeña comunidad en Español en el foro, por si resulta de interés.",
