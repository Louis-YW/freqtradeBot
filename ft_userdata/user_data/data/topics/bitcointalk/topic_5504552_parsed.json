Meanwhile, Harris chose to continue down the path Biden forged by opposing bitcoin and cryptocurrency. That's why I think there's no reason for us to vote for any democratic candidate when they always find ways to fight us. It would be bad if she took Biden's place because there wouldn't be any beneficial changes for us. Her choosing an anti-crypto candidate could be a move to tell us that we will be in even more trouble if she gets elected, I hope everyone will know to vote for who.",

So if the Democrats think it is a winning strategy to be surrounded with the Anti bitcoiners, then it is obvious that they don't have good plans towards the future of Bitcoin and that alone becomes a point to their failure in the anticipating US election because they are being enemies of a global economy progressions on the hedge at Bitcoin technology.",

Just like her predecessor that stepped down the chair for her, she's definitely with no chances against Trump going by the support Trump has pulled so far. But it's all politics and since since it's looking as though Trump has stolen all support mostly from the bitcoin community and the likes, Hence, she's with no option than to fall to the other side of the divide (anti-bitcoiners) testing her chances by having to pick a popular running mate like the Peter's who's believe to enjoy much popularity among the Michigan community and which could boost her chances in the polls by November. However, as I read from the article, Peter is just in the mix of other interested persons in the position of Harry's running mate as she's yet to pick a mate.",

Kamala is a communist and all commies are about redistribution of wealth. People in the crypto industry represent the upper class to these communists. We have enough money that we can spend it on investments in the tech sector, while the poor working class is struggling As for Every Garry being anti crypto, I think that Gensler isn't completely against it. He's pro bitcoin, as long as the US is in control. He'd like to cut everything libertarian and decentralized out of it and leave it a stock on the market that they can shut down if it gets too big or close the trading session if it moves too much.",

I just pitty the uninformed people singing their praise at this moment  instead of them pushing for a sound and broad leadership.The masses already know who they would vote. They say experience is a teacher and I believe they must have learnt their lesson and are preparing to effect a major corrections this time around through their vote power. So far, the buzz around Donald Trump re-election is echoing very loud that the deaf can hear it very well. I think a win for Donald Trump is a win for the Crypto community as a whole.",

They are really doing good for doing those research since they tackle those important points which they could able to help on their campaign. That's why right now Trump is the most strongest candidate because he create a good statement that he is for everything and he won't allow any negative things will spread in US towards those issues and other discussions he raised.I guess those Anti bitcoin or anything which have connection with Biden is been hated by people and its like their chance to win this election seems so low.
