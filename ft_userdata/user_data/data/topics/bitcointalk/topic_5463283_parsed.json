I also read where the former Binance.US said that the White House is trying to keep stable coins \"out of discussions\" like they know something. Is this all about saving their USD? Or they are waiting to create CBDC successfully first before they go after stablecoins? The SEC  Chairman Gensler¬† once said that stablecoins are risky and can harm the US economy, he even referred to them as poker chips at the casino. I don't think that stablecoins are free from the SEC's attacks because they are currently under scrutiny. The recent legal action against Binance also relates to its stablecoins. Binance's stablecoin BUSD and other stablecoins are at risk if they are classified as securities. Immediately stablecoins are classified as securities they will be highly scrutinized and regulated by the SEC. But SEC seems confused because they failed to include Coinbase stablecoin USDC as a security in the suit against the crypto firm. But an unfavorable ruling against BUSD might affect stablecoins like BUSD, USDT, and others if they become securities making them fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the SEC.Quote from: Nwada001 on August 14, 2023, 08:55:42 PMHow about looking at it this way:The USDT is backed up by the United States dollar, and it happens to not have a CEO that's entirely controlling it; although it's completely centralized, there are still limits to which it can be controlled.Firms that issue stablecoins claim that each coin is backed by dollars. This claim cannot be fully proven to be true because their accounts are not audited by any authority and for now, their operations are not regulated. That's why they need to be regulated to ensure that people are not been scammed.",

I also read where the former Binance.US said that the White House is trying to keep stable coins \"out of discussions\" like they know something. Is this all about saving their USD? Or they are waiting to create CBDC successfully first before they go after stable coins? These are many questions and the summary is that the US government currently has no issue with stablecoins because their values are pegged to the USD and other verifiable commodities and assets and have those assets practically backing them.Meaning that they can truly prove their value/worth and make backed settlements to investors/holders, unlike other cryptocurrencies. This arrangement is happening in fiats as well but they tagged theirs in $(USD) which is why people do not suspect it that way. Just like PayPal, Skrill, Perfectmoney and others, the number you see on the screen is not the real money but has the power to settle deals on their platform like the real money while the real money is in the bank or stored as other assets. That arrangement is the same with the stablecoins but its own is just in the blockchain mechanism.In addition, most stablecoins are centralized, and the USDT which is leading them by a wide margin is also centralised. Although some face scrutiny and lawsuits by regulators, it's minimal as I don't see a reason why the government will clamp down heavily on such an arrangement.",

Stable coins should be regulated because there should be a guarantee that what happens in Luna will not happen in another coin. I don't think there is any institution trying to end crypto. If there was such an institution, they would attack stable coins at first. Stable coins should be an element of trust in the crypto market. When people wake up one day, they should not see their stablecoins, which are equal to 1 dollar, at a lower value. Therefore, the regulation of stable coins and the elimination of risks are of great importance for the crypto market.",

I am sure SEC will go after the stablecoins when they are done with decentralised coins. The current ignorance of SEC should not be considered for future planning. Also stablecoins are usually launched by a centralized business. So it is always easier to catch and control them. The real challenge for SEC is to get hold of decentralised coins. Once they will get fed up, they will run after easy catches.",

To the best of my knowledge, stable coins¬† are not exempt from oversight of Security and Exchange Commission(SEC) of USA. However, due to their direct pegging to fiat currencies like US dollar or Euro, they are less likely to be categorized as securities. It is important to highlight that regulatory approaches can indeed differ between jurisdictions.",

It's just that their volatility is so small and we don't care about them, but they obviously also have volatility risks. I think the SEC has their plan and will attack the market step by step, most likely exchanges and altcoins being their first target. If they succeed, the rest of the market will be their next target. And I believe even bitcoin will be their goal and their ultimate goal is to regulate and control the whole market.",
