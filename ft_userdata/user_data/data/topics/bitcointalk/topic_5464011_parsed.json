Don't you know bumping thread is not a legitimate service? Anyway, lets come to the point you have mentioned a good number of skill but you have not provided reference of your skill and experience.",

Do other potential clients see chats you run private? How do you want to scale through successfully when your thread is scanty, nobody to attest of your services. Nothing to see to convince someone to hire you for a token. OP you should  know marketing has a key point to attract customers bit here I see nothing on your thread to attract members to you. Scanty and empty thread. Is it what you want is to see?",
