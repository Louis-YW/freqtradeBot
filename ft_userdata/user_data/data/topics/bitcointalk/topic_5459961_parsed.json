Believe me, I won't join any signature campaign on this account even doomsday!!!)You need 64 more merits to rank up to full member, and you think making a post about account farming and loan defaulters would give you all of that? I strongly doubt if that's gonna happen, if you truly want to wear an Avatar badly then you should try to improve your posting technique at least you have been able to earn 36 merits why don't you follow that same style unless you somehow earned them from a contest.Be careful Op so that you won't make and all of a sudden it will be taken as an attempt to beg merit.Back to the Op, lenders have tried thier best to give loans to those that they think managed to grow their account themselves, and also have a good post history so as to avoid giving loan to someone who purchased a high ranking account from an account farm, but since everyone in the forum is anonymous you really can't tell for all account if they are still being controlled by the original creators or not.",

The only difference is that, OP really stated it here which is kind of a brave act if you will ask me while others aren't directly saying it, but it's pretty obvious that it's their intention to beg merits thus, creating a thread like that.Lenders have different criteria on how they will give out loan to different users here. They aren't just dumb users that will just give out loans to random strangers. You want to make your pizza as an avatar? Then work hard for it, or maybe try sending your entries in this thread, or maybe try to PM The Sceptical Chymist, and maybe you're eligible to get merits from him. You won't join any signature campaign? Did you know that money can change one's mind in an instant? I don't believe what you are saying TBH, and my apologies for my statement, but that's just my opinion.  Don't be mad at me.",

Although I have not come across any information about high-ranking members farming accounts to take loans nothing is impossible. Hacked or bought account will be ideal for this kind of criminal activity because it will be hard for someone to lose an account that took so much effort and time to build just because of a loan. This thread: Someone Loan using My Account shows that hackers are now using hacked accounts to take loans. Members should ensure that their accounts are protected to avoid hacks. Some members have even decided to receive neutral tags stating that they will never take loans to protect their accounts from these criminals. Lenders should also pay more attention to these loan proposals and demand more details so that these fraudsters can be dictated. Their accounts should be exposed and tagged by high-ranking members.

Believe me, I won't join any signature campaign on this account even doomsday!!!)Why do you think someone will send you merits for such a basic topic? Your post was quite good as you said some suspicious behaviors from Borrower but this topic is now known to every lenders. Now they judge many things from a borrower if he should get a loan but still now some lenders fall in a trap. I think some of the scammers grow forum account either to join a signature campaign and if they fail then focus on lending services to scam. Your whole information was good but not up to the mark to get Merits. But you did it more troublesome when you indirectly beg for merits. Have you read about forum rules? Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM7. No begging. [5]Just imagine if everyone is doing like you that means begging for merits directly or indirectly then what will be the environment of this forum? It's not too hard to gain Merits if you contribute actively beside learning. Also you learn about others inspirational stories and how they are became successful. These will be really helpful to know how to join discussions in a constructive way. So let's check it out: Inspirational stories from self-made promoted users",

You whole plan is the most dumbest plan i have ever seen. Like, there was a funny video in which both character planned to rob a bank by working there for 40 years and at the end they planned to take away all the money from the bank once they build their trust in the bank so no body will doubt them.Maybe you already have watched that video. I mean, really! in order to scam lender first you have to work hard to become Full member or Senior Member or any rank then you are also earning through Signature campaigns and that's the legit money you are earning but at the end you still wanted to loot those lender by running away with the borrowed money. Ok! i accept the plan but how much money can we really make by this method (obviously we means one person). Because this plan sucks (no offense).",

They know that what they are doing is a risk and also a business for them, so even before going on with their lending services, I believe they have taken the decision to accept any loss that is incurred.You promised not to join Signature on this account, but you are on Signature on another account, right?
