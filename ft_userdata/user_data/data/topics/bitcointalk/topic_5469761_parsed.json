It's not a must.I could also say \"Please don't use Kucoin or Phemex because I have a bad experience with them, but I can't tell you the details\" See? Would you really believe me? Nope. Not a chance.I could just be attempting to malice or FUD the two exchanges for all we know. An accusation works well with evidence.",

They may have a problem with the support team, represented by a late response, the lack of a specialized team, problems with withdrawal, high fees, and other problems.In general, I did not find anything related to CoinW, but many people talked about avoiding LATOKEN: - LATOKEN altcoin virtual currency trading is a user scam - Avoid using LATOKEN and Cointiger to buy any altcoins. - LA TOKEN IS A SCAM EXCHANGE BEWARE OF THEM - Is LAToken Exchange an exchange for listing Scam tokens ?",

      "body": "I don't use any of them but heard a lot from latoken. You surely will be tracked if you give some not direct details about you and your experience there? Do you still have funds left there and that's why you don't want to go in details? There's no point if you don't have funds there to tell your actual experience and you'll just leave them forever. But if that's the whole point of this thread and just giving your hint not to use them, just like I have said that I've read a lot from latoken users negatively.",

But can you explain why you are advising everyone else here to stay away from these exchanges while at the same time, you are still protecting your relationship with them and are still their user?Shouldn't you, if you have a bad experience with a service, end any business with them and move on?",

I remember Latoken has a lot of scam accusation including faking their volume on newly listed token just to attract customers to list more tokens and buyers to trade with this fake volume tokens.I knew that the reason for using this kind of exchange is to take advantage for buying early on shit tokens before they listed on huge exchange but trust me it’s not worth it since this kind of exchange usually have a very thin liquidity for you to exit properly in profit. It’s much better to use DEX and pay for fees instead for this exchange that has the possibility to freeze your asset without any explanation.",

At the moment I don't use it anymore so I don't know if it's still bad.",

They are evasive in answering me, so like another person I recently found out was scammed by CoinW, I am walking away from losing anymore time on this, and I will just have to consider it a learning experience in discovering which exchanges are good and which are bad.  Sometimes we have to lose in order to learn and warn others.Global Protection - Canadian Citizen Living In Belize Now",
