Not only do you lose morale but you also have this urge to join the bet yourself, thereby losing games more for the sake of money. I guess this is what they call \"game fixing\" where players are also involved in the betting process and they intentionally lose or throw the game to win money on their gambling accounts.This happens rarely but the potential of it from happening is possible. I remember, there was a basketball game hosted in the Philippines and you can see the players on one team throwing the game by missing all of the free shots and intentionally losing the game. If you guys are interested in watching it, I will leave the link below:Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc9QCbO5Ph8&t=383s",

During the just concluded FIFA world cup, many people believed that the competition was manipulated and that big sports betting companies may have had an influence, although these were just mere talks that were not backed by any facts, it does not take away that possibility from the hearts and minds of people who will begin to question the integrity of this sporting contest and reduce people's confidence in it.",

Afaik it is illegal though. Regardless of the stance if the player, whether they bet on their win or loss, the fact that they gambled on their own game kind of splashes them with cold water which cools down their passion for the match. It's just that bad imo.Let's not even mention it becoming a rigged game due to that, that may be the worst case scenario, but that's what all people should always assume imo.",

What about soccer and other sports? Are they exempted? Let's talk about this.This certainly applies to all sports.In the past, we only saw this happen in boxing, because from the beginning it was a sport that attracted a lot of bets on who would win or win, until today we have plenty of examples of movies that portray this type of crime.As sports betting has been taking the digital media and expanding to other sports, we have seen that the corruption of players and athletes is reaching the most diverse sports.In higher level championships where players win \"absurdly well\" it is more difficult to see this occur, as the risk of manipulating a result is not worth it when you have a reputation to protect on the field, and losing that reputation will cost a lot. more expensive than the reward for manipulating the outcome of the game.Anyway, this is indeed a dark side of gambling, which unfortunately has no turning back, but it is still a minority among many sports games that we have.",

      "body": "Of course, this isn't a concern exclusive to NFL. This is a challenge to all sports including ESports. A month or two ago, I shared that a neighbor was involved in game fixing. He's a professional DOTA II player who's already climbed through the ranks and was playing on the international stage. The talk is that a huge bet is involved and that they're all paid. They were found guilty and was banned by Valve. Just very recently also, an investigation was started on game fixing allegations involving certain players of the largest basketball league here and a Singaporean businessman. The same businessman is also accused of the same in a basketball league in Thailand. Again, sports betting is also involved. These are examples why public confidence of these leagues or contests is lost. The integrity of these games is lost. While many are still watching these games, it is undeniable that many also believe that there could be arrangements or negotiations behind.",

These are just a list of possibilities and that's the part where the public won't be aware of and it would to a large extent hinder fair play. It's why it remains a frown at act and a practice that can't be allowed to linger in the sporting system.",

QuoteRapoport noted Williams and Berryhill's suspensions stemmed from betting on college games while they were at the Lions' team facilities; Moore, Cephus and Toney are believed to have bet on NFL games.It is against the rule of most popular sports for the players to bet on games especially if it's in their specialty. In this case, American Football. Some bet on college games and others made a bet for the sport they are playing which violates their contract.Regarding the question if this applies to other sports, yes and no. In small leagues or local leagues, I don't think they have a contract clause about betting for the team. But when it comes to national leagues, I am sure it is added to their contract to prevent point shaving or other illegal things a quarterback will do or a team themselves. Boxing, UFC, and other contact sports also have the same regulation about players and fighters betting for themselves or their opponents.",

Who would've thought of that earlier? I could never see this coming. I guess that you've never heard of rigged/fixed soccer games(replace soccer with any other popular sport).My opinions is that sports betting slowly ruins almost all sports. In my country's soccer league all teams have sports betting companies as the main sponsors. This is quite suspicious, especially when certain games end with a weird result.I don't know anything about the \"Jameson Williams\" court case and I don't care about American football, but I know that money and greed could ruin every sport.",

The problem is that the money involved in professional sports is huge, and some people will do whatever it takes to make a buck. When players, coaches, or referees are involved in betting, it can easily lead to biased decisions and even outright cheating. And if the public loses faith in the fairness of the game, it can have serious consequences for the sport's reputation. It's hard to say how prevalent this problem is in the professional sports, but it certainly seems like there are more stories about match-fixing than there used to be.",

This is especially pronounced in the lower leagues, where the players' incomes are lower, but even top sports are not immune to it, because some who earn a real fortune want even more and then accept bribes to influence the game.Sometimes it's not just about money, but these people are blackmailed in such a way that they are threatened with revealing some secrets, or their family members are threatened. Sport has become a big business for a long time, and criminals want their share of the pie - that's why I think the laws should be much stricter, because punishing someone with not playing a few matches is not something that will discourage others from doing the same.",
