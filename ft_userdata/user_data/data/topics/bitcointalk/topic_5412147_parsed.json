Your fantasy that you will do something if others support you and asking for some kind of compensation for what you will allegedly do is more than ridiculous.I remind you of your identical attempt to do the same thing that you are promising now, and that from then until today the price has not been more than $25 000. Your mind isn't capable of understanding how delusional you are, let alone competing with supercomputers and AI - what's next, threatening to hack Bitcoin if we don't do something for you?archivedQuote from: Ucy on July 14, 2022, 05:29:38 PMQuote from: Ucy on July 01, 2022, 05:11:46 PMSomething I have decided to do Have decided to move it up to $25 000 to 40,000 in 1 to 2 weeks time. I'm doing this without expecting reward from the work of moving it up. The current price of Bitcoin is about $19,500 is archived: https://archive.fo/0aVIp  Date: Friday July 1st 2022I will move the resistance to $40,000... And I may stop supporting the price at $25 000 to 40,000 level if people still do not appreciate. I'm impressed with what was achieved so far even though I avoid posting much on things related to Bitcoin/crypto...partly due to people trying to steal the \"show\" from the one who started it on July 1st. That's typically my experience whenever I want to prove something true especially via miracles... then you see spams/people claiming thesame/similar thing. I will do this by surprise at the right time... Meanwhile, I will continue, then expect more big movements especially when you see me posting more on Bitcoin/crypto. *We hit $22,400 High probably on July 8 2022*Current Bitcoin price: $20,400",

Apart from these demand and supplier, I don't think there is anyone who can tell the Bitcoin investors that the price will reach $100k tomorrow and it come to pass in the market. Many people has came up to give people such prediction that they are among the people that made Bitcoin price to go up in the market or  decrease in the market but at the end the truth will show itself that they are predictors not the real teams that made the price of Bitcoin pump and dump in the community. I will never be deceive again than to follow up with the market price to buy whenever the price is low in the market and hold to watch whenever the price will go higher before I can supply to market to achieve something good.",

Also the market cant be controlled by one person unless he holds literally a lot of bitcoin ans its fiat equivalent which he can drag and influence retailers. Theres a lot of whalea out there which can affect the market and the answer why still low is the economy is not in good shape and inflations are getting higher which influence others investors to pull out due to such crisis and no new institutional players are moving in.",
