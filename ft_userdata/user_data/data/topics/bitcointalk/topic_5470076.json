  "content": "I'm new here. I've only been reading threads and FAQs for a few days and now I'm starting to post with a basic crypto knowledge.I found out about crypto by watching youtube. There are many youtubers who have very low knowledge about crypto and only post shitcoins in 50% of their youtube videos.I watched a youtube video where a youtuber talked about bitcoin and satoshi and forum. So I did a google searched about bitcoin forum and ended up here.",
