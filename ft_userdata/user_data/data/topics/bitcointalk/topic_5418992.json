  "content": "Bitcoin highest price in August was $25200, $22800 in September, $21100 in October if it does not surpass it in few hours away to the month of November. In 2018, these three previous months were similar in a way the price of bitcoin did not have much volatility but followed by a massive bear market that decreased the price of bitcoin from $6600 to $3600 in November before the next massive bull run started that drove bitcoin up to $13970. This is not to cause a panic, but unsure if bitcoin price will still decrease further? But yet buying at $20000 is going to be profitable in some weeks or some months to come.What I know would happen is either the price will not fall more than expected before the next bull run start. Or the price of bitcoin may fall in a way it can get to $17600 again or below which would result to a massive bull run in some weeks or months to come. But let us continue our monthly fun. Would the price of bitcoin increase or decrease in November?",

The last quarter of the year should be more bullish than bearish but I guess this time is different. The bear market is here to stay and it may even cross another year before we can finally witness a bullish market. However, whether it’s bearish or bullish, just continue to hold tight our bitcoin and the rest of good altcoins, that’s the only way to prevent us from losing and still become profitable in the end.",

It's probably around this levels as well, $20k-$25k give or take. The thing is that we are about to hit the last 2 months and specially in December we had some runs before Christmas so I think we might hit as high as $25k.So in November, it could be around $22k-$23k the most, unless there is another news that will put the market again. Yes, the war is still in the background, but if the US has some good news about their economy and their monthly CPI, then maybe it will have a positive effect on the market this month.",

Seeing the market condition, the Bitcoin price breaking above the $23k to $24k mark in November could aid the uptrend to the $30k resistance level at the end of the year, what do you think?",

I’m overall bullish, but I think there’s a good chance the price could be lower in 30 days. Maybe because I've already bought some which made me a bit optimistic as well. But seeing there is a bit of a green market in different DEXes that I have been I think it simulates the last bull market back in 2021 and the price of BTC had been very stable for a few months.In the back of my mind, I'm also doubting since the report I've seen recently was that miners are still selling heavily to cover their expenses, and miners in China sell all the time since they get almost free energy.",

Honestly I'm still expecting a bull this November on Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies on the market. But I still have a hard time knowing whether it will happen within this month, because considering last year the conditions were very different from November this year, so I don't see November last year as a reference for market conditions in November this year.I just want to hope that the Bull can happen this month so that everyone can get the benefits to enjoy after December is over, because the new year is always fun at night and everyone will be very happy if they enjoy the new year with the profits they get from market.",

It may gradually increase its pace as the end of the year ends though, so we might see better gains at the latter end instead of the start. The top by the end of the month would probably stop at around $23k or so, and at the end of the year around $26k, $27k. On another hand, even if we did go down from here, I don't think we'd go lower than the lows we've had the past few months.",

I was surprised TBH that it went up to $20,000 a few weeks ago but still, it is around my past prediction that price of Bitcoin will end up sideways at around $18,000 - $25,000 this year.

DO not expect it will soon arrive. Focus long termYes, we are still in a bear market but also in a sideways position because I see bitcoin prices are not going down or rising too high or deep and tend to be at one price level. So far, if the bitcoin price has been at the bottom, the price will not go anywhere and tends to be more stable than before. And even if there is movement, the movement is not too significant. For example, when the bitcoin price was at $19k for a while, and the price started to increase to $20k, it has stayed at $20k until now. But I don't know if suddenly the price will go back to $19k or even lower. So we must be prepared for all situations and conditions, and if that means another decline, we can buy more bitcoins again.",
