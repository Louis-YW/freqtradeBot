They will get their money and the blame will fall on you. In the stage of gaining customer trust, when the user will not be able to recover his money, he will stop using the service and all the negative reviews will be yours.I remember a while ago, scammers used auto-sell links to scam beginners, so your service could easily be misused and all the blame would fall on you.Quote from: 1moresell on September 11, 2023, 07:09:57 AMHi, yes this is my website, the advertisment of the stats are just to impose a certain trust for the seller, as at the moment as we don't have a base of sellers and this is our main goal for the moment.
