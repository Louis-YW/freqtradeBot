  "content": "People do not want to understand how humans are thinking. They are disappointed about how ethereum has not gone up massively but they forgot to check how natural assets are. Gold marketcap: 18.8 trillion.Silver marketcap: $1.8 trillion.Gold is 10 times higher in marketcap than silver. The reason I compared the two is gold is the natural asset that has the highest marketcap while silver is the second. This is how people will see bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies. People will prefer bitcoin and buy it instead. After a long period of time, know that bitcoin will continue to dominate with over 50% dominance but the dominance with ethereum or the second higher crypto by that time will likely get larger.",

      "body": "The problem with altcoins is they were all created by for-profit private enterprises for the purpose of enriching the founders and early investors. They all have endless supply or nearly endless supply where the founders, VCs and devs issue themselves 80 to 99 per cent of the supply, print new tokens whenever they feel like it, and dump on retail idiots  (err I mean investors) whenever they feel like it. Those who have little to no understanding what they are throwing their money into are left holding the bag. When you have crap like dogecoin, pepecoin, fartcoin, etc. with billions in marketcap you know you have reached the pinnacle of insane, off the chart levels of mass stupidity. Tulip mania could certainly be used to describe the shitcoin/altcoin market. But at least tulips are something that have some actual value. Altcoins are little more than a high-tech recreation of the traditional fiat money system, but with qualities that make them much worse than fiat.They are little more than high-tech Ponzi schemes masquerading as \"technological innovation.\" In other words, modern-day snake oil.",

Its decentralized nature has made many investors trust it. Investing in a coin that is controlled by a few individuals is risky because they can easily control the market. People might want to invest in altcoins because it is cheaper but I prefer to buy Bitcoin in bits because it gives peace of mind and even appreciate more than some of these coins.

Perhaps privacy is the only thing one can point out in monero which is a very beautiful attribute to us. Bitcoin is more life a paradigm that was invented/innovated as a result of world financial crisis of 2007/2008. It had a real time problem to solve having better attributes to be called money in place of fiat or better than fiat but perhaps Ethereum and every other shitcoin was more of a copy and paste of bitcoin with and unlimited supply or a totally supply that would probably not be reach, must or all for selfish reasons. Bitcoin will always have more dominance over shitcoins as it's peculiar to only scammers (creators).",

And maybe what OP means is that when assessed in terms of profit and capitalization comparison, Bitcoin is far superior in terms of profit and also dominates which has proven to be the best cryptocurrency and also the number one asset chosen by most people or investors in terms of profit and storage value. And besides, Bitcoin is limited in number and there are only 21 Bitcoins which makes the price of Bitcoin continue to increase due to its high demand.Bitcoin cannot be compared to other cryptos because Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency in the world and the others are just imitations of Bitcoin, but will never be as perfect as Bitcoin.

Unless there is a clear benefit, people do not readily go from something steady to something experimentalIndeed, ethereum boasts a vibrant ecosystem, but it by itself does not ensure a complete marketcap explosion. Adoption calls for belief as much as it does for knowledge. People want to see real-world application; they want actual stability; they want trust spanning boundaries. Bitcoin meets those criteria. It has to do with dependability over long stretches. New coins sometimes arise, but if you ask ordinary investors, they would much prefer chose the known name than gamble on the obscure. People operate in this way. This is why the top position of bitcoin remains strong. Although the second-place coin might grow more, the difference is still somewhat noticeable. The gap remains real",
