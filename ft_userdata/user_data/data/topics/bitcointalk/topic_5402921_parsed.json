  "content": "As the blockchain industry grows, the crypto storm is blowing into East Asia as well.It was Thailand’s first top blockchain technology summit, Crypto Expo 2022, held in Bangkok in May, where many well-known brands participated, including Bitkub, ZIPMEX, FINTOCH, and Bittaza. And the invited official guest such as the Deputy Director General of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. Attendees will gain insight into the latest blockchain tech trends from 80 speakers during the four-day event.FINTOCH is a blockchain-based investment platform developed by Morgan DF Fintoch, which provides 100 percent peer-to-peer investment with no dead space through HyBriid, an innovative blockchain security technology. Users can enjoy secure lending, borrowing, and investment services in FINTOCH which is like a decentralized bank.Once an investor’s funds are at risk, the system is forced to liquidate immediately, making it a truly zero-risk blockchain investment. Moreover, borrowers can leverage their borrowing by pledging less margin with the security of capital technology.DeFi 2.0 is widely considered to be the next application of this technology, which is expected to further boost of its development.FINTOCH’s security technology is based on,”zero-knowledge proof” and “multiple signature” technologies, which are implemented as follows. Whenever a borrower requests a loan, he or she must submit a deposit of 50% of the requested funds. Afterward, a multi-signature wallet is jointly created by the borrower, the platform, and the monitoring nodes. Lenders who are willing to lend funds will transfer the money to the multi-signature wallet, which is co-managed by the three parties.When the borrower wants to use the funds, two of the three parties must agree. Among them, the private key of the supervisory node is randomly selected10 nodes from 100 anonymous monitoring nodes to jointly create the private key that represents monitoring nodes. Furthermore, the funds in the multi-signature wallet cannot be transferred to the private wallet at will but must be invested in the FINTOCH-awarded DEX.The user’s funds remain under FINTOCH’s supervision during the DEX investment period, and if a margin shortfall or investment loss exceeds the margin balance, mandatory liquidation will be initiated and the funds will be converted to the lender’s provided currency and withdrawn from the multi-signature wallet for eventual return to the lender. The above actions are initiated automatically by the FINTOCH system and also require the consent of two of the three parties to the multi-signature wallet. This ensures that users’ funds are monitored 24 hours a day without the risk of loss.FINTOCH’s technology is a new milestone in the implementation of blockchain business. The zero-risk lending and investment will definitely attract more capital to crypto-assets and accelerate the development of the DeFi.Will FINTOCH really have the Midas touch to make DeFi 2.0 a paradigm shift? It is worth keeping an eye on the industry.",
