Still, there were no stories of hoodlumps, terrorists attacks or violence of any kind.Â  Â Information that got to me said that the president of Nigeria,Â  Muhammad Buhari, also went out to play his role as a citizen and casted his vote. And I heard that he voted for labor party .lol that's wonderful. My question here now to you all, is who did you vote for? I voted for labor party, so what about you?...",

How you go pray make a candidate liberate you but you no go vote for that candidate. Why we deh allow this selfish politicians play us every time. At least since you believe say Obi fit liberate us you for give am your vote. Go with your conviction and not wetin others deh think or feel say na him better. Inside all those people weh come out for presidential post, na only Peter obi and Sowere make sense. But Sowere own be say him too get bad mouth and no respect for people. Rigging too much for that election. E no go better for all those weh help rig this election.",
