  "content": "Can I setup a time lock which will allow access to the coins in x amount of years but only allow access during that time if 2/3 other people sign it? I do not want to give these people access but my goal is to keep Bitcoin until a certain date 2030. I want to make sure that despite what happens with the btc price I do not withdraw. My solution is getting trusted friends and family to have a multisig setup which does not give them access to the coins but allows them to prevent any impulse withdrawing because of emotional attachment. I have never attempted to setup a multisig in this way and I am just trying to work it out. I want it to work like this: 1. 2/3 signatures needed during the time lock period2. Those in control of the multisig cannot get access to the funds without the master private key (owned by me) 3. Set a date of 2030 as a time where the wallet will unlock. Is this possible?",

In the latter, they can gain access to your coins and don't need your approval to spend, something you've said you don't want. You also can time lock money to yourself, to avoid messing with intermediaries, but that's once and for all; you can't reverse it, in contrast with multi-sig wherein you can convince your friends to get the money. An even better solution is to look after your emotions.",

And start with some shorter period, like a week, just to make sure your coins are spendable, and you can unlock them correctly. It is very easy to make a mistake and burn them.QuoteIs this possible?Not only it is possible, but also there are many options, because it can be done in many different ways.QuoteYou also can time lock money to yourself, to avoid messing with intermediaries, but that's once and for all; you can't reverse it, in contrast with multi-sig wherein you can convince your friends to get the money.Both options are possible. You can:1) lock coins, so they can be moved immediately when all people agree on that, or after a long time, if one person will do that (exactly in the same way as a closing channel transaction is made)2) lock coins in a way that even if you have all needed signatures, then you still have to waitAnd there is another option: lock them only to your key.Also another one: lock coins in time and nothing else, then it could be treated as a treasure for miners.QuotePossible, but I'm not aware of any current implementations that allow this.Bitcoin Core and console will allow you to write any transaction, and to broadcast a standard ones.QuoteOP_2 PUBKEY_1 PUBKEY_2 PUBKEY_3 OP_3 OP_CheckMultisig OP_CLTV TIME OP_DropWhy not Taproot?

And more private, because you only reveal one TapScript branch, all other branches are hidden behind some hashes, and there is always a chance that \"there was one more way to spend that coin that nobody knows, except the script creator\". Also, I think K-of-N could be done if one person would have more than one key, just by using a combination of keys, and doing N-of-N multisig on that. Another benefit is that if all people agree on everything, then there is always an option to spend-by-key and hide in the crowd of other users with just a single key per address.",

This is why a lot of the collectors in the collectibles community managed to find themselves suddenly wealthy.  A lot of folks didn't want to part with their Casascius coins or other loaded memorabilia until it was life changing for them to do so.  I've seen many people say that they would have been better off buying BTC instead of a loaded collectible, but those that did mostly sold off their BTC on the way up.  Don't discount using your emotions against you to reach your goal.  Emotions are a powerful tool.  Learn to harness them.",

I have a safe that I mangled the key and did not put batteries in it for the code setting. If I wanted to get in to it I would need to drill through the metal casing which would hopefully deter any emotional swings and would make me think why I was protecting against this. My only concern is if these safes are mass produced and the key is not unique. It is a cheap one and is not fire resistant I do not think and does not have any fancy features",

There is no reason to force yourself to wait until an arbitrary date far into the future to sell your coin. There is a very real possibility that the price of bitcoin will be zero in 2030, and if you assume this to be what will happen, there is also a very real possibility that the price of bitcoin will be very high at some point in time before 2030. Based on how much coin you are holding, and your personal financial situation, there is a price point at which it no longer makes sense to continue holding if your long-term goal is to sell your coin, and you should have the ability to do that. From a technical perspective, what you are proposing is possible. You would need to implement a smart contract in which 2-of-2 signatures are required, with the second signature needing to be from 1-of-2 possible keys, and the other signature needing to be from your key.",

Although if OP manages to hold for 4 years he will have no longer issues holding for 4 more, I also agree that storing digitally is screaming for troubles.I would store the seed. I would put it into an envelope, surrounded by some black or at least thick paper so you cannot see through. And laminate all that so you are not tempted to take a look too often.Also I'd do this at least twice to have a backup (that I store somewhere else) in case my house burns down.Since you want to see your precioussss money is still in place, keeping an xpub or the relevant addresses at hand should be good, then you can take a look now and then in Electrum or a block explorer that you're still fine.",
