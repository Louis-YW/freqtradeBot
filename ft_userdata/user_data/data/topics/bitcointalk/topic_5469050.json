You must do your own research and do not try to get spoon-feeding from someone, because the person who will try to teach you something about BTT, will teach you what he has learned so far and that is limited. But if you would make your own efforts then you might cross that person and learn new things that your source might have not known about. You will learn a lot but you should try to start from the history of the BTC then you will come to know about the importance of this forum and the BTC.  The most iconic bitcointalk threads. History on Bitcointalk. and after getting familiar with the history of BTC you might want to learn about the rules and regulations of this forum, in that case, you should consider reading this thread --> Comprehensive guide to Bitcointalk.

Well i can be so sure that some of the points i did mentioned are already covered as I havn'nt read the whole thread yet but most of the information will be in top posts...

Because till now I have read about the features of BTC about like 100 times but every time I learned something new because each OP comes with a different type of explanation and from that explanation I got many ideas and understanding of not only BTC but other related technologies. And other than this, repeating topic sometimes work like a notification reminder to remind us about something.

But the only flaw is, that many members do not make it to other pages even the OP can not make it to the 3rd page.

I want to know something about your trading portfolio,  I didn't think that it will matters or may be it needs,  but bitcoin is a coin in which if we start from the very low amount,  we can't get that much of the profit by starting from a low portfolio. And also,  bitcoin is now a days moving upward,  which is a better sign of getting into profit. So,  you should get some knowledge about its analyzation,  how to analyze bitcoin and then it would be far better to Hodl it for better time. Things that we think is not matters a lot,  but in sometimes that can change the entire luck of a person.",

If you plan to create a wallet then you should choose the wallet provider where it is open source which means you can see the code in how it is built or created. You should also pick the wallet that is non-custodial where it's up to you on keeping it safe unlike the custodial wallet where the wallet provider is the one who keep the wallet information (like seed phrase) safe. Well, better start learning about the forum rules to avoid problems if you violate a forum rules unintentionally. Good luck.",

There is nothing about the coin that you can not learn from this forum,  just navigate through the forum and pick your areas of interest. This community is made up of people from different parts of the world with different cultures and traditions so you have to expect some form of misconceptions and sometimes arguments about different issues. If you are here to learn then you should be teachable and correctable. You might make mistakes that might warrant correction from the community, some might be polite or rude, but don't take it to heart. You should also avoid the use of Chatbox to make posts and avoid plagiarism. Make sure you reference the source of the information you share in the forum if they are not from you. If you can read the links you have been referred to,  you will have the best of time in this community.",
