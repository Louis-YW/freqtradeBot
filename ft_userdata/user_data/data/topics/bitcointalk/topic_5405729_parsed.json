Even some of the top upcoming professionals use a poker coach, it helps them to improve or find their leaks. You shouldn't be so harsh to a possible new member of the community unless what he is pushing is a guaranteed scam. I don't know the OP but users interested could maybe offer to escrow their money, he may be willing to do that if he wants to make some business here.",

Many user here especially high rank has this kind of thinking towards newbie without giving a fair evaluation first on what’s service he is offering. I deal many times on newbie here in the forum but on marketplace and some them is good to deal with when it comes to sales.Like every experienced person need to have an account in this forum with a higher rank, reputation or something. That's what they sounds like.It may sounds shady, but accusing someone just because a newbie is offering something is just an exaggeration. Most people here behave like that.Escrow is a thing here why not offer it to him if you want to be coached or something.",

But, maybe he can show a website, or an instagram page, or twitter page ecc. where he promote his product (I don't think that is the first time for him that promote thisproduct), also in way to see if him has an history. Maybe he can be also more trusted than us, but he needs to prove it.",

It is worth a try, I just think that there are so many people playing poker these days that the general level has also become quite high and it is difficult to build a stable income with it. You also have different levels in poker books and lessons. I believe that you can't learn everything in poker based on statistics, but you also need talent and always a hand full of luck to be successful.",

Yes, this is my first post on this forum but I registered around a month ago. I understand why you would think this is a scam attempt. But it’s not. And I do have something to lose since my goal is to sell more than one course. Yes, you are right, poker can be learned freely. But some people are sometimes looking for a deeper dive into poker concepts. That’s just what I am offering. I am willing to give everyone a free overview of what I’m offering.",

I think this has nothing to do with scam. And if someone claims they bought the OP course but couldn't earn anything, that person can't accuse OP of a scam either because OP is not promising that people will make money, he's just selling course (knowledge)welcome to the forum, how long have you been teaching poker courses?",

Just imagine opening a free account on this forum and sudden op want to sell poker courses for cheap price. Things does not work like this, op need to grow his account or rather do this in other section not necessarily to be here. It all depends on if people are really interested in a poker course that we can easily learn on youtube without stress.",

To be clear, I am a part time poker player. I play mostly CG at 10NL and 25NL This post was not about coaching (even though, I do coach a little). Over the past couple years, I have accumulated quite a few poker courses and I am just offering them for a very cheap price. To answer your question, I do believe those courses help you become a better poker player. BUT being a great poker player is a whole. You need to work on your fundamentals, review hands on a regular basis, have a study group and, last but not least, work on your mental game. Poker courses are just the beginning of the journey.",
