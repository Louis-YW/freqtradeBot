  "content": "Dear Bitcointalk Community,We're thrilled to unveil Etherchain, a Proof of Work blockchain powered by the Ethash algorithm. Our core vision is to preserve and build upon the legacy of PoW Ethereum, bringing the benefits of decentralized, secure, and energy-efficient mining to the forefront of blockchain innovation.About Etherchain:Etherchain isn't just another blockchain project; it's a testament to the enduring significance of Proof of Work in the cryptocurrency landscape. By embracing the Ethash algorithm, Etherchain aims to continue the PoW Ethereum tradition while advancing the technology for a new era of miners, developers, and enthusiasts.Key Features and Highlights:¬†¬† ¬†* Proof of Work Heritage: Etherchain is rooted in the principles that made Ethereum's PoW mechanism so influential. We believe in the security, decentralization, and inclusiveness that PoW brings to the crypto ecosystem.¬†¬† ¬†* Ethash Algorithm: Our blockchain will utilize the Ethash algorithm, providing miners with familiar territory and ensuring compatibility with existing Ethash-based mining hardware.¬†¬† ¬†* Decentralization and Security: By focusing on PoW, we're prioritizing a network that is resistant to centralization and censorship, where every miner contributes to the network's security and consensus.¬†¬† ¬†* Community-Centric Approach: We recognize the importance of community involvement. Etherchain's development will be guided by the insights and feedback of our community members.What's Next:In the coming weeks, we will share in-depth information about Etherchain's technology, development roadmap, tokenomics, and how you can actively participate. This pre-announcement serves as a teaser for the exciting journey we're embarking upon.Stay Connected:Join us on our official channels to stay updated and engaged:¬†¬† * Website: https://etherchain.io/ ¬†¬† * Twitter: https://twitter.com/EtherchainPoW ¬†¬† * Discord: https://discord.gg/GhC6PQHNtb ¬†¬† * Github: https://github.com/EtherchainETX No premine or presale of Etherchain will take place. Our intention is to ensure an equitable launch of the chain, providing equal opportunities to all participants.Thank you for your interest and support. Stay tuned for more exciting updates!Warm regards,The Etherchain Team",

It's time to prepare your mining equipment!Concerning the Etherchain block reward, there will be a total of 7 coins distributed per block. Miners will receive 5 coins, 1 coin will be allocated for staking rewards, and the remaining 1 coin will be directed towards the development fund.Etherchain has plans to introduce a staking option in the near future, where a fixed amount of coins (i.e. 10,000 coins) will be required for staking.Launch Timer: https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/launch?iso=20230905T15&p0=136&msg=Etherchain+Mainnet+Launch&font=sanserif&csz=1",

      "body": "Why 1 coin per block has been allocated for the development fund?To grow Etherchain, we need substantial funds. Nobody works for free, and we have various expenses like marketing, exchange listings, development, server maintenance, and supporting our team. Some other projects get their funding through presales or by keeping a lot of coins initially (premine), but then they sell these coins quickly, causing the market to crash. A better approach is to allocate a small portion of the block rewards gradually, instead of a big initial allocation. This way, our team stays motivated and has the funding needed for the long-term.Some people argue that the team should have absolutely no coins from the project and should pay for everything out of their own pockets. However, if you think about it, it makes sense for the team to have some coins since they are investing their own money ‚Äì it's like buying a stake in their own project.",
