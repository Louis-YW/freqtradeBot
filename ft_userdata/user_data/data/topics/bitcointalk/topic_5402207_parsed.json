  "content": "We are currently hearing this word \"BTC SegWit address\" in many places, for those who don't know about it, details are given belowWhat is SegWit ?Quote from: trustwalletcommunity link=https://community.trustwallet.com/t/trust-wallet-is-segwit-compatible/923Segregated Witness (SegWit) is a protocol upgrade developed in 2015. The protocol upgrade brought up a number of benefits, such as improved transaction speed and block capacity. In addition, SegWit solved the so-called transaction malleability bug.As of June 2020, Bech32 349 is supported in many popular wallets and is the preferred address scheme. How to create SegWit (Bech32) BTC wallet address and why it is worth a while?Quote from: CoinDeal link=https://coindeal.com/support/article/segwit/Before we describe how to create a SegWit Bitcoin address, you should know that there are two main reasons why you should do it.First of all, as an innovative exchange platform, we want to show our support to the SegWit adoption and therefore every BTC withdrawal done to a bech32 address will reduce the CoinDeal withdrawal fee by half. Additionally, it is important to remember that EVERY transaction you do FROM a bech32 Bitcoin address (starting with bc1…) is going to be cheaper than if you did it using old/legacy BTC address (starting with 1… or 2…).There are several ways of getting a bech32 BTC address as some online/desktop wallets offer to create them for you. In our eyes, one of the best and safest option is to get an Electrum desktop app and use it to create a BTC wallet supporting SegWit.Here is a short guide on how to do so:Step 1: Download the app hereStep 2: Create a new wallet by giving it a name: Step 3: Choose the type of wallet (for our purposes, Standard is enough)Step 4: Select ‘Create a new seed’ from the list. It is a safety measure allowing a wallet recoveryStep 5: Select Segwit from the Seed type list:Step 6: Write down the generated words (seed) in a safe place where you will not lose it:Step 7: Create a password if you want to restrict the access to your wallet within Electrum app:Step 8: Your wallet address will be visible upon going to ‘Receive’ tab:Important notes regarding Electrum wallet:You can use the same wallet address to receive funds, however, Electrum will generate a new address for you each time as it is a more recommended way in the blockchain worldBefore sending/receiving BTC via Electrum, it would be best to read through their documentation or to search videos/articles explaining in more details what is Segwit wallet and how it worksThere are more benefits to using bech32 addresses, however, once again we would like to point out that aside from having lower fees for sending BTC from Segwit addresses, you are also getting 50% lower fees on Coindeal when withdrawing Bitcoins from our cryptocurrency trading platform to an external bech32 wallet address.Is trust wallet compatible with Segwit?Quote from: trustwalletcommunity link=https://community.trustwallet.com/t/trust-wallet-is-segwit-compatible/923Your new Bitcoin , Litecoin , Viacoin  and Digibyte  Wallet are native SegWit compatible which means you can send/receive to/from any bech32 address.I have tried my best to give as much information as possible, sorry if anything is wrong. Thank You",

      "body": "Thank you for quoting the guide on how to create a segwit wallets with Electrum but I think it's a bit outdated. Newer version of Electrum will create a segwit wallet (bech32 adresses starting with bc1) by default and this is since version 4.1.0 (March 2021)*.Newer version of Electrum do not allow creating legacy wallets from the GUI anymore. To do so you have to use the command line.Or you can generate a legacy seed from the Console by typing this command:Code:make_seed(seed_type=\"standard\")* https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/29d8d8de2619bba9f87c2cc6ca3e68ae2b33031f/RELEASE-NOTES#L152",

There are plenty of other scripts which can be encoded in a P2SH address and will have addresses starting with 3 while not being nested segwit.Bech32 is the encoding of the character set and checksum, not an address type. Native segwit is more accurately called P2WPKH (pay to witness pubkeyhash).Now that we have taproot (P2TR, which also use bech32 encoding), you need to specify that native segwit addresses start with bc1q.

Exchanges can accept any of it. As far as I still know, you can maintain privacy and anonymity and still pay into the exchanges if your coin is not tainted or involved in illegal transactions. Yet, both native segwit and P2TR are not privacy means of payment like Monero and Litecoin Minblewinble. Although, you can have privacy if you know how or maintain anonymity while using bitcoin for payment, but bitcoin blockchain is transparent and available to the public.Quote from: pooya87 on June 18, 2022, 03:57:41 AMIf any exchange is not yet supporting Bech32 addresses today then you can't really call it \"late\" because it's been 5 years already!
