What would be that? LINK? SOL? BTC? ETH? Whatever. You can exchange for bitcoin first, then maybe when you later have some more funds you can invest on other coins you mentioned as an addition, but I don't think polkadot is upto 80% as of today, but you can consider that if you put into consideration right from it all time high, but we can't still tell, if you can hold and wait till after next year bullrun.Quote from: a298b112 on December 04, 2023, 05:12:38 PMSo the idea is, to save remaining fund which is down 80% and hopefully some gains.

Moreover, starting from October, the price of the Dot coin increases every day. So your concerns are unfounded and you just need to focus on the hold. Or do you consider the decrease in the price of the coin from high, which occurred in 2021? If this is the case, then you decided too late to take measures to save your deposit.",

With respect to the question in OP, what actually do you advise the Op should do about his portfolio in -80%?Quote from: tvplus006 on December 04, 2023, 07:56:21 PMQuote from: a298b112 on December 04, 2023, 05:12:38 PMI have some DOT, and it is down ~80% today from total allocation...There was no such reduction in the price of the Dot that you are writing about today.

Hold and wait till bull run, the coin could recover upto 50% and you can sell. I made a similar mistake with Shiba in 2021 and I am still at lose upto -70%",

I will decide what to do. However, I would also like to know what are some strategies if there are any that other people might be taking. I am new to the crypto and markets so, there are plenty of thing I don't know. So would be good to see what would other people do in this situation. Anyway, thanks.",

I think that DOT is still gonna have some come back and pump in the altcoins bull. If I am in that percentage of loss, I won't do anything and will keep it as is because for me, that's already too late to cut loss or even allocate it on other altcoins. And if I want to buy some other cryptos, then I'd use another fund for it. But if you insist and you want to, the best bet is don't go with meme coins or any random altcoins. Trust the established ones and so DOT is and it's just all about the market of it and the recovery that you're going to wait patiently.",

      "body": "Selling now that the price is down by -80%, that's going to give you a big loss already, and if you end up buying another altcoin, you never know how the price can turn out, so it's better to just accumulate some bitcoin instead of taking the risk with another altcoin. If you also have some money to still invest in Bitcoin while you also keep holding your DOT, then it's still good because if by chance the DOT pumps during the main bull market, then you might also regret why you sold the token so early. Just make a better decision so that you will not end up blaming yourself.",
