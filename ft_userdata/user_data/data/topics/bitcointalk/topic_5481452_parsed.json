  "content": "AbstractHow about considering the \"sell to buy more strategy?\"This is just a common strategy where you have to sell your bitcoin bit by bit during the peak of every bull market. From history, the peak bull market usually takes place the year after Bitcoin halved. So, what is implied by this strategy is to sell your formal hold during the bull market, then buy back during the bear market. The bear market will surely come after the bull market. Read further, and you will see the risk attached, the reason for the strategy, and how to go about it. This strategy could be what another Bitcoiner might have practiced or is actually planning to do too, but I have been on this forum for a year and three months now, and I have not actually come across people talking relatively to this type of Bitcoin investment idea more often, probably because they think it's not worth it or because it's just nothing special.If not many, I have seen at least two old members of this forum whose comments stated that they have been holding their bitcoin for more than 8–10 years now and have not sold any bitcoin from their holding. while, the price of bitcoin has been going up during every bull market and falling again during the bear market.There is this phrase, buy the dip and hold, which refers to buying Bitcoin at a low price or at a price you (the investor) consider to be the bottom or cheap. After buying the dip, you must also be willing to hold the investment until a bull market occurs. (Buying the dip and holding it for a long time until it generates a huge profit is a profitable means of investing in Bitcoin.)It's normal to invest in Bitcoin and hold it for as many years as you want, and while holding, you can still invest more using the DCA method, but the strategy I want to discuss is also simple and will be profitable if properly managed.Bitcoin is known to have two seasons, which are the bear and bull seasons. The bull season usually starts in the year of the bitcoin halving or the year after the halving. Looking at the price history of Bitcoin, the price usually experiences a sharp fall in price after the bull market is over, and if perhaps you sold your Bitcoin during the bull market, you can hold your money (fiat) and wait for the bear market, which gives rise to a sharp fall in the Bitcoin price. Then you can buy more bitcoin, which is more than the number or fraction that you sold in the bull market.A Little Recap of The 3 Circles of Bitcoin HalvingThe first Bitcoin halving happened in 2012; from price history, through out that year, Bitcoin traded just around the price range of $4.7–$16, but in 2013, the bull market kicked in and Bitcoin spiked above $1000 for the first time. The bear market started in 2014, as the price dropped to $320.19 at the close of the year.The second halving took place in 2016, as the starting price for that year was $400+, but in 2017, the price spiked again, and for the first time, Bitcoin got to $19k+ around December of that year. In 2018, in the month of December, bitcoin dropped to about $3,100 (a bear market too).Third halving of Bitcoin is what many people already knew about. After the halving took place in 2020, during 2021 the bull market started and Bitcoin got to $68k, but we all know the story after then till now. Why do I think it's wise and can be profitable to apply Bitcoin's sell-to-buy-more strategy?Because Bitcoin will definitely experience a bear market after every bull market.Because if you manage the strategy well, you will increase your holding.Because Bitcoin is a volatile asset, the price must definitely swing up and down.Because the three experienced Bitcoin halving has proven that the bear and bull markets are always certain.Possible risk involved in this strategy. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and its predicted price is not usually very accurate.You will not accurately know what the ATH (peak) will be during the bull market.You will not know what the bottom price will be during a bear market.While holding a fiat and waiting for a bear market, the fiat could devalue. Secondly, fiat is a centralized currency; just hope nothing gets complicated on the smart contract while holding a huge sum of it in your wallet.How to go about this strategy:Step 1= First, if you invest in Bitcoin, read about the price speculation of other people and price discussions on the forum, and also make your own assumptions about the price that you are expecting during the bull market.Step 2= Set out 2–3 target prices for which you will like to sell your bitcoin, and when the bull market starts, sell in different fractions as you earlier set your target price(Note: don't sell all your bitcoin at once). After you have sold, patiently hold on to your fiat. While doing so, also be active in discussions relating to price, then make your prediction and also set a price target that you would love to buy. Note: don't buy with all your fiat at once, DCA should be applied. Reason why you must not invest all fait at once is because price might still dip more. If you sell high at the bull market and buy low at the bear market, you stand the chance to have increased your holding.For example, if you bought 1 bitcoin for $16k in the month of January 2023 and you are still holding it now, you are already on profit. Keep holding. Perhaps you hold until the peak bull market starts this year or towards the end of next year, and maybe the price of bitcoin gets to $80k, $90k, and $100k+, respectively, and progressively. After selling your Bitcoin at those said price, your total asset becomes $100k or more, and you hold that money till 2026 when the bear market will start again (and perhaps the price drops to $60k, $50k, and $40k, respectively,) you will be able to buy more that the 1 Bitcoin you bought. If you buy one bitcoin at $16k and sell it at $100k, then the price drops to $50k and you re-buy it again, spending $100k, that amount will buy you an extra one bitcoin, making it possible for you to own two bitcoins rather than the one you were holding. That's what I call \"sell to buy more strategy. \"",

I have my fears however, the fact that the time of the sell is not determined by the peak of the market but by your analysis gives me a thing to worry about. What if you sell and the price keeps appreciating?When you sell, you can not tell for how long it will hold before the bears take over, what if life happens and you have to use the resurces thinking it will be refunded before the bear season sets in. Too mny variables just keesps me away from deploying this strategy.",

The strategy you shared was probably discussed in a few hundred threads in multiple boards of Bitcoin so it isn't really a special strategy but an effective one as you said if one who successfully pulls their moves at the right time which is market peaks and bottomed down.Quote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on January 13, 2024, 01:11:20 PMIf not many, I have seen at least two old members of this forum whose comments stated that they have been holding their bitcoin for more than 8–10 years now and have not sold any bitcoin from their holding. while, the price of bitcoin has been going up during every bull market and falling again during the bear market.HODLing is what most of the early investors follow because they know that simply holding it is enough to bring returns that is not possible in any other kind of investment so why take the risk of buying/selling and then buying again at the next cycle.",

No, shorting is a very precise trading term. If you sell, you sell, that has nothing to do with shorting. Yes, with crypto the only way to short is doing it with a contract, like futures. Shorting requires borrowing in fact if you pay fees to short a coin. Please check online the definition of the term. Selling high and buying when the market deeps is simply trading and what any trader should do, lol. What do you suggest buying at the top and selling at the bottom instead?",

That's what I call \"sell to buy more strategy. \"There are models of the price of BTC that allows to determine areas when the price of BTC is overvalued and when the price is oversold. I have worked on a model for several years and I have used it to find the bottoms almost perfectly and to come close to the tops. Tops are more difficult to determine but we can still identify areas where it is to sell even if not quite at the top. Here is the model that I'm discussing:https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18z04kp/15_years_of_btc_power_law/I programmed this method in Tradingview by telling the algo to buy when the price is 50 % the trendline and sell when the price is 200 % of the trendline. I did backtesting over the last 10 years and the success rate is basically 100 % and one can literally multiply the BTC themselves by 100x of time even without leverage. With time the distance from the bottom to the top is becoming smaller but there are still chances to make at least 5x if one times correctly these moves. The model I have shown helps with timing more precisely the entry and exits.",

      "body": "I have gone through the whole thread and I believe the strategy that you have presented in your thread is a quite useful and working strategy. That's the strategy which I have been following for quite some time with my own take and it has been profitable for me so far. But, you'll have to understand that we can't really predict with 100% accuracy that what's going to be Bitcoin's ATH in a bull run. I know that most of us have our own speculations and predictions but those aren't 100% correct. Let's say if most of the people predicted that Bitcoin would reach $120k during this bull run's peak and some of them predicted that it will reach $150k, then it's better to avoid both of those predictions and set 20% less than $120k as your first selling target for 25% of your holdings and 20% less than $150k as your 2nd selling target for other 25% of holdings. In this case $96K is the price for first target to sell 25% of your holdings and  $120k is the 2nd target to sell 25% of your holdings, I know that Bitcoin has chance to go up to $120k or $150k or even more than that during this bull run but we need to set good selling targets that are highly achievable.I would also suggest you to never sell all of your Bitcoin holdings even if you're 100% sure that Bitcoin's price can drop after the bull run. I would say only sell 50% of it at maximum and 25% at minimum. That way you won't be without Bitcoin even if in the next bear market Bitcoin's value doesn't drop below $96k.",

Yes, 50 % from the top is good bet without any other tools to estimate tops and bottom. I think $140,000 is conservative for the top. current mining economics of value premium acquisition costs put this part of 2024 at $25k-$140k window of speculation between ultimate support and ultimate resistance right now (and thats based on actual math of mining cost)so $140k is an achievable max(just).. where as $200k if hashrate stays same is not achievable today of there was a FOMO/HYPE momentall those claiming $500k by 2025 ATH would only be correct if the mining economics 3x in the next 18 monthsso safe bet is the $140k limit(based on math of planets mining cost premium)",

For instance, a cousin of mine is a contract manager, and his job doesn't come steadily, so this method will surely profit him if he is a Bitcoiner or an investor.Perhaps if he has a stash of Bitcoin that was bought as a result of DCA or lump sum while he was still in contract and now that he is out of contract, he could be using the OP's accumulation strategy to increase his stash now that he is out of contract while waiting for another job. So this ideal is a win-win ideal  if properly applied as Dr. B.S. specified above.",

But I wish there were other terms that better befit the strategy I talked about since it's still a long-term investment and not just shorting or going long for a short-term profit. (Don't forget you will still have to buy and hold for some years.) Quotealso if you look more into your \"little recap of 3 cycles\"you will notice the bottom of cycle 2 did not drop below high of cycle 1you will notice the bottom of cycle 3 did not drop below high of cycle 2Yeah, you are right; the bottom of circle 2 was around $3k+ and did not go below the high of circle 1, which was $1k+. But for the second statement, I think your calculation was wrong.The bottom of circle 3 was around $15k+ (November 2022), while the high of circle 2 was around $19k,which means that the bottom of circle 3 actually went below the high of circle 2, although it might not be the same trend this time.Since the high of circle 3 was $65k+ and the bottom was $15k, if the all-time high of this next bull run becomes $120k, is there any certainty that it could not go below $65k when the bottom comes either in 2026 or 2027? (It could still possibly go below that high.).Probably someone who sold at their target price starting from $100k to $120k can still buy in the range of $70k down.(If the price slid down below high of circle 3).",
