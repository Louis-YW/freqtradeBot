  "content": "There's a weird story i totally missed in Sam Bankman-Fried's case, and that is the fact that the lawsuit against SBF, includes a memo that detailed plans to purchase a whole country with money from FTX to build a shelter that could withheld an apocalyptic event.Now, one could argue there's more than one use cases for owning your own sovereign nation. Especially when the nation is already blacklisted internationally because of their blatant money laundering for super rich. If FTX (or sam) indeed managed to buy this island before it came cashing down, how much of different situation they would be facing right now?Source:https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/07/21/sam-bankman-frieds-brother-allegedly-wanted-to-buy-pacific-island-country-to-build-doomsday-bunker-for-effective-altruists/",

      "body": "As more and more stories are revealed surrounding the FTX/SBF fiasco, the more we are enthralled by the level of absurdity Sam and minions exhibited. The avalanche of money really exposed the people behind FTX and they were not able to contain their evil human nature which is unfortunate to the whole cryptocurrency industry. Let's close this chapter with big lessons and a big warning to all platforms operating in the industry to think more of the right things and not be influenced by their imaginary plans not based on doing good. Anyway, no I don't think it can be true that SBF can buy Nauru, in the first place.",

And this will anger more a lot of people that it could have been their money used on this one which is likely.",
