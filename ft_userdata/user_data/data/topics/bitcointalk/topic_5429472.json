You shouldn't bank on a prediction, cause people say things for different reasons; could be their perspective of the market, or saying what the public wants to hear, to build followership.You should only trust your judgement, and this involves trusting yourself to trust the judgement of someone who you consider informed. There are a few useful content on the social space, but they are mostly drowned out by the shillers and bull market merchants.",

      "body": "The cryptocurrency market is open for everybody to earn money. The crypto trading telegram channels make lots of money by predicting the crypto market for premium members. The truth that nobody can predict the cryptocurrency market price correctly is not yet disclosed to clienteles who are victims. I've followed some channels in the past that claim to provide accurate market price predictions, but if the analysis goes wrong they'll restructure a new lie. Customers, here, only care about big profits, eventually it'll close their eyes and leave them blind towards deceits. However, variety of people with different perspectives of cryptocurrency, flood the cryptocurrency community everyday in hundreds and thousands. Newbies that joined the cryptocurrency sphere believing its a get rich quick scheme constantly remain blind to a bunch of con artists in the market including the premium channels for price prediction, thereby spending money meant for investments on worthless services.",

Now at least you won't believe (or at least be skeptical about) all these predictions regarding further changes in the field of currencies in the media and YouTube. Indeed, no one knows what will happen and all talk is just speculation. Of course, the entire responsibility for investing in crypto currencies lies only with the users themselves. This is precisely the advantage of crypto currencies. You just need to study and expand your horizons at least a little in order to bear this burden of responsibility with dignity and without loss.",

The whole crypto economy depends on bitcoin so there's really no need to take additional risk by investing in altcoins. I have some ETH because it's something different from bitcoin and I want to see how it does, but most of my money was and still is in bitcoin. I will continue to hold if the price falls to 12 or 10k, I don't care because I know that this is temporary. Bitcoin will succeed and it will continue to grow and by holding I show my support for the project.
