  "content": "Hello, i've been into mining since early 2021 and recently decided to add variety to my portfolio.Lately on my twitter feed a new coin keeps popping up - SaverToken (SVR). Chart looks good, active twitter account, has all the social media (Discord, Instagram, Telegram), even whitepaper information interests me because i'm into mining. Could someone share their thoughts whether this project has any promise?https://savertoken.org/https://twitter.com/SaverTokenThank you guys",
