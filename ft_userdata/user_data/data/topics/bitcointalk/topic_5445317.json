  "content": "Hello to all!Looking for a software development partner without investment in a Project to create a new bitcoin mining pool.I am also a developer in the past, but now I want to give the development and technical implementation to a partner.I already have an agreement to run our mining pool on a fairly large farm that now produces about 50 bitcoins per month and they are now mining through Binance Pool which takes 2.5% commission from them.We are supposed to be more modest and take 1% commission.The principle of \"win-win\".And this will be the starting point of our mining pool.After that, we will expand our referral program among miners and companies selling ASICs, and increase the number of independent miners connected to our pool.I have also repaired ASICs, and there is some technical understanding to develop my own firmware for ASICs that is more optimal for users. But that's the next stage.I also have a very cool programmer for low-level programming, but he needs \"guidance\" and \"tasking\".Maybe we can partially use some existing open source solutions to some extent, but that needs to be searched and tested and most likely refined.If you are a developer and are interested in an interesting Project, drop me a message on Telegram @dkr_1993_2Thank you for your attention.",

I think this one is the best option nowadays.https://github.com/tpruvot/yiimpthe installation instructions and the requisites are really clear, Since you are a developer I don't think you will have any problem with it. So, good luck with the project.",

Let more your post affects other issues of bitcoin before upgrading to proposals so that people can easily buy to your ideas with fear of frauds.As long as OP can provide some details of his business, being a newbie should not be a problem. Some popular services that I know of don't even bother upgrading their account member and just straight-up run signature campaigns to promote their services. Obviously, this doesn't work for OP, but he can do something else to attract interest from others. For example, giving proof that his current mining farm does produce 50 bitcoins per month, or uses Binance pool to mine, etc. I don't think that is difficult and break his privacy either if that is an issue. OP, you can also try posting on the Services board if you can pay your team with Bitcoin. Especially if you're open to using an escrow.",

My personal farm does not produce 50 bitcoins a monthÂ  I made an arrangement with another, affiliate farm that has enough sites with the right electrical capacity and is currently actually producing approximately 50 bitcoins a month through the Binance pool.Proof of my words, apparently, can be provided later.I am not asking for any investment, so I see no urgent need to prove anything to anyone. Besides, the point of the pool is to have a LOT of customers and a lot of connected farms, not just one. So even if this farm decides to disconnect, or switch to another pool, or even starrt to mine solo - it should not have a fatal effect on the project.I've seen a lot of dead pools that have ceased to exist. And if we focus only on the first farm, which I found - we are likely to suffer the same fate. Of course, maybe we can use some open source solutions like yiimp, but we also need nice client accounts with statistics and good servers with minimal pings.",

I can understand your point of view, but again I doubt anyone would accept your words at face value since you're new on this forum. Giving proof that you do have a business that is running and doing what you've described in your post is one of the ways you can increase your credibility. You can choose not to and wait until someone ask for private communication or something else, it is not mandatory. If you plan to hire and post on the Services board though, I doubt you'll get far without at least doing something similar as I mentioned above. Anyway, best of luck to you OP.",
