Like a day ago, I have 0.003 balance where 0.002 I sent to gambling site, and the rest+fee 0.001 (0.00997) automatic sent (HD) to 1st change address (yellow mark) on electrum.  the question is, is possible I modified change address?, example: I want to send 0.00997 to gxkum on 2nd address on pic automatically.",

I have received these two UTXOs in two different addresses. Now, I want to send 0.05 BTC without using coin control feature. As far as I know, electrum would use the UTXOB and wouldn't use UTXOA at all. 0.05 BTC will be sent to the recipient and 0.01 BTC minus transaction fee will be sent to the address specified using \"!\". So, my coins won't be consolidated. Correct me if I am wrong, please.",

With coin control, you don't specify the change address. Coin control allows you to select which UTXO(s) you want to be used. Assume that you have three UTXOs and you want to make a transaction using a specific UTXO. You can go to coin control and select the desired UTXO. Now, it's like that you only have that specific UTXO and the two other UTXOs won't be used for your transaction.",

A newcomer may not know what that is and try something that could lead to some fund losses. Features like this are better left somewhat hidden and only for \"advanced\" users.",
