We should not be contributing to the referencing of this link.Also when a newbie with 1 post asks that question it is basically 99% shot it is a scam.So a piece of gear that has the hash power of 10 s19 j pros and burns 650 watts vs 30000 wattsand it also has the hash power of 44 L7's and burns 650 watts versus 132,000 watts.and it is cheap price. =  Scam!!",

Think of their comments as a lesson in learning to always dig deeper on your own before asking in a public Forum  Do a search using asic miner speed as the search term to see what I mean... The top results are current best available.That all said, yeah that particular scam (dual coins at the same time with incredible speed/power 'specs') comes up at least 2-3x a year and is probably ran by the same people...One does have to ask where you came across that site? I do hope it wasn't from Coindesk or similar BTC 'news' site which are mostly pay-to-publish sites. Several years ago Coindesk ran a 'new product announcement' and 'reviews' on said miners for company running the exact same scam and got raked over the coals for it. Hopefully they have learned to at least use a *little* due-diligence on that sort of 'news'...",

It's pretty simple, you see gear that:- is double or more in efficiency than anything bitmain or microbt have- mines multiple algorithms- is twice as cheap compared to what any reseller offersit's a scam.Quote from: vvic on August 21, 2024, 08:46:46 AM This is not 100% scam, this is 10000% scamNeah, it's just 1000%, for 10 000% they would need to claim it mines ethereum.",
