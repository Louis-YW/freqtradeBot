You've misunderstood the things greatly. Most people will try to scam you, whether this is about crypto or not. Scamming others means easy money.This being said, since scamming with crypto tends to be easier than with other means of payment, learn to watch your back.The website you're mentioning is at least writing all that into ToS. Many others don't do even that. Ask around and go only to the sites/services others (preferably not newbies) recommend. Ask first.And as a final word: keep in mind that crypto faucets tend to be a huge waste of time for the users. If you calculate the cost of the electricity you've used for browsing that crap, you'll see that you could have been much better by using that money to buy actual bitcoins.",

Sometimes many types of scams start like that by letting us continue to be carried away by the gifts given through the advertisements we click on.From the quote alone I'm not sure if they are really serious. They even openly allow you to transfer funds from your account balance to the purchase balance.Think again my friend.Most people lose funds by clicking on ads or links provided.",

It's quite difficult if you have to get 10 active referrals, but how much do you get? If it's big enough and you have to make a deposit to take what you collected, then undo your intention, it will only trick you by taking what you deposited. Nowadays such type of Faucet is very rare to find and really pays. Bitcoins are getting more and more expensive and getting scarcer, so there's no easy way to earn more from ad clicks and so on.",

Moreover, even if you find a reputable website that respects its users, you'll simply waste your time since the rewards are minimal and practically not worth the time and effort you'd be putting in to earn a few Satoshi. On top of that, some platforms have an excessive minimum withdrawal amount, which will make you give up any earnings to them.Thus, it's best to go through the TOS briefly and do your own research by reading valid reviews from other users. Whether or not it's worth the effort, I leave that up to you.",

This test is performed to see the effectivity of buying traffic, but it makes me wonder why people set something up like that and hope for investors to chim in with a set up like that?

The one who are really earning to this scheme are the owners of the \"free bitcoin\" sites. Imagine that they are trying to make you lure people in their site and at the same time making you run another set of advertisement. There are nothing free in this industry anymore, you need to offer something like service, identity or efforts just to get the reward you deserve. At the end of the day, This kind of sites is just a waste of time. Focusing on other things such as learning is much better than wasting your time earning there.",

It's much better to take everything for yourself than to constantly share it with someone else, leaving you with only a portion of the funds. This is why crypto scams are created, because they are insanely profitable, you can spend money on templates, spend money on advertising and then build a good pool.
