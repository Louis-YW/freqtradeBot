  "content": "Next Generation A.I. Blockchain: FEPC will be listing on CEX soonBased on the pioneering work of Dynex (https://dynexcoin.org), our blockchain has been designed to support Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence tasks. Miners can not only contribute hashing to the blockchain, but can also run Neuromorphic computations, which are at the core of any next generation system. In twenty years, nearly all data will become digitised, making it possible to use AI for decision-making and optimization. AI and automation will replace most blue-collar work and “make” products for minimal marginal cost. Robots and AI will take over the manufacturing, delivery, design and marketing of most goods. FEPC is an innovative blockchain enabling Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology are two groundbreaking innovations that have been transforming various industries independently. However, the convergence of these two technologies holds tremendous potential to revolutionise how we harness the power of data, enhance trust, and unlock new possibilities for AI. In this article, we will explore the ways in which AI can benefit from blockchain and the promising implications it brings. In this connect, neuromorphic computing is an approach to designing computer systems that takes inspiration from the human brain. In simple terms, it aims to create computer chips that work more like our brains do. The human brain is incredibly powerful and efficient at processing information. It consists of billions of interconnected neurons that communicate with each other using electrical signals. Neuromorphic computing tries to mimic this structure and function of the brain to perform computations.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology are two groundbreaking innovations that have been transforming various industries independently. However, the convergence of these two technologies holds tremendous potential to revolutionize how we harness the power of data, enhance trust, and unlock new possibilities for AI. In this article, we will explore the ways in which AI can benefit from blockchain and the promising implications it brings. FEPC is a POW based coin empowering this trend.Data is the lifeblood of AI, and ensuring its quality, security, and privacy are paramount. Blockchain provides a decentralized and immutable ledger that enables secure and transparent data management. Through blockchain, AI systems can securely access and verify data sources, ensuring high-quality inputs for training and decision-making. Moreover, blockchain's cryptographic techniques and consensus mechanisms can protect data integrity and prevent unauthorized tampering or manipulation, enhancing data trustworthiness. Federated learning, where AI models are trained on decentralized devices, addresses privacy concerns associated with centralized data collection. Blockchain acts as a coordination layer, enabling secure and privacy-preserving federated learning. Instead of sending raw data to a central server, blockchain facilitates the training process while preserving data privacy. This breakthrough allows individuals to contribute their local data for model training, empowering them to retain control over their sensitive information while benefiting from AI advancements.The convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology presents a transformative paradigm shift. By combining the strengths of AI and blockchain, we can unlock new possibilities for secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving AI systems. From enhanced data management and privacy to transparent and auditable AI models, the potential benefits are vast. Upcoming CEX ListingFEPC will be listed on a CEX shortly. This is a pre-announcement.FEPC is Open SourceWe believe in democratisation: FEPC is a Dynex fork, fully open source and available in our GitHub repository, including the latest releases of our nodes and wallets. FEPC is using CryptoNight as its POW algorithm, which can also be mined with ASICs.Coin name: Future Economy PayCoin ticker: FEPCMain net launch: 08-04-2023Links:Website: https://fepcoin.orgGithub: https://github.com/FEPCoin/FEPC/tree/mainTokenomics: https://fepcoin.org/economic-modelGovernance: https://fepcoin.org/governance",

We forked Dynex from the version just before they made DynexSolve mandatory on 1st December, because we think this model was more fair. Our nodes and sources have been public since main-net launch, and some people are mining it. We currently do not have a pool yet.",
