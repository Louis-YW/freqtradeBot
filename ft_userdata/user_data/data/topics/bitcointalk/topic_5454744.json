  "content": "Hello everyone. I would like to ask you to join and mine Canxium coin (CAU), this is the beginning of new coin and it'll support offline mining this year.More miners join, more decentralized Canxium will have. CAU can be distributed more and more widely.More information can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5453820.0",

These are algorithms for ASICs and mining on them is unprofitable if the miner has a video card. Then you want to add more algorithms and staking. This does not look like the development of the project, but the addition of mining algorithms.",

This does not look like the development of the project, but the addition of mining algorithms.Exactly.It does make no sense to make mining of a new coin this difficult at all.In fact most coins when coming out they are starting with a very low difficulty so people can have a look at that type of coin and see if they like it,if not they get away.You OP by doing this,adding without any logic of algorithms you just make it burdensome to mine this type of coin and most people will be turning away from your project,not that there are many profitable projects nowadays in mining anyway but why turn people away since the early beginning?",

This does not look like the development of the project, but the addition of mining algorithms.Why do you make coin mining so difficult: Why do I have to make the coin mining so easy? Why? I just make the coin mining become stable, not too easy at the beginning or too difficult at the middle or the end.First use the Ethash algorithm: Because Ethereum drop Pow, I choose ethash for one reason: Continue where Ethereum left.Then plan to add the SHA256, X11 algorithms: More algorithms, more miners, but same difficult.These are algorithms for ASICs and mining on them is unprofitable if the miner has a video card: Just buy an Asic, and let video card where it belong to.Then you want to add more algorithms and staking: Not staking, it's POS. Pos but no staking reward. POS + Offline mining fix the Pow problem.This does not look like the development of the project, but the addition of mining algorithms: Just the begining.",

If it make no sense, why canxium network reach 1 TH difficulty just one month after launched, why miners around the world are mining it now?Don't be silly. Take the risk, or lose the chance.",
