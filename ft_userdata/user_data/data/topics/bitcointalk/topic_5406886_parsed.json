Why not try to use other managing tools like Minerstat, Awesomeminer and hiveOS. They do support ebang units and support almost all ASIC models.",

      "body": "I found \"Ebang Miner Management Method\" on the \"ASIC Miner Troubleshoot\" page of zeusbtc.com, and then I checked Ebang's official website according to the introduction, but it seems that the website has changed, and I can't find the download link of the management tool . I think you could try contacting their staff, and ask if there is an other download method or if they have a file for the tool.",
