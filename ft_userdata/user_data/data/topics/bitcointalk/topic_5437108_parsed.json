Shorts were not recommended after such drastic falls back to back already.Also, BTC was very favourable in this month, since coin is related to crypto, it will rise when btc rises. News is not everything. If so, btc could have never recovered after the ftx meltdown [1]",

Stockholders like layoffs because it means that more money will go to them instead of being deducted in the form of salaries, incentives, etc. And as long as the platform is working well, this means that the 20% of the employees were not really needed.Quote from: krishnaverma on January 28, 2023, 01:17:22 PMThey also then shut down operations in Japan recently.This may be read as positive news, even though it appears to be negative.Quote from: krishnaverma on January 28, 2023, 01:17:22 PMOn Dec 2022, COIN's market value was $32 and on Jan 27, 2023, it is $61.47.

On the other hand, they are having all sort of issues which should have caused a decline in the stock coin price. You do not need a reason to pump and dump any coin and they can take advantage of the liquidity they obtained from laying off employees in stock purchases, which may push more investors when they see that the price is going up.One month's data will not give us detailed information that we can use, so you have to wait for several months and then your question will be logical.",

They rally harder than Bitcoin when it's bullish, they crumble harder when Bitcoin's down.I'd say it's a long way off from being correctly valued, but then I don't know anything about stocks nor of Coinbase profits, but it still doesn't agree with my logic that Bitcoin's performance should affect stocks of companies that should be valued based off their performance. I suppose revenue just doesn't work the way it should with crypto companies.",

Is it kind of trap by whales to dupe innocent investors and then dump the coin ? If you look carefully, it is still -75% in a year, it was near 200 USD 1 year ago, and much lower than the 340 USD starting price.I believe it is somehow correlated to bitcoin price and correlated to some good news regarding interest rates, which may go down sooner than expected. As bitcoin is performing really well this year, COIN is also expected to do so.",

Because I only just looked at the title but didn't opened and there's the title \"global\" so I assumed that it's related to it but, it doesn't have since it's just all about data collection and new laws that they've got under the laws of United States. Honestly, if looking at the timeframe when COIN was launched, its launching price was $342 and then now, it's $61 gone down to $56.16. But anything that's related to bitcoin just as said by Edward, since it has gone up then that means that everything that's related to it might also increase.",
