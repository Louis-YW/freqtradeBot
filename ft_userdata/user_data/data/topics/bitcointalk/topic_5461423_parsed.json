Users can directly bridge/swap their cryptocurrencies across different networks. This method, increases the transaction and funds security for its users. *️⃣CATENA’s Trusless Bridge saves you money! Using CATENA Bridge to swap your CMCX tokens with CMCX Coin, fees are deducted from the Catena Chain’s CMCX, which are considerably lower than other chains (e.g. BSC). However, in case of using protocols such as WalletConnect, fees will be deducted from both chains! *️⃣CATENA Bridge is designed for cross chain transactions with both EVM and non-EVM compatible networks. In the future upgrades, by enabling more networks and their cryptocurrencies, protocols such as WalletConnect will be activated (not necessary for all networks) to help facilitating the transactions. ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️https://bridge.catena.network/The How-To is very simple. *️⃣First you need to choose the send and receive networks from the drop down menus;*️⃣Enter the amount in the “Transfer From” section;*️⃣Enter the recipient wallet (your wallet) address in the designated field;*️⃣Press “Proceed”In the next page, you will be given a wallet address dedicated for your transaction. You need to send the exact amount as you entered in the previous page to the given address, and wait for the Bridge to do its job. ❗️The whole process after you send the amount can take a couple of minutes.⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⬇️Twitter:https://twitter.com/catena_networkMedium:https://catenanetwork.medium.comTelegram:https://t.me/CatenaOfficialCATENA Explorer:https://catenascan.comCATENA Bridge:https://bridge.catena.network/",
