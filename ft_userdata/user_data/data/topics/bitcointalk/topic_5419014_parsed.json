Payments could be sent to the wrong wallet address and also it would be difficult to manage the transaction history. What should I do? There are various payment gateway systems provided by various third-party sites for accepting payments through cryptocurrencies.  If you want to accept payments in cryptocurrency for your online business, you can set up payment gateways from third-party sites or if you've created a wordpress site, you can easily get some plugins to accept cryptocurrency payments that can be installed easily.  You can set the payment gateway.  By which a customer can easily pay you through cryptocurrency.  And you don't have to give your personal wallet to anyone.  A separate wallet will be generated for each customer. If you can't do it yourself.  Then you can hire a dev to do it easily",

It's not troublesome, that's the traditional way to receive payments and there's no need to make things complicated. Quote from: ashleyknight on November 01, 2022, 05:22:02 AMPayments could be sent to the wrong wallet address and also it would be difficult to manage the transaction history. What should I do? Nope, it's not going to happen. Each wallet address is unique and you can simply print the QR code for that wallet address so that your customers will just have to scan it for you.",

Payments could be sent to the wrong wallet address and also it would be difficult to manage the transaction history.That is possible, but won't be scalable. An address mistake is also part of that method, well, actually some cryptocurrencies business always deal with wrong addresses or networks within the payment system, mostly from the user part.Quote from: ashleyknight on November 01, 2022, 05:22:02 AMWhat should I do? Since you don't tell how you built or develop your online business, I'm gonna say that it is just the same as integrating a basic payment system using Stripe or Paypal, just try to find cryptocurrencies payment gateway services.But if you want a more elaborate answer, try to answer first about, how you build your app or platform? What kind of cryptocurrencies you are willing to accept, and did you want to retrieve it in a cryptocurrency or FIAT? And how do you want to store the payment? on third-party or on your own.",

And also, I got my funds on time which is great.and it's just a recommendation that is not necessarily suitable for you and it all depends on your needs and comfort in using it.",

Payments could be sent to the wrong wallet address and also it would be difficult to manage the transaction history. What should I do? You can take advantage of the experience of other online businesses that accept payments in cryptocurrencies. That is, see how it looks on their website, you can even test it with a purchase to understand how it works. But it would be better if you turn to professionals (for example, on freelance platforms) who have experience in such an implementation and use their help. This will save you resources than if you personally tried to figure out this problem and look for a solution for it.- Of course, you will need to provide your crypto-wallet address in order to receive payment. It will be better if this is a separate business address for working with clients.- There is nothing complicated with paying cryptocurrencies, this is a myth.- Payments can't be sent to the wrong address in any way, if the data is correct, this is also a myth. For your peace of mind, you can additionally use a QR code.",

Payments could be sent to the wrong wallet address and also it would be difficult to manage the transaction history. What should I do? Yes, that's right. Many wallets now do have a QR code. You can also share it to them so that they will just scan it. That should avoid errors instead of copying the receiving address manually but they should make it a habit to double check the address that they see on their screens so that they are sure that the coins are sent to the right address because sometimes mistakes can still happen and we don't know what if our device have been infected by a malware, which automatically changes the address that is being pasted.Every wallet has an option to show your transaction history and it is not difficult to manage them if you are already familiar of how crypto works.",
