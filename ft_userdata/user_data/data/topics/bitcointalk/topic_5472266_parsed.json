There are no insider teams or opaque tokenomics. RAIN is designed to bring pure decentralization and daily rewards to token holders.What Makes RAIN Special?No Team, Pure Decentralization: RAIN operates without a centralized team. All coin operations are automated, ensuring a fair and transparent ecosystem. No one holds the keys to your rewards.Daily Thunderstorm: At midnight GMT every day, the Daily Thunderstorm kicks in. This unique event is autonomously scheduled and ensures continuous action within the RAIN network.Transparent Supply: The entire supply began on liquidity pools, with 50% being bought from the public DeFi pool to fund the Daily Thunderstorm. This transparency ensures that all coins are in play.Locked Liquidity: The SushiSwap LP tokens have been locked ensuring that liquidity will remain in the pool.Earn With Every Token Movement.Every time RAIN coins move - whether it's buying, selling, or transferring - 1% of the transfer value is distributed to all holders, weighted by their wallet balance. The more RAIN you hold, the more you'll receive every time something happens on the network. Plus, there are daily movement of Thunderstorm coins at midnight distributing some supply across all wallets that hold RAIN.Why Polygon (MATIC) Network?The choice of Polygon (MATIC) over Ethereum (ETH) was deliberate. RAIN's distribution to all wallets is blockchain intensive, and we wanted to minimize fees for our community. By selecting the Polygon network, we ensure that RAIN can truly benefit all holders without being swallowed up in gas fees.How to Join the RAIN Community:Any Polygon (MATIC) network wallet can purchase RAIN on SushiSwap. For instance, if you're using Metamask, simply select the Polygon network, send some MATIC, and start trading on SushiSwap.Social Channels:Website: https://raincoin.xyzTwitter: Follow us (*Updated)Telegram: Join our communityDisclaimer: RAIN is a decentralized cryptocurrency. Please do your research and due diligence before investing. Cryptocurrencies are inherently risky, and you should only invest what you can afford to lose.",
