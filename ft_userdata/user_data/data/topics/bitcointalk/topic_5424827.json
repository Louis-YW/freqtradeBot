  "content": "Hey guys!I was just looking through some of my merits when I noticed someone merited my old thread from over a year and a half ago about my first encounter with bitcoin:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5334929.0Looking back at this day all I can do is smile, and think of how great my life is. This life isn't about having unlimited money, this life is about the relationships that you make and the life that you create for yourself through those bonds. Everything you try to accomplish, it all means nothing if you don't have love to give and receive from the people you really hold dear that want to see you succeed and love you through it all. I think the best part of my life right now is the struggle and hustle. Things aren't exactly easy right now, but that is what keeps me going. The drive and yearn to get more out of life, to create better conditions for my family and myself. Shoot even hustling to stack as many SATs as I can while the getting is good, I am just so thankful. Find Joy in the getting! If you've already got it, but are still missing something than I would recommend finding God, because that in the end is who will fill any void that you have. Just IMO and beliefs. There is a part in the bible in James 1:2-4: Trials and Temptations2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters,[a] whenever you face trials of many kinds, 3 because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. 4 Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.I love this verse. As it relates to Bitcoin right now I think that this industry is recovering from a huge earthquake of FTX and FUD. Consider it pure JOY!!!! These events only make bitcoin stronger, and we become more resilient and more legitimized as a result, soon to be not lacking in anything. There is really no rhyme or reason for this post, just really more of a meditation I've been having this afternoon after a delicious sushi boat and a good Japanese beer =D We are blessed! Be thankful, and make sure you thank God, especially for Bitcoin ;PCheers, TREAD",

      "body": "I have been using bitcoin for a long time without my awareness of what it is or how it works. I remember when I first saw the Bitcoin protocol wondering how this technology could survive in a world based primarily on centralization. After that, I kept selling any amount of Bitcoin as soon as I got it, thinking that it could collapse at any moment. This continued for months until I discovered that global services had actually started accepting bitcoin payments, which increased my reassurance, and this was the first incentive for me to create my account here on the forum in March 2015.Bitcoin changed all our lives and contributed greatly to changing our view of the world and ourselves, with the certainty that the possibility of liberation from the power of banks is possible and that this is an inevitable result if Bitcoin succeeds in steadfastness. Today, after years have passed, Bitcoin has proven its worth, especially in the recurring global crises.",

      "body": "To those people who have encountered Bitcoin and this technology in general, way back years, did you buy an amount as an investment?If not, why? 'coz I also did not.At first when this 'thing' was introduced to me, I did not even put my attention to it. For me it was just the same with other digital assets. I've invested only on year 2016. Do I regret it? Hmm nope. Never engage into something if you're not ready. If I have invested at this technology's early years, there's a bigger chance I lose profit than to earn 'coz its market value was not that big. It just became popular when its price started to go up and that was just the time I invested into it. As I've read stories of other users; many regret not buying when its price is low. But think of people who managed to hold it for years or decade; there's only a few so not buying or holding that long, is quite a normal thing 'coz that ain't simple.",

      "body": "Oh man, your mindset is so refreshing most especially in the chaotic cryptocurrency industry. I guess that if more and more people will be adopting your stance in life then we can expect a better world to live. Indeed, I fully agree that life is all about building relationships, connections and maybe even inspiring people to do positive things and contribute in our own small ways to make people happy and not just give up on living. I am considering this time for Bitcoin to be a period of cleansing, of purging platforms and people who should be belonging here in the first place...hopefully we are learning many big things here. Eventually, Bitcoin will survive and fulfill its own destiny for the benefit of the people and not those who are here to make big bucks just like Sam Bankman Fried.",

      "body": "Nice story! It's quite difficult to get rewarded even when some of us noticed about Bitcoin very early:   1. We need to notice Bitcoin. As information about Bitcoin wasn't very widespread in the early days, it's already quite unlikely to hear about Bitcoin in 2009 - 2010. OP has been lucky to hear about it but unfortunately, his purchase didn't happen and that's our second point. 2. Let's say we have noticed Bitcoin. Then, we need to read about it, understand it, learn how and where to buy it and of course we need to buy it, too. Not just considering to buy it like it happened unfortunately to tread93.  3. And finally we need to HODL until now. So many people sold Bitcoin when it made 10x or 20x. Like bought it at 1$ per BTC and solt it at 20$ BTC or even 200$ per BTC. Already a nice profit but nothing compared to today's prices. 4. And of course we need to avoid any hacks (Mt. Gox) or scams. So, everyone wh had noticed about Bitcoin in 2010 would have faced so many obstacles. Don't worry OP, even if you did this purchase, it's quite unlikely your Bitcoin survived until know. But at least, you already know today, what's important about BTC to prevent losses and store it safely.",

Be thankful, and make sure you thank God, especially for Bitcoin ;PCheers, TREADI became fully involved in Bitcoin few years ago and I have not regretted my encounter with this innovation. This year have been a very turbulent one for me and my family because we faced so much challenges but I am also grateful to God for the gift of life. The Bible have always been my guide and motivation. But my connection with Bitcoin and this community have also been my source of strength and hope. Apart from my faith in God, Bitcoin is another force I believe so much in. This is because I have a strong conviction that Bitcoin would always be a key player in the global financial space because it has so many advantage over fiat and the conventional banking systems. Regardless of the loss in the value of Bitcoin, me and my family are committed to keep Hodling this priceless currency until we are ready to use our investment to achieve our collective goals. Thank you OP for this wonderful piece of advice.",

This is true, if you just have to much money and dont work you will loose this money one day or not be happy since you are used to a very high standard that you can not sustain. Still we are still in a more or less early adopter state of bitcoin, where we can hope to see a significant price increase in the next years, so not all hope is gone.",
