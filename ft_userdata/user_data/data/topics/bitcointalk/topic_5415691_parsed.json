Also bear market should not have much impact on gambling activities as the price of bitcoin is not directly related to people gambling and betting. They will continue to gamble and bet anytime. I think this is more related to individual gambling sites as for how long they want to run the campaign, how much it was beneficial to them and also the funds they have allocated for marketing.",

For me, gambling assets are very influential on visitors, this is also not much different from online gambling sites in general, whether or not gambling sites have been campaigning on this forum or advertise on foreign websites, I think the influence of visitors is to bet, not based on the bear market, the bear market only affects the value, but not the nominal bet, no.For this reason, many gambling sites today are implementing the best features to attract visitors.",

It is quite possible that the owners of gambling sites explore the market promotion changing their strategies and this is quite normal because only in comparison can you understand what kind of promotion more profitable.If we talk about the state of the market, now many companies reduce not only payments but also reduce workers. So we wait for a bull market and try to worry less.",

If it has a big impact, it is not impossible that it will continue to run signature campaigns like other long-running signature campaigns such as Freebitcoin and several other campaigns.Lucky if you have joined a signature campaign that has been running for a long time and with consistent payouts.",

This is quite normal especially that signature campaign isn't the only way to promote or advertise their platform. It is also a good thing as these signature campaign are recommended by various gamblers, bounty hunters, investors and other users in which they follow through. These campaigns usually comes back especially when the test campaign has provided good traffic and attracted users to their platform.Bear market surely affect their finances however not in such a way that it will hinder them too much but in case it did, they'll surely prioritize the least functional.",

So I'm not quite sure what the point you're trying to say since the Bitcoin price almost not changed when they launch their own campaign.I think they just think if signature campaign is a bad advertisement and there's no progress for them, while we're know signature campaign is the best advertisement in this forum and you need to launch it for long term.",

I just think that it's likely they have other reasons to not continue the campaign aside from the bear market when you look at it in their position.",

If they find out the signature campaign in the forum works better than the others campaigns they are doing, they might just put more allocation for sig campaign.Casino doing a signature campaign in bitcointalk earns trust from the community which could be what they are evaluating for now.",

The bear market is not the reason to blame for this since there's still a lot of signature campaign that still running in long term regardless the market condition.I'm certain that this scenario is due to limited funds of the casino that allocated on there campaign here since the payment is huge for a startup casino to maintain the campaign running for long term while getting only minimal result due to tough competition.",

As in the Trus Dice campaign, which was managed by Hhampuz, only a few hours after it was opened, many people applied. and for sure those who have the most merit in the last 120 have a chance to be accepted. while those of us who are only able to collect a few merits are sometimes always eliminated and do not get a place.One thing most participant failed to understand is that they can't be the ones to dictate for the campaign manager, that's why they are called managers, you can't guess right the criteria used for the acceptance of a member but onky because that of the required merits is open to everyone to see, come to think of this, having a good number of Merits is actually a first indication that the user is a consistent quality poster with 120 days, secondly check by yourself the spreadsheet or trust dice campaign thread as see a number of participants accepted with lower merits especially on the sr member participants, did you asked yourself was it because of the merit they were accepted? Obviously no, the campaign manager have the insight to detect even those actually been active, regular and quality poster but with low Merits and consider them, also you can have a high number of Merits and ended up not being accepted because not everyone understands how to spread post across relevant boards required and not just posting only on a particular board consistently over time, i advise you leave the campaign managers to exercise their role base on the requirements of the gambling site team representative demands.",
