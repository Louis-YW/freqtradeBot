Currency built to be used on the internet was clearly the goal.",

It's really possible to trace him with the information from the registrar because during that time, even if you want it to be anonymous the registrar will still need your data.Would you say that BTC is planned not just by Satoshi alone, someone must have advised him what to name right?",

BIT-coin ; okay someone could Vividly understand that those digital coins are made-up in BITS and apparently, those bits are called Satoshi. Anyone who's interested , probably in owning 1 Bitcoin should havr stacked-up enough sats which are also known as bits. The name alone is a BRAND to which it function lies and that makes it self explanatory. Maybe netcoin could've been an ordeal in today but, it wasn't chosen so I think it wasn't guaranteed.Cheers ,Sandraüíá",

The kind of impact that Bitcoin has so far delivered for the whole world to witness can partly be attributed to its name. In the world where brands are fighting for attention of the people or the market, having a good name is always important as we have seen many good products falling away because the name is lousy and has no power in itself to gain some good attention. With Bitcoin this is surely a a biting name.",

What other options do you allow?Well said, this actually could be an interesting research made upon but how are we going to know that this actually is from Satoshi decision or not, having the two names almost the same time doesn't give enough reasons that it maybe from Satoshi because things happens coincidentally also atimes, but if this isn't coming out from Satoshi himself or the whitepaper made then i think it's better to discard such, but also, am well pleased with this kind of research and findings that it may be actually the fact we all don't know, even though it lack the enough proofs to the fact.",

I don't think satoshi worked on a different project. He was probably just unsure about how to call the creation and that's why he registered two different domains. It seems unlikely that the person or group that though of something as good as Bitcoin would also work on a different project that was abandoned for whatever reason, and there is absolutely no mentions of it anywhere.",
