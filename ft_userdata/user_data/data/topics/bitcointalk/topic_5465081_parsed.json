  "content": "This thought has made me start wanting to see our local banks as a cooperate and legal street business compared to the aza men dem. The banks are legal entities authorized by the government with issued license to operate and carry out financial transactions but it seems that they utilized the opportunities they got to Â start a broad day robbery on account holders with their illegal debiting Â of funds from accounts of Nigerians or if you may like their customers. They place unnecessary charges and in most cases, they debit twice without any reasons and fail to make refund. If one is not observant enough, they would keep doing that till the account holder notices that and lay a complaint then they would stop because they see that the customer is now aware of that act. Now look at the numbers of persons that such must have been happening to multiplied by the amount and days that debiting must have been happening. You would know that these banks are really sucking Nigerians of their funds and raking in billions everyday or is it the of charges for the sms alert,card maintenance fee, stamp duty, carbon fee coupled with the stress they make one to go through to reclaim their Â funds if at all they would make refunds. Make una no vex o. I use the word aza there for the topic unto say I believe we know wetin I mean by the cappings. I Â no want make the other normal name wey dem dey call dem come dey bring many thoughts for other country men their head if dem come dey scroll to see topics for themselves unless dem open and read to really know and understand wetin I dey talk for those wey sabi our language but we know say na street things I dey yan about here like this. Â These aza men own na sake of say them dey do things anyhow dey dry people of their hard earned resources through illegal means compared to the banks. When dem do am, dem dey leave a kind of funny lifestyle wey be say dey attract eyes to them and dem dey make things dey hard for both their victims and other people for the society wey be say police go dey chook eye for young bobos dem too much and dem go spend money any how wey dem no go price market, dem go make things begin dey expensive coupled with the matter wey already dey for ground for we country. Some of their act na through love scam, hack, forgery,extortion etc. All these na illegal means wey dem dey take collect money and at the end all result to breakdown and hardship of their victims in pain while bank own be say na legal entity wey dey intentionally carry out their acts as e be say dem dey licensed by the government to do financial transactions on their behalf but their act they result to customers being pained. Banks own be say dem dey pay salary, dey run maintenance for their facilities and gadgets, tax and lots more wey dey add value to the society and humanity at large but make we no forget say dem too dey collect from customers anyhow too while the aza men dem na hide hide lifestyle coupled with collection wey dem dey do any how from a specific client wey be their target.My country people,looking at the above, wetin you think about this matter wey be say both mentioned categories dey do to their clients, the matter pure or na sake of say man go survive things?",

What you just said above, are the outcome of what happens when a system is corrupt, and we all know say this our motherland don lose-guard tey tey, wey nobody dey talk about am simply because all these our top politicians get their own share/percentage of wetin these banks dey treat the poor masses daily basis, and as such, making huge sum of money from the small #50 to #100 \"transfer levy\", just like wetin \"Access\" bank dey do me recently, as shown below. Â  Â But yet, person go still survive in the hands of Nigerian banks, which is why if you get huge fund, Bitcoin is the best way to invest your fund, or likewise create a \"Current\" account in your bank to keep funds",
