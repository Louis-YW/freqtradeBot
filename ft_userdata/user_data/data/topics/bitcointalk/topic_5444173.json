This is pretty risky we do not know what exchange can be trusted on the darknet there is escrow mentioned above but how about the external escrow? I don't know if there is an external(escrow) service that can be trusted about this.If I were you if you want to buy BTC why not use a P2P exchange that doesn't need KYC like Bisq?",

Find a seller (they can be found here on the forum) and offer to make the transaction through a third party guarantor.The agreement with an escrow does not have to be done through a third party either. You have to search for it yourself.",

What's DNM? Is it an exchange?You do not need an escrow or vendor if you want to buy Bitcoin. Even if you want to buy anonymously. Through which mean are you planning to buy Bitcoin?

I will advise you to make it public by creating a thread for the BTC trade while you make use of one of the active escrow service providers in the above list. But this is 21 century, and I still don't see any reason you have to go through that to buy BTC.",

And also the risk of buying stolen is that your wallet is being monitored but you can break the chain by using mixers. Anyway, you can maybe find someone in the currency exchange(Already mentioned above) but most of the sellers or buyers there are newbies that can't be trusted so always make sure to use escrow to avoid scam.",

Its the first time I know and see about DMN and ability for selling or buying Bitcoin, all transaction kinds if you don't know with seller or buyer better trough escrowed but your have already paying escrow fees depending with how much your transaction values. I don't familiar with Bitcointalk escrow because usually I made local transaction only and never any transaction with foreigner.But if you looking for trust escrowed maybe check with account level and how trust with reputation, don't try escrow with account with lower level like Jr or Member level because its seems having chance with scammer.",

It must have been collected from some innocent buyer like you.Even if you don't mention the strike price, there are no discounted price bitcoins (personally) anywhere for stolen bitcoins. Identifying the source of origin of bitcoins isn't as easy as the average user might think, so no \"dirty\" bitcoin status can be said honestly unless the seller is primarily out to deceive the buyer.",

Not only is it morally wrong, but it can also result in serious legal consequences. In addition, there is no guarantee that you will actually receive the BTC you are paying for, as you have already experienced in your previous attempt. Seriously, how could you think that paying only $50 for a wallet containing $500 worth of BTC was a legitimate deal? It simply doesn't make sense for anyone to sell BTC at such a steep discount, whether the coins was acquired through illegal means or not.Instead, I recommend that you invest in BTC through legitimate means, such as buying from a reputable crypto exchange or from a reputable seller if you want to go the P2P route. These options may not provide the discounts that you are looking for, but they are safe and legal ways to invest in BTC.",
