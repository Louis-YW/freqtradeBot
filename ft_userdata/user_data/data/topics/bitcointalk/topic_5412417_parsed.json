I have been working online for some time now and yes there is stress as you have to work 12 hours 7 days a week. Then there are times when your employer or your client might ask you to extend your working hours or complete the job before the due time. As most of the time you are watching a screen it is imperative to keep your eyes healthy and visit the doctor whenever you feel uncomfortable. Another important thing is to exercise whenever possible every day.",

I am sure remote jobs are not causing additional stress. Rather the plan for return to office is causing stress. I have 70 + members in my team and this month the management has decided to start the office in hybrid mode. I am currently standing at 13 resignations from my team because they don't want to return to office. So remote jobs are actually so much better than office jobs. It saves time and money from travelling. And also doesn't cause unnecessary pressures. Yes the physical exercise gets reduced to some extent but that can be easily covered up at home.",

All types of work have fatigue and stress, online or offline it's the same, what always makes someone stay calm and enjoy is enjoy and work sincerely, far or near if sincerity can make us comfortable at work.",

The work is decently challenging and engages me to work around 10 hours a day.But I feel very comfortable since I don't have to travel to office and I can wear comfy clothes at home and work according to my timings.At the same time I make sure to take proper care of my body. I hit the gym and workout 1 hour every day 6 days a week.I take short breaks every 2 hours while I am working and sometimes take a power nap of 30 minutes in the afternoon.I drink plenty of water and these are some of the ways I stay healthy and hence no stress.P.S: @pakhitheboss a merit for regular exercise",

What I do most is to control my eating habit as the food you consume if not able to burn it would result in weight gain. Therefore I consume less and demand more from my body. I am sure you would understand what I meant if you follow yoga.",

See the truth is today be it any desk job their Job involves usage of Computers extensively which means even if the job was not remote the person would still be glued in front of a computer for a similar amount of time just in a different city, a different environment basically in an office. So it would have caused equal stress and disability. I do agree that working along with Peers might help you to rejuvenate you a bit as you might chill out with them for some time and relax but that would give equal stress of living in a different city and doing things by yourself staying away from your family. I think nothing can be done about this it's only you who should know how to keep yourself physically and mentally fit. Join a gym or Yoga or any hobby to keep yourselves mentally destressed.",

That's a very valid point. Whether it be office desk job or remotely working from home, the amount of time we are glued to computers is almost equal.So it all depends on one's perspective how he/she is taking it. Before covid I used to do a desk job and it was fun to be honest.I used to play sports with my team in the morning and then start the work and after covid I am working remotely yet I hit the gym in the morning and start my work later.So things haven't changed much it's just a different environment that's all. I kinda like working remotely though since it provide me flexible work hence a good work life balance.",
