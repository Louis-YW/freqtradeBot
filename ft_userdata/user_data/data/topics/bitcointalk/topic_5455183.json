Not sure how many of these exist, but these are the rarest Moonbits with the new hologram. It's also the only plastic chip with the Moonbits hologram. It was a pre-production to the metal chips, serials 2000 - 2200, but I believe less were produced actually.So you are looking at one of the more historic Moonbits pieces here. Price reflects recent auction prices.It's actually grey btw, lighting in the picture may have it appear slightly blue-ish.",
