Hopefully it's not a repeat of luna.",

Gox has had an impact on the crypto market for a long time. If at the beginning of the process they may have had a negative impact on bitcoin and other assets, but this news has not surprised anyone for a long time and I would not be surprised if at the last moment their plans change again. All in all, I will not react to it in any way. There are plenty of other negative news on the market right now than this one. Even more so, even if the exchange starts to return funds to users, it will certainly not all at once and it will require a huge amount of red tape.",

But for sure for those who have been in this market and knows when to sell and when to buy, it wouldn't matter if Mt. Gox will finally released their bitcoins or not. On the other hand, we don't know if they are going to sell or hold it as well.So it's better to just have a wait and see attitude for now as March seems to be bullish as well.",

Gox users will finally be receiving their refunds, the effect of it to other Bitcoin holders is probably priced in already. But I still doubt the refunds will be sent within this month.",

I also think that these payments, if nothing changes again, as it has happened many times before, will last a very long time. The exchange won't be able to pay each user the full amount in one lump sum. This procedure will drag on for a long time and will most likely have no effect at all on the market, which has a huge capitalisation compared to when Mt Gox scammed. This news may even have played out a long time ago.",

Even if it causes bitcoin to be dumped, I still hope it happens. But I doubt that will ever happen, they are just trying to buy time, making it difficult for the victim to give up hope voluntarily.",

I know people who came in lately would see it insane to sell now but you weren't putting money in back then so you don't know what it would be like for them.And before that happens, ton of speculators will dump their their bitcoins in the markets because they know that the price is going to dip hard. So this will be another leg down before bull for sure.Usually this would affect to altcoins as it has in the past but this time i am not that sure. It's a purely BTC thing. Not BTC reacting to other real world financial events.I wonder how much these people who cash out will need to pay in taxes total?",
