  "content": "A report by  Paxful  a cryptocurrency trading platform showed that the volume of money sent by Nigerians via it's network doubled from October 2021 to May 2022. While global deposit volume increased five times since the platform launched its integration on the Lightning Network in September 2021. The firm stated that Nigerians traded at least N77.75bn ($185m) worth of Bitcoin in the first three months of this year, which is a 5.71 per cent increase from the N73.54bn worth of Bitcoin that was traded in the corresponding period of 2021. Last year a report by Chainalysis disclosed that nation is the sixth leading nation in the world in terms of crypto adoption. While recently KuCoin, a crypto exchange reported that about 33.4 million Nigerians traded or owned crypto assets. Nigerian Bitcoiners achieved these entire feats despite the bearish mode of Bitcoin and Central Bank of Nigeria restrictions. In February of 2021, the CBN asked banks in the nation to stop transacting in and with entities dealing in crypto assets. In fact doing that attracts a hug fine that would definitely affect that bank’s operations.  Recently a Nigerian Bitcoin trading Linus Williams Ifejika, aka  Blord  floored the Nigerian government anti-corruption agency called the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in court. He was arrested on August 31, 2020 an accused of internet fraud and his properties were seized. After a twenty four months running battle with the anti-graft agency, the bitcoin trader won his case in court and all his belongings were released. This entails that even the Nigerian court indirectly recognizes Bitcoin as a legal currency. A country that is ravaged by inflation, unemployment and high cost of financial transactions and Bitcoin directly or indirectly assists most young Nigerians to minimize the impact of these challenges (this was before the drop in price of Bitcoin). The government should have known by now that Bitcoin has come to stay in Nigerian and they don’t need a soothsayer to inform them that it is time to give up and change their stance.",

Can you please describe how an asset that is losing value is helping somebody minimize the effects of inflation and unemployment cause it realizes puzzles me!Oh and if you think that by trading on Paxum, it simply means you're making money by selling coins at a premium, so, basically you're taking money from somebody else who will have to deal with the loss until the market grows, which ain't happening right now.",

As Bitcoins cannot be controlled by any government, so no one can stop it or impose tax on it.This is not only happening in Nigeria, but happening in all the countries where Bitcoins are not legalised yet.In order to counter this, I have heard many countries are creating their own digital currency and are planning to impose tax on it.Nevertheless as Bitcoins can only be controlled by it’s holder only, so no one can do nothing to the Bitcoins.And seeing the stats in Paxful regarding the Nigerian people, it feels great.Hoping more people to join this crypto world from all over the Earth.",

However, this has made many to opt for crypto as alternative means of survival.No matter the move of any government, they can not stop the bitcoin movement. As the identity of the founder of bitcoin is unknown, it would be very difficult for any government to fight bitcoin to extinct.",
