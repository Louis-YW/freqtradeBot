I'm hearing it's impossible to disconnect you from the coins, and that depending on how much resources is put into it, the coins can always be traced back to you. Is this true?If you use a good mixer it will break the link between the input money and the output, unless you use a SPV wallet and the server your wallet connects is owned by a chain analysis company, or you use a blockchain explorer linked to chain analysis.It worth mentioning though that there are a fair number of services that consider mixed coins somewhat \"tainted\" and may try to confiscate that money from you for this kind of reasons. Some people do care about this, some don't, some may be knowing/avoiding them, but it's better you know this part too.Of course, there are also P2P means of acquiring bitcoins, which may not be so easy to link to your identity.",

If you use centralized exchanges, you're just kill the purpose of mixing since they will record your IP address and ask you to submit KYC. Don't believe with any centralized exchange that still offer temporary no KYC, your account will be frozen since they've track your funds come from mixer.The best way is use decentralized exchange e.g. Bisq or trade via non custodial P2P.Although there's many ways and sites that can mix Bitcoin, just use Chipmixer, it's currently the best mixer.",

Is this true?The most obvious option is to use mixers which can break the trace of your coins, however this option has many issues as some services could refuse to deal with you due to the history of those coins, another option is to find a service which does not require that you identify yourself and then you can convert to other coins and then convert them back, this way you will have coins which cannot be directly traced back to the coins you bought while identifying yourself.",

Exchanging BTC for XMR is a great way to make yourself untraceable, no doubt. You need to be cautious, though. For instance, don't do both trades at the same day. Preferably, don't use Bisq for both trades as well, because you might have identity leak. Use Bisq to buy XMR, and Robosats to sell.

Sure, ChipMixer is great for most uses, but exchanging BTC <-> XMR and vice versa eliminates the trust required to use ChipMixer.",
