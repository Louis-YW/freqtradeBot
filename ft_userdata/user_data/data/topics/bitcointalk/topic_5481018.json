  "content": "It just was approved....per CNBChttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/09/-sec-approves-bitcoin-etfs-for-trading.htmlQuote\"The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved rule change applications to allow the first bitcoin ETFs in the United States, paving the way for the long-awaited funds to begin trading as soon as this week.The decision will likely lead to the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which holds about $29 billion of the cryptocurrency, into an ETF, as well as the launch of competing funds from mainstream issuers like BlackRock’s iShares.The approval could prove to be a landmark event in the adoption of cryptocurrency by mainstream finance, as the ETF structure gives institutions and financial advisors a familiar and regulated way to buy exposure to bitcoin.\"...Update:Now the SEC says this:\"SEC Twitter 'Compromised,' Chair Gensler Says After Account Said Bitcoin ETFs Approved\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/09/sec-twitter-compromised-chair-gensler-says-after-account-said-bitcoin-etfs-approved/",

They're a freakin joke.https://twitter.com/safety/status/1744924042681897343This is embarrassing. An important institution like the SEC doesn't have a simple mechanism to protect their account and this has led to such a disgraceful event. For me, I think SEC Chair Gary Gensler is lying that the SEC account was compromised. I think a staff who had access to the account made this tweet without authorisation from the Chairman and other top SEC officials. X released a statement that the SEC account was compromised due to any breach of their system. This shows that the SEC is covering up their mess. Another perspective is that it was an approved tweet but some powerful politicians like the President might not be comfortable with approval and they mounted pressure on the SEC to deny the tweet. I guess we now have a higher possibility of disapproval because of the current situation. Some US Legislatures especially Republicans have been angered by this drama and might probe this shameful event.",

So, spot etfs are definitely not a huge factor for bitcoin, but if approved, it will also contribute to faster bitcoin growth. But what I see is that people are putting too much expectation on it, which will not be good for the crypto industry because if etfs continue to be rejected. It will certainly cause short-term panic in the market. I think people should prepare and focus more on the halving instead of focusing too much on etfs like now because the halving is the biggest catalyst for bitcoin to make a new ATH.",

The hack of Gary Gensley x account must be from one of those institutions that wants to trade bitcoin because they have already stashed up their bags believing that today SEC will approve bitcoin ETF. This was why they had to do the hack to give false news to the public, so that within that period, the price of bitcoin will soar. Unfortunately for the hackers, not quite long that the rumor was in the air, was when Gary Gensley cleared the air that his x account was hacked. This means that no one is safe from these hackers if they mean to hack into any of your account, this is why we should be careful with our security when using the internet. I don't care about the approval of bitcoin ETF because it will be an attack on financial freedom.",
