Though is Ironic when the government of under developing countries are still not adopting Bitcoin as a source of revenue  but is just how life is.Not every Bitcoiners now were Bitcoiners a decade ago but not they come to know and believe the truth and this same to some nations who didn't adopt Bitcoin earlier but do now.As Ironic as it seems like we became Bitcoiners late, in a decade from now others will consider us earlier adopters also.",

      "body": "This step has been implemented by the government in my country. At first Bitcoin trading was prohibited in my country and people who transacted it would be subject to sanctions, but after the regulation was issued, Bitcoin trading did not decrease, but instead increased, this became a concern for the government because they saw this as a problem that needs to be addressed because if it is legalized it will provide taxes to the state. And after that the government started to change their regulations and started to soften the regulation for Bitcoin and Altcoin trading, and started to legalize it (but only on regulated exchanges), and finally crypto trading in my country managed to bring in tens of millions of dollars in taxes in a year alone.This is one example of how the legalization of Bitcoin trading can provide benefits for the country and this can be imitated by other countries.",

The issue with governments that oppose Bitcoin is as a result of ignorance and a lack of interest in understanding what it truly defines.Take El Salvador for example, we've witnessed the country's enthusiasm towards Bitcoin and how they've implemented strategies to promote its adoption, such as using geothermal energy for mining, introducing educational programs in schools, declaring it a legal tender, etc. El Salvador is not just aiming to make profit from Bitcoin taxation alone, but also from the things they've put on ground such as mining programs and others.So, what I am trying to say is that if an anti-Bitcoin government decides to legalize Bitcoin solely for tax purposes, they should integrate it fully into the country's system, just as what El Salvador has done. At least, more tax revenue can go to their selfish pocket.",

      "body": "Legalizing gambling is very different than legalizing crypto. Gambling is easier to manage for a government from taxation perspective. Whereas crypto is very difficult for taxation due to its anonymous nature. Gambling houses across the world are heavily regulated and taxed. Crypto is still finding its way. Probably in a next couple of years we will see more countries coming forward and accepting cryptos. But for now, government cannot control its progress and transactions. That's the main roadblock here!",

So for this initiative you've suggested OP to work, the Governments who have tagged Bitcoin illegal before now, needs to come out open with clean mindset and embrace Bitcoin without any reservations of any sort, then they will begin to witness the Goodies that is associated with cryptocurrency.",

I think these are very diverse fields to be brought in contrast with each other. The only connections your getting to make here is, having to have seen them as illegal but this isn't the vitals. The distinction between these field is that,Gambling platforms are centrakized while,Bitcoin is decentralized.Now, it's easy for government to legalize Bitcoin because it exists within fhe realms of centralization which is what the government is about. They could be regulated with a high level of efficiency and parties to this are very well known.When it comes to Bitcoin, government don't yet know how they could suck its sap and that makes acceptance really difficult. Although, they can start by regulating them centralized exchanges but, its just a part to the system and Bitcoin is fully functional without it.Even so, we just have to keep hopes up but, the government haven't stopped individual adoption in a decade which makes them a not so relevant factor.",

Many countries have not been able to have the same level of expertise in regulation, so they have decided to place a ban on it. We have been seeing an increase in the acceptance of Bitcoin in most countries through the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETF and hopefully, this move will move to other countries in the near future.",
