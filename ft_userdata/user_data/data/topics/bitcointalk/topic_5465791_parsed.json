You need to delete all others.I have to ask you though. If your service is so good and you think it's worth 4,5k for 24 hours, I guess your clients can easily return that money. However, it is not clear to me why you sell such knowledge, why you don't work for yourself and earn even more. Why all this waste of time?",

However, it is not clear to me why you sell such knowledge, why you don't work for yourself and earn even more. Why all this waste of time?Markets choose the price, not me  The average sales price for Dextools trending is 5-6k right now. There are even people who payclose to $10k when there are many middlemen (re-sellers) in a deal.I don't sell the knowledge though, just a service.The client will be trending on Dextools for 24 hours and that's it, he won't know how I did it.If he wants to do it again, he will need to pay once more.If your question is why don't I make a token, and use it on my token to make money, the answer would be clear:Making a successful token is much more than just trending on Dextools. A lot of other things should collide too.Not to mention that requirements for trending are there as well. I can not make every token trend, only those with $150k + liqI got many re-sellers from these posts, who bring me daily leads  So I don't think it was a waste of time at all!Thanks for your comment though My contact:https://t.me/dekidev",
