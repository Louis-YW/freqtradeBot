My point was about the country. In some countries the minimum wage is low. In mine the minimum legal wage will rise next year to some 600 EUR.A 20 years old person is a newbie in his field and will not have a great starting salary.Taking all this into account, neither the $3k/month logic, nor the \"living frugally\" to save some bitcoins don't help.What can help is a second job.

Here if someone who is single has an income of $ 3000 per month, then he can save up to $ 2000 a month because $ 1000 is very enough for his life here and that includes the cost of renting a house in a year and also the cost of eating in a month.

The truth is that your expenses increase as your income increases, so waiting to save when you have enough may never happen. The habit of saving is something that has to be consciously developed even from when you don't earn much. If you draw up a budget, remove savings and base your expenditure on the remaining amount. To develop a strong mentality towards it, train yourself to believe that the amount left after you have removed savings is what you actually earn to spend. It is not easy, but it is not impossible too.",

Based on my experience, lifestyle is one of the factors where our money is wasted (when I still didn't realize the importance of saving or investing). To be honest, when I still didn't realize the importance of saving, I could barely set aside money from my income every month, even that wasn't enough because I was more concerned with my lifestyle and prestige. It was a time when I regretted why I didn't realize earlier what I'm doing now, namely investing and saving.Now that I know the importance of investing and saving, I can suppress my lifestyle and prestige more and attach importance to what I can take in the future.",

This freedom includes buying a comfortable home with an income exactly equal to your expenditures, something that differs between countries but is almost the same for the world, for example: - In those countries where young people earn less than a thousand dollars a month, an amount like two hundred thousand dollars is enough to buy a house and an amount like a quarter of a million dollars is enough to achieve financial freedom. - The same is true in countries where the average is three thousand dollars.

Many people don't have this habit and neither did they develop it when they started receiving income which Is why it's hard for them to save.Saving can be done in many ways and you can use Bitcoin for your savings as well, you can decide to put that money you're meant to set aside into Bitcoin at the end of each month frequently and be disciplined not to touch it until the specific time you set for yourself to make use of your savings for something useful.",
