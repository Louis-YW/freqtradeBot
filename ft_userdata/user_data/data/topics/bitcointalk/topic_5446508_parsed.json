  "content": "https://cryptohomepages.comProblem:Crypto has come a long way in the last few years and keeping up with all the available tools can be difficult even for the most organized individuals. In the past, I've been able to use my browser bookmarks bar for easy navigation between different crypto platforms, but with each new blockchain, my bookmark bar has become more and more congested.Because I've been mostly been living off profits from crypto since 2017, it has kind of put me in a comfort zone where learning new skills and being productive has not been necessary to thrive financially, I've lost great deal of time not learning any new real skills. Fortunately 2023 Brought along artificial intelligence and ChatGPT that enabled asking questions and getting expert answers about any technical venture for a complete dummie like myself. Therefore I decided to learn website creation and create useful link directory available for everyone. During the process of creating this website, I have explored, learned about and evaluated thousands of websites and selected only the best in each category. I have currently written 25 product reviews in 5 articles and learned about the mechanics of SEO and will continue to do so as this website will never be fully completed as long as crypto ecosystem keeps evolving.Solution:https://cryptohomepages.comCurrent Features:Ultimate link directory to save space in your browser bookmark barEasily find trusted utility platforms for most popular blockchainsConveniently filter out the utility you are looking for using the tag filtersClick on the INFO button of each link to see further information and its corresponding links to social media and servicesDiscover awesome research platforms to improve your DYOR gameExplore best available artificial intelligence platformsAt the time of writing, there are 25 product reviews to readIf your platform is already listed or you have awesome platform that is not yet listed, I'd gladly list it and write dedicated product review article in exchange for shoutout on your platform social mediaFuture Plans:1. Completing and continuing to keep up-to-date the artificial intelligence link page2. Creating page for useful free browser tools and extensions that will improve creative work and save money and time for content creators and internet users.3. Adding couple of new categories for top tier unbiased content creators and miscellaneous platforms that currently doesn't fit in anywhere.4. Creating dedicated page for each top blockchain such as:EthereumBinance Smart ChainPolygonSolanaCardanoAlgorandAvalancheFantomArbitrumOptimismPolkadotKusamaAnd other new upper-coming blockchains that will be gaining adoption and activity.Marketing and monetization:1. I'm planning to start contacting all the listed platforms to offer them dedicated product reviews in exchange for shoutout on twitter.2. There are currently about 10 affiliate links in the whole mix.3. Maybe will offer advertisement options in the future.If you found this website useful, then please consider following its progress on twitter: https://twitter.com/C_Homepages_com",

I would love to add a crypto community category to list bitcointalk.org as its legendary part of the whole crypto legacy, however almost all of the forums I know are mostly specific blockchain or product based. Where should I seek to find more all around forums such as bitcointalk?5. I'm also trying to figure out which category should the opera crypto browser go. Its a very nice browser with a lot of utility, but doesn't seem to fit anywhere.Cheers!",

They have couple of different product with price range from very affordable to high end. They borrowed trezor's software and are open source. I only wish that their affiliate link wasn't so scrappy, but i guess its because they are too busy with catching up with more established wallets features.Passport - even though there are already plently of much cheaper wallets that can store bitcoin, as well as thousands of other tokens, passport is class of its own. You've got to put respek on bitcoin and passport hardware wallet brings the security and user experience for bitcoin to another level. Its definitely a high end tool, not a toy.CoolWallet - I had couple of them collecting dust until my girlfriend found them one day and asked if she can try to use one. She figured it out herself in few hours time and now she has it in her wallet. Seems to be convenient.Also noticed that my website had too few options for bitcoin compatible wallets so electrum and sparrow wallet were perfect addons. They are listed now. I also listed bitcointalk forum under defi research tools for now on the 7th page. I will find a better place for it in the future.",

Thanks a lot for your reply. I'm glad that you like the idea and the design. The design still needs some adjustments for example, i've been using 3840x2160px 65\" screen during the development, but yesterday when i switched to my 14\" laptop, i noticed that links that have longer than avarage names, have been squeezed on top of each other in a bad way. Hopefully im going to be able to find a custom css fix for it today.(Edit: Fixed the smaller screen text overlap issue quite effortlessly. thanks to chatGPT once again!)As for arranging site \"ranks\", this has been quite difficult thing to figure out. There are many amazing websites in each category and its sad that some of them don't fit on the first page. One of my goal is to bring awareness of some lesser known websites that have great deal of utility to offer. In that particular case, Coingecko made it on the first page only because of its legacy status. While coingecko is very lightweight, without ads and very clean, many of its competitors have been getting ahead. CryptoRank is on its own level. It offers so much unique information that cant be found on any other same category competitors. Messari is another upper comer, however a lot of its utility if for monthly paid subscribers and for that reason, maybe it does not deserve third spot. Still, i believe it is more complete crypto knowledge center than coingecko in today's standards.As for tags, its been such a challenge to figure this one out. I mean, its matter of how far detailed am i going to go. If i put bitcoin tag for every single site that has something about bitcoin there, then its going to be like 90% of them and it renders the whole filter kind of useless. Another thing about using tags is that, for some reason, sometimes it does make all the correct websites pop. Then another times, some websites without the tag still pops. But mostly 98% of times it gets it right. I dont have a clue why they behave like this, but anyway, this is my first ever website. In the future, im going to probably re-do everything and make everything more beautiful and better while trying to correct the current mistakes.For now, i have still a lot of work to do and improve the content.",

I think it's better to add add Bitcointalk forum under Crypto News Outlet, or create new category dedicated only for forums and reddit pages for Bitcoin.*Hey mate! Thank you once more for bringing my attention on this! I took your advice and made some research about these 3 wallets. I came to the conclusion that BitBox and Blockstream Jade are both great picks and listed them up! However while looking into ColdCard, I came across several very negative reviews. Because the list has already hardware wallet for every single blockchain, coin, use case and price ranges from budget to high end, then I would rather not make it too complicated, currently excluding ColdCard. The bear market has been rough and I currently don't have too much excess funds to play around with, so it wouldn't be reasonable to just buy one to test it out myself.*If any hardware wallet has built in multisig feature in app, then I would most definitely add them there. But because EVM, Solana, Cardano etc multisig wallets are smart contracts and compatible with 90% same blockchain wallets, then once again, it would make the list too long and complicated.*Created brand new category for bitcointalk.org  Will find some other relevant communities to include there soon.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on April 01, 2023, 12:14:57 PMNice website.

I didn't record my screen, but here's a full page screenshot (click image for higher resolution).Hey! Thanks for the big bag of merit, wondering what does it do though hehe.*Just finished the final touch with dark mode!!!!!!!!!! hahahah. Was driving me crazy. I tried several plugins and even paid for one hoping to have more customization, but nothing worked. Interfered with the list plugin and couldn't customize some key components. I ended up learning some javascript and created my own dark mode from scratch with the help of google and chatGPT. Hopefully the dark mode plugin that didn't work is going to refund the 80$.*Thanks a lot for these 3 website recommendations! Those 3 Mempool, asicminervalue and bitcoincore were perfect addons for the directory!*Added Electrum in the multisig wallet list!*I wish I wasnt lazy and saved the information that was provided by the multisigtools website earlier, now its gone. damn! It was very detailed website to learn everything about bitcoin multisig wallets. Thank you for the notification - having broken links is something I'd like to avoid at all cost! *Also thanks for confirming the bug. I contacted the plugin support, but they claimed once again that they didn't get it. However I managed to figure out a fix while working on the dark mode. Simply added max-height custom css to the column!

Best of luck for your project.Thank you very much for liking it and I'm glad it runs smooth. When I first bought the domain, I took bad advice from youtube and bought the domain and hosting from Bluehost. First 3 days worked fine, then got slower and slower. On the 2nd week, it took minimum 20 sec to load a page, a lot of times over a minute. Doing modifications that should take 30 seconds, sometimes took me 5-10 minutes. So I asked for refund from Bluehost and moved hosting to Cloudways and set the server to Germany. Loading a page went from 45 sec to 0.75 sec for me in Europe. Would like to know how it performs for someone from North and South Americas and in Asia.What parts of the interface should I work on though?cheers",
