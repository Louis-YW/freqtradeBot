The only thing there was him stating the obvious, it's never a good idea to invest for anyone no matter how close they are to you, it's always better to educate them on the issue and if they like the idea they can proceed not you getting involved in their investment what if the whole investment scheme doesn't go as planned what do you think will happen to you?I think you need to reread that post and get a better understanding of his reply.There's a post by LoyceV I read sometime ago that changed my mindset concerning some posts here in Bitcointalk.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5312089.msg61249430#msg61249430If someone anonymous on the internet has the power to make you angry, you're doing something wrong and some time away is probably a good idea.",

I, as an internet user, have a right to do that.Of course, if I am abusing my freedom then I deserve to be called out.

Everyone has a right to talk however they would like to. If it's actually out of line, even according to a vast amount of other members, then I am sure the perpetrator will get called out or receive similar treatment (as the circle goes). Otherwise, don't worry about it...and definitely don't make threads about it",

I will say that is a bad idea. my advice to you is to teach your father about bitcoin so it can decide on his own whether is half or quarter of retirement funds he can afford to invest in Bitcoin. which I personally do not consider to be offensive at all. In fact he is not making fun of you or saying mean words, he is just criticizing your action (and not you as a person).Even if it still bothers you, you can just press the Ignore button to hide the post.",

Are you saying that if someone thinks your viewpoint is nonsense, you take it offensive and as an insult? How else do you expect them to express their disagreement? Or are you suggesting that people should be silenced just because their opinion doesn't align with yours?Besides, I took a closer look at the thread, and I couldn't find a single instance where SOKO-DEKE used offensive language. Are you sure you didn't mix something up?(And hey, don't get me wrong here, I'm not trying to offend you or anything. )",

I also observed that the newbie got a lot of merits from the post which means that the post makes a whole lot of sense. People will always view things from a different perspective and they also have the freedom and right to express themselves. This forum promotes freedom of speech which has helped members to express their views without intimidation. In a group like this, there will always be disagreement which will most times lead to agreement and greater understanding. I have learned never to be offended by the words or thoughts of other members because everybody must not accept my views or post. This forum is far better than other forums in terms of the use of words because I hardly come across insulting words.",

People who complain about this really don't understand how important it is, and how completely subjective \"offensive words\" are!Watch Rowan Atkinson on free speech.
