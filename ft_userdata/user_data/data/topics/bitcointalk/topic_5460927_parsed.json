Bitcoin is not a new project or some kind of altcoin that requires promotion in order to create awareness, and that awareness is what brings in more people to invest in the project. Bitcoin is already self-promoting itself; all it needs now is steady growth in mass adoption. Let its usage increase, which will increase its demand, and the price will definitely reflect positively on that.",

In this point Bitcoin market can crash or have a correction. When no more new buyers appear to support the uptrend then usually market go for a correction. So it's a part of Bitcoin trend and a opportunity to grab more in a lower price.Probably it can hit 25000K level if market need to have a correction. So we have to trade with caution or be prepared for both positive or negative scinerio.Quote from: Sandra99 on July 24, 2023, 06:25:48 PMRe: What do you think Bitcoin Market Need Promotes for Price up ?The major promotion will be then when most of the governments will start legalizing it and that time a huge mass adoption will occur and obviously a steady growth too.",

He seems to be representing himself and because of that, I guess he is part of the community. There are some suggestions he made recently about Backing USD with BTC. It may terrify some of the lawmakers but I think Blackrock will still like that.And also Blackrock is also good to promote since they promote Blackrock.

That is the approach that is constructive. The focus should not be on the price of bitcoin at this time. As the price of bitcoin moves up and down, what you should be focusing on is how much bitcoin you have accumulated or what gains you have achieved through DCA as this time the bitcoin market is at its correction stage",

You don't need to worry if the Bitcoin price falls deeper because that will be the right time to accumulate more Bitcoins. All you must consider is the price you are ready to buy Bitcoin.With the current ups and downs of Bitcoin prices, you should be able to understand when to buy Bitcoin, especially if you have prepared some funds to buy Bitcoin. And right now could trigger the Bitcoin price to drop again deep and there is a possibility that the price will be back at $28k, especially if people panic again to see the price drop now.But we have seen Bitcoin price hit rock bottom, so maybe the current correction is the one that always comes in the market.
