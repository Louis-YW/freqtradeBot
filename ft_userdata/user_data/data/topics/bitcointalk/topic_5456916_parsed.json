  "content": "A situation occurred today in my locality,  I have some guys working for me today and suddenly I hard them battling with an issues and when I get close to them to know what exactly the problem is,  and I asked the guy who look strange to me since I am meeting him for the first time and not a worker on the site what his business and why he is distracting the workers from work. Then the guy narrated his case to be and he said,  that one of the workers came to his betting shop the yesterday to play some visual,  that at first the guy came with ₦‎1,000 in my local currency to make the bets and along the line, he existed the balance but as a regular customer,  the agent decided to allow him at further on credits and in all he accumulated a total debt of ₦‎8,000 because he lost all the bets and since that yesterday he has been on the run from the gambling agent until he traced him to the site today. So when I wanted to judge the case and possible settlement,  I query the casino agent how can you allow a customer to gamble on credit to the tune of 8k Knowing fully well that the gambler only has a 1k balance which already existed? Also what is the probability that the gambler will ever return after owning such debt in the betting shops,  note the gambler's daily pay is 2k as a helper on the site,  so he has to work for 4 days to be able to meet that debt that is if he doesn't make any other expenses. Question is: What is the possibility of the betting agent getting his money soon/considering the gambler's low-income earnings?",

He do not know the work of a betting agent. Betting agent do not borrow people money to bet. He will know this if he has been in the business for long. Football or other sport virtual matches takes less than 15 to 30 seconds from start to to the end and it can make someone to bet further before he realizes that his money has been exhausted.",

The gambler is addicted, if not he could've left once after the loss. What he had done is kind of borrowing to gamble. Here the mistake is with the gambling shop owner, because he had tempted the person to gamble and made him loss.To the OP, If you get an opportunity to ask a question to the gambling shop owner please ask the below question.You've given credit to gamble, if he had won big will you not ask for the winning amount?? If so, he should take part in the loss too.",

The gambler who knew full well that they didn't have any balance on their account still took the offer despite knowing his situation. He gambled, he lost, he needs to pay, and he has no right whatsoever to protest if the betting agent is requesting him to pay. As for the payment, I don't know if the worker is good for his word or not, but the betting agent has the right to force your worker to pay, although of course that should be done after hours on your worker's duty.",

Well a proper discussion regarding on settlement made should be discuss towards the betting agent since there's nothing they can do with this since your worker cannot pay in full since he is earning low only. This is a lesson that need to learn by your worker that never bet exceed on his earning capacity since he experience more worst than this. Also never do any decision that you cannot take especially if its risky on his side this is a hard lesson need to face by your worker.",

If the borrower intends to pay then he will get his money but not soon because of the earning of the borrower, probably and installment payment may do but if the borrower is on the run then he will be having a hard time getting his money.  If there is a contract about the person borrowing money, he can file a case against that person but still that does not guarantee to make the borrower pay.",

That gambler will likely return since he's a helper in the betting shop, and I doubt he can easily throw away his job only for the gambling money he borrowed, which is worth around 8k. The person to blame here would be the betting agent because most casinos will never lend any money to their customers. I guess the betting agent got careless and overestimated his customer/helper because he might've thought there was less risk involved, but he still decided to go on the run.",

Main question aside, I must say the agent is quite dumb to allow the person to make a loan to gamble. I'm assuming it wasn't under a contract, hence why the guy easily ran away and hid. If he was trying to take advantage of him, a contract should've been 100% necessary.To the question though, I reckon it should be a max of a month, and a minimum of maybe 2 weeks? That should be enough time imo for the debtee to pay his debts, granted he doesn't do the same sht of gambling it all again though.",

I think this is similar to a recent thread about borrowing money to gamble, if it was a nice idea but in this case the deed has already been done.To me I think the agent has some personal relationship with that worker of yours, maybe he knew him for somewhere in the past for him to be able to let him place bets on credits because you won't expect a random stranger to jsut go that agent's shop and he'll allow them bet for free if he tries it for others then his shop will fold up in less than a month.The only solution now is to try to settle a date for the payment and since you mentioned that the income of the debtor is low then the agent should agree on installement payment because it's almost impossible for him to pay everything at once. And if that does not work then he should consider informing the police because that will scare him to pay up quickly.",

Why would the betting agent be blamed when he wasn't the one who spent the money on gambling and he was even the one who was kind enough to let the gambler continue playing on credit. He didn't force the gambler to bet. He didn't hold him at gunpoint just so he continues betting. The gambler will have to pay what he borrowed. Not at once of course because he cannot do that. He will pay his debt daily until it will be fully settled.",

But instead of winning, he kept losing and in the end he ran away. Okay, this is a trick that is commonly used by gambling agents to get players to keep playing by providing them with a debt feature, but this is a big mistake for players because they are playing gambling with money that is not theirs. It's their fault because they didn't play with the responsibility of gambling and ran away from their obligations. Like it or not, players have to pay their debts because they play it with their own conscience and they certainly already know the consequences if they don't pay their obligations.",

Where gambling is unregulated and ruled by mafias, they take it one way or another. Either you pay however you can, either by giving everything you get paid or by selling things, or you are at risk of physical harm. In this case, if gambling is completely legal and the agent has no power of coercion, it is either going to cost him a lot to recover the money and little by little or he is not going to recover it at all, although it seems to me that the latter is more likely.",

If we consider the gambler's ability to repay, there is a slim chance that he will be able to recover the money he borrowed. However, there may be some form of agreement between the gambler and the lender that ensures timely repayment, even if the gambler has a low income. It's worth noting that gambling laws often have their own provisions that differ from those in the real world.",
