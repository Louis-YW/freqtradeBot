      "body": "No.In general, it hasn't been worth mining bitcoin with anything other than ASICs for quite some time. For your specific card, here are the benchmarks I can find:https://www.onlinehashcrack.com/tools-benchmark-hashcat-nvidia-rtx-2070s-super.phphttps://gist.github.com/kennwhite/caf3a861325122f5ff8ba58e7210c63dBoth put you at between 4-5 MH/s. Call it 5 MH/s. The network has 200 EH/s of hashrate. That gives you 0.0000000000025% of the global hashrate. Convert that to a percentage of mining rewards, and you are at less than a single satoshi per year, without even considering things like pool fees and electricity cost.There might be altcoins you could mine and then trade for bitcoin, but your profit margins will still be tiny and you need to consider other fees and costs as I outlined above, as well as trading fees, and wear and tear of your hardware.",

My laptop temperature become so hot during the process and I'm scared that I might wreck my laptop so I decided to stop and just use it for gaming purposes.Much better to use ASIC miner or used a separate mining rig that build for this kind of work. Don't waste your laptop health.",

You might need to buy a special USB hub to provide enough power for all those sticks though.Note: You will only make a couple of cents a day mining btc with these sticks depending on your electricity price, because they have a low hashrate.",

Or if you heat your room with an electrical heater, as you can use any miner as electrical heater regardless of efficiency.",

So, those miners that kept on mining have spare money or allocated budget for their electricity bills and operational costs. And they are not going to sell but to hold whatever they earn at this rate.But to remind you, these miners built dedicated rigs to mine and not with laptops. Because even you've got a gaming laptop, it's for gaming and not really for mining. You'll just lessen the life span of your device if you do that.",

But even if a mining rig is setup and more appropriate to mine crypto, with the bitcoin mining difficulty, a GPU is not going to make any profit from bitcoin mining. If a miner want to setup a mining rig, it would be best to make use of ASIC which generate higher hashrates and specifically designed for crypto mining if compare to GPU. Specifically, I will recommend Antminer S19j Pro for bitcoin mining.",

It is very possible if you know cryptocurrency industry is big enough and there are so many job types: content writing, social media manager, community manager, campaign/ program/ bounty manager, trading strategy creator with bot, etc.Like a job with payrate as $100 per week, then you can earn $400 per month, after 10 months, you can have $4,000 that is a lot of money. It is surely a thing should do than killing your laptop with Bitcoin mining (like the image)https://beincrypto.com/careers/https://hyve.works/",

As far as I know, today, gaming laptops are very expensive. But even if we assume that mining is still a success, it will not pay for itself. It is much easier and more profitable to join a signature company in which one post is worth a day of mining work, even on a good but not an eternal laptop.",

      "body": "You are thinking of bitcoin mining on gaming laptop in 2022 which is not at all possible but if you have been into this at earlier days when it was launched then you might be able to do it but now when the ASIC machines are deployed for mining bitcoin with so much computation powers you Rtx don't stand a chance against them.There are big mining farms with heavy equipment into mining using ASIC machines like this and we are talking about laptop mining which could not help us at all :  The consequences of laptop mining you have seen above also as mining would require your laptop to run for 24x7 without any disruption which will heat it up eventually even it's RTX 2080 single card also which will then cause internal damage to your laptop and most probably within few days only.One of my friend tried it with Alien predator back two years and then it has to be repaired as it was under insurance.You think of dedicating your laptop to mining so suppose it's $1000 and additional cost of RTX 2070 8gb but what will you gain on daily basis? Few satoshis worth $1-$2 per day so is it profitable according to you? The Bitmain have been continuously making more improvement to ASIC machines for mining increasing the TH/s for fast hashes calculation and the last post i made about them have this machine Quote The mining machine will have a hashrate of 198 TH/s, power efficiency (@ 35°C) of 27.5 joules per terahash (J/TH) and will consume 5445 watts of power, according to a tweet.In comparison, the previous top-of-the-line Antminer, S19 XP, has a hashrate of 140 TH/s, power efficiency (@ 25°C) of 21.5 J/TH and consumes about 3010 watts.The new model will also incorporate the “latest liquid cooling technology” and is designed for use with Bitmain's Antspace HK3 mining container.The adoption of liquid cooling has been increasing in recent years as an alternative to traditional air-cooling, which allows mining machines to be immersed in a synthetic hydrocarbon compound liquid that has no electrical conductivity and is fully biodegradable.This specialized liquid can reduce heat, power consumption and noise stemming from the computers, as well as prolong the lifespan of the machines, allowing miners to maximize profit in an increasingly competitive market.So it's not advisable to you to go through this way and best is to find some altcoins for the same purpose but then also the question is how much profitable it would be as you are spending some amount on it including electricity, maintanence cost of your hardware.",
