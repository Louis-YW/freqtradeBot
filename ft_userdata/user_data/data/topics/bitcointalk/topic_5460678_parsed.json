I hope you understand this, but if you are really interested then you can visit the Bounty board.but my advice is not to focus too much on Bounty or Airdrop campaigns. it will waste your time and most of it really doesn't pay you well.",

I thank you for your honesty, but the free methods usually require repetitive, boring, very low-return work with long periods of sitting. Instead, use your time to learn freelancers skills or develop your skills to create high-quality posts and earn an average of $200 per month from signature campaigns after about 6 months.Start with YouTube channels and read some books, try to learn new information daily and ask about it here.you can earn from some paid Bitcointalk Games topics or for review services.",
