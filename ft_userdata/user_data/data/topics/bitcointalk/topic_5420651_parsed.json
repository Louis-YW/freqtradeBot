You'll need to invest in knowledge first but that won't require you a monetary initial investment. That would only require you time and ofcourse devotion with what you will try to learn. There are many learning materials and best ones are videos demonstrating and sharing ideas. You may follow Marvin Favis, MoneyZg and the likes (not sponsored;just to name some) to know more of the fundamentals. In trading, it won't require you huge amount of money, and there will also be risks involved (which is normal). There are no easily earned money especially in this industry, you need to work hard for it. You may also join communities which will also help you grow and discover other ways to earn profit not only in trading.",

Thank you for your cooperation, and I wish everyone a lot of success!Yes, it's possible and there are too many ways that you can do to earn that amount on a daily basis. Aside from trading, you can earn it exactly as it is with freelance work. While you're studying to trade, learn also the freelancing marketplaces because that's where you're going to get most of the tasks and you'll have to get someone to pay for you in exchange for service or tasks that you'll do for them.

Have you tried doing some freelancing works before trying your luck in Bitcoins or crypto? Moreover there will be always some risks if you invest in Bitcoin and aiming to take 5-10$ profit daily. Instead of this why not earn 5-10$ by using your skills? It’s not hard to learn photoshop or video editing(Free resources available on YT). Also if you are good in English, then try to write articles for people.",

For now he better start on the basics. Staking is one of the ways to earn passive income and there are staking platforms which offers fix returns as long as the coin that you stake are stable coins. Not all of them are scams and before we start, we need to read the feedback first of other users.Another thing which can make him earn stable income is through working. This one has no risk because no capital is needed here just time and effort. We have lots of freelancing sites such as Fiverr, Upwork and there's also Bitcointalk.",

They stake with low value coins and of course the reward also is low value and this may not sustain op if this is the only thing he finds to do but if he add up with other things like freelancing, on line graphics and more those will be nice.",

Staking or farming offers that. However, there are risks too associated with either staking or farming. Otherwise, there isn't any trading strategy that can guarantee you that range on daily basis.

I initially played and hoped to get a profit and return on investment, but when the crypto crashes the p2e game can no longer be expected. Apart from that this type of game is no longer popular, there is one that is more popular, namely the game Move To earn. but my advice to play crypto games like this still takes a long time to produce if you look at the current market conditions. The best thing is that if you have a little money you can do scalping or if you don't have any capital, do aidrop tasks which can be found on this forum or on twitter, and bounty campaigns on this forum are widely available and can be chosen. but for $ 5-$ 10 per day of course will not be sure. as long as you don't have initial capital, you won't get consistent income, unless you have joined the signature campaign.",

You may be able to make a profit from your trading strategy every day, but of course no strategy can really make a profit consistently every day because of price volatility.
