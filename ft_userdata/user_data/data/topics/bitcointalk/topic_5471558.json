  "content": "I always thought the Coldcard was a great hardware wallet, but never knew the head-spinning amount of security features it has on it, because I never looked at it before in much detail. It blows away every other hardware wallet in terms of sheer amount of features, almost too many to list. Many of them appear to be unique to the Coldcard, and doesn't cost much for what you are getting. The Trezor Model T doesn't have a fraction of the features but cost $60 more. And unlike Trezor the Coldcard is bitcoin-only so no shitcoins supported. It also seems to be built like a tank.I will be getting one next time they have their 20% off Black Friday sale.  https://coldcard.com/Some of the features:* Supports Bitcoin only.* Dual Secure Element chips* Takes open source to the next level: The open source code can be viewed, verified and compiled directly from the device itself.    * True Air-gap - Only signing device (hardware wallet) with option to avoid ever being connected to a computer, for its full life cycle: from seed generation,    to transaction signing. Uses PSBT (BIP174) natively.* MicroSD Back-up - allows truly offline signing by transferring unsigned/signed transactions  sneakernet* NFC tap for all data types, PSBT, address, etc.* USB virtual disk mode* Extensive duress PIN features* AirGap SneakerNET - maximum security when transferring data between devices* BIP39 passphrase supports multiple hidden wallets* Anti-phishing words* Genuine vs. Caution lights* Clear see thru case design so you can see if wallet has been physically tampered* Dice roll and provable bitcoin seed generation",

Personally, I will be more than glad to purchase a wallet that offers as much security as ColdCard and also offers altcoins. But still, I like that they only focus on Bitcoin, their message is clear.By the way, main difference between Trezor and Coldcard is that Coldcard is a superior wallet when it comes to security and features, overall, it is an ideal wallet, both, CC and Passport are great choices!",

Open source has a very specific meaning and is very important to the ecosystem. Coldcard is not open source.When coldcard was created, they came up with an unmatched security, right? It's true that they copied others and use their work but Coldcard still came up with more unique product that no one has created before. At the same time, we have to keep in mind that bitcoin hardware wallet is a business. When ColdCard left their code open-source, The Passport Foundation copied them, improved some UI details if I am not wrong and become a Coldcard's competitor. This means loss of customers, loss of sales and all these because someone copied your code and put it in a new design.Let's say ColdCard left their code open-source and there comes someone with ten times more money for marketing, manufacturing and so on. They take ColdCard's open-source wallet, create a new hardware wallet, spend ten times more in marketing than coldcard and will build a great business on ColdCard's work.I don't see anything wrong with Verifiable Source Code. It's a business, I think it will even demotivate people to start a business if their work might be copied super easily. I don't think anyone shares the belief of Nikola Tesla in a modern capitalism where you are nothing without money.",

By the way, I have mentioned that your GUI is different from Colcard and I don't say your hardware is copy/paste. You improved GUI side of ColdCard and made your wallet easier to use, what I said above was only about code. Your wallet has camera also, it's good, no one says it's bad. I often recommend your wallet and CC to people.I just want to explain that ColdCard's source is available for anyone to use and verify, that's all that matters for users. When people simply say ColdCard isn't open source, it looks like ColdCard and Ledger are comperable in terms of status of their code. Both of them are not open source but there is a huge difference. Ledger is closed-source, no one can check what code their Ledger runs but ColdCard is not open source in a sense that they don't allow competitors to simply copy their work, on another hand, anyone can see and verify the code. This doesn't make them bad and doesn't ruin their reputation. In a business where you work days and nights to write a code and there is a danger that rich businessman will copy and paste your code and sell a clone but dive you because of money and better marketing, I think it's okay to protect yourself from this danger.",

It's not for beginners - or rather it's not for beginners who don't want to take things slow and patiently and learn. It doesn't hold your hand like Ledger or Trezor and it has so many options and features that if you don't understand what you're doing and just press buttons you can really fuck yourself up. There was somebody in a Reddit thread the other day that opted not to use Coldcard's TRNG (default option) and instead selected to generate their own entropy via dice rolls. When doing so you must use at least 99 dice rolls to generate sufficient entropy - but this person used ONE roll, and because of this, the entropy was at an absolute minimum which will generate one of only 6 possible seeds which are obviously monitored by bots hoping to catch such a mistake and his funds were swept. Coldcard does have warnings throughout this process but you still need to be aware of what you're doing. Most people just mash the \"ok\" button at every prompt and read nothing. There's also another option to let the TRNG generate the seed and then \"mix in\" dice rolls. So 3 different ways to generate a seed with it and you need to understand each one. Compare this to Ledger where the entire setup process is completely braindead and simple.",

Do you want to learn more about bitcoin hardware wallet softwares? You can read every single line of their source code anytime you wish, so, you can learn from them and come up with your product if it's better and not totally based on their source code. Supporting this point. Consider the perspective of an ordinary wallet user whose sole concern is the availability of  code for scrutiny and verification. To such a user, referring to the Commons Clause attached to the MIT license accompanied CC product appears to be nothing more than a sheer casuistic. From their standpoint, all they seek is open access to the code, making the presence of the Commons Clause seem irrelevant.",

And code which is not open source and therefore prevents other projects, companies, developers, etc., from using that code in their products means that none of these projects, companies, developers, etc., will bother looking at the code, probing the limits of the code, building on top of the code, and so forth. Why would they waste their time going through the GitHub of a \"source verifiable\" project knowing they can't do anything with that code, when they could spend their time going through the GitHub of an \"open source\" project knowing they can use that code for anything they like?\"Source accessible\" or \"source verifiable\" simply means fewer people will be looking at the code than they would if it were open source. And for the ordinary wallet user, this is what matters.",

But, Coldcard's license doesn't stop anyone from sharing their ideas or suggesting modifications to Coinkite. What they can't do is create their own products based on that code and sell it. This is a douchebag move by their team , I have no doubt about that. If you don't want to have anything to do with Coinkite or their developers, that's fine. But you could work on the code if you wanted to. And the end-user who is not interested in building and selling software, but verifying it and checking the code, can do that.",
