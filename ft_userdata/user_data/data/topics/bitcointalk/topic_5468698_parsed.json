  "content": "I've noticed that many people are interested in buying domain names using Bitcoin, and I wanted to share a step-by-step guide on how to do this on Namecheap. It's a straightforward process, and with the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, it's becoming an increasingly accepted payment method. Here's how you can purchase a domain name with Bitcoin on Namecheap:Step 1: Create a Namecheap AccountIf you don't already have a Namecheap account, you'll need to sign up. Visit Namecheap's website (https://www.namecheap.com) and click on \"Sign Up\" in the upper right corner. Follow the registration process and make sure to provide accurate information.Step 2: Search for Your Domain NameOnce you're logged in, use the domain search bar on Namecheap's homepage to find the domain name you want to purchase. Enter your desired domain and click \"Search.\"Step 3: Add Your Domain to CartIf the domain you want is available, you'll see it listed with a price. Click the \"Add to Cart\" button next to your chosen domain name.Step 4: View Your CartAfter adding your domain to the cart, click the shopping cart icon in the upper right corner to review your order.Step 5: Select Payment MethodOn the cart page, you'll see your domain name(s) and the total cost. Below that, you'll find a section titled \"Payment Method.\" Click on it and select \"Bitcoin.\"Step 6: Review and ConfirmDouble-check your order details to ensure everything is correct, and then click \"Confirm Order.\"Step 7: Make Payment with BitcoinAfter confirming your order, you'll be redirected to a page with instructions on how to complete the Bitcoin payment. You'll see a Bitcoin wallet address and a QR code. Use your Bitcoin wallet to send the required amount to the provided address or scan the QR code.Step 8: Wait for ConfirmationOnce your Bitcoin payment is successfully processed, you'll receive a confirmation email from Namecheap. This email will include details about your domain purchase.Step 9: Domain OwnershipYour domain name is now yours! Namecheap will take care of the registration process, and you'll have full ownership of the domain. That's it!I also made a complete video that covers this subject in detail.

I registered all my domains on Namecheap this is my go-to domain registrar for TLD domains not only TLD but local extensions I have two .ph country extensions registered here. I am not aware of these domain registrars that accept Bitcoin since Namecheap is my host provider and I can easily link my domains to my host, propagation will not take long if your host is the same as your domain registrar, I will explore these domains registrars and see what features they have.",

Your guide would look better if you would add step by step images, but yeah, you're newbie, so, you can't upload images.But why just Namecheap? I have good experience with theirservice in all these years, but it's not only service where you can buy domain with Bitcoin. Though, IIRC they were accepting Bitcoins only through BitPay and it's probably worse than not accepting Bitcoin at all. But fortunately later they added BTCPayServer.P.S. It's that your Youtube channel? Haven't checked deeper, but from first glance it looks nice .",

Charging a balance in Namecheap or buying a domain with Bitcoin is not much different from using Bitcoin to make payments, and even in Namecheap all you do is replenish your balance with Bitcoin and use that balance to buy domains and not buy a domain directly, which is different from, for example, buying an Ethereum domain and mining the domain using gas fees.Even if the service provider does not support Bitcoin, you can use gift cards or pay using Visa cards that are charged with Bitcoin.",

Namecheap is perhaps one of the easiest to use (that's why I wonder why this service gets a video + forum tutorial), but it's neither the most popular nor the cheapest, plus the user experiences are not the most positive (at least mine and some around me that I've heard of).For example, BitMaxz suggested a few way better registrars.",
