In that case you're wrong my friend no \"Core\" or any other crypto-currency could take the place of the King of Crypto-currencies, the Bitcoin will remain the king and even if someone makes it's copy the same way people do the cloning of animals, doesn't mean that the copy could replace the real one.I have read the white paper of Core, just skimmed it, and I found that the creator was smart enough to attract users by copying code out of many blockchains that include Bitcoin, Ethereum,  Ethereum 2.0, Polygon, Solana, and others. But, it's just a copy project and it has nothing special. All those features have been copied from other blockchains and now they are trying to promote the thing.Although, the userbase of the project seems quite good, but still it's nothing compare to the mighty Bitcoin. Bitcoin was, it is, and will always be the king of Crypto-currencies. And, trust me even 1000's of such shit coins are created they won't be able to replace a single part of the king. I recommend you to stop promoting such coins that are just not going to last so long, and focus on buying and hodling the crypto-king Bitcoin only.",

If you intend to promote anything that has nothing to do with bitcoin then you should look for the appropriate mainboard because here it is more relevant to talk specifically about bitcoin. I don't want to know what shitcoin and wallet you are trying to promote and that is your right and even if it is a scam you will also get the consequences of what you do. It's been over four hours since you posted your post and associating bitcoins with your referrals makes absolutely no sense.",
