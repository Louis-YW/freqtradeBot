  "content": "While the Bitcoin network has introduced a revolutionary platform for data storage, the information currently stored on the blockchain often doesn't fully exploit this advantage. For instance, consider the analysis under the BRC20 protocol, where a token like sats has already generated 21,722,504 records of mint and transfer types. Each record takes up about 60 bytes on average, amounting to a total of approximately 1.3 billion bytes. To put this volume of data into perspective, let's compare it to the storage needs of literary works. Novels vary widely in length, so here we provide some average byte requirements for different categories of literature and how many such books could be stored within 1.3 billion bytes.Based on the definitions of short, medium, and long novels, their average word counts are approximately 7,500 words, 40,000 words, and 80,000 words, respectively. If we calculate an average of 6 bytes per word, the byte requirements for each type of literary work are about 45,000 bytes, 240,000 bytes, and 480,000 bytes. The following table illustrates how many books could be inscribexd using the space occupied by the sats token under the BRC20 protocol:This example shows us not just the vast capacity of blockchain data storage but also underscores how this technology can be leveraged beyond traditional applications. Just imagine, the same technology used to track and verify transactions can also serve as a digital fortress safeguarding our literary heritage. The potential is vast and varied, stretching from the realm of cryptocurrencies into the very core of human culture and knowledge.The Masterpiece \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" comprises approximately 150,000 words, which, including the foreword, occupies around 820,000 bytes. Remarkably, just one sats token can encapsulate 1,585 copies of this vast tome on the Bitcoin blockchain. While Bitcoin can host countless fungible tokens, named whatever we choose, how many such renowned works do we actually have? Even if we combined every major work in human history, it wouldn't fill the space occupied by a single fungible token.This comparison highlights the immense storage capacity of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is currently widely used for recording financial transactions. If we were to repurpose this capability towards cultural and educational ends, its potential value would be enormous. Through the Bitcoin Library project, we could tap into this underutilized resource to create a digital global library, offering readers worldwide instant access to world literature. This would also provide a secure and enduring repository for humanity’s cultural heritage.I truly understand bitcoin should be used as pay method. But the reality is bitcoin is misused as a big casino, runes, brc20, tap, atom and so many protocols just send many useless and meaningless information. As the example I mentioned, brc20-sats occupied almost many books' space. If we can use this to storage books that will be very meaningful and fun.A master piece is always less than 1MB. Guys, what do you think of this idea? Looking forward to your reply.And if you have any recommendations to Library, just contact me: grok@btclibrary.org",

We should get creative and look for more immutable way to store data.- Jay -As human society has developed, the means of storing information have evolved from primitive etchings on stones and walls to paper records, and now to modern electronic devices. While these advancements have significantly improved the efficiency and convenience of information storage, the durability of information from a long-term preservation perspective has shown a decreasing trend. For example, traditional paper materials can last for hundreds of years, whereas the lifespan of modern electronic storage devices typically spans only a few decades. Even information carved into more durable substances like stone cannot escape the fate of physical environmental damage and erosion over time.In recent years, scientists have explored new methods using quartz glass as a data storage medium. This technology employs lasers to create minuscule physical changes within quartz glass, thereby achieving long-term data storage. Theoretically, the data preservation capabilities of quartz glass can reach hundreds of millions of years, significantly surpassing the lifecycle of traditional storage mediums. However, despite the significant advantages of quartz glass storage technology in terms of data preservation duration, it presents limitations in the convenience of information retrieval. This technology requires the use of specific reading devices to decode and access the stored data, which not only increases the cost of accessing information but also limits its accessibility.In contrast, information storage based on the Bitcoin network, although theoretically not as physically durable as quartz glass, offers nearly instantaneous global access. With the aid of the internet, anyone can access data on the blockchain at any time from any location without the need for special equipment, greatly enhancing the circulation and availability of information.As the value of Bitcoin has significantly increased, so too has the strength of its consensus mechanism. This consensus is not only rooted in the robustness of the technology but is also reflected in a large community of stakeholders—including miners, developers, investors, and millions of ordinary users. These participants create a strong network effect, with each individual contributing in their own way to the stability and security of the Bitcoin network. The immutability of information on Bitcoin is primarily attributed to several core principles.In the end, I TOTALLY SUPPORT YOUR SAYINGS. Yes, not just 200 books. I mean there are 200 books you must and have to inscribe. I don't doubt we have more brilliant books than 200. It's just my list, if this library can be built, I will be happy to see your list~",
