In this particular case, Twitter probably has made a lot more profits than the penalty amount ($150m) by selling their user data. So they can get away with it even after paying the fine and I am pretty sure they will come up with a creative way to avoid this penalty anyway.Tiwtter, Facebook, Google these companies make their money from ads.

If someone really wants to change something, then the penalties must be far greater - otherwise this is nothing but a farce that will continue indefinitely.I'm really interested in what the new T boss will do in this regard, especially when we know how much he paid for his new toy.",

They broke the law and got caught. Frankly it shows that the regulators are always far behind the criminal activity taking places and it's probably by sheer luck that they got wind of this. Facebook went through similar things and you know what they most likely learned? How to hide the malicious activity they are doing even better, and besides that - the punishment is likely to cost them tiny amounts compared to the money they can potentially earn from abusing data in these ways. $150 million sounds like a big number to us, but it's pittance to this multibillion dollar company and comes under the \"cost of business\" category in some accounting line. The regulators need to be more proactive instead of reactive if they want applause.",
