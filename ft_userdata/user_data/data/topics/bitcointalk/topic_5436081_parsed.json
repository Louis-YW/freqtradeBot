There goes the CBDC from other countries like China and this seems is going to be the source of the money that shall flow for the next bull run and this trend might continue for next years.Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/19/national-australia-bank-becomes-second-australian-bank-to-build-stablecoin/The National Australia Bank (NAB), one of the four biggest Australian banks, has created a stablecoin called AUDN, which it aims to launch in the middle of 2023, according to the Australian Financial Review (AFR) report.The purpose of AUDN would be to allow its customers to settle transactions on blockchain technology in real time using Australian dollars, NAB said. AUDN could also be used for several other purposes including \"carbon credit trading, overseas money transfers and repurchase agreements,\" NAB’s Chief Innovation officer Howard Silby told AFR.The stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum and Algorand blockchains, the latter a smart contract platform similar to Ethereum.[..]For the full article, please read the source:National Australia Bank Becomes Second Australian Bank to Build Stablecoin: Report",

China started it and maybe this will be the new trigger foe crypto to be active again. The big guys are probably talking now and what would be the market trend for the next few years. Break this recession or what.",

No government wants to lose out on the Financial grip and if CBDCs are to be introduced under any blockchain architecture, the Governments will create their own which they feel they can control and manipulate. Like the fee, taxation, tracking, freezing transactions and addresses, controlling money in circulation etc.You are right, the bank is probably acting on their own and not as the Australian Government. I am not sure what kind of legal processes they went through to have this approved, though given the Australian Government can get bitchy sometimes towards crypto.",

Launching its stablecoin can trigger other countries to follow suit and of course, they will get support from their country's currency such as Australia. Blockchain technology will finally develop with the participation of every government by creating stablecoins so that the government will give permission to its citizens to use crypto in full. But maybe it is still too early for other countries and they still need to research if they want to use blockchain to create their stablecoin.",

So Australia now also has a digital version of their Australian Dollar. This basically also means, that if for example 1 Billion digital Australian dollars will be minted and put into circulation, that 1 Billion \"normal\" Australian dollars would need to be removed from circulation or otherwise that newly printed money would just generate additional inflation.Also i am not really sure if such CBDC are really a reason or a source for a next bull run of the crypto market. For me their are just digital versions of native national tokens nothing more.",

That might be a hopeful technological advancement and progress if blockchain could be utilized to improve the current system. No matter whether it will be implemented in the token form or directly within A CBDC system, it should address the current lack of innovation within the nowadays centralized payment system.",
