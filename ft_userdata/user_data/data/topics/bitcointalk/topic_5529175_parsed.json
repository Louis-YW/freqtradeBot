Gox.  News was everywhere back then and there are also and some media sensationalized this hacking by reporting people committing suicide because they lost all their money on that hack.When it comes to hacking security issues, it won't be fair to say only Mt, Gox has that issue, when an exchange is hacked, it automatically points to its security lapses, thus all the hacking incident have something to do with the companies security, may it be an inside job or the other way around.",

The good thing in Bitcoin is we have choice, either be your own bank or trust it to someone.The possibility is still there, though, honestly speaking, most out there would still use CEXes to do daily operations or trade.Surely, the catch would be to get only the funds you will be working with on them, all the rest should be on the cold wallet / other secure means of storage.",

People thought it was anonymous and technology wasn't as resilient as it is today. It would have been the wild west in the early days and even when I discovered Bitcoin and became active here there was a lot of things going wrong in the ecosystem...it's just the process of maturity I suppose.Quote from: Ziskinberg on February 06, 2025, 06:21:45 AMMeron ding mga exchanges na nahack before pero hindi lang masyadong popular kasi Mt Gox was really the most popular that time they dominated the market.

Gox was the first to experience its kind as at that time, it should be expected to be more louder even than every other one that happened after its own incident.",

Gox gets a lot of attention because it was one of the biggest and most well-known exchanges at the time.  It served a large percentage of Bitcoin users so of course many were affected by the hack.",

And in some cases, it's literally the people in charge who have the keys to all the coins who actually just take the coins.You can't really do anything about it because:Not Your Keys, Not Your CoinsYour Bitcoins should be only briefly at the exchanges, and you should withdraw as soon as possible, before you can't",
