The crypto industry looks centralized to me, and for one to be fully decentralized they probably have to use BTC and trade in a decentralized exchange which many people find it hard to do, and they just use their crypto like they use their fiat in the bank.",

At the end of this, this drama is clout chasing and gathering attention for them, still good exposure for both as usual.The reason CZ needs to defend his position is solely because Kevin O'leary is making a strange claim that the reason for the FTX failure is CZ and not SBF. It is a fact that SBF contacted CZ to bail out FTX but when they checked their audit reports which they obtained CZ knew that he is in a bigger hole if he tries to bail them and hence he backed out and the people who took money from SBF are defending him and trying to blame others for the scam that took place.",

If he didn't lose anything it means that although he was shilling for SBF he was smart enough to hold his investment out of FTX. Sharks like O'leary only act surprised like they didn't know what was going on and lost money. A real believer would've taken 15 mill from SBF, put it all in crypto and held the coins on FTX but a smart guy who did his research would reinvest elsewhere. I hope people finally learn and nobody trusts O'leary and people like him from now on. There are no angels. Vitalik sold a lot of ETH last year, Musk sold bitcoins and Tesla shares... These guys are not our friends. The most generous billionaire FFS",

You might misunderstood my post, as I didn't say that O'Leary didn't lose anything but rather that he didn't lose everything. Out of $15 million he got from FTX, $9.7 million was in STT tokens that he was holding in exchange and he invested $1 million in equity, meaning that he should have $4.3 million left from that deal. Not bad at all i think.Quote from: coolcoinz on January 08, 2023, 10:40:59 AMA real believer would've taken 15 mill from SBF, put it all in crypto and held the coins on FTX but a smart guy who did his research would reinvest elsewhere.Well, we know that he wasn't a believer because just few years ago he called bitcoin garbage. He was just a mercenary, paid to promote the exchange.",
