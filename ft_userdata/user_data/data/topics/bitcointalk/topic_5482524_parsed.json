  "content": "Rewatching the Simpsons yesterday night , this time on a full 4k tv and not on the tablet I just realized that the way they depicted Satoshi, (well his statue) was probably one of the best I've seen to date, personal tastes but I still think it beats by a long way all the Guy Fawkes style art I've seen to date.So, how about we create a small fan index of those, just a bit like Wikipedia mentions!What I'm impressed with in it is the small details, like the snow being BTC coins, I know it might be dark for some but still to me looks impressive!So here it goes:The Simpsons , Season 35, Episode 5Â  - \"Treehouse of Horror XXXIV\", aired November 5, 2023Important!Only images from movies and TV shows, no youtube clips, no fanart!",

      "body": "Pretty cool huh? I also think this way in which people see Satoshi is very good, the artistic freedom created to represent him, each of us has a figure that represents him, for some a nerd, for others a kind of hero, for others a wizard ... imagination really is something surprising. The way I saw people or characters reminds me a lot of my childhood.great topic OP. Congratulations, it brought back good memories from the past.",

      "body": "Reminiscent of the ghost of future yet to come... perhaps even more appropriate if Satoshi and genesis block are read as foretellings of a future bleak for traditional money!I wonder how the cypherpunks would have illustrated/visualised themselves in fiction. Everything I've tried sourcing or asking AI has come up with the generic hooded figure look...",

      "body": "The TV show Simpson is known or popular because of its numerous conspiracy episodes where they show an event or happening that really happens in real life. Is it a coincidence or not? We never know. And now that we see in this episode that Satoshi or Bitcoin made an appearance, and from the looks on the image, it looks like it is a portrait or something, I don't know if there is a message in this episode why they made it into this episode. From my perspective, the statue's appearance symbolises the anonymous character of the creator of bitcoin, which is true as, until now, we have never known the identity of the creator. Yes, we have the name, but who is it exactly?. Second, the statue seems to be raising the coin, which is bitcoin, which can be a message that Satoshi will appear and reclaim the coin as his creation. The snow part, which is made out of a bitcoin logo, may also pertain to bitcoin's dominance in the world; maybe bitcoin will become more known and adopted in the future. This is only my own opinion of the image; I know we have different interpretations of it.",
