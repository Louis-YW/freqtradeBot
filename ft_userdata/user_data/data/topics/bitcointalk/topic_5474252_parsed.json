Generally we understand a wallet as a thing that stores all the savings of our daily life. By my question everyone will understand what I mean, what and which are custodial and non custodial wallets.A crypto-wallet is a type of software. With a crypto wallet you can access the blockchain and execute transactions from there.1: Custodial WalletA custodial wallet is where a third party holds private keys on behalf of users. The third party has full control over the crypto assets, taking responsibility for managing the user's wallet keys, signing transactions and protecting the user's crypto assets.Some of the popular examples of best Custodial wallets are: Free Wallet,Binance, Kucoin,BitMex,Bitgo, Cobo wallet,Gemini Wallet,Venly Wallet,among others.2: Non-custodialThe main reason non-custodial wallet users have gained a huge momentum is that they provide users with a separate access to their funds. Those using non-custodial wallets do not have to look to a third party to manage funds or perform any related activities.Some examples of best Non-custodial wallet are: Electrum, Exodus, Ledger Nano X, Trezor One, Zengo, Wasabi, Metamusk,Coinomi,OKX,MyEtherWallet,among others.",

The private keys or seeds of the wallet are what determine its nature. If you are the only one who knows those seeds, generates them, and controls them, then the wallet is non-custodial.To achieve these requirements, the Non-custodial wallet must be open source, well reviewed, sufficiently cryptography random, have the option to withdraw, and have no restrictions on the ability to send. Otherwise, you cannot guarantee that you are the only one capable of generating the private key.",

By my question everyone will understand what I mean, what and which are custodial and non custodial wallets.With custodial wallet, you do not have the seed phrase and the keys. Like Coinbase.com or the Freewallet. Only what you will use to access your wallet is just email and password. With noncustodial wallet, you will have your seed phrase and your keys. The seed phrase is used to generate the keys and addresses and you only need the seed phrase to recover your wallet. They are also called self-hosted wallet.@AirtelBuzzKnow that centralized exchanges are different from custodial wallet. Although, centralized exchanges have their own custodial wallet which they keep customers funds as well. Binance, OKX Kucoin and BitMex are exchanges. Also know that Exodus and Coinomi are close source and not recommended.",

This is similar to the custodian wallets you have the coins but in control of it because not your key not your wallet .While being a grown up and so being able to have your own personal account without the dependency on your parents run anyone to keep your money, by which you can save and get your money as it pleases you without the control of your parents or anyone. This is similar to the Non-custodian wallets, you are in control of your key and so you are in control of your wallet.",

Well what other great options to buy and hold for investors or traders are hardware wallets or others. I think Trezor is the most popular at the moment.",

It looks like our friend Mr AirtelBuzz does not know English so well and also has no much knowledge about custodial and noncustodial wallets. He therefore decided to use AI to generate text for him to post here, and in the process he ended up posting wrong information.This is why use of AI to make posts in the forum should be completely discouraged.",

And once those seed phrases are gone our assets are also gone. But if the wallet is gone our assets still remains.",

By my question everyone will understand what I mean, what and which are custodial and non custodial wallets.As a newbie, your question is very valid, as this is one of the most important things that you need to understand.A custodial wallet is the one that you open in an exchange, and they will manage the account for you. They have access to it, therefore, you're not in total control of the coins inside. It is not advice able to leave all your crypto coins in an exchange, because if the exchange folds up or is scammed, your crypto asset will be affected. It is said that if it's not your keys, then it's not your coin. This saying is only applicable in custodial wallets.A none custodial wallet, is the one that you have control over, it's your passwords and your seed phrase, therefore you have full autonomy over it. It is decentralized, so no third party can access your wallet, except you misplace your passwords or seed phrase, or if they are compromised. So it's very important to keep your passwords and seed phrase in a very secured place, so scammers will not see them and access your wallet.",

If you open your account on one exchange and use a public address to receive (deposit) your coins into that account, you don't control private keys, mnemonic seed of that wallet.That specific exchange controls it, not some crypto exchanges (like you write).
