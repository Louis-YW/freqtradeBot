Is there a list of what you get and what you do not? Been using that link for a while and just now noticed that things that I can see by going to directly have new posts but are not showing.Did a google search and didn't come up with anything.-Dave",

Please ignore it if it is helpless for you.Â  What I was asking is more or less, is there anything else not shown then what is described with the link you posted.In my mind with the URL I am using it should give me all of the latest newbie posts outside of bounty. BUTI did not see a post form a newbie that was non bounty posted a couple of minutes before I went to that link.I could see if I went to the thread itself.So I was wondering if there is any other filtering going on. Not important, just wondering if I was missing something. -Dave",
