You'd better learn to take risk if you want to make something different from what you've been having, but you can minimize this risk by going for bitcoin first being a newbie, then later when you think you've got a thicker skin in crypto and in taking risk you can go for some other cryptocurrencies as well, but everything begins with a step, take the first and bold step to learn and know that you've acquired something about bitcoin before investing, if you ask your friend again, he will tells you how long he has been in the system and the level of risk he had taken, before getting to where he is now.",

I have met various braggarts, I hope he is not like that.there are many possibilities in the bitcoin/crypto world and it is very complicated for anyone to list the full potential. It is certainly the best advice to learn about everything before taking any steps. Also, if you got interested only because of the possibility of getting rich and living comfortably, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. Several factors are needed for that.",

Thanks so much... I so much long to understand bitcoin very well and will love to invest and enjoy it's benefits. You have made a clear point. But u have spoken about minimizing risk, and in other to do that you recommended Bitcoin. Do u mean there is lesser or no risk in Bitcoin compared to other crypto?",

Does his life actually improve after he joined Bitcoin? Or is he just saying sweet words to entice you to join Bitcoin? I think the later is meaningless because bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme and is not a referral program. Whether you join bitcoin or not, it does not add anything to his success and neither does it subtract. So you have to meet your friend to know more about bitcoin. It is not all about earning you have to learn first before you earn.Try and read the books shared to you by dzungmobile",

Can anyone advice me on this? Even though everyone here believes that Bitcoin is not going anywhere and that it will be worth much more than it is worth now, it is still a fact that its a high risk investment. It is normal to be afraid to be afraid of something that you don't know much about so what you can do is educate yourself about all the pros and cons and if you are still afraid and think that you can't handle the volatility and being responsible for safety of your money, better stay away from it.",

You need to make an if you want to invest in Bitcoin and you just don't have to enter the market and come out without knowing the next direction of price and where price is going. You would also need to learn about the cryptocurrency market so that you will be able to measure your risks and plan how to execute your target that it will be affect your holding. Have it in your mind that Bitcoin investment is risky and entering into the market is at your own risk.",

Do u mean there is lesser or no risk in Bitcoin compared to other crypto?Lesser risk. Bitcoin represents 14 years of Blockchain advancement and has been the most valuable for all of that time. There is a real product and has maintained the exact same process for all of that time while getting more secure and more valued. Other cryptocurrencies are copies of existing ones, only few having an original idea, but still falling short in security or decentralization. The chances of a good investment with them is not favorable.Bitcoin has a fixed supply and is not vulnerable to inflation.- Jay -",

Can anyone advice me on this?  You cannot see changes in your life if you stay living in your comfort zone. Take some risk too so you will develop challenges in your life that will give you more motivation to succeed. And you can only do that if you start being knowledgeable in the crypto market at first. By knowing a lot about bitcoin and other potential cryptocurrencies, you will be aware of their risks so you start learning on how to manage the risks by then. Little by little, you will understand how crypto investment works and when you fully grasp its whole idea, then you can start taking some calculated risk and invest in crypto. But take them as long term investments because that’s the best way you can earn from them.",

Learn about Bitcoin first do it gives you a background knowledge of what you are heading into.  If you really think investing all in, then you will surely fear of its outcome. You cannot start investing if you see yourself less knowledgeable in the crypto market. Take the process of learning first until you see yourself start to completely understand how crypto investment works. Risks will always be there. If you keep on fearing it, nothing will happen to your life. That is why learn first before you take the risk so you can lessen the risks and manage your losses if ever you start investing.",

If there are people who can guide them upon looking for things like investment on crypto maybe they might get courage to try to spend some amount of their hard earned cash. But for sure once they got enough knowledge they provably try what they learn they start to spend money with the learnings the accumulate for many months of research.",

Why are you afraid to take risk? you already done so many risk in your life that you just don't realize that everyday you are at risk, its only your mind that saying you have not done it yet, the only thing that you may regret is you have not take the shot earlier, we all afraid of risk its normal, but we still do it, you have no idea what your friend have to endure to make where he is now, we may see his success but the nights where he can't sleep, stress, thinking what will happen to him is just in the background, taking risk is part of our life, let me tell you a short story about me, i only got 600$ got some other cash but its reserve for emergency, during first 4 months of 2021 still in pandemic, I have to help, to pay the bills, but i have to cover the last 1 and half year, i have to take a risk and bet on a coin which some say is a shitcoin, i don't listen to them, and do my research, hold the coin for a month, i don't expect it will spike that much, turn the money to 5 digits, and help me out a bit, lost some but keep others to help pay rents etc., as you can see, you have to take risk, sometimes but always have a backup plan, im not saying you go all in, but keep some just incase, as you see taking risk is part of our life, take it no regrets, learn from it, do not dwell on failure, take it as inspiration to move up.I hope this will help you decide, but no matter what its still your call, we are just here to give are advice, and experience good luck.",

What I'm saying is that words need to be checked for facts. Maybe he is just telling you, while not having anything that he boasts about.Whether you can bear the risk or not will be known when faced with it. Therefore, don't be shy, but act. Otherwise, you will regret that at the very last moment you didn't have the courage to plunge into the bitcoin's world.I don't recommend anything out of the ordinary. Study, educate yourself, become an expert in this area and then you will have a chance to get the benefits of bitcoin. But keep in mind that this will take effort and remember that nothing comes for free.",
