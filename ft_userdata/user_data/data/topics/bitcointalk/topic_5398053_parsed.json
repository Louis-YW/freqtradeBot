  "content": "Luna is a role model no doubt and LUNA is the only reason for the Popularity of the Pegged Decentralized stable currency in true words. But Luna showed a massive DIP reason its stable coin pegged with the LUNA lost its value to 77 cents remember that it's due to market fud/panic and heavy transfer of funds so Whatever the reason but due that LUNA made 50% dip estimated. $5B a massive Capital loss in the UST.But if the LUNA made no recovery on it then the condition will be more worst I know they have good reserves in BTC and Luna to Pegg UST price again but now UST lost a major power Capital and there are more options for investors in the market.My one more concern is with the USDD and TRX there are more possibilities that USDD can also face such positions but the Reserve and Market Capital Partners in USDD are one the biggest ventures onboard and in this Panic situation still, USDD made a good resistance on a $255M capital and keep growing reason major @AlamedaResearch @ambergroup_io @Polonniex. I am hoping good for USDD and if such a condition comes then TRX in DIP will be a buying spot and LUNA is also an opportunity but on which price you have to decide.Other Hyped Topics CoveredTron (TRX) Time is Here !

This is the likely the best time to bagged as much pieces of the coins as possible. The market is currently down, now is the best time to bagged as much coins as possible, inother to gained from the dip. One of the major reasons other Crypto are dipping is because the dumps of Bitcoin affects them all. Even Ethereum work align with Bitcoin price actions. Whales are selling their coins, those who buy high are selling low due to FUD in the space.",

This morning it is trading around $16 that means 86% down from its ATH. The idea of algorithmic stable coin UST failed to work during the market downturn and it has drastically damaged reputation of LFG. The collapse of UST would send ripples through the entire DeFi industry, and it will sound alarm bells for regulators who notice retail investors holding the bag. The current crisis is a huge challenge for Luna team.  Some supporters of Luna still believe that they still have enough reserves to bring back UST to 1 dollar. let's watch and wait how things shape up in coming dayshttps://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/10/ust-stablecoin-veers-wildly-from-dollar-peg-heres-the-latest/",

We are all claiming about how shady the USDT is while we are giving praise to LUNA UST since they are doing huge investment in Bitcoin but look at them now. They are the reason why crypto investors is on panic during this bearish trend. Bitcoin should be recovering by now if there's no scam drama like this given by luna company.How come a stable coin will lose double digit percentage on few days?",

This may become the end for terra luna. This company is seeking a big loan to back its stable token but im sure that if this is not enough to be used for that.

Stable coins pegged should be strong enough to provide the Perfection in justified price as its pegged there will be opportunity for the investors to enter with high risk and profits.",

The USDD protocol maintains the market price of USDD around the target price regardless of market conditions using the following method:● When USDD's price < 1USD, users and arbitrageurs could swap 1USDD to 1USD worth of TRX in the protocol.When 1USDD = 0.9USD, an arbitrageur can buy 1USDD with 0.9USD in the external market and then swap 1USDD for 1USD worth of TRX in the system. After that, the arbitrageur can sell 1USD worth of TRX in the external market at 1USD. In this way, the arbitrageur spends 0.9USD to get 1USD, and earns 0.1USD without taking any risks. As a result of the above arbitrage, 1USDD will be burned, and 1USD worth of TRX will be minted. As the supply of USDD decreases, USDD's price will increase, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage and 1USDD re-equates to 1USD.● When USDD's price > 1USD, users and arbitrageurs could swap 1USD worth of TRX to 1 USDD in the protocol.When 1USDD = 1.1USD, an arbitrageur can pay 1USD for TRX of the same value in the external market and then swap 1USD worth of TRX for 1USDD in the system. After that, the arbitrageur can sell 1USDD in the external market at 1.1USD. The arbitrageur spends 1USD to get 1.1USD and earns 0.1USD without taking any risks. As a result of the above arbitrage, 1USD worth of TRX will be burned, and 1USDD will be minted. As the supply of USDD rises, USDD's price will go down, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage and 1USDD re-equates to 1USD.",
