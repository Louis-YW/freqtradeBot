The only way for him to make money through his account is joining a campaign that receive negative feedback, 1xbit only receive negative feedback account with a reason for applying their campaign, I don't think there's an another good campaign.",

I also don't believe in that offer, the alibi that he needs money is very weak to offer $80 for hero accounts even if that account is not actively posting, no way you will sell it for $80 each, he just needs one or two months and of actively posting and learning how to posts constructively and he can be accepted on gambling campaigns some of which prioritize hero members and you can earn ten times of the amount he is offering, but of course he needs to be active in the gambling section and can participate in gambling discussion.",

This offer is quietly scam because 80$ is one week salary. He made this offer to attract bounty hunters because they are only who can take risk to use it for signature purpose. If he really doing this then i will say that he is most lazy person who cannot work honestly and Play his role in this forum with a good quality post.

      "body": "I was wondering what could have prompted the sales of those accounts by the seller. As i can see those accounts as claimed by the seller to be up for sales at that ridiculous amount which he or she could earn more if applied for a signature campaign. Come to talk of it, those accounts have gone that far to be sold at that price when looking at the efforts, commitment, and time put in place to build that account to that rank and yet the owner feels like putting it up for sale at a giveaway price. I begin to doubt if truly that account belongs to the seller or a possible account hack from a long inactive account holder and maybe the owner is no more. This situation is not the type to tell person that this is a scam. Ordinarily, one should know it is a scam looking at the account involved and the price tag attached. This would make people to rush the account and unbeknownst to them that they would definitely  end up being scammed. No one should deal with this account as there is every tendency and possibility that the seller and the the account itself been flagged.",

Both the deceived and the deceiver, in this situation, are both dishonest people. In most campaigns, a Hero ranked account goes for $80 and above weekly. Yet, someone supposedly wants to flog theirs for something far less, and someone thinks all is well?",

So not potentially joining any signature campaigns for that matter, he can still get back that $80 if he can scam a lot of individuals.And that is the best thing that we can do is to give the seller that red tag.
