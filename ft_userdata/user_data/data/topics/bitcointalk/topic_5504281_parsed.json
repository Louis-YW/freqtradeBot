What I know of is that it's listed on the exchange and its trading has begun there. The other candidates who talked at bitcoin2024, showed major interest in BTC where Robert Kennedy said \"I will sign another executive order directing the US Treasury to purchase 550 Bitcoin daily until the US has built a reserve of at least 4 million Bitcoins.\" I don't really believe their interests because it's glaring that they are desperate to win the crypto community over.",

This is fact that lasts with time, a long time in political history and it's true in all countries, not only in the USA or in this specific President election and nominees who join it next months.Make a big change like a country's reserved asset, in treasury, is not easy to be passed by the Congress. Smaller things can not get approved easily or even denied so a big change for national treasury, like accept Bitcoin, is not easy to pass, if not say it's nearly impossible at the moment.",

They know that many Americans are crypto users and they will like to see a president that that would announce that he will support crypto. Out of the presidential candidates, Trump would win. It would be Trump versus Canada Harris and I think be it Biden or Harris, Trump would win. I hope he will keep to his words because crypto supporters are really following him. Many of them would vote for him.",

There's speculations that he's working on a bill that will see the FED hold some Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.If that's the case,he's elected and implements it, the bull run would be massive.Not only Trump but also independent candidate Robert Kennedy F. Jr. also expressed support for bitcoin, who also mentioned that he would use bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. He said this today at the bitcoin conference and we wait to see what Trump will say next. But it remains unclear because there is no guarantee that Trump will be elected or whether he will actually keep his promises. Not to mention, just because he supports it doesn't mean it will go through easily since he needs approval from Congress and the Fed. I have long doubted his idea and did not believe it would be easy to implement. I don't have too high expectations if Trump is elected, I just hope he is not as strict on bitcoin as Biden, and turning bitcoin into a reserve asset is not easy.There are only a few hours left until Trump speaks and let's see if he has anything interesting to offer.https://x.com/TheBitcoinConf/status/1817171394506953042",

      "body": "This Bitcoin in the national reserves is quite interesting. Everybody is making promises during election season. Indeed, that sounds fantastic and the crypto people love it. But implementing it? That is challenging. Its not just about saying the right things, its about understanding the system, the complexities, the regulations. Its about handling the banks, the government, the whole worldwide financial machine.Bitcoin is a winner. But putting it in national reserves? That is a significant choice that must be done well and will take decades.So, listen to these politicians, hear what they have to say. But keep from getting carried away. Ask the challenging questions. Demand a true plan, not merely slogans. And most importantly consider the whole picture. This implies what for the nation, the economy, and the world generally?",

Once the mission has been accomplished, power automatically change hands and you're now at his mercy.My take is that anyone that wants to support trump shouldn't do so just because he's been bullish about Bitcoin of recent. Regardless of the action of the election and even if he's able to leave up to what he's been saying, Bitcoin will still thrive through.",
