After all, nobody reaches the final by accident, including them. But if City manages to score early, Inter's hopes may dwindle. The odds at the bookmakers for City to become European champions for the first time are only 1.25, while the odds for Inter to secure their fourth title are 4.00. In one match, anything is possible, and once the ball is kicked off, there won't be any clear favorites anymore, at least until the first goal is scored. The momentum is building up. Both teams deserve it, and may the best team win in the end.",

Manchester City squad is stronger than last season, and yes Pep should get credit. I think nothing can stop Manchester City from winning the treble winner, before that I wasn't too sure about Manchester City. But when they handled Manchester United in the FA Cup, and won very well, now I really believe in Manchester City, although Inter is currently also considered good because they have reached the UCL Final but tonight a new history will be created.",

However, Inter made it through the challenge by beating Milan in the semi-finals and earned the right to advance to the final against Manchester City.Pep Guardiola is a great coach who has led Manchester City to win quite a number of titles in his last 6 seasons. Including this season, he might make history for Manchester City if he wins his first Champions League for City. I agree that Manchester City will most likely win the treble winner, but only if their performance against Inter is very good. No surprises about Inter, they won't win the title this season.",

Also, they could surprise Manchester City, but Guardiola will field all of his best players in the final to achieve the vision and mission of the treble winners.",

I think one of the most important thing now because, i do feel tonight's champions league final is already won and has been won since, Manchester City did beat Real Madrid.  The important thing about Manchester City tonight when they lift the trophy would be that, Pep Guardiola did fulfill his promises either consciously or unconsciously to Manchester City board, fans and players since he joined up that, there would be a champion's league trophy at the Etihad.Tonight would be a fulfilment of that promise and its going to be flawless",

I hope not, I don't like teams that can buy every player thatAs we saw in the first half - Manchester City dominated the game but their creativity was not as good as when they beat Real Madrid. Manchester City had several good chances, but Haaland was unable to get Onana to collect the ball from the net. Inter defended well and were prepared enough to make it difficult for Manchester City's players to create chances - but I thought Manchester City would have been better in the second half.Inter's game was uninspiring as they appeared to be planning a draw in 90 minutes of regular time. Inter tended to defend and capitalize on counter-attacks, but in all their efforts in the first half they failed. Manchester City also made some mistakes for not being calm under pressure, but I'm sure Pep will instruct something good for the second half as their victory won't be easy.",

This is just your personal opinion and how you feel about the club, what really matter now is how each team play out that’ll determine who will win the trophy. The fate of Manchester City winning the treble lies in their hands now. They’ve been able to win two trophy already and this is the most important amongst them, do you still think they won’t win the match and Inter Milan will be able to stop them? I doubt so but let’s watch out till the end.",

Manchester City is looking hard to win tonight with only have 1 different goal, and inter is playing bad also by let the City player open improve during the match, this is what That arrogant person (Pep) wants by creating a hybrid formation of 4-2-3-1 to 3-2-4-1 because playing without right-back, that very genius coach I have ever seen.Congrats to Manchester City for the 1st time getting the Champions League Trophy and Trebel Winners.I just won a little penny tonight.",

Manchester City has just made history that is hard to forget, the success of lifting the UCL trophy completed the success of winning its first treble winner. Previously they had won the Premier League trophy and the FA Cup, then complemented it with the long-awaited trophy.After successfully lifting the UCL trophy, there will be several more trophies that can be won, Manchester will be challenged by Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.

It was Manchester City's turn to win, that is why everything went in their favour, even after loosing one of their most creative and important players in just 35mins into the game to injury. They have worked very hard this season and all the players in Manchester City deserve to celebrate because they have successfully shown their dominance in the European football and are now the defending champions.
