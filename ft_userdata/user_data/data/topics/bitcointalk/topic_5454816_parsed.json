The area where I want to host the wedding is like a village where I don't have good mobile network, so it won't be wrong to call such an area as a remote area. After eating and drinking, me and one of my cousins went out for a walk and saw three boys drawing something in the mud. I approached them with interest and watched them make the Bitcoin logo in the mud and compete to see who could make the logo more beautiful. So I asked about this logo and one boy said that his parents have this bitcoin and his father taught him to draw this logo and he taught his friends. I was very happy to hear this from the boy because in such a village where there is no good mobile network people are involved with Bitcoin.  In this case of the boy, I remembered one thing that the children will be developed in the same way as the parents raise their children from childhood. The boy's father may want to expose his son to Bitcoin from an early age.",

They draw things they know and know recently but they even don't know what it means technically. Children are hungry to discover new things and if they have fun with new things, they love it.It is good start for children but if you want to teach your children about Bitcoin, you must maintain it very long time like education. If you stop it, they will forget what Bitcoin, what logo it is after a few months. Some children with good memory will not forget but most of them will do forget.Honestly I don't think we need to teach children too technically about Bitcoin as they are young and they should enjoy their childhood as most as possible. Don't put them into pressure of learning Bitcoin too early. They have many years ahead to learn from education to Bitcoin.",

If they are exposed to Bitcoin knowledge at a young age, they will grow up with it, which will be really beneficial to them.",

How many of you have become them now?Agree, a photo will prove some of our doubts about the story. After all, there's nothing wrong with taking photos to demonstrate the legitimacy of Op's story. But despite what the Op and the story say, we're pretty limited on this one. Given that if it is true then their parents are trying to introduce Bitcoin in a simple way like a picture while the rest I still doubt if the child's parents explain Bitcoin in its entirety. Then if this story is just an essay to attract our attention, at first glance it might make sense but because there is no evidence of pictures on the sand we only respond to it as a fictional story.",

Actually, that's my target and plan for raising my son if it's a boy. That's why right now it's not possible because it's only 3 years old, maybe at the age of 7-8 years old I'll gradually introduce it to Bitcoin. I'm not going to explain anything to him about it, I'm just going to show him how it's used and helps us.There is nothing wrong if we educate children at a young age because it will not affect their infancy as children. There are other children here under 7 years old who know how to say bad words and smoke cigarettes, because of the environment they grew up in.But if a child is aware and fed correctly about Bitcoin, it will be a big challenge and encouragement to adults my age to learn about Bitcoin because they will think that if the child is aware and has knowledge of Bitcoin then I can be more who learns faster than a child. here, even if the child is not taught anything if someone older than them sees them, they will have the initiative to learn about Bitcoin as well.",

Also, you don't even have to drop their pictures, all that's been required of you is a picture of the LOGO that the little boy draw on the ground, how hard can that be?

But most stories don't have any accompanying images, just stories told. No offense to the OP, but I hope this thread is not meant to earn merit. One thing I was going to ask the OP, he didn't mention the age of the baby, and I don't fully agree with teaching bitcoin to kids if they are too young. Teaching bitcoin too early also does not guarantee that they will become rich or will be passionate about bitcoin when they grow up, teaching children is necessary but needs to be appropriate for each age.",

And most of these lessons are covered in their academic work in school. But as parents, we have to observe our children identify their area of interest and assist them to channel their effort towards that area. You might have a child that doesn't have an interest in Bitcoin, you don't need to force him. But some children will pick an interest in the sector, your responsibility is to encourage and guide them.",

Now what they are saying is that you would have snapped the image on the ground since you were with an Android phone there because snapping does not need internet to connect and send it whenever you network, especially in this thread you have created. You don't have to snap even the boy but only the sand logo. And that would have been making the story more realistic. In these days children with bitcoin is the talk of the day.

So I asked about this logo and one boy said that his parents have this bitcoin and his father taught him to draw this logo and he taught his friends. I was very happy to hear this from the boy because in such a village where there is no good mobile network people are involved with Bitcoin.  In this case of the boy, I remembered one thing that the children will be developed in the same way as the parents raise their children from childhood. The boy's father may want to expose his son to Bitcoin from an early age.That is a very good thing because there is a father who wants to introduce Bitcoin to his child from an early age in a very gradual way even though the child does not know how the system is in Bitcoin and how to get it. But by being able to describe the Bitcoin logo, of course it has occurred to them that Bitcoin has a shape like that so they start to believe that their father owns the Bitcoin even though they may not know where his father keeps the Bitcoin. And actually I'm not really surprised by such cases because I've also found people who live in remote areas but they can still earn via the internet even though they have to struggle with a bad signal. Because the development of a person's brain and way of thinking is not seen from the place where they come from, but it is very visible through how they have a good mindset and the case that you are talking about is a very unique case.",

The area where I want to host the wedding is like a village where I don't have good mobile network, so it won't be wrong to call such an area as a remote area. After eating and drinking, me and one of my cousins went out for a walk and saw three boys drawing something in the mud. I approached them with interest and watched them make the Bitcoin logo in the mud and compete to see who could make the logo more beautiful. If something like that actually happened in such a remote place, it would be incredible, because someone would know about bitcoin. Even the knowledge of their parents about bitcoin, can be directly taught to their children. I think it's a really good start for these kids, because they can get to know bitcoin from an early age. You should capture events like that in photos, whether you didn't have a cell phone or camera with you at that time. Because it would be very interesting if you could take a picture and post it on the thread you created. Because even though the place is very remote and the internet connection is very bad, it doesn't mean you left your cell phone or camera at home. Because taking pictures does not need to use an internet connection. But all those incidents have passed, so it's a shame you didn't take those picture moments.Quote from: arbiter5 on June 02, 2023, 03:50:06 AMI'm gonna bet $100 that this didn't really happen.I think you are too quick to make an opinion, that all the stories are just a lie. It's true the OP didn't include a photo or a valid address for the place. But I don't think it's right to accuse the OP's post. Because maybe it all really happened.",
