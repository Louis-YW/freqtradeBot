This can happen to any app. Before on playstore, there was many fake Electrum app but we keep posting the fake apps on this forum and also keep reporting them.But you are not wrong that people should no more use Ledger hardware wallet. The company is careless with their users data and also are encouraging their users to trust third parties with their seed phrase.Quote from: cygan on November 05, 2023, 08:52:13 AMhas already been posted and mentioned here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452900.msg63107288#msg63107288the discussion has already begun...I think having a separate thread for it is good.",

Although there are many reasons to stay clear of Ledger and their products based on everything they have done lately and are planning to do with their Ledger Recover vulnerability, receiving spam or phishing emails isn't one of those. Those things have happened before Ledger and will continue to happen to many other companies. Knowing how to recognize scams and not responding to spam is the way to go.",

The most obvious and easy way to scam user is to substitute the receiving address but we have already faced similar extensions ( for instance developed for Chrome) with capabilities to steal users SEED.UPD.

I would advocate multisig wallet with at least one HW-based cosigner (P.S. mine  is Passport 2).You are right, this wallet should be forbidden now, especially after so many warnings. Many experts suggest avoiding it for that recovery phrase feature shit and after that ledger database leak of customers, etc. These were all warnings to the users to shift to another wallet, or at least they should not have stored their full savings only in a single wallet of the ledger or any other wallet company.I read your provided news and the reddit user Weak-Rice-3545 lost around $26,500 of his total savings. I feel sorry for him or her, but if that was his lifetime savings, then he should have kept half of these savings in some other place.One thing I have learned so far is that the crypto industry is full of land mines. Once you become ignorant, you step foot on some mines and lose your precious assets. Therefore divide your body parts (savings) in the field of crypto industry. And thanks for sharing this news but according to the @zachXBT who reported this issue, noted that this app is removed from the Microsoft store.",

If it asks then it's phishing.Ledger app or any software wallet like Electrum only needs connection and authentication from your hardware device you should never share your seed anywhere other than into your hardware device itself.So how did Microsoft forget to check it?This means Microsoft does not manually check and testing any software that they publish on the store.",

The conclusion is that people simply do not understand what they are doing at all - because such stupid moves as entering a seed anywhere except in another (verified) hardware wallet is more than enough proof that someone does not understand what they are doing.
