Blockchain Authentication: The blockchain verifies the validity of a transaction by checking if it has been properly signed with the PK. However, the blockchain does not store the private key. The private key remains in your wallet and is never transmitted directly on the blockchain.In simple term, the bitcoin uses ECDSA. The digital signature is actually created by private key and the verification is done by public key. This way the public key proves your argument ownership without having to expose your private key. So with this method just anybody cannot prove owner of your bitcoin without the knowledge of your private key to that public key. Do not worry about the exposure of the public key because it can never be used to get your private key, it is a one way thing. So during transaction verification the data of transaction hash is created by you and then sign with your private key, this combination is the digital signature. Then moving forward transaction data with the signature is propagated including even the public key, so the public that accompanies it is what make them confirmed that the one who actually sign this transaction is the owner Found an image that explains it bettersource",

People can use your digital signature to verify you own the private key without you need to reveal your private key.

Yes, you are right that private keys are never shared with others, but nodes verifying these signatures do not need that information anyway. To verify a piece of information referred to as a digital signature, you only need a signature itself, an address, or a public key and message. No private keys are involved in that process of verification.",

You seem to be confusing bitcoin with some crappy stable coin?Blockchains is the universal name for the system behind cryptocurrencies but each one uses a different algorithm which gives different levels of decentralization and security. There are some blockchains which are run by someone with central servers from which they can freeze transactions at will, but this cannot happen with bitcoin cause of how it is designed.- Jay -",

Here is an example of a topic that is basically covering the same thing that you had probably seen: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5204055.0Let me put it this way, did you know the banks can close your account or freeze your money? Why? Because they are centralized.It is the same with cryptocurrencies, if they are centralized they can do that and more. Sometimes they are not 100% centralized so the degree of control they have is different. In short the more centralized they are, the more control they will have over the system.As an example of a fully centralized cryptocurrency you can check out most of stablecoins like Tether aka USDT. They can freeze your coins if they wanted to.Other parts you mentioned earlier and I highlighted in your previous comment can happen in centralized altcoins, like reversing your transactions or blocks by the \"company\" like what happened in centralized shitcoin known as Ethereum.None of it can happen in bitcoin though. Simply because bitcoin is decentralized.",

If an exchange controls the keys to your assets, they can block you from withdrawing it, they can also lock you out of your assets if they get any request to do so from law enforcement agencies. Mind you that you do not control the wallet address given to you by a centralized exchange, they are the ones that control it.It is not possible for anyone to block Bitcoin addresses, if you have an address on an exchange and you were prevented from spending it, the address was not blocked per se, the 'owners of the keys' (that's the exchange) do not just want you to spend it and you can't spend Bitcoins without the valid keys; thus don't hodl your assets in exchanges, but move them into your non-custodial wallet.",
