If you have cheap electricity, then you will be successful miners. But in many European countries, contracts for the supply of electricity are terminated with miners. It is very important to find a place with cheap electricity and not be kicked out of there. And Ethereum forks are not profitable now.",

You can either hold the units to resell in the future because I'm sure these units after block halving will be more expensive or either start mining today if you have pretty cheap power and stay mining then hold and wait for block halving to resell and sell your Bitcoin to fill your pocket.",

Cause they have very big expenses. These are difficult time for miners, especially miners who have invested a lot into mining equipment running into millions of dollars. There is an increased cost for energy, an increase in demand as well, and dwindling supply. If some of these miners are not careful, they will be spending more especially on energy than getting value for what they have invested. How can miners be careful? by applying proper business risk management strategies which I believe that anyone has invested millions in mining must have taken time to understand the dangers in his investing in mining and how to control and manage situations well. The major question now is no longer about 2022, but the coming year 2023, will mining be profitable in 2023?",

But if this is the fact, then I don't think it is that much profitable nowadays. The difficulty is increasing and the total hashrate of competing for a block is also increasing so I think that is just a projection probably some marginal error.  If in 1 year's time, Asic company releases a new miner that has the double hash capacity and cheaper electrical consumption, that calculation is already in error because the hash rate will possibly be doubled and the variables used to calculate the profit will be obsolete.Quote from: tjtonmoy on December 17, 2022, 05:11:30 PMAlso, not to mention that you are competing with giant farms, who have much powerful rig than you. If they are unable to make profit to cover up their expenses, then this becomes obvious that people with personal mining farm are not doing that much well either. This isn't a problem because you can join a mining pool that can compete with any giant farms out there.Quote from: tjtonmoy on December 17, 2022, 05:11:30 PMAnd the competition becomes more and more hard as day passes by. On the other hand, if you have cheap electricity supply, then I'll say go for it. Because the main concern in mining is energy consumption. If they can find a cheaper electrical service provider then they are good to go.  Or be able to tap the force of nature that provides free electrical supply like  windmills, solar energy system then it will greatly boost the profit in the long run.Here is an excerpt from the article in NiceHash about how profitable is mining in 2022, you can change the USD value to the current price of BTC and then calculate from it (this might be outdated though since we are now entering 2023) so I decided to include a link[1] of the possible trend of mining in 2023QuoteMining in 2022A miner would earn 0.0004 BTC per day in the first 47 days of 2022. Based on the current price ($40,000) that is around $16 per day.ConclusionAs we can see from the examples above, 2021 was the most profitable in terms of fiat currency. On average a miner earned approximately $30 per day while the second most profitable year for fiat earnings up to now is 2022 with $16 per day.But looking at Bitcoin earnings, we can see that 2020 was the year that the miner would earn the most Bitcoin per day, an astonishing 0.0008 BTC. Yet the fiat earnings were low because the price of Bitcoin was low.[1] https://cryptominers.ae/will-crypto-mining-be-profitable-in-2023/",

Mining Costs:Mining requires electricity, fuel and renewable energy.If the cost of these energies increases globally, mining costs will increase much more than before in the coming years, resulting in huge losses for mining.Cryptocurrency mining will not be profitable in 2023 unless mining costs are brought down to a limit.",
