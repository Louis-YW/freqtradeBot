Have you ever felt like a gambling addict? and how much did you lose in gambling?I have been heavily addicted in 2019-2020 with slot machines.In fact I was not gambling much at that time except sport bets and it was that time that I first saw the new providers of slot machines like Play n Go and immediately fell in love with their Arthurian themed slots boasting an x100 multiplier,in the slots that I used to play before they never gave you more than x3 or x5 multiplier but they did give you huge amount of free spins up to 200.This love led me soon to addiction and it took a while to realize it and thank God that gave me a super strong self determination to quit it,I know only gamble once or twice a week and with very little amount of money compared to that time,I am healed.",

Have you ever felt like a gambling addict? and how much did you lose in gambling?Addiction is when gambling only occupy most of your time. Literally thinking gambling all the time is a sign of addiction. Losing money is not enough as reason for addiction since it’s obvious that house will always win due to house edge. The only time you can classified as a gambling addict is when you play gambling most of the time and abandoning everything.I didn’t experience this kind of addiction since I have limited funds available to gamble which makes me immediately stop whenever my gambling budget is already loss. FYI, you can still be considered as gambling addict even if you are consistently winning as long as you are always gambling without any control.",

Depending on the severity, on average, it is quite difficult for heavy addicts to stop gambling. That's why we always see advice from many people on this forum to gamble responsibly and wisely",

I didn't borrow from the bank and without money I stopped gambling for quite a long time.You had a short gambling problem caused by chasing losses. You would have become addicted if you didn't stop gambling for a while. Chasing losses is one of the popular causes of gambling addiction. Spending your savings on gambling is absurd. Your savings should be used for investment or meeting needs and not for gambling.  I am glad you have a friend who advised you against getting loans to spend on gambling. Nobody is sure of the outcome of a stake so it is relatively a game of luck. Accessing loans to finance a business or take care of a need is okay but it should never be used for gambling. We have been told every time that we need to have a gambling plan and our allocation to gambling should be what we can afford to lose.",

If someone continues a behavior that is not good or has bad consequences and cannot stop the behavior, then that person is considered out of control or addicted.And in my opinion you fall into the category of addiction but it's not serious because you can't control yourself which causes you to lose your savings and it's a good idea for you to realize this immediately, because many addicts not only spend their savings but also lose their vehicles and even their homes.And if you lose your savings because of gambling, you should be grateful because you didn't lose other important items which would actually make you suffer even more.And I personally haven't felt what it's like to be a gambling addict, and I only play on weekends with enough capital and that's if I want to, otherwise I won't gamble.",

      "body": "I've never felt addicted to anything other than food and water  because of how crucial it is in contributing to my happiness. Gambling is an activity I enjoy because it somehow funds my food and water. But, doing it so much that I'll run out of resources to gain those utilities; food and water is almost impossible. It's important to me to always watch my bankrolls while gambling. Despite the joy associated to gambling games like black roulette games. The kind of game I enjoy playing. I always keep it at a minimal. Games like Poker, are also great but most time I play with friends and family without staking any real money. Playing for the fun of it. That doesn't mean I've not lost some significant amount in gambling. Yet it doesn't feel like addiction to me, because I still feel in control. Feeling like you're addicted to gambling may have solved half of your gambling addiction problem. As it's a sign of self control. Also from the look of it, you were able to manage how you spent the money, but what doesn't sit right, is the fact you lost a 5 month savings on gambling alone. It's enough to make anyone feel addicted. Because such feelings of doing similar things often and often can be seen as addiction. But, to me, like someone may have said, you weren't addicted. Seems like you enjoyed gambling at that moment. Gambling addiction is not easily stopped. It has to do with the mental health and such players may not realize or feel like they're addicted. Some get sad when told that they're addicted to gambling. These are the symptoms of gambling addiction. Being unlucky with winning our stakes doesn't make us addicted to gambling.",

Currently I am aware and am in the stage of improving my own financial condition. Have you ever felt like a gambling addict? and how much did you lose in gambling?Even though I have been gambling for many years I don't think I am addicted to gambling. I can take a break from gambling when it's necessary or when I am on vacation or just don't have any spare time. During the times where I am not gambling I also don't really think about it and feel the urge to play again soon. Everbody has a weak moment from time to time where they don't follow their own plans. This his normal for humans and I wouldn't beat myself up over it. Of course it's tragic too lose such a large savings amount, but it's also a lesson you won't forget and will help you to not make the same mistakes again. Addictions are something different in my opinion, it's when you always think about gambling and you can't help yourself anymore. To me it just sounds like you a had a bad night and regret your actions the next day. Somebody that is hooked on gambling wouldn't reflect his actions in the same way and would rather keep gambling the next day.",

Have you ever felt like a gambling addict? and how much did you lose in gambling?I won’t consider this as an addiction; to me it just feels like you don’t know how to manage your funds when it comes to gambling and because of that you can just use any amount you like carelessly to gamble.If you come across a real case of addiction you’ll instantly know, have you ever been in a stressful situation and all you could think of was “how you can improve your winning rate” or “how to get more money to use for you gambling activities”? When one becomes addicted to something all they can think of or do with the slightest opportunity they get would be for them to do that thing and in this case gamble. I believe in your case you were able to go through a whole day or perhaps weeks without even gambling if you don’t have the money to gamble, but it will be like a torment for those that are addicted to it. Although I don’t think I have been addicted to it but I have seen those that have.",

Yes, that is something very true, but have you ever been a gambling addict? Gambling responsibly is where gambler is able to accept every risk and must also accept whatever losses they experience so that they must remain in control of themselves without any emotional feelings that can control every gambling activity they do.Regarding gambling addicts, I think here anyone who has been gambling for long time has experienced a phase that is really difficult to leave gambling for a long time and also the attitude of pursuing victory because phase like this can be said to be gambling addict.QuoteTo be honest in the past I have spent a lot of money gambling.

Have you ever felt like a gambling addict? and how much did you lose in gambling?So, from what you have experienced you can already be classified as an addict because you are willing to lose quite lot of money to play and bet in relatively consistent time.I have also experienced incidents like that and when I experienced it I felt sense of regret and disappointment so deep.If you are trying to fix everything then the small step you have to take is to try as hard as you can to set financial limits on the money you use for gambling.That way can slowly learn that control over yourself is starting to be in your hands.",

I lost so big that it affected my financial life.
