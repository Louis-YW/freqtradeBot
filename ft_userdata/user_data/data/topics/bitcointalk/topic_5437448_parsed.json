In the meantime, it would be awesome if another moderator could take care of the reported posts on the Greek board. Bitcointalk doesn't need another local section which becomes a spamfest tbh.",

Over the forum's many years, relatively \"newbie\" members with good report histories have consistently done much better as mods than veteran, well-respected members with poor report histories. That said, not all reports are equal, so a simple report count doesn't tell the whole story. Also, in addition to report histories, it's necessary to consider factors such as the ability of the candidate to be neutral, their trustworthiness, etc. It's also nice to choose a moderator who people generally already trust/respect, but sometimes this is outweighed by other factors.If a poll is created, I will not completely ignore the results, but I will also not use it as a primary influence. I'm more interested in arguments people have for or against certain candidates.Here are the top non-bad report counts for the German sections over the last 6 months, along with the German boards which those reports covered (broader coverage being better).",

If you have decent number of haters then it will continue pages after pages.This type of wish is better to express in PM to either theymos or Cyrus. Just my 2 cents.Bitcointalk have long years of history, active for three years may not be the only criteria for selecting a moderator. If there are others who are worthy to mention then you can talk to them too. All of you can work together to have the best one for your local board while we have two global moderators can help you sometimes. Increase the number of reports and let them do their work while you are working on growing some attention for the application.",

It won't be perfect of course and it would be much better if you have their own board, but if you report those posts, mods will most likely remove/merge as it is a blatant breaking of forum rules. For example, Croatian local board doesn't have own moderators for the last few years ever since Lauda was removed so now we depend on the global mod sorting our reports. Earlier today I reported spam topic in our board and it was deleted in a matter of few hours.Anyway, good luck with your request and I do hope that you get local mod appointed. We asked for the same few years ago but so far we didn't get any reply yet, maybe because our local board is pretty clean and doesn't have too much spam. I personally think that every local board should have their own mod and that role could be much more than just being a police but I guess those in charge don't agree.",
