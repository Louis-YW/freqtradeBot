I would never do this, but maybe somebody else won't care..If you collect unspent outputs coming from kyc and no-kyc sources in the same wallet, you'll either combine those outputs sooner or later, or you'll have to pay a lot of attention to coin control.",

Centralized exchanges? Government? Secondly, storing the coins in which manner? The same wallet? Do you imply that outsiders can acknowledge that you're keeping your KYC-ed and non-KYC-ed coins together?It is totally possible, and totally acceptable for all those entities are far as I'm concerned, to merge KYC-ed and non-KYC-ed together. The problem is that you're about to harm your privacy that way. For example, if you make a transaction in which you spend two outputs, one KYC-ed and one non-KYC-ed, you're making it clear to the exchange that has identified you, that the non-KYC-ed output is yours.",

I remember a post from a few months ago where one person said he used Wasabi's new and improved coinjoin but had his account blocked by Gemini I think.True; not mixing is not a solution, either, though..In my opinion: either send those funds back to the exchange, sell for fiat and buy your Bitcoin back on Bisq. That way, 'officially' you don't own any BTC anymore and you can provably show that you 'sold it all'.Second option: if you (have to) declare Bitcoin holdings anyway, for instance, simply mix those coins and you will be able to spend them without worrying about being traced through your KYC data. If you want to sell, just use Bisq.
