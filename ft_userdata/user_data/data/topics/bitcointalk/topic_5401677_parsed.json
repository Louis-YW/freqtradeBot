  "content": "Hello everybody, here is an article about position sizing, and here is its quick summary(Full Article on cleo.finance blog):Position sizing is determining the correct size of the position based on the amount of money you risk on the particular trade.Before you can do that, you need to figure out what is the maximum acceptable risk of the trade.That risk is usually expressed as a % of your balance, that you are willing to lose.To make sure you don’t lose more than this amount traders set a Stop Loss order which are the real maximum exposure of your position.If you don’t use a stop loss, you are exposing your entire portfolio!Where to put a stop loss?That’s where Technical Analysis can be handy. Majority of retail traders would look at the chart to find out – usually behind some support/resistance level or based on some volatility indicator, such as ATRRule of thumb:Risk between 1-3% of your portfolio balance on each position. This way any single individual loss won’t wipe your account and break your spirit. And more importantly, even a string of losses will leave you with enough ammunition to recoup the losses.Have a clear approach to risk:Set a risk limit for each trade, asset in general, day, week and month (you won’t risk more than X account)Determine the right position size and start smallIncrease the position size of trades slowly if your account growsLower size or switch back to paper trading if your account doesn’tTwo types of position sizing methods: Fixed and flexibleFixed position sizeUsing the same position size for every tradeGood for finding out if your strategy has an edgeMake sure you come back and reevaluate position size periodically.Flexible position sizeUsing a percentage of current balanceCluster of wins makes every following win largerCluster of losses makes every following loss smallerHow to calculate the correct position size:You need to knowTrading account sizeAcceptable risk (in % per each trade)Invalidation point (in form of a distance from the open price)The formula:Position size = Trading account size x Acceptable risk / InvalidationExample:Trading account size = $10,000Acceptable risk = 1%Invalidation point = 4% drop in market pricePosition size = $10,000 * 0,01 / 0,04 = $2,500This way you will always risk losing $100 no matter where your Stop Loss goes! If Stop Loss must be wider, say 8%, the calculation is:Position size = $10,000 * 0,01 / 0,08 = $1,250Doubling the distance to our stop loss has us reducing our position size by half to maintain the same possible loss.How to set position size in the trading platformPick a leverageAdd a Stop LossInput the market price or the distance in % of the stop lossWhichever value you enter first, that becomes the constant – element that won’t change when you edit other variables. You can select different constant by clicking the “target” iconInput the Position Size or Margin size while watching the PnL of the Stop LossIncrease or decrease the size of the position, until the PnL of the Stop Loss is at the level you want it to beThis way you can control exactly what your exposure is, while understanding all the variables involved. You can even add multiple Stop Loss orders, which can help you limit the exposure in lower conviction plays, such as new set-ups.The next article will be about Stop Losses.",

The use of leverage is the failure of many. Assuming I open a long position at $30000 with 1x and I have liquidation price of less than $1. If bitcoin get to $25000, I will increase my leverage to 2x, the liquidation will be around $12500 and I will still have rest of mind. The price to make profit will change from $30000 to around $27500. What I just know is that trading is beyond what someone can write or post, experience matters too. It is in OP that stop loss is good, but I did not even make use of stop loss, I only make use of take profit.",

You therefore probably making use of very minimal leverage like you mentioned otherwise you can't have that kind of peace. I started using low leverage because if the market is against me, I do close position opened because of fear of liquidation and later the price do correct back. I see the market moving in both side ways and low leverage can be good for bears and bulls if the market is studied very well with indicators and risk management.Quote from: palle11 on June 08, 2022, 06:57:01 PMSome other times but not all the time, the market price and direction can change against you even at low leverage. You said it about experience.I can use leverage if need be, I prefer to begin trading with 1x, if my analysis failed and the market go against me, I wait for a time for indicators to signal me to go 2x, I can do it up to 3x max. This helps the chance to gain back the money as fast as possible if the market later go in your direction taken. 3x for bitcoin, not altcoin. Using 1x is not that risky but it can result to panic too if the amount used is very high, so trade with the amount you can afford to lose.",

You said it about experience, it is very important in trading.Not all traders have this cut loss setting, some are just ok with the risk and whatever the result of their leverage, they are ready for that. For to some traders who are still not familiar how this market works, I think having a cut loss setting is not a bad thing, it can limit your losses and most probably save your capital. I do still have this cut loss level, and its working fine with me, having your own strategy is also a big thing here.",

This is done to avoid more losses and move to another trading pair again to gain more profits. So, the recent profits can cover the loss that we have in advance. But, if this is for long-term investment, especially for top coins like Bitcoin, we may not need to set a stop loss because we are not in immediate trades.Quote from: thecryptogandalf on June 07, 2022, 12:20:05 PMHow to calculate the correct position size:Will this really work on every trading strategy? When I see the trading leverage use, well, this may be interesting more, because we can gain much more profits on it, but also high risks to face. That is why more calculations, strategies, and smart decisions to take the position will be very crucial to combine.",

If you know what you are doing then it shouldn't really be a problem but if you have no idea about crypto then you could diversify by buying silly coins and so forth. I highly suggest being very careful with it, you could buy like 10 different coins and if 7 of them fails within first 5 year, then you made absolutely nothing that worths diversification, just buy btc, eth, bnb and be done with it in that case.However, if you know what you are doing then you should be doing a lot better and you could totally profit from it because you could buy 10 different ones, and even if 1 dropps, the other 9 would save you.",

Since we have to recover this loss, we need bigger invested amount so that it can happen quicker. In silent market this could work perfectly however in the market like bitcoin (/crypto as whole) this could be dangerous to leverage. The volatility can make higher losses and we might loose the position quickly but with experience this can be recovered too.
