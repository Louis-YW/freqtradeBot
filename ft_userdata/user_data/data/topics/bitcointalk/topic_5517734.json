  "content": "Hey, this is my first post on this forum. I found it the most relevant forum to share my thought, so I created an account. We are still getting closer to quantum computing, which in itself wouldn't cause much of an issue to most due to new quantum resistant encryption algorithms. The developers can swiftly fork the network - new quantum resistant addresses will appear. There is just a slight issue, what do we do with addresses which have no owners, or Nakamoto's wallets? Nobody can move the bitcoin from the weak addy to a strong quantum addy. They will be waiting till the day somebody gets access to them by breaking the old standard with quantum computing.I heard that Satoshi holds over 1M bitcoin on his wallets, he better be alive and active somehow. A theft of 1M btc would cause chaos. Well it wouldn't change how bitcoin works, but you get my point, it is no good. We can neither confiscate the bitcoin or hold it somehow (even if there is a way to do so, it would not bring any good reputation to the situation). We can't transfer the old addy format to the new one obviously. We are left with the option to wait and see whoever gets it first, China, Russia, US..?",

With quantum power they will move Satoshies funds to a secure place but those funds will no longer be in possession of Satoshi. I really don't get this here like if that's even possible? I think I have to do some research here on why this can't be possible as some answers here are very short. BTW thanks for sharing this thread link it's new to me.",

      "body": "I would think the powers that be that create quantum computing would not be dumb enough to just release an incredibly powerful new technology into the wild without regard to the consequences, and would take steps to ensure that it doesn't get into the hands of the wrong people. Because if they dont then their enemies could very well end up using it against them. Hopefully they would take steps to mitigate the possible threat to the world such radical new technology could impose. So I think it is much more likely for example that the bitcoin devs and miners would gain access to quantum computers long before any bad actors did. Therefore they will have time to secure and upgrade the bitcoin network so it is resistant to any possible quantum attacks. Keep in mind that bitcoin is by far the most powerful computer network in the world, more secure than that of any corporate or government network. Nefarious actors would be quite foolish to go after the most powerful computer network in the world when their are thousands of much easier targets to choose from.And why would you risk hacking into bitcoin network when there is a good chance you could get caught since your actions can be traced back to you on the blockchain that leaves a public record of everything you do.",

Large countries could throw all their resources into gaining access to this wallet - it's like winning the jackpot.Gaining access to this wallet with 1M BTC, but means that all these coins will be sold immediately and the market will collapse. Of course, this will create a stir on the cryptomarket and some of the \"weak hands\" will sell their bitcoin, as they do at any 1st panic. But think about it, not only ordinary citizens become bitcoin holders, but also companies, corporations, and even entire countries. They invest in bitcoin not for 1-2 years, which means that even in such situations, they will not get rid of their btc, which will keep the BTC-price at the proper level. In short, there will be no chaos, but only a \"small\" stir in the community. Which, first of all, will have more of a psychological character (theft from this wallet will undoubtedly be a shock for the BTC-community), rather than an economic one.",

My point was that there are certain bitcoins that nobody can move to a safer wallet, and there are quite a lot, enough to cause chaos and doubt. I know my btc are safe, I know I’ll move them as soon as possible, but how about wallets with no or inactive owner. It seems to me that whatever the outcome is- bitcoin takes a hit to its reputation. Letting US or whoever is the first to take over the bitcoin and move it to the new quantum resistant wallet - US essentialy controls that bitcoin - it didn’t belong to themLocking the inactive old addresses - again you are taking bitcoin from somebody, dead, inactive, in coma. It doesn’t matter.the list of solutions goes on..Also I’m quite confused to why are you comparing bitcoin to central systems. They are not alike and they do not share the same problems. We cannot just migrate the whole network, it’s a game of whoever transfers their bitcoin to safer wallets are good, but what happens with the bitcoin that has not been transferred and is sitting in old addresses?

And my answer will be always the same: Well, then these coins may be redistributed.Do you know how many Bitcoins were sold on exchanges today? According to CoinGecko, BTC worth 111 billion USD. Assuming an average price of 85000 today (we're currently close to 88k, but earlier today it was more close to 80k), then this are around 1.3 million Bitcoins that changed hands in the last 24 hours. More than Satoshi's coins!Yes, it includes wash trading and it also includes a lot of FOMO and euphoria. Normally the trading volume is lower. But also for example during the dips in July/August around 900k coins were sold (=traded) on the most volatile days.Other things to take into account:1) It is highly unlikely the entity will be able to \"crack\" all wallets at once. They will take probably years for the first one, then months for the next couple of wallets, and perhaps in some years they'll be able to crack one wallet with 50 coins per day.2) Even if they achieve this faster, it is highly unlikely the entity will sell all coins or even larger batches at once. Probably they will sell 50 coins here, 50 there, and so on, perhaps spread over years. Nothing will happen, like with the other 2009 coins that were already sold (some as later as this year).3) If a post-quantum algorithm is introduced when quantum computing becomes a real threat for ECDSA, then we can expect many first-time Bitcoiners to move their coins. Perhaps also Satoshi will be among them. We don't even know if one of the 2009 miners who already moved their coins was Satoshi.So the most likely outcome is that this will be much less of an issue than many fear.",
