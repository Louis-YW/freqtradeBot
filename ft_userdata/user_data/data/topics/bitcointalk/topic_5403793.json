Well, I'm happy to see that personally to be honest.Last month, the ASP has posted on twitter that he was holding 130 million LUNC which was around ~$70k at that moment.

I was wondering how that police officer got detected and if he was forced to admit that he owns cryptocurrencies. But based on that image, he's posting it publicly and that's why sometimes you just have to remain lowkey if you've been in a place or country where restriction is being implemented or just be actual lowkey and never published anything that might be used against you since it's a hot issue in the country.Quote from: Little Mouse on June 23, 2022, 04:09:36 PMIt's sad they have picked shitcoin instead of bitcoin.True, they're learning it the hard way by choosing those.",

The police might be faced a case or worst discharge of service for doing illegaly activities against there country law. Maybe the policeman salary in Bangladesh is not huge enough which is the reason why seek out crypto as investment.[1] https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/should-bangladesh-be-sleeping-on-crypto-daily-star-contributor",

As a matter of fact, top government officials are fully into Crypto in various anti Bitcoin/Crypto currency law enforcement nation but you wouldn't know about it. The law makers are usually the law breakers. Don't be surprised to hear that top financial institutions bosses and staff are into Crypto even the government highly revered accountants too. They fix the law, still they mess things up deceiving the citizens of their various nations.",

In our country, Police has been dominating the country with various aspects. Most of them are corrupted and we don't have anything to do. Well, I blame ourself for this, we don't have the ball to raise our voice against it (risk is to get jailed for no reason lol). They take bribe all the time.

Probably Bangladesh even in is in a worse situation than we were back then so, just investing in crypto is something minor.That being said....https://mobile.twitter.com/sagor30/QuoteThis account doesn’t existThis raises questions....",

In the end it's all about the price that you'll sell yourself for. The police chases you not because they want to uphold the law but because they want to earn money the safe way and are too stupid to be innovative. The next case that comes to mind are corrupt police officers in Venezuela raiding bitcoin mines and stealing hardware to sell it online. When laws are stupid you have a moral obligation to oppose them. Banning bitcoin is banning freedom.",

I think this police officer knows the real value of cryptocurrency so instead of supporting fiat, he chose to invest in crypto for bigger profits compared to fiat. And maybe he's a big time investor and has been doing that in the previous years as he takes no fear to invest and hold in such a very huge amount.  But yeah, too bad he never stick to bitcoin as its certainly the best crypto asset.",
