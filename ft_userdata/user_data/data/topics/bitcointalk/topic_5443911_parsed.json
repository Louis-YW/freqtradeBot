This is what you get when you try to attach value to a price of tokens by staking it for another token, once the new tokens are released it becomes a game of who is the first out of the gate, the project and the team behind it are very sound no doubt about this but will need real work to drive value back to the tokens with so many people already waiting for the price to go up and dump on the market",
