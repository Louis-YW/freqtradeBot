  "content": "I have spoken with lender who is one of the top private Banks.I got Also in good relation with banker because we spoken about markets and Investment so we shared alot Same opinion about everything as myself i have done alot reasearch about markets and finances.So i need someone who transfer to me off course from legit source becouse i go trhough background check and full kyc. So the deal is like this , you give me the 5mil EUR from that i'll transfer or cash out 2mil for you  and 3 mil EUR i use with fixed Investment scheme from the banking desk i get about monthly profit minimum of 100k from that 100k loan debt Will be payed and from that i take little % for myself to cover my living expenses and i Will give to you the rest of the money until your 5mil eur fully payed + your intrest % I accidently got into this deal but now i have to i must complete this becouse i got so good relatiokship with banker i don't want to look like time waster. So i guess the 100k monthly minimum return the loan ammount monthly payment is about 20-30k so i'll take As 10k and rest of the 60k+ Will be yours so you Will get 60k+ x with 10 months at least 600k-700k back or even more so 1 mil about one year return. The numbers could be little different but it's general estimated numbers in the worse case scenario. I know that's little different loan kind of thing what you guys use to but that's what i have.Thanks let's work together on this",
