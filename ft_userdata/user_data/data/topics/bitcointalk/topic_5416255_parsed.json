What are the mintages on these? LOT 1, I want to say 50 were made.. I can check with wheelz on that oneThey were made for a collectors/poker-pro game that was held in Vegas, June 2019Of note, Scott Blumstein, a WSOP champ, who was featured in the 2018 Topps Allen & Ginter set was there There were also a run of Polymerbit notes made for this event. plus the winners of the poker game got got an additional Polymerbit note corresponding to their winning position (1st-4th)LOT 2, I think only a few... ClayCast gave these as a thank you/gift in certain orders.Other than this one up for auction, have seen 2x others: 1x LTC and 1x BTC",
