If they’re looking for cheap investments, they can go for altcoins, but Bitcoin’s system and progress should never be changed just to make it more affordable.Also, calling Bitcoin \"expensive\" isn’t the right way to look at it. Unlike a physical product with production costs and a set selling price, Bitcoin's price is purely driven by demand. Even if you see it as expensive, there are still investors buying at the current price, and they’re not stupid. They do it because they believe it will still be profitable in the long run, knowing that Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise over time.",

The rise I price of bitcoin was created by the forces of demand and supply and follows such natural law of when demand exceeds supply, the price will rice and vice versa. For bitcoin having a fixed supply and an increasing demands, how do we force the price to go down without creating excess supply? This will truly beat the laws of economics. Maybe you missed buying low, the reason you are suggesting the price come down so you can buy some at lower prices",

To make it affordable? That only means it's already dooms day for a coin. And you tell devaluation for massive adoption? That's not for adoption anymore, people should stay away for a coin that was dropped 80%, it can be considered dead anyway.",

And this is one of the worst advise that I heard, sorry OP, reduce to 80%? Just think of other assets as well, if that happens, let's say some blue chip stocks goes down to 80% so that it will be affordable to the masses. It doesn't make sense. And you can accumulation it with just small sats and that is the essence because not everyone can have 1 full Bitcoin in their wallet.",

The more time is exhausting is the more the price of Bitcoin appreciates that is to say... The amount of Bitcoin fraction (Satoshi) you can buy in a Bear, Dip or Bull season in this season with a minimum amount of money will be more than the value of holds to wait til up and upper season of same market season to come.Many had made this delaying mistakes to had invested in Bitcoin earlier than they do and that caused them certain discouragement to further because the price of Bitcoin gone higher than when they had the opportunity to buy earlier.But today, they are happy investors and their late coming to invest on Bitcoin has no been no more a nightmare for them because they are making profits no matter the higher increase of Bitcoin value to when they bought.This can be applicable to even the future investors.",

If a future Bitcoin is like what you want, its value is lower and there will be less people who have interest in Bitcoin investment. It won't help to increase Bitcoin adoption and trading volume, then price will be affected and dumped.There are thousand altcoins that are cheap but intelligent investors don't want to invest money in those altcoins. Bitcoin does not need to become those useless altcoins by any devaluation proposal.",

If you have that kind of mentality, the mentality of fear and wishful thinking, you will never be a successful investor.

Of course, it's good to have that kind of Bitcoin but not many of us can do that as most of us here are just average joe investors.So it really depends on how much we can accumulate and it's not that the price should go down as low as what the OP wanted to see.

Let it not be as if there is no hope for us that are new to the ecosystem.It sounds like you regret not buying Bitcoin earlier. However, the idea that Bitcoin's price could be deliberately reduced by 80% to make it more affordable is purely wishful thinking. Markets don’t function that way.Bitcoin, like any other asset, is priced based on supply and demand. Its value is determined by market participants—buyers and sellers—rather than some central authority that can arbitrarily lower its price. If Bitcoin were to drop significantly, it would likely be due to market forces, not a coordinated decision to make it cheaper for new investors.Moreover, the notion of warning all holders in advance so they can sell before a price drop contradicts how financial markets work. If such an announcement were possible, panic selling would likely drive the price down even further, creating extreme volatility.While Bitcoin's price may seem high, you don’t need to buy an entire BTC, you can acquire small fractions (satoshis) over time. Many investors dollar-cost average (DCA) by gradually accumulating Bitcoin rather than waiting for an unlikely massive price drop.If you're interested in Bitcoin, it's better to focus on understanding how it works and adopting a long-term perspective rather than hoping for artificially lower prices.",

First of all, you have to understand that Bitcoin is not like your currency that government and central banks have authority to decide on what happens to it. There is no central authority that regulates Bitcoin price in the first place so how do you think devaluation would take place? Absolutely, no individual or authority has power to slash bitcoin price to make it affordable for people.Moreover, even if you make Bitcoin free to accumulate some people will still miss out giving some excuses. And again, you don't need to own a complete bitcoin, with the little money you have you can accumulate as little as you can afford until you get a satisfactory portion.
