I found instructions somewhere but the link (example: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;sa=recent;boards=52;limit=10) led to this: https://pasteboard.co/ukMa2LnrAkwQ.png What do I need to do to gain access? I would like to be able to write a Discord bot to automatically post new posts in a certain topic. Thanks!",
