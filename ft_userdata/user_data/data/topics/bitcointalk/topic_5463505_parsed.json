It will be even better if you can give much better services than other gambling sites so your domain name wont be something that make people worry to be your customers.  If it is similar then they are synonymous. And there will be slide different in the name but whereby the domain names are the same then it is not good again. And if the domains are the same, the second one can not host the site because the website hosting company will detect the first existing one and ask the second company to change the domain name. So since the domain was successfully hosted then there must be differents in the name. Yes your point is also good. If the first was not doing well, then it will affect the second one because people might think that it is the first casino that has changed name to deceive them. So it is bad. And also the content of the casino is also matters. And the service it render.",
