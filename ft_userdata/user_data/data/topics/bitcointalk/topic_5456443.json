  "content": "QuoteIn an interview with Bloomberg on June 13, Michael Saylor, the founder and chairman of Microstrategy, delved into the recent crackdown on exchanges. Saylor emphasized that Microstrategy has held the belief since 2020 that bitcoin (BTC) stands alone as the “only institutional grade investable asset in the crypto space.” He underlined the fact that BTC is widely recognized as a digital commodity on a global scale, and he speculated that regulators do not envision a promising future for other cryptocurrenciesQuote...the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a bitcoin-focused industry with maybe a half a dozen to a dozen other proof-of-work tokens.”This resounding assurance comes at a time when the SEC regulators has found Binance and some other exchanges including most stablecoins, crypto securities and tokens, liable to have contravened some laws or have not met up to a certain specific standard, which BTC holds. The talk of how crypto currencies would perform following the case against Binance, has been in talks and the fear we all had at the back of our mind is, could this be the beginning of the end of cryptocurrencies?I mean, a majority of the worlds population knew Bitcoin first before other coins started coming up, if such event like the regulators are imposing, takes a toll on Binance;*What happens to the coins of those who invested in BTC and other coins in the exchange? *What becomes of the crypto market?*How would other sectors like forex or stocks be impacted?This vote of confidence by  Michael Saylor, the founder and chairman of Microstrategy, more than soothes the frayed nerves of investors and traders who have and HoDL  BTC as their asset or security as it is being tagged.There is no fear of anyone losing their BTC or entertaining the idea that Bitcoin is dying/crashing anytime soon, as it authentic and committed to its vision of the future.Let's Discuss!https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategys-saylor-envisions-bitcoin-only-future-for-crypto-industry-as-us-regulators-hammer-the-sector/",

If anything bad like Binance US. failed in the lawsuit, only the branch will be affected. In addition, it is to restrict Binance US. operators but not to destroy Binance US.' users and their funds. At the end, Binance US.' users will be able to withdraw and receive their funds.Quote*What becomes of the crypto market?Not good but the market will recover eventually.Quote*How would other sectors like forex or stocks be impacted?If it is about Binance US., it won't impact Forex and Stocks markets. They are older markets and have more and clearer regulations already. Cryptocurrency market is younger and it is more sensitive to new regulations which are unpredictable.",

It's a no-brainer.It's true that Binance is one of the biggest exchanges, it is also not the only exchange facing the back fire from the SEC regulators as kraken is lined up too. My point of view is from an angle that subjects the customers/users patience and trust to constant test. What happened to FTX more than helped in reducing the influx of new users to the crypto world, with Binance, kraken in the news, prospective new users may be faced with a double mindset and may even give up the thoughts of investing in crypto.",

I’m not against Michael Saylor but we knew that he is heavily invested on Bitcoin which means he has a self interest(clearly to make a profit).We need to hold on the fundamentals on Bitcoin and assured with that. Not because some hot guy or billionaire reassure us that everything is fine. Saylor might be pro crypto today but what if he sold in future and switch side? Then most of his believer will be converted too unlike if we are looking on the Bitcoin feature itself. Exchange come and go in crypto. Even with Binance closure, There will be new exchange that will dominate the crypto market.",

See for yourself.Binance.us today trading volume = $40 mln Binance.com today spot trading volume = $9 000 mlnbinance.com futures trading volume = $46 000 mln so binance.us is not even a 1% of binance. Binance.us is even 4x smaller than pancakeswap (dex on binance smart chain)",

If you are holding BTC, you have to know that Binance isn't BTC's bank, and that the BTC network is decentralized, events that affect Binance and other crypto services can only create a temporary plunge in price, but BTC is too useful to fail because of the collapse of any exchange.",

More importantly, a robust system and network that is perceived as dependent on a centralized exchange such as Binance. To further support Bitcoin resiliencies, Any user should try to explore another decentralized solution such as a decentralized exchange. Within the Bitcoin space, we have known the prominent DEX like Bisq.The essential thing is just because Binance got difficulties it does not mean they will indirectly reduce Bitcoin's dominance. Bitcoin does not dependant on such a thing.",

      "body": "What is the SEC doing? (rhetorical, perhaps). busting the bubbles of some centralized exchanges that they think violate some rules. But wait, when Bitcoin started, buy/sell transactions were mainly via P2P transactions; then, the SEC did not worry about anything like CEX, so now there are too many CEX and a lot of problems for themselves, and I don't see those problems putting an end to Bitcoin. But rather can eliminate some investors who chose to be ignorant of their privacy. What surprises me now is that despite what is happening, some people are not really even aware that Binance has been charged by SEC, but yet, those users are heavily loading up coins on their accounts. They are not heeding to the warning, \"Never store coins on CEX.\"If you ask me, I would say that Bitcoin is here to stay.",
