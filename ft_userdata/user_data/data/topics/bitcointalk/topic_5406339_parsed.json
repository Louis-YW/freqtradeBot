We have invited Aaron, the product developer from Sealem Lab, to answer our questions.Don't miss this event if you are interested in Sealem.You are welcome to invite your friends to join the community.Please consciously abide by the community rules, don't post irrelevant content, $SR worth 500 USD is waiting for you to get during the AMA! Fomoin：Before the AMA begins, please allow me to show you the introduction video of Sealem Bond https://youtu.be/aSFLzr7iadk Fomoin：Next，please enjoy the GameFi video by Sealem Lab. https://youtu.be/irETfd_S-LM Fomoin:：Wow！ Amazing！We can see that Sealem Lab's products are very excellent！And let's wlecome the guest today Aaron Aaron:：Hello, i'm Aaron. Please allow me to introduce myself first. I'm from Khalifa University of Science and Technology and before working in Crypto industry, I focused on socioeconomics.In 2017, with the introduction of a friend, I attended the Blockchain Fintech Summit Of Silicon Valley.Since then, I have understood and recognized this special economic system.At the end of 2020, I founded Sealem Lab with my good friend Osman. Our goal is to build a new financial platform based on Web3. Fomoin： Thank you for your introduction.I believe that under the current economic depression, a safe and stable financial product is what everyone needs.Everyone must be very curious about Sealem Lab, so let's start today's AMA.Today's AMA also collected a lot of questions from Twitter. We will have a free question and answer session later. Fomoin：First question, can you introduce Sealem Lab in detail?  Aaron：The Sealem platform creates a new generation of DeFi + Gamefi protocol and ecosystem that will interoperate to maximize returns while minimizing risk to users.The DeFi part also became Sealem Finance, a product built by my hand, which includes bonds and staking.GameFi part is built by our game team. Different from P2E products on the market, Sealem GameFi creates ultra-high-quality chain games with rich gameplay, which can be seen from our CG.And in order to reduce the bubble, the game has increased the game between players, so that the entire economic system of Sealem is in a healthy ecological environment. Fomoin：Let’s take a look at the DeFi part first, can you introduce Bond and staking? Aaron：Let's talk about Bond first. Each bond period is 14 days, and 1,000,000 $ST LPs are sold in one period.During these 14 days, users can buy bonds with $BUSD or $ST, so you have a Sealem Bond with a vesting period of 14 days.After 14 days, you will get $ST with the same value as the profit and principal, and you can sell it at any time, buy the next period bond or stake it.Stake part is the same as other noramal DeFi.I believe that I don’t need to explain too much.Users stake $ST to obtain $SR income. When you withdraw the principal, you need to pay taxes.The taxes and fees depend on the time of staking.Staking for 299 days to reach the minimum tax rate of 0.1%. Fomoin：What factors determine the interest rate on a Bond? Aaron:：The interest rate of the bond mainly consists of three parts: base rate + liquidity pool rate +  additional invitation rate.The base interest rate is 3%; when $ST’s liquidity pool increases USD 10,000, the interest rate increases by 0.01%; the invitation is divided into invitation to buy bonds and invitation to stake, when the invitee buys USD 1,000 Bond, the inviter’s interest rate increases by 0.1 %.When the invitee stakes USD 1,000 worth of $ST, the bond interest rate of the inviter and the invitee increases by 0.1%. But be aware that everyone gets up to 30% interest. Fomoin：Can you simply give us an example? Aaron：Now the liquidity pool of $ST token has a total of $3,000,000.If you invite your friends to buy bonds worth $10,000, and you also buy bonds worth $10,000.Then your interest rate for this period is 3%+3%+1%=7%, and you need to pay a 2% purchase tax, so you have a total of $9,800 worth of bonds. After 14 days, you will get $ST worth 9800*107%=$10486. Fomoin：That's awesome!Please tell us briefly why Sealem Lab chose to go public under the current market conditions. Aaron：Web3 is becoming more and more mature, and the entire Crypto is currently in a recession.It is time to put aside all FOMO emotions and make good projects.I believe that people are now waiting for a financial product like Sealem Lab to help users grow their assets stably even in a bear market.We are also very confident to use our successful economic model to allow users to allocate assets in Sealem Lab without worry. Fomoin：What are the advantages of Sealme Lab in terms of DeFi?Aaron：Sealem Finance doesn't  have a super high apy like other scam projects. Our features are: low risk, safe funds, stable income, and never loss. First of all, our bond vesting period is only 14 days, which is a very short bond, which can help you reduce a lot of risk;secondly, all our LP Token will be destroyed, which means that Sealem Team can't withdraw the liquidity pool of ST by themselves,it guarantees the security of the capital pool to a large extent;third, the unique interest rate setting can keep your assets rising steadily; finally, because we use the USD standard system for calculating income and principal,so the user will never lose principal in Bond,and the income obtained by Sealem Lab in other fields will be used as a guarantee for the user to repay the principal and interest. Fomoin：That's great, I need such a safe and stable financial product. When will the IDO of the project go live?Aaron：The total IDO amount of Sealem Token are 2,500,000 ,the price is $0.4, and will be sold on multiple partnership platfroms and offical Twitter on June 28.You can also participate in the Twitter campaign to get $ST Airdrops benefits. Fomoin：Ok, thanks a lot, let's take a look at the GameFi part of the project.Aaron：Before entering the blockchain industry, Sealem's predecessor was a well-known game publishing company, which released a total of 21 games on the Steam platformSo this time the game is also the main product we brought into the crypto industry,because Sealem Team agrees that all GameFi products on the market are of poor quality and have a bad economic model, which has caused most players' assets to shrink.But Sealem GameFi will use high quality games and a successful economic model to allow players to enjoy the true P2E. Fomoin：Can you talk something about Sealem NFT?Aaron：Sealem NFT currently corresponds to the equipment of the hero in the game Sacred Realm, I will show this in the follow-up AMA, and our game is expected to be launched in late July. Fomoin：Ok, thank you very much Aaron,This concludes tonight's AMA。",
