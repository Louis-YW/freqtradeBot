It's a service industry so I'd love to be able to send them a payment link that would work but I can't find anything thst really works like that.Could I get a wallet I use just for that? Where I can leave the payment QR code in the email and people can scan it if they choose to pay via Bitcoin?",

Otherwise, I think OpenNode is the way to go since you don't seem interested in accepting other cryptos.",

      "body": "This is a good adoption, first where are you located? For sure there’s already a local wallet where you can generate QR code and start accepting BTC as mode of payment. In my place we already have this option, and the wallet is very easy and convenient to use. Though you can also use QR code in your exchange wallet or other apps, just be mindful with the fees and for sure the buyer will not be willing to should the fees for you.",

      "body": "You can also just simply generate a QR code with the Electrum wallet where your customers will pay for your service. You simply go to view>show addresses>addresses tab>right click any address where you want to receive the payment> and then click details>Look for small QR code and click it>then save it.Now simply send the QR code .png you generate recently to your customer email and ask for payment. But if you want to start to make a marketplace website I suggest you try the WordPress Woocommerce with Btcpayserver it is easy to set up you can follow these two video guides on how to install it.- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT2K8It3S3o- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QcTWHRKZag",

But a piece of advice, instead of sending an image of a QR code only, why not send them also your BTC address so that it is easy for them to copy and paste it to their wallet? There are a lot of process in Youtube regarding this, probably it is also good if you will find your own research.",

There's also the idea that if you want the payment to you in BTC but want to automatically convert it into fiat, there are third-party wallets/services that you can use like bitpay but there are also other services like it that provides and offers the same feature.",
