  "content": "Binance's CEO said that industry players and regulators need to come together to bring transparency in the crypto space.As the FTX crisis unravelled over the last week, the demand for regulatory clarity and proper crypto framework has soared recently. Head of crypto exchange Binance – Changpeng “CZ” Zhao – said that the firm has spearheaded efforts with other industry players in establishing a global standard for digital assets.Zhao has recently engaged in a public feud with FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried triggering the chain of events that led to the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. The collapse of giants like FTX has completely shaken the crypto industry. It also eroded more than $200 billion from the crypto market in a week’s time. Speaking at a conference in Bali, Zhao said:“As an industry, we need to increase transparency. We need to work very closely with regulators all around the world to make this industry more robust. There is a strong role for regulators to play but we can’t blame this on any single party”.The Binance chief also mentioned that Indonesia’s tax regime isn’t optimal and that licenses should be available more easily. He further argued that the “industry is still growing, we are still building”.The FTX collapse has caught the attention of U.S. lawmakers. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that the FTX fall uncovers fragility in the crypto space. However, Coinbase chief Brian Armstrong slammed the SEC adding that the lack of regulatory clarity is causing more pain.(Source: Coingape)",

They need to come up with strict regulation to scrutinize exchange and all crypto holding companies to maintain transparency in their day-to-day transactions and set high standards of business to avoid such incidents in future.",

The trust system that only blockchain can guarantee is the way it has been built but unfortunately, some ideology for more wide coverage has make the system almost not rely on blockchain as first source of evidence in transaction but the exchange was brought to play this part instead of blockchain. Trading is the point again that is giving exchange the relevance but the trust is becoming issue with exchange.",

      "body": "Funny to hear that from the CEO of an exchange that allows some absolutely degenerate leverages like x100 or x150, which is one of the big reasons why it's not on good terms with the US regulators. Shady shitcoins and tokens, \"high yield\" investment opportunities, projects that spend 100 times more on marketing than on development are bread and butter of exchanges like Binance, because they take their cut in trading and listing fees. It's not sustainable, because you can't scam people forever, but Binance is not demonstrating with their actions that they want to be a legitimate and sustainable business.",

A great leverage use by CZ to promote their ideals and plans without telling the world about it. FTX could have been great, but its head honchos never bothered thinking twice before making any important decisions.Although Binance is not totally pure from certain crypto transaction irregularities but it has proved to be one of the well-managed exchange firms in recent times. When some exchanges and crypto related firms were sacking workers Binance was employing more staff because of its ability to manage funds. The firm spends less on advertisement more than other exchanges. I would agree to some extent that lack of standard practice or regulation of the shitcoins space have really led to diverse challenges in the crytospace because most of them are fraudulent and mismanaged. Therefore, the government in partnership with some exchange firms can come up with some standards that would ensure that these crypto firms are guided by rules and regulations that would make them adopt best practices in their business transactions. This might reduce their manipulations and sharp practices. But decentralized platforms should be given the freedom to carryout their operations without government regulations because they have never been a challenge to the bitcoin industry.",

However, it would take the cooperation of other stakeholders to successfully implement what they have in mind. It may take time but if they will push thru such changes, they may see their fruits of their labor.They have their financial capabilities right now, and they have the respect of people, so they should strike while the iron is hot.",

As the world's largest centralized exchange, Binance is essentially restricted by the policies of various countries. Binance accepts supervision and specifies industry standards, and increasing transparency is the only option. But the essence of the encrypted world is decentralization. Without this line of defense, the encrypted world will collapse. Maybe the blockchain will continue to go on, but this application in the financial field will lose its meaning.",
