  "content": "Bitcoin Lightning Network to be deployed for fiat transfers between the UK, Europe, and African countries.Coin Corner and Bitnobi have launched a new application, Send Globally, which enables transfers between British Pounds $GBP or Euros $EUR and $NGN, $KES, and $GHS, currencies of Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana.Bitcoin Lightning Network is a Bitcoin’s second-layer solution that allows off-chain computations for fast and cost-efficient transactions.The transactions are automatically converted into BTC and the selected local currency when deposited into the receiver’s bank account or wallet.With the Lightning Network users will be able to avoid high costs and fees. In the last year, 14.1% of global remittance payments were allocated to the Sub-Saharan African region.",

Yes, the fees might be less than other remittance services for international money transfers, but like #pooya87 said.... they are still using a centralized service to do those transfers.  What are stopping them to use their own Lightning hub and doing the transfers without any centralized service? Yes, it is convenient and easier to do, but they still rely on a centralized service. (Rule #1 : Control your own Private keys)",

I understand that people are making things to be centralized and making money from it, but the lightning network is not centralized, just that fiat is centralized right from the beginning it was created and this innovation does not affect bitcoin as it remains decentralized.Maybe for small fiat amounts but for larger amounts I don't think it is actually cheap because of all the intermediary fees.Let's say you wanted to transfer $50,000 abroad and decided to use bitcoin.You first have to wire that money to a centralized exchange that could cost from $10 to $100.Then you have to buy bitcoin with it and with a 0.2% fee you'll have to pay $100.Then you have to withdraw those bitcoins and pay something like 0.0005BTC (~$8.5) which some exchanges charge.Then the receiver has to do all that in reverse to convert the bitcoins to fiat meaning they have to pay 0.2% trading fee or about $100 to convert bitcoin to fiat.Then they have to withdraw the fiat to their bank and pay another bank transfer fee another $10 to $100!I also assumed the price is fixed otherwise some platforms have a big spread and you buy bitcoin at a higher price that you sell it.This is why correct way is to only stick to bitcoin. If you wanted to send $50,000 worth of bitcoin that is 2.969BTC you can send that with about 0.00000200BTC fee and that's it!",

That is a very good idea and it shows how bitcoin development has helped in this world more than expect. Blockchain helped in several fields, now it is lightning network.Thanks for confirming this, mate. Other than we can save a lot of fees, I am also thinking that this is a great way to force someone to use a bitcoin because they expect you will only send them money in their own local currencies but they didn't know that it will be automatically converted into bitcoins.We should only contact them and educate them further on how they can convert this btc if ever they want to but it will be better if they keep a portion of it, into a wallet that they fully control. I just hope that more currencies are going to be supported by this app and then more cryptos as well, not just bitcoin but it's great that they highlighted the lightning network first. This should help it to become popular again.",
