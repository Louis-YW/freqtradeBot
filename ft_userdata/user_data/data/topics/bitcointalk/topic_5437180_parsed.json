So what do we all think about thisThe public has been aware of the recent FTX insolvency and its contagion effect, most of the country haven't got rigid regulations in regard to ruling out cryptocurrency or tokens, especially a stablecoin. The whole thing is a pushy move, especially, the tone that the article narrated. The world doesn't need many useless tokens or cryptocurrencies that currently existed, even select the major ones. They won't get behind simply because of it, do you even know what is the cryptocurrency market cap compared to others markets?",

Therefore traditional banks will still exist to continue to monitor real finances and control the economy directly. But the government will also add another option, namely by building a digital bank with the same goal. In other words, CBDC is the most appropriate option for monitoring the movement of cross-border transactions.In conclusion the government will always move before you say this here. Make no mistake they know how to control potentially distracting finances.",

Crypto banks are providing both crypto related, fiat pegged coins and fiat related banking services. They have interest bearing wallets, physical cards and the fees are getting competitive too. When you have cheaper fees and better interest and could deposit and withdraw on both crypto and fiat anywhere anytime, you'd use it. Crypto adoption is something that's not spreading as quick as we thought but that could be due to the old coins which are highly volatile. Newer, quicker and cheaper coins would be the pioneer to a cashless and non-custodial finance of the future.",

A complete decentralization in finance is not possible because there is a human element and humans make mistakes. There will always some illiterate people who can't use tech well enough and that's why they will always need the help of a centralized authority.

So what do we all think about thisArticle: https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-banks-are-going-to-swallow-fiat-banks-in-3-years-or-even-lessWell, I absolutely agree that banks will either have to adapt or they will be left behind. Technology can't be stopped and life will continue to change. Those who continue to exist on the old terms will lose.I don't think that crypto banks will replace the traditional ones. Most likely, traditional banks will be reformatted for crypto banks, because they have more resources and opportunities, although they will be reluctant to do so. Such organizations especially dislike change, which will be clumsy and slow.I don't like the idea of crypto banks and I think that with crypto currencies, this is completely unnecessary for users. But to my regret, I expect that banks will still exist, and worse than that, they will have their own depositors. There will always be people who are ready to trust their money to others because they are not able to manage their finances.",
