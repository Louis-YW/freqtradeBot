Although, in this contest there are 3 wishes, which contestants can use to help solve the puzzle. Not that it would help solve the puzzle, but contestants could use one wish and vote to reveal the public address of the canvases, which would reveal the Grand Prize total   The upside of doing this, besides learning the Grand Prize total, is that maybe some extra BTCits get added to the Grand Prize by anonymous onlookers?  Hey, it's a first of it's kind concept and contest, so don't think I'm not going to make it special! Currently there is a welcome raffle which is free for all contestants, almost full right here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410154.0Few entry spots remain! Thanks again for your interest!",

Huh. I guess I misunderstood. I was under the impression that it could be solved with one canvas print alone and no clues, other pics, or other canvases. I thought it started when I purchased mine? I will continue to try to solve it, but historically I'm not great at this type of thing, just glad to have the canvas anyway. Geo",

GeoHey Geo   you are correct buddy, you only need (1) Entry / Limited Edition Canvas to win, however, I will reveal one CLUE to help solve the puzzle when we kick the contest off.

I greatly appreciate the compliment!I really am proud of the concept and would love to see other makers enter this new genre of loaded crypto collectibles with their own unique releases. I definitely have plans to try some cool stuff I've thought about making with the concept! The contest is definitely well thought out and planned , what I'm lacking is marketing skills i guess!  I thought for sure a 21 piece limited edition \"first of its kind loaded canvas\" would be an easy sell out, turns out the \"CONTEST\" part may be the best deterrent for making that not happen LOL, as I suspect with everything we all have going on IRL some people feel they don't have the time. Maybe I'm wrong? Would appreciate any insight guys! In any case, I am eternally grateful for all the support I've received on this project, I honestly can't thank you all enough everyone! We have a few entry spots still available! Thanks again!",
