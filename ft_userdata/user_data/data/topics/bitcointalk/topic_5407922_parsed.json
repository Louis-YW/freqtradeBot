  "content": "Since 1998, the US and Russia have successfully collaborated on the ISS along with other partners. However, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ties have deteriorated, and Russia had already threatened to abandon the project as a result of Western sanctions. According to NASA, no official notification of Russia's intention to leave the program has yet been received.The International Space Station (ISS), a joint venture of five space organizations, has been orbiting the planet since 1998 and has been the site of hundreds of scientific investigations. The US wants to prolong it for a further six years with the support of all partners even though it has been given permission to run until 2024.With the two nations striking an agreement earlier this month to allow Russian cosmonauts to travel to the station on US spacecraft and vice versa, cooperation on the ISS between Russia and the US had appeared to be relatively unaffected by the war in Ukraine.However, other areas of Russian and Western cooperation have been harmed by the conflict in Ukraine. The European Space Agency (ESA) and Roskosmos no longer work together to launch rovers to Mars, and Russian Soyuz flights from an ESA launch pad in French Guiana have been suspended.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62308069.ampIf Russia eventually pulls out of the International Space Station, What would be the implications of this decision for the ISS's future and world economy?",

      "body": "Russia may be making decisions from what it seems forced into doing though and mentioning things like this might make them more likely to pull out (on a general stance). It's nice if politics can stay out of science for as long as possible too as it has little place there. The advancement of research/missions isn't worth hindering - I don't think it benefits anyone doing that.",

The sanctions against Russia have backfired, and Russia has become rich enough to do it all alone, now. After all, that was her goal with her part of the ISS in the beginning. But Stalin's sins caught up with her - what goes around comes around. She didn't have the strength to do it alone until a reasonably good guy came into rule over Russia... Putin.",
