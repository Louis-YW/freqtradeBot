Wicket of Vijay Shankar can change a lot of things here.Gujrat titans won the match by 5 wickets. I would call this a comprehensive win by them. MS Dhoni and team need to see how things can be improved in the future. Even though Ruturaj Gaikwad scored 92 runs and Chennai Super Kings Â made 176 runs which they should have defended in the first place. Gujrat titans played well as a unit and Shubman Gill scored 63 runs making partnerships at the top which set the platform for the batsmen to follow.Tomorrow there will be a double header where Punjab Kings take on KKR while Lucknow Super Giants will take on Delhi Capitals later in the day at Lucknow.",

The growth of Gujarat Titans in the IPL this year has been exciting to see. The main drivers of their success have been their dependable play and on field experience. Chennai uneven play on the other hand has worried its supporters. Ruturaj received some assistance from the batting side but the team was unable to take advantage of it. Shubman Gill outstanding performnce made it easy for his team to win. It will be wonderful to see how the rest of the season plays out and whether the Gujarat Titans can keep up their lead in the points standing.",

Every batsman in the top order is able to perform well. Because the performance of Kolkata bowlers is not good enough. Umesh Yadav can bowl with some control but I don't see better performance from any other bowlers. Bowling like this, I think Punjab will collect like 210 today. If Punjab provides more than 200 targets, it will be much more difficult for Kolkata to win this match. Kolkata's lineup doesn't seem too strong either.",

Yes, some people do not bet, but not knowing IPL in the cricketing world is really strange.The 2nd match of the IPL has ended in favor of Punjab Kings ad they won by seven runs through DLS. I would say it was tough luck for Kolkata Knight Riders. The rain ruin any chances for KKR team to come back in the match although they were struggling when the rain came down.

Kolkata would have been able to win this match if they got a chance to play the full 20 overs. Because Sunil Narine and Shardul Thakur were at the crease. Narine is quite a good batsman. However, I was not satisfied with Kolkata's performance in today's match. Their bowling was uncontrollable. The Kolkata squad is not strong enough. And if Kolkata perform like this in their upcoming matches, this team will be at the bottom of the table.",
