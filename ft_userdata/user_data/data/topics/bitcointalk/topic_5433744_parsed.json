I guess you can but have we asked ourselves how they get into that position? Maybe they are skillful enough to have a good win rate but I think most of them spend lot of time and spend a lot of money before they made it this far. Would really be a good thing if someone in here really make a living into sports betting and what can he/she advice.",

People have really gone into gambling because of lack of jobs and some have been successfully cashing out heavily from it especially on soccer on a daily basis.Quote from: Maslate on January 10, 2023, 11:54:02 AMCan they share some inputs on how to be successful like them?Do not wait for people to tell you exactly how they make their money because if you are waiting for that you might have been wasting your time yourself. People will give you clue and not exactly how they are making their money after all you are not their family member. The clue is yes it is possible.Quote from: Maslate on January 10, 2023, 11:54:02 AMI hope they will share so we will know if it's really possible. I know that people are cashing out in soccer betting and doing it as daily business. One strategy I have heard is to bet on few games or 1 or 2 games and they bet hugely on it to increase the potential winning. Also some rely on betting numerous game but they cash out at a particular time that they have a reasonable cash out.",

If you want to gambling responsibly, use the amount of money you can afford to lose and the amount shluld not be above it.If you want to be gambling for a living, you will use more amount, remember that as you can win you can lose, but you have more chance to lose, it is called house hedge.Quote from: bittraffic on January 10, 2023, 12:12:37 PMYou have to be very good at it so that you can accurately predict the likelihood of a match outcome.

You may have a winning streak but in the long run, you will have a losing streak as well and eventually lose some money in the process. Unless you are doing \"arbitrage betting\" which i have not tried myself as this is a complicated thing, sports betting is just for us to win some money if we are lucky and enjoy the sports that we are betting.",

It's 52.4% win percentage you're decent, around 55% you're doing great, around 60% over a decent sample you're a sports betting god.Â  But here's the thing, to make a living out of sports betting, you gotta have a large enough bankroll.Â  That's why when somebody asks they want to make 100k in betting sports in a year, how do they do it?Â  The answer is they should have a 100k bankroll to win 100k.Â  Â  And by bankroll, it's the money used just for betting.Â  If anybody wants to bet sports or play poker for a living, you gotta have at least 6 months worth of living expenses in your bank account separated from your bankroll.",

I do think that in sports betting the slogan house always wins is not true because the results of wins or losses that punters get really depend on the results of the match and the punters' ability to analyze a match and the luck factor doesn't really play a role just a little.Don't know if there are members here who can really make a living from betting on sports betting, but I've seen several bettors who share the winnings of their bets and it's worth quite a lot in my opinion because they also use big money to bet. The amount he won could cover a year or more of living expenses if he lived in a developing country but it might only be enough to cover a few months' living expenses if he lived in a developed country.So I think there are people who can indeed make a living from sports betting but that person must also have other activities that generate income and not just depend on one income.",

I mean, as the saying goes, casinos always win because they have the advantage, so how come people are making a living in sports betting? One thing you should know: gambling is high risk, despite the fact that some people you know make their living, in sports betting, I would bet the percentage of such people is small, maybe 1%, if at all.I already know many friends who are involved in gambling, they spend their time in the world of gambling for 24 hours, without working, the fact is I don't see them being able to cover the needs of their families, what happens is fights in the household, so why do they keep on gambling if this happens, the biggest factor is addiction and lazy work, hoping to get big wins.To be honest, I've made a lot of bets in sports betting, you really can't bet 100% accurately with the guesses or teams you bet on, sports are competitive, situations and conditions will determine wins and losses, even though the team or player is the strongest player & team in the world, the fact is that in the 2022 world cup, many bettors lose because of the team they are defending, what is the story if what happens like this can be said to make a living.Sports gamblers, if you hear anything on the internet they can make a living in sports betting, it's all illusion and fairy tales, If someone says something to me, for sure I will hear with my shoulder, not with my ears.",

Like what most have mentioned, it can be really difficult making gambling as your main source of income due to its nature being unpredictable and unstable. Unlike getting a job where it pays you monthly, gambling totally relies on your partial skill + luck for you to profit. You may earn huge amounts of winnings in a day but you may also lose large amounts if your luck is not on your side.If you plan on making sports betting as a source of income, make sure that you have a contingency plan in the event that it fails. Rather than depending on gambling as your main source of income, you may also want to venture into business, etc.",
