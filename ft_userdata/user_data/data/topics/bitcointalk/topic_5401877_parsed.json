  "content": "I’ve always been a pretty big supporter of the THORCHAIN ecosystem, and THORstarter really is the star of the show rn imo, so hear me out on this one, it has a lot of potential.IDOs have never had this much potential with THORstarter and THORstarter Forge.Forge is a major upgrade that has recently been implemented on THORstarter, it’s aim is to combine several products and features of Thorstarter IDOs, yield generation, and LP-ing, all without inflating the circulating supply of the token, which is really cool.This will reduce protocol debt accumulation, or sell pressure for LPs who would withdraw their LP positions and sell XRUNE as soon as the rewards stop.The goals with Forge are to give users much higher yield, simplify and integrate all Thorstarter products (tiers, staking, LPing, etc), and to do that without simply donating XRUNE and inflating the circulating supply of the token, with a deflationary and sustainable yield, done by aggregation of XRUNE tokens from a bunch of different sources, not necessarily out of the treasury (key point).These are some really really interesting and promising news coming from the THORstarter team, how do you guys feel about Forge?",
