The public should see how awesome your project may be. Or you may tell us what you believe are the best qualities by listing them",

Your announcement should not be just a loud drum but a drum with content of great value and potentials speaking for itself. I know the bitcointalk community  would be eagerly waiting for your next announcement as regards the development of your game and features in it. Making just announcement alone would not just help but engaging in marketing would be of great help and value. So in that case, I would advise you seek the expertise of a good signature campaign manager with good reputation and large followership to help promote your project. This would help your project go a long way in gaining popularity.",

Can we ask what kind of game it is --or there are various games that you can choose not only focus on one game? I agree with the comment above, it is good if there is a picture of your planned casino so that we have an idea about it.Well, that is it, good luck and welcome to the forum.",

There were games made that paid you for playing or allowed to convert some ingame loot or points into cryptocurrency, but there were no real PvP games that you could bet on against other players.How are you going to stop cheaters? What types of games are these going to be? Games where each player rolls the dice and whoever gets the higher number wins? I'd really like to see some strategy board games in casinos one day.",

For features and others it would be better if you could show it too.One more provide a link that can go directly to your casino site.",

One thing I will love to suggest is that never forget to ensure this project has a very fast, secured and easy to navigate interface, because we have heard many people coming up to promise working on a p2p casino of which till date we never saw again. So I hope yours will be different. Goodluck",

How long do you expect your site to be launched? How about KYC? Hopefully, you don't implement KYC in your casino.To be realistic, it is probable that if OP's casino may require KYC, even if does not in the beginning it may be forced to do it as his casino grows.If this is a casino which would accept Bitcoin, then we are talking about a custodial service, which makes difficult not to be registered in some jurisdiction, in order to gain some trust from newcomers, etc. With the registration comes the regulators, I assume.",

But I did not see them being active for a good period here. I mean all of them have gone or stopped their project services. So I'm not sure how people will take your project. I hope this will be interesting and you will keep the project active for a long time.I think the past PVP games project are not last long due to a lack of users. Because if you don't have enough users then how people will play each other? People will not wait for their opponent for a long time. So I think achieving enough traffic/players for a PVP games project is a big challenge. Best of luck",
