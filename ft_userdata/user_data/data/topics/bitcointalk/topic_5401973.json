The feedback goes to the untrusted feedback section. topics goes under  spamming attacks by he and his collaborators4 - And when the victim is trying to get him/her right back or declare a crime, he and his accomplices attack to they with fake stories, nonsense and fake chats and links and transactions. and finally destroy victim account by feedbacks and flagsFrustrated victims unable to scream and Retrieval their right and leave here and Money that has suffered for years but has been lost forever5 - This cycle is repeated and repeated for the new victims and they increase the validity of the account get a lot of money.my goal is not to follow take back that money from 5 years ago Milkz scammed me that year I forgave, ignored, this person and what happened followed  into my life striving for an honorable income. Until he started hitting me here again in aug 2021 when I was trying to start my own business herePlease don't let this swindler pull the sheepskin on himself I have tried many times before to show the real face of this person to new users but he has some collaborators who help him. See what they have brought to my profile because they could not compete with me. They tried to destroy my years of relentless efforts with cowardice and negative feedback Although they did not succeed in taking my loyal customers away from me!Do they really allow themselves to hit anyone they want with a few green numbers and keep it here like a leech for their own benefit? I want to know because a user has a number of posts and how many unknown feedbacks he has the right to attack others without any evidence ?! Who are these people ?! Priests are the messengers the judges?!Not!They have turned this forum into their colony they make a lot of money and they can not tolerate anyone who wants to do clean businessThere are only a few scammers who look like leeches feeding on this forum with just a few nonsense posts and a few self-made feedbackI'm really sorryI know that due to the low strength of my profile I do not have much chance against them or they will delete my topic.I just want users to take my warning about this person \" MiLkz \" his accomplices like \" S3cr3T \" and other fake accounts and accomplices who helped him which you can see here or in my profile's trust seriously.MY ANSWER TO SHOW SCAMMER MILKZ FACE:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5356483.msg60323677#msg60323677",
