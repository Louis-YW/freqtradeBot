  "content": "Since the emergence of Trump as president elect bitcoin price has risen by more than 30%. As the day goes by, it keeps showing strength.According to fundstrat’s Tom Lee who says he sees bitcoin hitting $100k before the end of the year and $150K soon after. He said this few weeks ago.Last night, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $97,800, in the last 24 hours, positions of overzealous traders who went short have been liquidated. Now $100,000 is just around the corner.Most altcoins did not react to the rise of the leading cryptocurrency, and as a result, BTC dominance increased to 60.6%. He also says “bitcoin is becoming more and more a hallmark of this next administration and can help solve some of the deficit concerns”We can all see that this Trump administration will favour us as crypto enthusiasts and the projection of bitcoin hitting 200K next year is feasible.-  With the Appointment of pro-crypto officials as SEC Chair and U.S. Treasury Secretary under a new Trump administration.-  Establishment of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S.-  Relaxation of industry regulations;  -  Fulfillment of several of Trump’s campaign promises related to mining, stablecoins, and more.These are key factors that will drive the price more bullish in the coming year.With the establishment of the National Strategic reserve in the US, soon other countries will start adding bitcoin to their strategic Reserves.We might even see more countries adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in the near future.China has already started changing its mind about bitcoin, as it has lifted its ban and acknowledged bitcoin as a legal digital currency.There’s still MORE that will happen with and around Bitcoin.",

I do not delude my self that I'll ever see bitcoin as a globally legal tender, but I know there's a lot in stor for bitcoin. So many people expected bitcoin to just be something that will die down in a few year, but they've been proven wrong. The rest that expected bitcoin to keep crashing are surprised it's getting to 100k now With time more people are going to realise that bitcoin exactly what it says it is and they will start t embrace it.Trump openly hated on bitcoin and crypto in 2019, but in 2024, he seems like the biggest fan of bitcoin. Even if it is politically motivated, the fact that bitcoin is big enough to make politicians feel that can use it to sway votes is a win. All that's needed is just and bitcoin will keep getting bigger.",

Additionally, the approval of the bitcoin ETF has inadvertently sucked all the money flowing into bitcoin, leaving altcoins struggling for a long time. As far as I can see, the prices of many altcoins have even dropped a lot compared to when bitcoin was at $60k. But perhaps the cycle will repeat itself again, the altcoin season is getting closer than ever as BTC.D is showing signs of peaking and will soon have to make a strong correction to make room for altcoins. Altcoin season is approaching, but not all altcoins are likely to see strong price increases, so be smart when investing in altcoins.",

Now I don't know where this is going to stop, but still, 100k can be a limit, and that's not bad at all. It will ensure the second wave target of $140k in my target range.$200k is not impossible, but it's more likely a sweet dream. I was reading the top 10 analysts' predictions for 2025 from the last few months and what I came to know is most of them I mean 5 out of 10 predicted a range from $95k to $105k and one of them was very bearish and he predicted a range of 56k and who knows still a week and a month stand on. 5 predictors are going with perfect speculation until now.",

Everyone is very happy and ecstatic to see almost $20,000 that time and saying that our next stop is $50,000 but it didn't happened as we have to wait for another halving. So just enjoy what we are seeing, that 6 digit and we take it from there.It will still take sometime for the market first and then we will have another bear market incoming in 2026. So right now, if we hit $100,000 and beyond, just take the opportunity and let it sink in first.

Always Bitcoin rises too much and too fast, it also depreciates on the same manner after a while.And in the current scenario it's even more serious, because people are putting all their hopes on a politician to make Bitcoin thrive. And a politician who already discouraged Bitcoin usage and who didn't fulfill his campaign's promises last time he was president.

This year price has gone up from $30k range up to $90k range because of halving (ie new supply being cut by 50%).Trump's hype might have only contributed to some short term market excitement as a catalyst but the bulk of the rise is not because of him, it is because of the same reasons why bitcoin has gone up from $0.001 to $100,000 in the past 15 years.QuoteHe also says “bitcoin is becoming more and more a hallmark of this next administration and can help solve some of the deficit concerns”Is he suggesting that the US government is going to start pump and dumping bitcoin to cover its deficit?!!!",
