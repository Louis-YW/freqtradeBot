Maybe Loyce is right it might be altcoin?",

This may result in some of your wallet's In and Out transactions not being visible to you yet. Wait for the wallet to fully sync and you'll see then.Yes, the OP should wait until his Bitcoin Core is fully synced (you will need at least ~550GB of space for the blockchain data and some associated indexes). You could speed up the sync process by increasing the dbcache (default is 450MB) value in your bitcoin.conf file. The value you can set for dbcache during sync depends on how much RAM your Windows computer has and what else you need to do with that computer during the sync process. Some more details from the OP would be helpful to suggest a reasonable value for dbcache.Quote from: FatFork on May 26, 2023, 04:44:25 PMThe address you provided does not match the transactions shown in the wallet. You probably mixed something up.It could be that the OP doesn't understand how the UTXO mechanics of Bitcoin work. If you request a new receive address from your wallet, you will usually get a new one if the previously requested receive addresses got funds sent. When you sent out coins, a suitable amount of input(s) (UTXO(s) in your wallet) are fully spent, your transaction destination gets the desired amount and the excess of coins in the input(s) minus the transaction fees is sent to a change address of your own wallet.Pleople who don't care to learn how Bitcoin actually works, usually don't know much about it (they re-use receive addresses and have not much clue of change addresses, either). I'm not judging...Quote from: FatFork on May 26, 2023, 06:31:29 PMQuote from: NeophyteReq on May 26, 2023, 04:53:27 PMEven if the bitcoin core is not updated, shouldn't the money appear on the blockchain?I don't know what you expect me to tell you. If the blockchain explorer (or multiple blockchain explorers, for added assurance) says that there are no funds associated with the address, then it's safe to assume that there is no money at that address. The remaining coins, if any, might be in other addresses of the OP's wallet. I don't know why the OP assumes all coins are on just one address. This might be, but it's not a very common outcome when a wallet has been in some use in the past. It depends on the history of receive and send transactions with the wallet. The shown screenshots don't allow much to say until the the blockchain has been synced and the wallet's addresses have been rescanned in parallel.",

The OP states that he only see one address, which would suggest an imported wallet with only one key pair. However, the screenshot provided indicates that it is actually an HD wallet. This does not make sense.",
