I have my account logged in my pc where I don't usually log out but when I log in from mobile, I make sure log out when I ended the forum usage. It logged out me from PC too.Did I get your question right?",

The easiest thing to do  (from my own perspective) would be to change your password on the new device and it will render the other log in inaccessible. It will turn invalid password or username.",

The easiest thing to do  (from my own perspective) would be to change your password on the new device and it will render the other log in inaccessible. It will turn invalid password or username. The easiest way to do is, logged in only in a private window tab, because when you close this tab, your current bitcointalk session on that browser will be destroyed without destroying the other session on your other device thus you will still be logged. If this is what OP is trying to ask.",

When you use Tor and you logout, you will be logged out of other devices as well. The benefit Tor browser can offer you is that if you did not logout your account, Tor browser do not keep logs and you will have to login again anytime you want to use Tor, which means it will not log you out of other devices, but you will need to always login again when using Tor.",

You are probably wrong. If you logout from your account in one device, you are automatically logged out from your other devices as well. That's how the forum works and your account can't be an exception. Read the post made by theymos about this before. Quote from: theymos on June 07, 2018, 08:03:24 PM - If you logout on one session, all of your sessions are logged out.",

Logging in and logging out on another device are not the same thing.@hosseinimr93 is right. Every time you log out on one device, your session will be terminated on all other devices as well.

The same thing happens when I'm login via incognito tab, when I logout the other session also logout. TOR or any browser should also be the same, there is no difference.But what is your problem, do you feel something is wrong or are you just asking because curiosity?",

I usually log in bitcointalk on my laptop. Once i logged in through my mobile chrome browser as i need to check some thing important. I then logged out from my mobile browser. Later when i reached to my laptop i came to know that my account was logged out on my laptop too and i had to login again.Remember that i logged on one in my laptop and it kept login in forever unless i logout out myself. So as per my experience, if you log out your bitcointalk anywhere, it will logout you out on all the open sessions.",
