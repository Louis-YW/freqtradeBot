If you go for brass cylinder or the common one, when the generator is no on, you can carry it to know if it is still heavy or not. When a gas is about to finish, you will know it when you carry it. You can also have two cylinders. If one has been used up, you will have the other filled up already.",

While our hands are tied on this it is our concern to adapt by any means, within the both you have mentioned the one with higher advantage over the other becomes the one best and suitable for use.I would still prefer using the gas cylinder as it is more economical than using the fuel generator, even with the disadvantage you mentioned it is still not enough reason to rule out using the gas cylinder",

It's really bad cause everything happening in the country the government will take the insult, I know the government should tidy up the mess they created cause the removal of fuel subsidy is really causing problem in Nigeria, I don't know if the government have a solution to this matter yet but they can't just keep the country like this, the government will have a solution concerning this matter maybe building an oil refinery. Actually president Tinubu stated that fuel subsidy was removed to increase the allocation of every state so workers salary can as well increase, I don't know what's wrong with the state governor and salaries of workers still not increased.I never supported the gas generation of a thing anytime I see the gas connected to the generation it looks risky, although it's something new and at that time gas got really cheap and a lot of people could afford the gas. Now wey the price of gas don increase everybody dey wonder abi una don forget marketers strategy, when the demand is high the price will also increase for more profit and gain.",

It's just unfortunate that they have to still consider the use of gas in the midst of the risk associated with it.E de always pain me say whenever we want talk negative things about our country, we see always get wetin to talk because matters full ground but a situation when you done remove fuel subsidy but no put a reasonable modalities in place in ensuring the things becomes easier for the average man, what do you expect? I even thought that since they know that the price of fuel has seriously gone up that they will even think on making nepa to be coming regular but it even seems that they have even reduced the number of hours that they bring light.

When the country saw their successes and bravity, they started a slow and steady increment in the price of the gas leaving so many with regret meanwhile deterring others from following the trend.This was not about following the trend at that time but it was about the risk that is involved in using cooking gas as energy source to power the generator. I love the initiative because it helped reduce the cost of consumption of the generator which will in turn reduce the cost of living of every Nigerian that used that method then. Now the cost of gas has increased above the cost of petrol which the generators was designed to work on initially, this people will have to convert their generators back to the fuel powered one. They must have enjoyed that period but to me, safety of life should be priority over cost of living.QuoteOne advantage of the gas is its inability to produce fumes and extends the lifespan and performance of the engine.

I have not seen in any place that cooking gas can be used to power cars and that it doesn’t show the level of the quantity of gas in it. Maybe you mean a different gas and not the one that was used to power generator when the price of the fuel increased in the past.",

But up to this moment they have not cover even 5 percent of entire zone, as you mentioned they have it type by type depends on your capacity, they have for 3 bulbs, four bulbs, five bulbs including standing fan, television set and so on. The good part of it is that just make a down payment of just 15% of the price and get the product, then the remaining payment will follow gradually as you agree to pay.",

Na you talk am finish. We Nigeria's no d confused just that we d find ways to survive for the country cos the cost of living no be here. It's not a bad thing if peso begin to find other alternatives for him and em family to survive for the country. For peso to convert em generator to gas power and later stop using it based on how expensive gas don become presently no be bad thing and it doesn't make one to be confuse rather calculative on how em supposed to the spend for this present economy wey everything d on increase for price",
