Ideally Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Facebook LinkedIn, Reddit and other social media channels.I'm just curious about your project because I can't figure out what it's all about, and you've been on presale for about 3 months with only 0.05btc ($99) raised so far. It doesn't appear to have any potential or interest in the community, but that's none of my business. My only concern is how you plan to pay for this position, which costs around $100 per week (at least that's my base rate), when the project only has 0.05btc capital.Paying in chips? Shouldn't be an option since it's worthless",
