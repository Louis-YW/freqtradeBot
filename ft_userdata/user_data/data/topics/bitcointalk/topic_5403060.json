We saw this during pandemic too when people were panic selling like maniacs and it suddenly stopped despite the stock market continued crash and bitcoin reversed and reached a new ATH. That's just too irrational to predict in my opinion.",

They are pumping the dollar but there's no getting out of this spiral, eventually they will have to let inflation do its thing because they printed so much money that it's going to be impossible to stop. It's like they set the house on fire and are now pouring water over it with a bucket, but it's not going to stop just like that and even when you manage to stop it the house will be unfit to live in for a while. Fractional reserve banking, quantitative easing, covid lockdowns, everything added to this situation and crashing stocks will not make it better. My ATL at this point is 14k, but I'm not going to wait for it or bet on it. I sell only in high prices and hold through bear markets. I didn't sell anything at 40 or 30k and I'm not selling at 20.

We knew that crypto winter could happen, but unlike 2018 we now have circumstances that are much more severe than anything that has happened since Bitcoin existed. I think this will be the biggest test Bitcoin has had so far, and that at this point it is completely pointless to speculate on where the price will stop because @pooya87 said well that the market is completely irrational.Quote from: ajaxtempest on June 18, 2022, 07:26:15 AMBitcoin was meant to break away from the stock market and fake debt base fractional economy. Sadly all the traders and short term gainers have joined the ride. If stocks crash then bitcoin also crashes.How Bitcoin is conceived and how people use it are two different things. The philosophy of people who only want profit prevails and they sell at the first sign of panic, and few seem to buy because they expect an even lower price. Those who have already experienced this well know that such things are obviously inevitable, but also that after each crisis Bitcoin becomes even stronger.",

The price could go down if there is a massive sell-off from panicking people and actually, this has been going on since the price dropped from $40k down. As of right now, the price is around $18k-$19k and maybe it will stay that way for a while or it could drop again. This situation is very difficult to predict because we do not know how much panic people will sell their bitcoins if the price drops again. Better be careful for now and don't rush to sell your bitcoins.",

Because $20k was the peak of previous cycle, and this is the first time of breaking below one, while $10k is the start of the most recent bull run - going below that would be an enormous blow to Bitcoin's image, it would show that Bitcoin is no longer guaranteed to be long-term bullish all the time.",
