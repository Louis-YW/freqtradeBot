How would it know just to generate those 10,000?I think that you've used the wrong word. Recovery is usually about finding removed wallets removed on HDDs. I think that you've meant restore from seed.Wallets don't just generate randomly 1000s of addresses, there's a rather low gap limit, making only some tens of addresses being generated ad first. Then, when those addresses are all used, more will be generated, but, again, not too many.My guess is that at restoring the wallet will pretty much do the same: generate the first tens of addresses, check if they're used, if so generate some more tens and so on, until it gets to a \"gap\" that's not used at all, then stops.",

Sometimes the software has to ask you the type of address to set that derivation path or lets you enter it manually.Sometimes they modify the mnemonic (like Electrum) to already include that information.Quotewhich are in use, and when to stop generating them?The software usually has a hard coded max/cap constant that it uses to decide how many keys to derive at first. Like 20. Then they usually check if these addresses are used before, if they are then they derive more keys and check those too until it reaches an unused set of keys to stop.The software usually has an option to manually set this value (eg. setting gap in Electrum).QuoteSurely it could generate an infinite number?Technically the number of keys is finite QuoteSay I'd done 10,000 transactions in my wallet so there were 10,000 private keys. How would it know just to generate those 10,000?It will generate 20 keys, sees they are used so derives 20 more and continues until it reaches 10,020th key and sees that the last 20 keys were not used.",

Which is why they offer the option to manually modify that limit.",
