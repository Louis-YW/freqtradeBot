  "content": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/us-sec-does-not-plan-to-appeal-court-decision-on-grayscale-bitcoin-etf-source/ar-AA1ib9YA\"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will not appeal a recent court ruling that found it was wrong to reject an application from Grayscale Investments to create a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), said a source familiar with the matter.The District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington in August ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETF, in a case that has been closely watched by the industry which has been trying for a decade to advance such products.The SEC's decision not to appeal likely paves the way for the agency to review Grayscale's application.A spokeswoman for Grayscale did not immediately provide comment.A spot bitcoin ETF would give investors exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization without having to own it. The SEC has denied all spot bitcoin ETF applications, including Grayscale's, on the grounds applicants have not shown they can protect investors from market manipulation.\"___I wrote about this on October 4https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5468539.msg62945379#msg62945379I’ll tell you one more piece of information that may be written about in the news again.This ruling will unfortunately not speed up the launch of a spot ETF. Grayscale will again apply for a spot ETF and the whole procedure will begin again with all the deadlines, and this does not guarantee the result, because the SEC will come up with a more competent justification for its decision during this time.The SEC does not want to appeal, not because they are afraid of losing the case. They don’t want to spend money on this because they already have a lot of legal ways to delay or reject any applications.",

And like you said now SEC may come up with a very strong reason for not approving the application. So we are now coming back to square one where everything starts over with no specific resolution. All the best grayscale! Also SEC has recently approved BlackRock's ETF. Do you think it's a coincidence?",

Do you think it's a coincidence? The SEC wants more skin in the game with Blackrock being the worlds largest asset manager. They move more weight. Blackrock's ETF probably will end up being the 1st BTF no matter what.",

Maybe two years?The pressure is now on the side of SEC, not just legal but perhaps political pressure. We have seen him in Congress already and majority of the Congressman is not on the side of Gensler. So if everything goes on schedule maybe next year we might see the long awaited Bitcoin ETF because SEC doesn't have a choice.",

The SEC has not approved BlackRock’s request yet. The second hearing was scheduled for October 17, but it seems that it has been postponed. I have not heard any news about this hearing.It is clear that the SEC wants to procrastinate and buy more time and is constantly trying to postpone, so they may ask Grayscale and BlackRock to file new applications to enter into a new cycle of wasting time.",

But I am more confident that the ETF is needed so that more hamsters will come to this market.",
