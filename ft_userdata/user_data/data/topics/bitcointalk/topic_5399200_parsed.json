  "content": "Some members probably saw recent shady project in forum that is most likely scam called CriptoDebit, so maybe you notice similarity in the name with CoinDebit project that looks legit.This two services should not be confused.CoinDebit is releasing physical and virtual pre-paid Visa cards that can be instantly loaded with bitcoin and spend fully anonymously within ten minutes.Cards are accepted anywhere that accepts United States debit, only up to $250 can be added on a card, there is a transaction fee when loading card up with money, and monthly maintenance fee.There is not much information on FAQ page, but it's still early phase and they are fairly active on their twitter page.Not sure if they are delivering cards worldwide or only within United States, but procedure for creating new cards is very simple and it can be paid with Bitcoin and Lightning.After reading their terms of service, it's obvious that you shouldn't use this cards for any illegal services, and they may cancel this service at any time.I am asking other member to check out this new website and investigate any potential red flags.https://www.coindebit.io/archive: https://archive.ph/NL0hUQuoteCoin Debit may, in its sole discretion, at any time discontinue providing or limit access to the Site, any areas of the Site or Content provided on or through the Site.

One of the red flags for me is that they claim on the website that they are in business since 2020, while whois says that website is live since 2021 (and expires very soon), and same goes for their Twitter account.

It also explains why the Terms don't make sense for a site that sells debit cards. This one for example:Quoteremove Content that is confidential or proprietary to a third partyWhat were they thinking?The link to the Privacy Policy in the TOS links back to the TOS. Right.Quoterestrictions or regulations pertaining to the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or missile technologyReally?

Even though I don't tag for plagiarism, stealing even the TOS makes it very likely they're scammers. Especially since they claim copyright on their TOS:Quote23.

The difference between them is in the way you verify yourself. If you pay with a US debit card, you need to enter your PIN. With a VISA Debit, no PIN is required, but you have to sign the receipt.    That's what I understood from these two sources:https://www.firstfinancial.org/youth-young-adults/it-all-adds-up/it-all-adds-up-article/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-your-debit-card/https://support.nmi.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001293352-US-Debit-vs-VISA-Debit-vs-Direct-Debit",

Yeah, its a lazy and shitty thing to do but it doesn't mean that some service is a scam as so many do that.

So probably legit. Check the filings with the Wyoming website and it does exist.
