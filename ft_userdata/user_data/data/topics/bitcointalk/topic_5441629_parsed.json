Why can't you just use the command line to build the transaction if using the GUI has lead to you thinking there's a problem - I think this would be the safest and easiest solution?Signed transactions are safe to publish too (unless you want to maintain your privacy) - the signing process doesn't mean your funds are spend able by anyone with a signature, the complete transaction must be present too.",

Do you mean you have signed the transaction using core? In which case if the signing process was successful the transaction should already contain the required signature inserted in it already. It may not be inside the scriptsig (like spending P2WPKH where scriptsig is empty and the signature is in the witness).",

Okay just wanted to make sure about that. Regardless i do sign it afterwards. So on both the fund and the sign comnmands.. it would add extra data on to the string correct?I only see it add the data onto it when i fund it .. not when its signed despite it coming back as true... would this still be valid?",

I don't know which site that shows \"waiting to appear\" so I have no idea, usually there'll be a result or none.On a side note, there's no official mempool ('cause of the phrase \"mempool site itself\"), every node has its own and has their own set of rules. (usually the default)So if the majority of the nodes don't have your transaction, chances that it's non-standard is high.For broadcasting transactions, every site with push service has a Bitcoin node on its backend so it's all basically the same as sendrawtransaction command.",

This however could be totally a different situation, but I can't see a reason as to why someone would want to go all the long way and not just use the key.Maybe the OP is trying to broadcast a forged transaction and that's why no other nodes accept the tx?",

He mentioned in the OP that the transaction is signed and that he also has the scriptsig, but somehow it's missing from the transaction he built. Maybe he just thinks it's signed. I don't understand how it can be missing and still be a valid and signed transaction. How do you prove to the software you can spend those coins without the scriptsig? It shouldn't work. And if it doesn't, how can there still be a valid signature for something you can't spend?",
