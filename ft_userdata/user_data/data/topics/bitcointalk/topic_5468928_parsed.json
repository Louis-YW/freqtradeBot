  "content": "Hi guys,I'm starting this topic after googling a lot about this and don't find nothing.So, I'm offering a prize of €50 in Lightning Satoshis to the first guy that presents the solution, a step by step guide to move some part of the sats from one taproot address to another taproot address with the change coming back for the first one on mainnet.This need to be done with node bitcoin-cli commands and explained step-by-step  for any newbie in the world that uses a bitcoin node could do it.Until now I just met guys with nodes that can't do it, I think is time for everyone knows how to use it.More questions you can send me PM.PS: \"Let's lead the way and show the light of day.\"",

I can try to repeat the commands for you if you want (or if it is still doable)...It was with signrawtransactionwithwallet command that I tried to reproduce based from OP's reply.But refer to my reply just above yours for the update. (latest test worked)It may not be a coincidence that I got the same result the first time but the command worked after a while.So it's either his node is lacking the necessary UTXO, using the incorrect wallet or missing the needed descriptor.Yeah, probably a sync'ing problem. Somehow, when me and the OP tried the procedure in my node, I didn't even have to do any sync for the wallet. He had sent some sats to that address recently, so, everything was kind of recent. Maybe because of that we didn't have any issues!",

Must be one of“ALL” “NONE” “SINGLE” “ALL|ANYONECANPAY” “NONE|ANYONECANPAY” “SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY”If you want to use the default value you need to put ALL and not DEFAULT, some beginner made that.I suggest checking that the command is executed with the correct wallet loaded (the one where descriptor had been imported). It may be easier to do it within Bitcoin Core GUI console.I verified all in Bitcoin Core versions 24 and 25 where the \"DEFAULT\" argument is accepted.What is the result of your attempts, cfbtcman?",
