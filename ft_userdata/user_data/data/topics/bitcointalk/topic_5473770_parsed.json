  "content": "The two outcome in gambling remains to proffer \"Winning\" or \"Losing\". Nothing goes for nothing. It is either the gambler wins against the betting company or the gambler losses against the betting company. So the resultants between the two parties is always depended on the gambler (player) because the betting company has already programmed its system and it is responsible for any form of changes including system updates and systems errors which has nothing to do with the gamblers.The gambler is only expected to follow the due processes including the \"Terms and Conditions\" applied in the system board.In some occasions, I have learnt where a gambler wins a huge unexpected amount in betting but some of these bet companies would come up with excuses of system errors because an unexpected winning has hit on their board and most of these winning is usually won with a little stake of fund.Let me share briefly about two Nigerian gamblers who placed 2 bets on \"1Xbet\" betting platform with the #80  equivalent to $0.099 and #120 equivalent to $ 0.15  to win #44,000,000 equivalent to $54658.39 and totalled at #37,000,000 equivalent to $170186.34 but the 1Xbet betting company has refused to pay them. When the bettors reached to the company, the company said....\"If an employee makes an error while accepting a bet (obviously misprint on the list of events inconsistency of odds between offered betting markets and the bet etc). Or a bet is accepted in violation of these rules, or if there are any other indications that the bet os wrong, the bookmaker reserve the right to declare such bets void. Returns of such bet shall be paid at odds of 1\".This has been taking to social media as the guys seeks for consolidation of justice, lot of famous Superstars has been made available to be behind them that it is a bridge of laws  in the lottery commission.You can read through on https://www.okay.ng/1xbet-faces-accusations-of-refusing-to-pay-n137-million-in-winnings-to-two-nigerian-bettors and https://www.gistlover.com/two-men-calls-out-1xbet-over-failure-to-pay-n137m-win-after-playing-the-game-with-n80Also can watch them on a brief video clip where they calls out the company and also seeks public attentions at https://fb.watch/ofN-8dkEPH/.I am not to argue with whatever the 1Xbet company has said about an employee on an system error of operation but what I am concerned about is... If these guys has lost the bet on a cause of same system error as the company stood to defend itself, would the same company come to outline that that was also a system error if not the lost game would had been a winning game?I think this is just madness.I hope these companies are attached with professional psychologist amongst their stuffs because such can be frustrating which can lead bettor (s) to suicidal thoughts.",

      "body": "Is this 1xbet a local casino in your country because that name is scary as shit to me, the name is already tagged as scammers running a casino on this forum, so which one are you talking about? The lesson to learn from this is just the same with online casinos too, always go with the best online casinos, they have a lot of reputation and they have already pay many customers millions in money, those new casinos that are starting up are probably broke, so if you win an amount that they don't even have you will never get paid. Stay away from online casinos that are just starting up, watch them closely and see how they build their rep, if you are in hurry to start gambling it's better you go for popular casinos online.",
