  "content": "Who are we?  Our mission and goals:Our mission is to give users access to clear usability, quality cryptocurrency exchange, new previously unseen modules using gamification and interaction mechanisms between users, NFT and crypto.Our goal is to make the world of cryptocurrency exchange more perfect, convenient and give people the opportunity to realize their needs in the best qualities of rion.finance service, as well as provide opportunities to earn money.You can read about our full range of pros and ambitious plans in the Roadmap. AbstractThis white paper explains the solutions behind Rion Finance, it covers the contract features and protocols that enable a complete decentralized token exchange system between each other, as well as NFT tokens to RION and popular cryptocurrencies, on the Binance Smart Chain and Pulse Chain blockchain. Rion Finance allows users to use their cryptocurrencies by providing a token (RION) to the network for passive income, providing as liquidity respectively. Using RION tokens allows the community to Providing liquidity that contributes to the continuation and sustainability of the ecosystemThe ability to receive Rion NFT collectiblesThe community improves the platform by determining its governance through voting. Issue:CookieAnalyzing the extensive list of such platforms we faced with the fact that many services do collect cookies, which by itself does not fit into a decentralized network, and yet the use of these technologies leaves such projects in the era of Web 2.0 and the user does not feel complete anonymity, which means that he is not on the threshold of a new era and does not participate in the general development and formation of Web 3.0, not being a part of it thereby.Impractical and complex usabilityMost projects stand on complex tooling. The result is a very awkward and incomprehensible interface. The level of interface complexity is a problem for newcomers, who find it very difficult to figure out how to use the platform.\"The ability of a product to be understandable, learnable, usable, and appealing to the user in a given environment\" - not all projects aim for this, and sometimes forget about it altogether, which makes the project difficult to use, and for the user such an interface becomes a quest...Development, innovationMany of the current projects do not go with the times and do not develop at all, not adding new technologies, not improving their product.In an era of all sorts of game technology development and market uptake of game content, it would be worth thinking about gamification...NFTThe current situation in the NFT market does not allow token owners to find their buyers and many are left behind.The NFT market has grown to enormous proportions, a huge number of tokens and an equally huge number of marketplaces, but still people remain unappreciated and their labors and assets unrealized. The solution: The Rion Finance project solves all these problems by:-Practical and user-friendly usability (interface)-constantly developing and adding interaction modules-no cookies (we don't collect user data at all)-voting (users are free to make their own decisions on changes or add new features to the project)-24x7 support (ready to help at any time to answer a question or help with solving a problem)-module of exchange of any NFT to RION token (in the short term) and to popular cryptocurrency (in the long term), this solution will provide 100% implementation of the NFT token, thus the exchanged NFT will be burnt, and we in our turn will be able to unload the NFT market and satisfy the users' needs.Advantages of Rion Finance serviceThe main advantages of our service include:-Low transaction fee-Balanced interest distribution between the community and the service-Convenience and ease of use-Gamification of space-Wide range of tools for interaction with the platform-New, previously unseen and unseen in SWAP modules (some of which you still have to get acquainted with) -Ability to add your own or little-known token in exchange, with a contract address created at least 30-60 days ago-Rewards for participants in the form of exclusive NFT rion.finance-Our platform is based on Web 3.0-Exchange any NFT token for a RION or BNB token-The best design in the galaxyThe universe pulsates with Rion.FinanceTrade and earn crypto on the most popular decentralized platform in the galaxy.The pre-sale of tokens has started.Price $0.01    BUY",

Tokens purchased in this way do not guarantee in any way any value of this cryptocurrency in the future. Couldn't you find the funds to listing on some more or less well-known launchpad?Of course, the token listing is assigned, it is reflected in the roadmap. Yes, it will be, of course, later.But then again, you need ~30 Bitcoins to make a listing even on Binance.You can do it for free, but the chance is not great.List on Pancake let's say (well, why not, the audience is large, support Binance, the developer has remained unknown)! You can, but how many of them are there? Very many and the reaction would be mixed, to put it mildly, some kind of another token, which is on this Pancake thousands, scam probably.We'll go a slightly different way. Yes, we focus on Binance, but through Lab.It's easy to talk about listing when you have a few dozen Bitcoins in your pocket).First you have to raise investment to be able to list. For that, a white paper is written, followed by negotiations with investment funds. Then the listing.We are not calling for the purchase of a token. At the moment you only see the functionality that is working right now, nothing more.After all, this is not a call to action, but an announcement of the possibilities.Thank you for asking a question.",

Listing on Binance is already a slightly different level, when large forces are involved in the project, there is a strong community and there are venture capital funds as investors.

      "body": "In the NFT era, we are seeing a tremendous growth of non-interchangeable tokens in the marketplace.But what was initially presented as a beautiful and effective idea, giving digital art and artists a new breath, has ended up turning into a mess. All thanks to exchanges and marketplaces that chased profit and money.Yes, everything in our world is built on money, but still they need to be managed wisely.And as a result we have:- a huge number of tokens from different creators, on different blockchains.- a huge number of marketplaces that allow you to download your work, but it is hardly possible in today's realities to sell....- moderation of works or collections is a very complicated process that requires accurate analysis of provided works and at least average quality of their performance, and some exchangers even refuse from quality content, choosing only the one, which is supported by advertising and hype, so that just to share the kush...And many talented and immensely rich in imagination and creativity people who truly deserve to be among the revered creators, are simply left out of this big boat...and it's not fair!The Rion Finance team has thought this through, has studied the problem and intends to solve it. As we have briefly written about in our    white paper . And we are going to implement this solution in the near future. Follow our news.",
