It might be a good idea to think about adding more stores to make it more helpful for users. You can expand your information sources by checking out sites like BitPay's directory or CoinGate's list. And, of course, don't forget the power of a good old Google search. Don't be lazy. Do your own research!",

Voting for the service is not useful to me, even if it is a Satoshi, someone can do it, and it may be misused.a scam company may request that its name be added. It pays 10k satoshi to appear as if it is a reliable company. The opposite may happen, which is to vote negatively for a competing service",

The solution this gives, in some cases, it might just be transformed into a project. Making people and other projects accept bitcoin has been a global responsibility and I believe this is a step in the right direction towards that, and more people seeing this will also be motivated towards having to join the list as this is also a form of publicity for the projects in the list.",

You need to test it continuously at least once a month and delete or add any modification that occurs to the service, which means more work, especially if the list is huge. If you continue to keep it up to date and comprehensive, the site will succeed, but it requires a lot of activity.if you searching in this forum and Google will give you huge lists, which you will test and update.",

I discovered several services that I didn't known they were accepting Bitcoin payments, it's a good thing because I am always happy to use my Bitcoin for buying something in real life which is for what Bitcoin has been designed at first. Unfortunately your gambling section is very poor and you don't list casinos with the best reputation(like 1xbet) I think you could look at the Gambling section of the forum to find some good ones to add. The one I'm promoting in my signature(Livecasino) could deserve it for example IMO. Anyway thank you for sharing it here, that's a nice service.",
