I think the prizepool is still large enough tho, and i am sure it will keep growing aswell!This seems to be a general trend however (im not 100% certain how big of a role this plays, but im certain it does) that a lot of esports leagues are pulling back prizepools if not shutting down entirely. The entire e-sports industry was way too overvalued and expenses way too high.",

You would really be only getting those shiny stickers and some chatwheel. Yes, its cheap but not really that liking to buy but some of my friends did really purchasethat level 1 and trying out to grind their level until they would really be able to reach out that level 300 which you could have that plaque of Aegis which it isnt really that bad to be some sort of collectors item.Even myself did really get disappointed that we havent seen those shiny and glorious arcanas that we do have on last years or in previous Battle pass but now this year do really sucks. Some said that arcana and battle pass would really be after of this tournament. So whats the point on launching it late?Â  Lots of people do really get disappointed on this one including myself.We've been waitng for a whole year and since pandemic has been lift up then we are expecting that huge crowd on this years TI but turns out to be a huge disappointment.",

Same feels about this year's TI.Â I've started playing Dota at the age of 13 when it is still Dota1, my friends taught me how to play it, and it has been my go-to game up to this date. When I transitioned to Dota2, I've been always excited to watch these players clash for the TI tournament, as the yearly tournament progresses like its prize pool it gets more interesting to watch. However this year's TI doesn't beat the last one, it is okay from my view but it would be great if they did. BUT I would disagree that teams won't try hard to win the TI, it is every players dream to actually hold the TI's trophy, more than the money they could get out of the tournament.

I think its a conscious move from valve's part to devalue TI so that the other tournaments become a lot more significant. There won't be as haphazard roaster changes like it happens before and after TI. On the long run, it might be better for players on the whole I suppose. So, that everyone is not underpressure to win or perform extraordinarily well to even carry on with Dota as a career.",

Valve introduced the people who will cover TI12. And at the same time, the developers added personal bundles of all casters to the game - the most expensive version of such a set costs $19.99. On reddit, users began jokingly saying that casters would now become richer than direct TI participants.I guess this is not a joke. For example, teams from 17th to 20th place - $8,500 per team, $1,700 per person. Casters can supposedly receive from 10k$ - $20k$ if you count on average, taking into account past TIs and that casters will receive 50% of all sales of their bundles.I can't stop laughing because of this, sorry",

Gaimin gladiator is strong and made a well-known run for the whole year but not with the last tournaments however, that could be a strategy for them to preserve themselves for this main event. We're counting on Arteezy and his gang, Shopify Rebellion. But we wouldn't be surprised if they don't win and it's like Team Spirit or Gaimin Gladiators.Quote from: edmundduke on October 11, 2023, 09:53:38 AMi havent watched Dota 2 in quite a few years and oh man have the teams changed lol. So many new faces there. Im guessing i have to go with either Rebellion or Team Liquid as those still have players i remember but will see how this plays out.Also not much longer now till start That's totally fine mate, it's just so exciting to see when you haven't watched for a long time and you see unfamiliar faces when you go back. If you've seen the performances of Team Liquid for this year prior to TI, they always been a 2nd finisher and always lose to Gaimin Gladiators but maybe this time they'll come back stronger.",

I tried getting back into Dota 2 myself a few months back but so much has changed, it is so hard to keep up! It felt so much easier back in the day. Also i still remember the finals from Ti 3 with NaVi vs Alliance, now that was a GLORIOUS finals.When looking at all of the rosters i still know some of the guys but not many. Also pretty sad that Team Secret didnt make it, broke Puppeys streak of TI runs",

They show an insane domination on the last 2 tournament prior to the TI which is the same pattern when they first get their TI title. I definitely agree. Team Spirit is the most favorite this TI after winning the last tournament, I just hope they don't make a amess to this TI12 like what they did last year. Yatoro is something of a carry, he reminds me of AME of psg.lgd, a very good carry who can come back after losing early and mid game. His performance last tournament is very consistent plus the 3-0 in the grand finals against the Shopify Rebellion is just so satisfying to watch. Quote from: Wapfika on October 11, 2023, 08:22:30 AM Larl is finally working well for TS member while collapse is already find his game on the current patch which is typically the game changer on most of their aside from Yatoro being monster as pos 1. Larl being the weakest link in early days of being TS is expected, I don't really think it is a serious matter for TS but having just enough time to get along with the TS play style, will give Larl the chance to dominate with TS. But I see Larl as nothing against other team's Mid laner, like Abed and NTS. Quote from: Wapfika on October 11, 2023, 08:22:30 AMRegardless of the prize pool of the TI. I think everyone still preferred the title which makes this tournament still worthy to watch. I canât think a team that can match TS now.  From my past comment, for players this isn't about the money they can get but the recognition to win a TI is more of a life accomplishment that can't be erased.",
