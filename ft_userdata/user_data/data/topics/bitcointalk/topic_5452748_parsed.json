  "content": "Hello, I have mistakenly deleted my bitcoin wallet from my additional M.2. hard drive (D:) when I removed the Bitcoincore software, I hadn't realised but I had forgotten to save the last wallet I made...I have since recovered the lost files from the drive but the wallet file is not in the correct format. From the recovered files the original Bitcoin core installation now has a missing path & I can see the wallet folder as normal & the files look ok, but the .dat which is 952KB will not load, saying the file is not in the correct format.I have done some research & looked into this topic https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/9127/dumping-private-keys-from-wallet-dat-from-command-line-pywallet-py-alternativesI am not good with things like this & I failed to get the py wallet to see the .dat file, which was placed in the same folder. I wonder if there is anything else I can try or am I on the right track, just not going through the procedure correctly?Any help that results in the wallet working again will recieve a reward.Cheers.",

      "body": "I hope you first made a forensic image copy of your filesystem before making changes to it with any recovery tool. That way, if one tool fails, you could always and repeatedly restore the initial state of your filesystem and try another, better tool again. A forensic image copy saves all sectors of a filesystem and not only the occupied ones according to the filesystem's directory.Flash drives can make serious problems, though. As Windows usually issues TRIM commands when files are deleted, some flash drives may not report back proper data from now marked unused sectors after they've done their garbage collection and wear leveling of flash cells.As you're using Windows, did you check if there's some Previous Versions of the deleted folder/files? No past backups of your wallet.dat (if it's a Core HD wallet, older backups are fine)?",
