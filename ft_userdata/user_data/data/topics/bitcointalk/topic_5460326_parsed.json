All of them get people wey go follow them talk and they go obey but unfortunately no one is talking.Again, Nigeria problem big pass the world itself. Na division go sure pass for this country now. The peace and unity we dey sing day and night na just pretence and illusion because no trust among us. Another group dey hope for downfall of the country if they're not in power.

Once the above mentioned is reached, things will begin to fall into place, hence the institution's will begin to get strong, ranging from the judiciary, the police, the civil service etc.But then, if our political class are not discussing these, and they are hell bent in just occupying political offices without purpose, then we all begin to suffer the effect of hyper inflation, insecurity and other social vices like we are currently experiencing.

My question be say for Naija na who dey make things dey spoil the more,shey na our Nigeria police or Politicians or we the citizens. I beg give me your reason.My G. This matter wey you bring here na very long matter o. Government naim be our challenge oh, according to my analysis Nigerians dey hardworking, talented and educated. Nigeria matter just be like family were eldest son get driving job and instead of him to give his younger brother wey Sabi drive him go force himself to do the driving job were ass him no get the skill. wetting you think ft happen? If care is not taken him go get accident to distroy the future of his employer.Our leader has make Nigeria leadership a family heritage. Emagine tinibu saying publicly that the presidency is his turn. As big as Nigeria someone bits his chest that he must be the president and he became it. Despite all our efforts but still to no avail. Democracy wey Dem teach us for school. Say \"it's the government of the people by the people and for de people\"now \"government of the people of the people and of the people\" Them say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow. I wonder if tomorrow never still reach. ABI na parable because Dem say tomorrow never ends. Student are graduating from different institution every year with better grade dey end up riding okada,Keke,danfo/taxi, hucking pure water doing all manner of things just to earn a living. Most people graduated as first class in software programing some software developers doctors, layers, bankers, engineer in different field. When dey sick for employment the boss will think employing such personnel is a treat to his work. So employment becomes a problem.Now even odimary cleaning job, dey will ask you who send you? WhereassO you saw a poster clearly stated cleaner job needed. So the politicians has made the country a living hell for the youth to survive. They only become friendly to the poor when it's time for election after wining. the next time you see them, is when dey come for another campeign.After all this political oppression and humiliation, the youth became angressive and started illigal activities. There is a saying that \"if you can't beat them you join them\" there brings us into curruption i.e1) kidnapping2) Armrobbery3) cyber crime e.g Yahoo Yahoo/hacking4) hire killers5) child trafficking6) fake churches everywhere7) cultism and terrorism8 ) bandit and militancy etc.So in every sector of Nigeria, corruption is growing drastically. as a matter of fact corruption has been a means of survival in this country. Many people can not survive without crime. They said police is your friend. Only when you have the money. Innocent persons are rotten in jail for the crime dey know nothing about. Some just because you are just dating a rich mans daughter dey jail you for life. Rich men are the law them self's. If a poor man driving without his papers complete it's a crime but a rich man without car papers can travel anywhere in Nigeria without police even checking his boot. You apprehend a critical and send to the cell, dey realise him just some few minutes of ditention. If you are riding on road just make sure you have your offering to give police otherwise dey will detaine you. Even when you have not even carried any passenger.you will come to withdraw money in the bank. If dey see you are a rich man you are above the law. The take you through the back door and give you what you need and others will be left with no choice Dan to wait through out the whole day with their number on it. Sometimes security on bank will take people's atm card to withdraw money for new commer while others are still on que. Many of our young girls are dying by the day all in the name of hookup(olossho promax). Dey don't even care how or whether it will take there life. Yahoo boys has use them for rituals countless times. Wasting there destiny. The solution is to empower the youth in government. So that some parastatas will be changed. If dey don't want the youth at least dey should creat employment opportunity and start production instead of consumption. One other important this is bringing down fuel price because petrol price has a great funtion in all sector of Nigeria.Thank you.",

We no know who to blame again, na ourselves ahbi the leaders wey we put for those positions to lead us? The matter just get as e be now like this. Na to just go meet prayers and make person find something to dey do and no relent for government work or any intervention for now if not you go just old without achieving anything for dis world. Dey say for good thing to come, one must have to pass through hardship, I just pray ours no go pass like dis before things go come begin better for us for Naija.I no think say even if they wan Write book about naija omo he go take years before they complete the book and he no go end self because problems they increase every blessed day, both the leaders and the followers  get there own role to play and both parties they fuck up, but sometimes prayer is good but we need to start taking responsibility, if you no do well we vote the person out because people and getting tired and true true make we all find something to do the thing go really help. Naija need serious reformation and transformation. And make we they pray has you talk to.",

Government naim be our challenge oh[/b], according to my analysis Nigerians dey hardworking, talented and educated. Nigeria matter just be like family were eldest son get driving job and instead of him to give his younger brother wey Sabi drive him go force himself to do the driving job were ass him no get the skill. wetting you think ft happen? If care is not taken him go get accident to distroy the future of his employer.Make I make you understand say na the bad governments dey make us dey hard working and talented and most of our talents are been learnt and no be say we dey born with am. The learning process fit no dey intentional but na wetin dey happen to us be dat. Look at other parts of the world wey their government get better responsibility, dem no get our level of hustle (wey we dey call hardwok) and dat one na because say the government dun provide everything for dem finish. If Nigeria governments was better we no go dey get the hardworking traits wey we get for the country but dat one no be excuse for the surfer wey dem dey surfer us and they thief our money for their personal needs them. Quote from: Samlucky O on September 01, 2023, 03:29:56 AMMany of our young girls are dying by the day all in the name of hookup(olossho promax). Dey don't even care how or whether it will take there life. Yahoo boys has use them for rituals countless times. Wasting there destiny. The solution is to empower the youth in government. So that some parastatas will be changed. If dey don't want the youth at least dey should create employment opportunity and start production instead of consumption.UK, Canada & United states wey belike heaven to many of us for this side still get high rate of prostitution and our own self dey learn work for where their own dey, scams and all sorts of internet scams dey popular dat side yet dem still get a better economy and are doing well for their own self. Country better, job dey and everything dey go well no mean say boys and girls go stop wetin dem dey do. Even now self we still get people wey dey put head together hustle and we still get those wey dey do this things wey you talk, people go always lazy and dem go dey find the easy way out. Dat one no be government fault, now our longer throat they cause am.",
