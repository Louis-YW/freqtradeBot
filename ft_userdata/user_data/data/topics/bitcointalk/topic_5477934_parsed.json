However, this time it's something unique, you're the first to own this kind of loadable artwork, this one will be different. I won't spoil the surprise! You are the winner of one of my lotteries, congrats! That's another artwork of mine, damn! Museum!  Regarding the 'cat,' artwork it's customizable, and once chosen, it's a one-way street. The next art collector can add more details or stick with the version you've got. Enjoy the uniqueness! Let's talk at the weekend! Thank you Owlcatz! Your support means the world to me.

Exciting news for 2024 - no more Opendimes on the back, instead, there'll be a Satodime on the front. To access your loaded bitcoins, you'll need to order a card reader and, well, say goodbye to the artwork.¬†  Cool, right? No worries, though, you can always check with your smartphone to ensure the card is secure and view the balance. This is the way to go!",

It's truly an awe-inspiring piece that holds a special place in my heart and memory.For me, this artwork embodies more than just strokes of paint, it encapsulates my journey, my struggles, and my resilience. You see, I believe I was destined to be an artist, reborn for this very purpose.¬† Following a life-altering accident, art became my lifeline, my memory keeper. When I awoke from coma, everything was a blank canvas, no memories, no familiar faces. But as soon as I could move my hand, I picked up a pencil and began to sketch. From that day forth, I became a bitcoin artist, using my creations as a means to preserve my memories, my essence.This artwork, in particular, holds a special place in my heart as it represents one of my most cherished memories. It's a piece of me, a fragment of my journey that I'm entrusting to you. Please cherish it as I have, for there are only 12 of its kind available.If you're ever curious about my other artworks, you can find them all neatly organized in my art thread. Feel free to explore and discover more pieces that resonate with you.Thank you for being a part of this journey and for embracing my art with such warmth and enthusiasm. Your support means the world to me.",

Some people are even dropping a few satoshis on a couple of my artworks just for fun. Because if the owner doesn't destroy the artwork, there's no way to access those bitcoins, which only makes my art more valuable. With NFC, it's easy to check the balance of the artwork.

It's a testament to the pure heart of the Bitcointalk community. I also wanted to mention that these artworks can be loaded with bitcoin.One important thing for early collectors to note - if, for example, number 1 out of 12 is sold, and then number 2 is sold, I'll send a small amount to the owner of number 1. The same goes for subsequent sales, with amounts being distributed to previous owners accordingly.Congratulations to the owner of the 1/12 artwork! @Owlcatz There's already a significant amount invested in it, and it's growing ‚Äì crazy, right?

I've poured my heart and soul into these artworks. It's not just about creating art, it's about being reborn. After awakening from death and returning to this life, I began painting Bitcoin art. Art is more than just a passion for me, it's my memories, my identity. Every gift, letter, or item that accompanies these artworks is infused with my energy. The year of my rebirth was the beginning of 2015",
