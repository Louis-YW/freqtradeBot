  "content": "Alik BakhshiRussian-Ukrainian war of 2022- ... for the salvation of the World         The war started by Russia with Ukraine took on a protracted positional character. Undoubtedly, Ukraine was ready for a surprise attack by the Russian hordes, which Russia had been massing along the entire border with Ukraine for several months, ostensibly, according to the official version of the Kremlin, for the usual planned military exercises. The assurances of the Empire of Lies were taken seriously in Kyiv. The words of the famous liar Putin were taken properly, which was demonstrated - the Russian attack bogged down. The hope to take Kyiv in 2-3 days turned out to be reckless. The planned blitzkrieg turned into a blitzcrash for the aggressor. Putin failed to seize Ukraine for the Victory Parade. (1) Having lost a significant amount of equipment and personnel, the Russians switched to a war of attrition, relying on Russia's resource incomparable to Ukraine. However, the West, realizing that the Ukrainian people are not ready to part with their newly acquired freedom and will stand for it to the death, decided to provide military assistance, despite the Kremlin's threats about its readiness to start the Third World War. How can one not refer to the results of the Russian-Finnish war of 1939-1940, shameful for Russia, in which, despite the colossal quantitative superiority in armament and human resources, the Russians could not conquer the Finnish people, and in fact the entire population of Finland did not exceed the population of Leningrad alone . By the way, the female population of Finland also participated in the Finnish war, which indicates the determination of the people to sacrifice themselves for the sake of independence. Thanks to that feat of the Finnish people, today we know Finland as the most prosperous country in which there is no oil, no gas, no gold, there is nothing at all, but there is only a people who valued freedom and showed what it was worth fighting for. By the way, here is a good example for the Russian people with its great-power worldview, which sees its happiness in robbing other peoples, instead of wanting to live a peaceful life and work not for the production of weapons, but for the creation of things necessary to improve their well-being. Unfortunately, from this side, as history shows, the Russian people did not show success. Who knows what kind of goods Russia produces, acre of nesting dolls? Lies have become the hallmark of Russia today. (2) She is her only product.     The Russian-Ukrainian war, taking into account military supplies to Ukraine, will continue as long as Putin is in the Kremlin, driving himself into a corner with the fact that defeat in the war will cost him not only the loss of power, but also his life, because the newly-minted Fuhrer cannot escape international tribunal for a great many crimes committed, for which the Russian people also have to pay, and that payment will not be easy. Of course, in order to avoid defeat, it is possible that Putin will decide to use tactical nuclear weapons, but the West can prevent such a development of events and provide Ukraine with an equivalent response in advance in this case. There is no doubt that Russia, with its weak economy under sanctions pressure in a protracted war, has no chance of winning. Putin miscalculated his plans to restore the empire within the borders of the USSR, in which the war with Ukraine was the first step. He probably did not expect, despite Russia's efforts to sow discord, the same response from the West to the unleashed war with Ukraine.    After long hesitation in assessing the aggressive actions of Russia, the countries of Western democracy finally realized that their future is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. On the map - the future of civilization. Thus, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of the need to deprive Putin of a chance to win the war with Ukraine. “If Putin succeeds, it will result in incredible suffering for the whole of Europe and the whole world will face terrible consequences. We will never feel safe again,” she said. In fact, the responsible mission fell to the share of the Ukrainian people to rid the World of a monster from the era of lizards that has survived to this day. In other words, \"Carthage must be destroyed.\" (3,4) The Empire of Evil, as well as the Empire of Lies in the person of Russia, thanks to the revanchist Putin, will inevitably become history after all previous empires.1.

After Paul’s objection, the bill now needs to go through a number of procedural moves, but is still expected to pass sometime next week. “Reserving the right to object, my oath of office is to the U.S. Constitution, not to any foreign nation,” Paul said when the Senate chair asked if there were any objectors. “And no matter how sympathetic the cause, my oath of office is to the national security of the United States of America.” “We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the U.S. economy,” the Republican senator added, referencing the steep increases in gas, food, and used vehicles faced by Americans. “Inflation doesn’t just come out of nowhere, it comes from deficit spending.”Paul said that it seemed like Congress was “intent” on “adding” to the pain Americans were experiencing economically “by shoveling more money out the door as fast as they can.”“If this gift to Ukraine passes, our total aid to Ukraine will almost equal the entire military budget of Russia. And it’s not as if we have that money lying around, we will have to borrow that money from China to send it to Ukraine,” Paul stated. ...",

This is what has been happening to all lands, especially the big nations.Consider Xerxes the Great, who ruled 127 provinces from lower Egypt to India and China, in the 500s B.C.Or look at the US who killed off their Native Americans until they left a few in Reservations. But now these re rebelling somewhat.Or, consider the Tatars a thousand years ago who ruled lands from Northern China and Siberia, all the way to Canada... until Genghis Khan and his hordes broke them up.Or what about China, herself, which isn't really one nation, but is made up of different provinces that are really a bunch of nations that were brought under the control of different of these at different times. What you talk about has been going on around the world ever since big nations became a thing on Earth. To focus on the current Russian State is like the pushing of propaganda.",

Thanks to active contacts with Western politicians, Zelensky obtained assistance in the form of the transfer of weapons to Ukraine. Unlike Putin's bunker rat, Zelensky is constantly in contact with the people of Ukraine. Zelensky did not run away from Kyiv when the Russian invaders were on the outskirts of the capital, which proves his courage and fearlessness as a man. Unlike the thief Putin, Zelensky does not have numerous palaces and expensive yachts. Zelensky, unlike Putin, does not have mistresses and illegitimate children, whom Putin hides from the people, which proves the immorality of the Russian president.",
