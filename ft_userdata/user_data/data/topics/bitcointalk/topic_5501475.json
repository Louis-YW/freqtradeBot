  "content": "Hi everyone,What's a good wallet for sending encrypted messages to people's Bitcoin address, especially PGP encrypted messages? I've tried the Green Bitcoin Wallet and it doesn't have the ability to send encrypted messages. Then I tried to use Coinbase wallet and it won't send to who I need to. I have a few friends who's wallet addresses I tried and they don't show up because they're not in the Coinbase network. Then I tried popular wallet addresses from Bitcoin Talk, such as hilariousandco, achow101, and gmaxwell and they don't work either. In fact, I want to send PGP encrypted messages. What is the solution? Thank you.",

      "body": "Basically it's known as signing a message. I personally haven't tried signing a message with a pgp encryption, however it think it should be possible. All you would have to do is look for a PGP encryption app for you device there are a variety of them out there for both Linux and windows. However I more familiar with open key chain app on android. All you have to do is type in your message there and hit the encrypt button.After that you can proceed to signing a message containing the PGP encrypted message. Mins you , for the receiver to be able to read the message you also have to send the encryption key. Personally I think the whole process is kinda bulky why not just encrypt the message and send it to the user via probably any social media platform or any forum like this then if that user is a member here you could also simply send him the decryption keys for the PGP message via a pm",

Unfortunately, Bitcoin's protocol dont actually let you send encrypted messages directly to addresses.  Thats not something Bitcoin wallets can do.  Maybe youre thinking about that XMTP messaging protocol idea for web3 and  i heard Coinbase and some other wallets support XMTP, but it got nothing to with Bitcoin itself.  Quote from: Mia Chloe on June 29, 2024, 06:11:11 PMBasically it's known as signing a message.

With bitcoin you can only sign a message using wallets like Electrum, Sparrow wallet, etc.Why don't you simply send a PGP encrypted email to someone else for free, or use messenger apps like Simplex chat, without paying any bitcoin transaction fee?",

You can either ask them for it directly, or you might be able to find it in one of their transactions if you know their Bitcoin address.Then, you can use software like Electrum to encrypt your message using the recipient's public key. After sending the encrypted message to the recipient through any communication channel, they will need to use their corresponding private key to decrypt the message and see its original content.",
