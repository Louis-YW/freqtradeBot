Really? I suppose you could try finding something else to do with your time, like knitting or watching paint dry. But let's be honest, what could possibly be more thrilling than scrolling through endless pages of forum posts? Just embrace the addiction and revel in your newfound hobby!Â  Quoteis it happened to your sometime when you were newbie?In all seriousness, I have a feeling that this may not actually be a case of addiction. Good luck on your journey to recovery, though!",

Everyone must be different in the number of hours spent on a forum per day, because in general they have real jobs that cannot be left behind. You can determine how many more optimal hours we need in the forum and ultimately take advantage of something for the progress of knowledge is much better, than spending time in a place that is not useful.",

I don't think it's addiction but just a feeling that makes you think you'd love to be like others, and so you keep putting in your effort just to be like them. It's just like when someone changes schools and you find out there are more intelligent people in your class than at the formal school you left, then you would want to frequent your reading habit so you could meet up. That's just it.I had that feeling when I first joined this forum. I write up to five replies a day, and some times I just keep reading to learn. I do social media a lot and watch movies a lot, but since I joined this forum, I have even been battling to finish a series I started in December last year. Is just my thoughts though.",

Just kidding, addiction is no joke. It's great that you're recognizing the issue early on, though.As for solutions, have you considered creating a schedule for yourself? Set specific times to log in and stick to them. You could also try cutting down your daily login time and gradually decrease it until you find a balance that works for you. Or, for a real challenge, try going cold turkey for a day or two to see how it feels.But let's be real, we all know the real solution is to quit your day job and become a full-time forum fanatic.
