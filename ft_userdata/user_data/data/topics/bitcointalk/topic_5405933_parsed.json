Only scammers are\".I mean scammers can fool those newbie and ignorant investors just by putting a title in their name. CEO, MD or anything is just a title and scammers all the time are the ones who are contacting investors thru DM. That is why I'm not entertaining any DM's whether it is from Telegram or Discord because I know that real title holders or legitimate projects will not contact you thru DM.Just out of curiosity, is there anybody here who received a DM from a random people regarding a particular project and that project became a successful one? Successful I mean it raised money and still developing until now and has a community on it.",

Always be wary of airdrops or free rewards from a certain stranger regardless of whether it is a member of the project or even the CEO of the project. Always verify airdrops or strange links by sending them to the project's official telegram channel so that everyone can verify their transparency. Additionally, we should use the new wallet instead of the wallet where we store our assets to participate in the airdrop.",

Titles such as Legendary, Hero Members, etc. To me, that's the easiest title that can fool a Newbie here in this forum because those titles are not easy to get, and sometimes it can equate trust to some extent.Anyone believing outside titles such as CEO, COO, Manager, Director, etc without verifications probably deserves what they get. Does it take anything to call myself a CEO online? Probably not.",

This is an advice to newbies and some other forum users to not be deceived or fooled by titles.

Do not be deceived, scammers can easily bear these titles to have an advantage over you.  Don't let your guard down.I think most people who fall victim to Scammers with big title holders are more concerned about the name or the office of the person (Scammer) than the business idea or investment they bring or introduce them to. First of all, you don't give an unknown person your full attention when you have not made proper findings about the investment he's about to link you into not even because you have been seeing the advert of the business or investment on social media. Secondly, big title holders have a special way of attracting their victims either by giving them false hope with abnormal incentives which is the easiest way to gain their trust so with this scammers will have clear access to scam them.Scammers who appear with such titles as @Rruchi man listed here know that they can easily be accepted because of the respect accorded to such office holders or titles and they also spend time to find out the ways to attract a particular person who they intend to scam.Everyone needs to be on guard so that scammers will not have the opportunity to perform their tricks on us whether here or in any other place we find ourselves, scammers are everywhere.",
