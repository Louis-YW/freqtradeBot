Almost all crypto platforms have been affected by decisions from the United States in one way or another.",

After the ICO wave since 2018, I have not heard anything about it, and even my account on that platform, I gave up its use after they asked me to prove my identity via Kyc. I also remember that it had passed a period of difficulties, as the complaints abounded in it, and the platform stopped producing advertising campaigns. Given the size of its daily transactions, I find it surprising that the platform still has customers who escaped from Binance and the rest of the market giants.As for American users, it is certain that no one wants to deal with them from the beginning due to the severe control imposed by their governments, whether directly on them or on the platforms they use. Moreover, it is not possible to ensure that the decision was taken independently from the platform or the result of any pressure.",

Bittrex listing carried some sort of assurance and guarantee. And it almost always meant a pump.Binance's arrival in the scene was very timely. It was around the time when Bittrex started to implement mandatory KYC. Binance offered what Bittrex deprived CEx users of. Unfortunately, years passed and Binance ended up implementing the same.",

Or even the exchanges that exist in American jurisdiction will completely change this very jurisdiction to a more friendly one for doing crypto business and will not be subject to constant attacks from regulators. Although, this can greatly untie the hands of such exchanges and they will start playing dirty games. Still, American exchanges did not use such a popular manipulation as trading volume cheating, judging by the latest reports among all major exchanges. But there are seemingly older exchanges based in the US such as Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini etc that seem stable unlike this other ones that keep playing hide and seek with the regulators. Bittrex tried that hide and seek game and failed. I think they even had two branches if i recall well. I think I remember some of us being forced to use Bittrex Global for non US users.The manipulation rumors, insider trading and troubles with SEC keep popping up from time to time even with Coinbase, Gemini but I believe they try to follow the rules to the book as compared to crypto exchanges that are not based in the US.",

They're just choosing what's best for them and that's to step out of the US market since it's still possible for their users to access their global brand. That's why I don't wonder anymore if there are exchanges like this that shuts their US branches because even Binance have been struggling on that region.",

I'd say this is all the CFTC and SEC's fault (especially the SEC). They've went too far by exceeding their authority. The SEC is now classifying every crypto as a security (except BTC), taking strict measures against crypto exchanges that provide services of unregistered securities. It's all a mess that will ultimately lead into a mass exodus of crypto companies and startups into the EU and other crypto-friendly regions of the world. Who knows what impact this will have in market prices during the short-term? Just my opinion",

Bittrex will go away, but I believe others will follow suit (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) unless US regulators become a little more flexible. I think the SEC is being aggresive towards crypto after what happened with Terra/Luna and FTX exchange. It's trying to protect investors' interest, but it's also scaring away crypto exchanges. How will everything unfold in the long run, is a mystery. If people in the US can't trade crypto through centralized exchanges, they will be forced to look for other alternatives. The revolution simply can't be stopped. Let's hope the US government starts easing regulations for the good of the industry. Just my thoughts",

Fierce regulations will only make them flee the country, taking away innovation with them. If we talk about exchanges, then I guess the only innovator would be Binance with its own blockchain network called \"Binance Chain\". But I don't think it can be called an \"innovation\", especially when it's an exact copy of ETH (except that the consensus mechanism is different). Either way, things are not looking good for US as one of the leading countries in crypto/Blockchain tech innovation. The tigher regulations get, the more companies will \"flock\" to other countries. Bittrex wasn't that big of an exchange as FTX was, but its departure will certainly make a bad impact on the crypto market within the short term.
