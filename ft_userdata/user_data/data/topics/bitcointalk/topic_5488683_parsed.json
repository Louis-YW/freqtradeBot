A lot of credit were given to institutional investors at that time. Which was correct as there was a sudden spike in Bitcoin price at that time. Today we are experiencing the same thing happening again and a lot of credit goes to the spot ETFs. After the halving events we can expect more as after halving less Bitcoin will be mined and the demand will increase.",

It got so bad that the owner basically shut down the exchange because if he didn’t it would of collapsed to $0.Most likely other exchanges would of been fine but the arbitragers would of kept hedging and dumping on other exchanges. It was a crazy time.For the next few days the exchange had a huge discount relative to spot. I think something like $500 or so. That sure was a crazy day.",

It was all about the economy crashing. To be more specific it was the recession that led to bitcoin price dropping too.That's the same reason why this current rise was postponed this much. All the conflicts over the past 2 years and crisis that followed caused recession that prevented bitcoin from rising. Even though recession is not over and it still is creating sell pressure on the market, but the demand has risen so much that is currently countering that.",

That fellow did and was able to save so much money that he doesn't need to worry about finances for the rest of his life. Same happened for Bitcoin as well.

It is 350% return on your investment per year.... which is almost 3 times more than what the S&P 500 achieved over the 4 year period. The thing is, not a lot of people had the balls to buy those cheap coins during the price crash. (I did and I am smiling from ear to ear)",

Still would continue to invest in Bitcoin since it is the safer investment compared to others, the best strategy is to invest in other potential tokens as well with only a small percentage to still make a possible huge profit with very little risk.",

Imagine how much I earn, but still, I don't sell any of my bitcoin holdings because I know the actual bull run is still not in place. What is happening now is just because of the halving event and also because of the ETF approval. I managed to accumulate more bitcoin in the pandemic because I do online jobs. After months of the pandemic, I managed to land different side jobs done only and also crypto currency stuff. I also added that NFT became in demand during the pandemic, so there's no need for me to sell my bitcoin in order to survive. We can't blame those who forced to sell their bitcoin because we know how hard we gone through during pandemic.",

This is how markets breathe - up and down.$72,000 is not the highest figure for the entire existence of bitcoin. I am sure that this is only an intermediate value and during this year we will be able to see a new value that will remain in history as “a new all time high for Bitcoin” until the next cycle.Quote from: BlackBoss_ on March 13, 2024, 04:00:37 AMHold your bitcoins, Bitcoin Spot ETFs will make you richer if you can hold your bitcoins.Well, I don't think Bitcoin Spot ETFs will make us richer. This is another brick in strengthening bitcoin, but this point in itself is not so important. Yes, Bitcoin Spot ETFs pushes investors from the traditional financial world towards bitcoin and introduces an element of advertising for bitcoin. But against the background of bitcoin, Bitcoin Spot ETFs remains a dummy and something insignificant. The power is in bitcoin itself, which can just make you richer.",

Many people had no choice but to sell a lot of their assets when the pandemic hit just to stay afloat. Not only coins, but also their cars, houses and even businesses.It’s just a lot regretful if you had sold your bitcoin back then knowing that if you just had another choice you would have been a richer man now. But now we are seeing a bit of the light so we should try to acquire bitcoin and hold them for long.",

Aside from the basic advantage it has over breaking international barriers in terms of transactions from foreign countries or markets, it has also helped to further revolutionize the financial system. Even amidst events like the COVID-19 pandemic, you can still experience an all-time high bitcoin value in less than 4 years. I believe this signifies empowering people to own their financial systems, free from governmental control over day-to-day transactions and financial lives. This aspect is something I always look forward to, and my advice, as I've always given to myself and friends, is to continue investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and other coins you believe in. Bitcoin does truly reflects the power of independence in the lives of users but I will always advice my friends  to understand how the system operates before making any investment, ensuring a satisfying return on investment and avoiding regret.",

The price was around $8k-$9k before the announcement, then dropped to $5k, but went back to $8k-$9k by the beginning of May. That's reassuring because it shows that Bitcoin is largely independent of the global economy and can thrive while other assets are still struggling.",
