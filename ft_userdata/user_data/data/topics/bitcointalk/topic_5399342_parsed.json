      "body": "Something definitely seems off but I was thinking it might only be Do Kwon's strategy to create his plans in silence.  There is clear evidence the community does not want his proposed fork.  But by the looks of it, he is very focused on the fork and achieving HIS goals instead of listening to the community who already got screwed up once.In the final proposal, he mentions this pre attack time frame which is up to next Wednesday.  The attack is already many days old.  Why did he choose the next Wednesday as the pre attack time frame?  Why am I, as someone who never knew about LUNA before the attack, rewarded as a 'pre attack' holder when I clearly started purchasing LUNA after the attack happened?Secondly.  I do not understand why so many of the funds are allocated to the post attack holders.  Is it for the staking rewards, or?  If before the attack everything has been distributed fairly to the existing holders, why are we rewarding the NEW holders?Finally, the vesting.  As far as I know, and please do correct me if I am mistaken, this means the rewards will be distributed among a time frame of two or four years for pre attack holders.  I understand that if the new LUNA succeeds there will likely be a sell off by the screwed investors who are still holding in desperate hope.  But is it fair to allow them to only access their own funds partially?-Regards,PrivacyG",

I don’t think that any proposals could really make up for the damage done to everyone and the entire image of the industry. They could only do so much with the proposal, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that the goal to save either of the two will be totally covered. It is a saddening event, but it is the reality. I never imagined that something like this will really happen.",

I just wanna remind you about burn is not even matched with the business model of luna. If you have no funds left in the wallet and will you try to burn it and use what? since you have zero money in your wallet. I think that is quite clear if in this case all proposal were bad. Almost no solution for this problem.",

This lack of community interest makes me to question the whole Decentralized Autonomous Organization DAO) idea, if this is a true decentralize ecosystem the interest of the majority should be immediately implemented but it appears Do Kwon just want to do what will be beneficial to him and his top investors friends. Thousands of people have lost their life savings and he is feeling reluctant to accept the proposal to Burn.",

So far, all projects that have caused such a massive gau have died, just because of the massive loss of trust. Billions of assets have been destroyed.

The only problem is how they will convince people that it will not happen the \"attack\" again and not to lose their investment and how they will handle it.",

The result of proposal that will be chosen by community actually depend on the result form the voting. Many luna holders are supporting burn but i think this will not gonna happen. Even when so many people introduced their own proposal and the result will always be the same. People can only try to receive their fork tokens at the end of this month. Even when hundreds of proposal created by the community and do kwon will always pick the first proposal. This is how the community being rugged by someone who claimed to be the master of stable token",

Once you fail, it's difficult to return in your once upon a time greatest achievement. Old investors of LUNA will surely look for an opportunity to sell off their remaining coins that was stuck in the middle of everything that happened. They trusted it could pump back but it didn't and it may not ever. They want something in the space of what they invested, not another dimension. In short, they want their money back. As an investor, I don't like buying stuff where old investors are lurking in the shadows ready to sell anytime.",

There is no better proposal to salvage Terra (LUNA), it was doomed to fail at the very beginning because Kwon Do f***ed up everything.And now, he is still trying to save his face by having this kind of proposals. They try as hard to keep everything normal, but we all know that they can't and now it's all over and it messed crypto market in the worst time.",

Of course, but they took a decision when they invested in those projects, while the rest of the community that knew that this was a scam and avoided it still have to suffer, something that is completely unfair.",
