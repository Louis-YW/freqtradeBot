It's like the bank who mint money by mining banks are at least goverment regulated but btc network is not.So you tell that If no miners no btc ? So i invest today 100k in btc it's not small money and tommorow i get message no miners so i just lost my 100k that's why Im asking about POS not just relied of mining.",

Not fully but miners plays a key role in maintaining its security and functionality so it's quite important in Bitcoin. POS is centralized Bitcoin was created as a decentralized method of exchange so if POS gets implemented rather than POW then it would seize been 'Bitcoin' I'm not saying POW is perfect or without flaws but currently is one of the best that meets the needs of individuals interested in decentralization. Yes you would loss some portion of your money due to panic sell Iyou bought as an investment and investments have their own risk And miners stopping is one of the risk of Bitcoin but the  probability of this happening is lower than the network of a blockchain using POS getting controlled by a central unit. There are better consensus and POS is not an option in BTC One of the things that makes Bitcoin stand out is decentralization and security and POS can't really provide such. On the scalabilty, POS could help but I don't see by how much considering the fee of ETH currently There are projects ongoing to improve on the scalabilty of BitcoinThough the adoption of LN has been quite poor and isn't that practical in huge transactions it serve as a sign that we can do better A solution for scalabilty is not quite far.",

Even if China and the US decide to stop mining Bitcoin one way or the other, we in Africa will keep mining Bitcoin, that is decentralization, the uncontrollable effect. The mining hashrate on the Bitcoin network is scattered around the world, to control Bitcoin you need to gather all the hashrate in one place and do some attack, that is even an attack, not full control, Bitcoin is freedom, power to the people in its own fashion.OP, you have a lot of readings to do, start doing your own research about Bitcoin so that you will understand the advantage that Bitcoin have for you and I.",

As long as there are transactions to be processed and new bitcoins to be minted, there will likely be miners willing to do the work.Currently, Bitcoin does not have plans to switch to Proof of Stake. The ethos of Bitcoin’s design leans towards security and decentralization, and many in the Bitcoin community believe that PoW, despite its flaws, still offers the best balance of these properties.",
