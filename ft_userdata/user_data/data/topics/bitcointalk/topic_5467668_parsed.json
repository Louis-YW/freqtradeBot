I actually intend to mining, but I don't know what coins I can mine with my PC specification.Even if you want to mine altcoins which has any worth it can't be done with your GPU hash power you need multiple powerful GPUs which is decent enough to mine coin like ETC or something and I used some mining calculator which gave me an estimation of GT 1030 can generate more than 2.22 USD monthly income with a 8.67 MH/s hashrate on the RVN - KawPow (NBMiner) algorithm.This means better not to mine at all with your machine, or you are just risking your hardware to wreck merely for nothing.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 22, 2023, 04:10:36 AMhowever you can consider mining ETH.No one can mine ETH anymore since  Ethereum (ETH) has transitioned from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism as a part of its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade which happened in 2022.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 22, 2023, 04:10:36 AMIf you insist on mining BTC you can get a computer with better computation power  and don't forget to consider the electrical cost in your locality before venturing mining as it is very power consuming.Mining BTC with GPU and CPU years are over a very long time and even with ASICs its highly difficult to make profits with the current mining difficulty of the BTC network.",

On the other hand, your comment about mining Bitcoin with a GPU doesn't seem too accurate either (you \"don't think\" it will be profitable, or it is ages since it is clearly not profitable?).I don't want to sound rude, I encourage the participation of new members even if they don't know too much about the topics (to participate is a way to learn), but in topics like mining, which I don't control either, we should let other members in this forum, who are real experts on such matter, answer.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 22, 2023, 04:10:36 AM-snip-You can still use the computer as an air gapped hardware wallet too.That's a good point, however  although a little luxury for those specs.",

As for me, my computer is always in idle mode, and I'm earning still from it, but the twist is, I'm not mining crypto, or it wasn't related to cryptocurrency at all. As a gamer, I've been hired by my guildmates to pilot their account in exchange for money. Well, it isn't crypto related, but at least I'm still earning while my computer is on idle mode.Forget about mining already, and can I ask you OP why your computer is unused.

I wouldn't even recommend ethereum because the outcome will almost be the same as BTC. Newer blockchains that require validators to use GPU machines that matches the spec of OP's machine. But since most of these chains require a substantial stake in order to validating nodes to participate, it's going to be a hurdle.I'm inclined to go with others, just sell the machine or do something better with the machine. The mining game is super competitive right now.",

You can just go back to this plan of yours of mining again when you've got a decent amount from the profit that you'll make from this rental VR business that you'll start.If someday you still want to explore and know what to mine with the current setup that you have or you will have in the nearest future, just check what you can potentially mine: https://whattomine.com/",

Is there no other way he can use his CPU to earn money while idle?Buying the top-tier GPU was not really a solution for early ROI, rather than a brand new 4090 he would be better with a late 2x series, the difference in initial capital is doubling the time you need to run it. Anyhow, GPU mining is dead, makes no sense!As for the CPU, again, who would pay him something that makes it worth the effort when he could simply buy that computational power from a data center, far cheaper, you can buy a dedicated CPU for 20$ that beats the crap out of that configuration for 20$ a month, with full support and 24/7 , why would someone pay you more for it?How I said a few times, before, it's time to let it go, the times of earning money while watching your 3 years old computer do stuff alone are gone.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on September 23, 2023, 03:20:27 AM or maybe I will open a rental VR Box on my country malls because it is quite promising.
