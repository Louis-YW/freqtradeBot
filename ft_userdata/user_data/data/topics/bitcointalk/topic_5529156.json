How exactly will they benefit from doing that since the machine is not like a cash ATM where things are stored inside unless they will somehow tamper with the program in order to steal from the machine without making an actual payment, or is their target the cash buyers who use it to buy bitcoin?",

It doesn't matter whether you're coming from a fiat ATM or a Bitcoin ATM or a physical bank or a remittance center. As a matter of fact, a robber is better off following somebody coming from a fiat ATM or a bank because it's certain that the money is there. All he/she just has to do is to point the knife and he/she gets the money right away. Whereas, the one coming from a Bitcoin ATM isn't carrying actual coins with him/her. The robber might have to torture him/her first. That's an additional hassle.",

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs have big disadvantages like very expensive fee, and KYC. As I know, recent years, KYC has become more popular with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs. Together with a biggest disadvantage, very expensive fee for buying and selling.Bitcoin ATM: Definition, Fees, and Locations with fees vary from 4% to 25% of your transaction value. You can see 25% is very high fee.",

Will Costco put a security 24x7? I doubt that because that will be another overhead cost for them.",

Of course, banks would have to agree to that, but that way no one would know that someone had bought/sold BTC.Of course there are arguments for and against cryptocurrency ATMs, but as others have already mentioned, it's not just the security risk, but also the fact that this way of buying/selling has the highest fees - because if people complain that paying 1-2% is too much for them, I wonder how they would react if they had to pay 10% or more. I read a few years ago that such a device can pay for itself in as little as three months if it is placed in the right place and promoted well. This is of course true for countries where people know what BTC is, and considering that about 90% of all such devices are located in the US and Canada, it is more than obvious that this business has been flourishing there for years.",

If this is the case then it is not much different to the gold ATMs that Saudi Arabia has or the fiat currency ATMs that banks generally use and the potential for theft is also quite high without a good security system in place. Anyone who plans to install an ATM in their store will definitely need to have their security system upgraded and there are now many ways to monitor for security issues one of which is through CCTV.The level of crime and theft is generally what happened before and not only in the real world because online systems are much easier, but when someone can take security measures it will be much better and perhaps preparing these measures will be the key to how to minimize the risk.",

So for me this calls for security concerns because they to have assured there customers of how safe or the measures they have put in place to safeguard their bitcoin while making use of the ATM machine. And also if the machine is making use of ATM card,  is also another big risk because the card can be hack or when misplace which can leads to one losing all his bitcoin in a blink of an eye.",
