Don't feel uneasy when purchasing with Bitcoin because that thing is a old thing now the scenario is completely different. I know that Bitcoin is still highly valuable as an asset but that shouldn't stop someone from using it for purchasing of goods. Well, for a minute just forget about the future live the current moment if the things you're purchasing with Bitcoin are necessary for your current time then don't think about future, just purchase the goods right now. If your main intention is to invest in Bitcoin and hold that investment for long periods than that will be a different scenario. In that scenario you should focus on accumulating as much bitcoin as you possibly can.If you can purchase things with your stable coins than that's also okay as long as you feel comfortable about your purchases, you are doing well with your money. If you have the option to spend stable coins for purchasing of goods then you should not touch your Bitcoin otherwise you can use it for transactions without any issues.",

If bitcoin is the easiest method to pay without having to go through bank problems like cross border transactions then it is best to use bitcoin. You can just transfer the fiat or stable coin you plan to use for the transaction to its bitcoin equivalent, rather than going through the fiat hassle",

The only time I will feel bad spending Bitcoin is when I have fiat in my wallet but I choose Bitcoin to spent because I become scared that the price will dump.But in a scenario that you need cash badly while your only option is using your Bitcoin then I won’t think twice on spending because I need it now not in 10 years or other year.Quote from: mejarm on May 08, 2023, 10:25:06 AMFrom a future viewpoint, it appears as though you are paying more for the goods.

The story of pizza and bitcoin is still very much remembered and you are reminded again.As an innovative payment network, Bitcoin is free to use for any transaction for users who want to use it. For some countries that accept Bitcoin as a means of payment, spending something using Bitcoin is a convenience without being complicated.If there are people who don't want to use Bitcoin as a means of payment because they just want to use it as an asset for investment, that's also not bad because one day it can bring benefits to those who hold it.It all depends on each of us because Bitcoin is here as a solution.",

Even though I had purchased multiple gift cards from Amazon and other eCommerce websites from a third party vendor but I really feel the pinch. We all know that bitcoin has the potential to go to a much higher price point. Just like the pizza guy could have been a billionaire today but he missed the chance. I really feel that while purchasing something with bitcoin. But when bitcoin takes care of my finances during the tough time, I feel grateful.",

It is understandable that you feel uneasy using your bitcoins to make purchase, it is because you have the mindset of a hodler and someone who has been attracted to bitcoins due to it's ability to be invested in to make profit not for transactional reasons. If you were attracted to bitcoins because of the you were tired of the 3rd party services from banks when making transactions to any part of the world, you will not have a problem or feel uneasy whenever you use your bitcoins for transactions. Using bitcoins for transactions is part of engaging all the benefits that it offers, not just the investment side.",

It is just that bitcoin due to its volatile nature and limit in supply started to increase in value to the regular rate of adoption and it has now become an asset. Bitcoin was created for financial freedom from third party which makes it more superb than any other currency. Therefore, if you don't use it to purchase commodities, how do you enjoy the major importance of bitcoin. As long as you have bitcoin, you must spend it either by paying directly with bitcoin or you convert it to your local currency for spending. On the other hand it all boils down to how you understand what you will use your bitcoin for. Everyone has different reasons on how they want to use their bitcoin.",

While things are still horrible on the market, I don't want to touch my BTC.If you feel that you are letting go of Bitcoin to buy something that can still be bought with cash, why not use cash? basically, you just need to be realistic and think further about what the benefits buy with the benefits of holding Bitcoin long term. That means you can choose other options plus if the purchase is only for goods that just don't have value then use cash. It's that simple, no need to think any further. Apart from choosing and sorting out which one you should take, there's nothing wrong with occasionally trying to buy things with Bitcoin that you really like and have wanted to have for a long time.",

I am not saying I don't like spending them but I want to be a true deinfer of Bitcoin Hodler. I missed many opportunities to become highly settled financially when I possessed bitcoin back in the time but sadly I sold them just before that opportunity. I was one of that FOMO investors in the market and just because of my gut feelings and fear, I lost a bigger opportunity. I am not letting that happen again in the future and not with the bitcoins that I am in possession of. For this, I now have my own ledger, which was literally listed and found last year, and putting everything in it for longer storage. Won't touch them that happily for selling until I reach my goal.",
