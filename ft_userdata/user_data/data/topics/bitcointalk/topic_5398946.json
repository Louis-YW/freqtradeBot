I am delighted to offer this option to our fans in all 50 states.\"This was mentioned through her Twitter.Twitter: https://twitter.com/AarikaRhodes/status/1465712231216136208?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwUnfortunately I found the news in Spanish, but nothing that our beloved translator can do.Source (Spanish): https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/california-regulator-will-revisit-long-running-ban-on-crypto-donations-on-may-19",

Normally politicians in other nations are getting some money from the taxpayers, because governments try to keep the politicians well fed enough to not make them corrupted, just so they wouldn't be bribed like American ones (not like this works neither).So all in all I would guess that there is a case to be made about politicians not getting donations via crypto is a good thing, in fact they shouldn't get donations from anything, they should be paid by the party and that would be a lot better if you ask me so that they wouldn't really focus on bribery as much and get paid by billionaires.",

All political donations should be banned quite frankly because they have been heavily abused in recent years and they are the scourge of a truly democratic society. They have been consistently abused since the law banning companies from making political donations was repealed and they are used by nefarious forces to get strategic politicians in who will favor ingrained business interests over the greater good of the public.",

I think this is a form of public concern for development. California, one of the cities in America, may be cancel the previous tradition. Crypto curency is a universal thing that is supported with high liquidity for the funds raised. I agree with you @Fortify a few months ago I heard that some countries have even implemented, both for humanity, the continuity of religion, places of worship and this effective for channeling funds from anyone who sends and holders of crypto.but speaking of democracy, evil and efforts that get out of the habit and something good (concerning many people) are not exemplary and not worthy of being continued. Like a cryptocurency saga like a scope, it depends on the owner to be what in its implementation .if it hurts some parties and is not good, it will be bad for this cryptocurency and this is what makes countries that have not legalized cryptocurrencies will review.In every event, anyone has the right to access all conveniences and crypto is the solution.",

After all, it was about donations to political parties, so the idea was to ensure transparency of who is sponsoring a certain party, and with cryptos, I think, it was supposed it would be harder to do that. That being said, I don't know how financing parties happens in the US, but in my country shady parties are often allegedly financed by the public, but then investigations usually show the people who generously donate are themselves very poor and far from politics, suggesting they are only straw sponsors, not the real ones. So perhaps the ban doesn't make much sense after all.",

I hope they remove the ban they sure as shit should.Well, I'm actually not surprised by that at all.California is one of those reactionary states which pioneers radical new regulations (not too long ago they legalized weed, for example), and in the sphere of cryptocurrencies I have observed that while they are hardly like New York which wants to control finance, they tend to pass bills which intend to stop sketchy stuff before they happen (abuse of campaign funds maybe? I don't believe regulators track that yet for cryptocurrencies).The 2018 bill must be of that kind then, but I wouldn't bet on any progress being made at the hearing (as I said in other places, the current sentiment towards crypto is too negative at the moment).",

If the ban was made after Aarika Rhodes said he could accept Bitcoin donations, it would mean that the opposition is trying to hinder democracy. Where this can be said as an action in the interests of the opposition who wants to destroy the democratic electoral process.",

It seems easy enough for a political campaign to register crypto donations and keep a log of such transactions to a campaign, but it might be difficult to monitor the donors to ensure they don't contribute past the legal cap. Donating with fiat presumably has a lot more verification steps involved on behalf of the donor, with crypto lacking those steps.",
