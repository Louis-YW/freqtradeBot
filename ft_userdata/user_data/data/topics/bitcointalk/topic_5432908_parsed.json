  "content": "Free alcoholic drinks, ease of withdrawal machines and ease of which to fund betting/gambling site wallets are serious contributory factors to addictive gambling.A man was invited to the court for failure to meet up with his bills. He complained bitterly to the judge he was standing before, on how he was given free drinks at a live casino and it made him so loose to the point that he lost and emptied his wallet to place more bet of which he lost more. He made several withdrawals from his bank account, most of which he had saved up for something as important as paying the bill for which he was summoned and more. He attributed his huge loss to the ease of which he could easily withdraw cash because of the presence and ease of accessibility of ATM and POS machines and the free alcoholic drinks served which made him drunk and so excited to the point he emptied all his savings on gambling.In comparison to live casinos, online casinos do not offer free drinks, but if one were to bet from the comfort of his/her zone, and had a fridge or cooler of chilled alcoholic drinks, it shouldn't be a yardstick to get drunk to the point of funding ones betting wallet all just to gamble at that instance of excitement. Also, if one can't get to control the amount of his/her alcoholic intake I don't think such a one can control the excitement that comes from gambling and shouldn't bet, make withdrawals or fund gambling wallets, while drunk.What other factors do you know contribute to form addictive gambling?",

These things all contribute to people spending more time in casinos than they might have otherwise. It’s the name of the game… I’m not sure places can be held accountable for these sorts of practices though. It’s pretty commonly known these sorts of things are in play.",

Because no matter how much alcohol a man hard he will know when he reached the finish line and have exceeded his budget in a physical casinos since most of the bets are placed with cash.",

The losing itself contributes a lot in becoming addicted to gambling because you'll come again and have that urge of taking back your losses.",

If they will not give a satisfactory service or offer something good and unique, they will have a hard time luring and attracting new customers to their casino. That was something mandatory to offer to all gamblers to keep them stay.Therefore, I think the question might not be appropriate since it's on the gamblers if they will allow themselves to be addicted.Convenience is a must and it's just usual to see those interesting things in a casino as it was part of the entertainment.",

Online gambling websites would definitely try to attract people with their new-user bonuses and other giveaways that can make at least a person spend more time. In addition, some also have the feature of providing free spins after they spend a certain threshold of money.The winning prize is always the biggest contribution in forming addictive gambling.

Alcohol is actually one of just many temporary influences on it, and I reckon anyone who was under the influence of alcohol (or anything similar that kills your thinking capacity) can recover from it after recovering. If, however, the problem stems from you yourself, then that's something different. Habits are something difficult to change/remove for a reason.

It's not advisable to drink while gambling because one can get carried away, I think after gambling and if it turns out well a gambler can then drink out of his profits. Other contributors to excessive gambling are drug addiction, anxiety and depression. These are not good for the player and such a person is expected to be taken care of by loved ones to save his life from getting into debt.",
