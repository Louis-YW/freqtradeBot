  "content": "Hi,On my (RPI) node I use maxconnections to control the maximum number of connections to my node, but my understanding is that this limit applies to both onion and regular connections. I am trying to connect to the 8333 port on my node from localhost, but my connection does not work and I think it is due to maxconnections being reached. So I am trying to reserve some connection room for my local services. How can I do that? Thanks!",

In the log I was seeing that the connection to the node kept getting disconnected in a loop and it was unable to sync.It started to work again after I restart bitcoind. However I would prefer not having to restart bitcoind. Thanks!",
