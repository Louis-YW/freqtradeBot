The answer is still No. For him/her to be able to withdraw the money they’ll need information like your private key that will grant them access to your wallet that’s the only way for them to move your coin from your wallet, but since you only gave them your address then there’s no need for you to panic.",

Take note that all bitcoin addresses that have received bitcoin are public and if it was possible to move fund just with knowing the address, bitcoin would have no value now.It may worth mentioning that anyone who knows your bitcoin address can check your transactions.

Your wallet address is the public address or key, you use to receive funds. To send or access your money, you use private keys. Since he doesn't have them and you do, he can't get into your wallet. Just keep those keys safe, and your Bitcoin will be secure.",

So, if you care about your about your privacy, you shouldn't reuse addresses. Yes, and this helps maintain transparency in the Bitcoin Network, although it might look like this feature  makes Bitcoin users not to enjoy complete anonymity and make Bitcoin transaction traceable and every man's business. Although there are some anonymous wallets that are not easily trackable even when you have the wallet addresses.And OP you made a little typo error in your statement.",

If this helps you worry less about this issue.",

But you don't need to worry. As long as the person only knows your wallet and does not have the data to access it, in this case the wallet password / seed phrase / private key, then he will not be able to access it. Whatever the reason, you should never share this important data with him or anyone else. Therefore, it is important to maintain privacy and security of important data for wallet access and do not trust anyone, especially people who request this access. Never, for any reason.",

But since there is a question, there must be an answer and some persons have answered you above. No one withdraws your money from the fiat bank using your account number only.

Know the difference between wallet address and seed phrase/private key. The name private keys should make you aware that it is not something that needs to be public but should be known to you only. If someone does not have your private keys or seed phrase, they can’t have access to your account to withdraw your money. Don’t ever disclose that to anyone and money can be deposited into your account without given them your seed phrase but you can only withdraw it when you have access to your seed phrase/ private key.",
