Thank youAndrewWhat?! Are you asking us if its a good idea to gamble your money on an asset that is going to go to 0 in a matter of 0-10 min? They do rug-pull just after someone invests in their crap so its likely that they will rugpull just after you buy.Its way better to simply go to online roulette crypto casino and bet all your money on red or 00. At least you want sponsor scammers with your money.",
