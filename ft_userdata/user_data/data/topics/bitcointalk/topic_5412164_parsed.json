If not, there shouldn’t be any problems. Even if he does, he doesn’t request it. He is just telling people if they have anything to discuss about the casino, they can do it in the ANN. It is simply a reminder and nothing else.Aware or or not, I don’t think anything wrong is happening here and nobody will get banned for this.",

In any campaign by any campaign manager if there was a quota to bump any thread or something like that then issues of paid bumps could be discussed but as you rightly said there is nothing like that going on here.",
