  "content": "Hello,I would like to share my experience regarding Betcoin.ag.I made a deposit in the past week of 0.2036 BTC (around 5,4k USD).I placed a few bets on major tennis markets and was able to run up the balance to 0.29187 BTC (around 7,7k USD).As a consequence, I wanted to withdraw my balance.After I had submitted my withdrawal request, I was informed earlier today that they want further KYC information from me.I have provided them with my driving license and a bank statement to verify my identity.Couple of hours ago I received the information that my account is suspended and I should contact them for further details.I have done that and so far did not receive any reply.They are currently holding my balance of 0.29187 BTC (7,7k USD) and have not been able yet to provide me any reason why they do no process my withdrawal.I have read carefully through their ToC before signing up.I am therefore asking Betcoin to provide me with detailed reasoning for suspending my account and holding my balance.I will fill an official complain with SBR in a few minutes.Keeping you guys updated on how this continues, big red flag from my side here.Upon checking with their license provider, their license has been suspended.",

You can use talkimg.com to upload image and send the links here. This is what I hate on some casi o protocol. They will still asked KYC then disable the account afterwards. There’s no use of KYC anymore if user account will just be suspended afterwards. It’s like a KYC theft because it doesn’t change anything on the user case.I check their license and it’s not really updated but it’s same result with some popular casino here like Stake and Duelbits which means there’s something weong on Curacao license checker because these two casino will surely take care of their license. We will wait for the proof to establish your case.",

Since your account got suspended even after you followed their instructions, there must be a reason. Betcoin.AG has already replied here and explained the reason for your account's current status. Now continue the conversation with them, and try to withdraw your funds. And if they have wrongfully withheld your funds without any reason, then definitely add all the proofs against them and post them in this thread.",

This was, of course, after we had already suspended his betting, and determined that he had violated our TOS, but it is certainly noteworthy. He conveniently left the arbusers part out of his post here.  As always, we encourage all players to share their unique experiences with Betcoin.ag, everywhere they can. Especially places like the arbusers forum, where we want it made clear that users of their scanner technology will not be tolerated.  it is unfortunate that some players are still trying to violate the most basic rules (of nearly all sportsbooks). The vast majority of players at Betcoin have an exceptional experience.",

I am not sure if you understand what account suspension means but it means you are not able to login to your account anymore.As a consequence, I am not able to see my bets anymore.Furthemore, I am the one who is getting accused of having done something wrong here so far without mentioning any reasoning for these accusations.The fact that 4/5 bets were live bets even requires more proof from Betcoin.ag on how they came up with the conclusion that I was using a software here.I think we would all be interested which software that should actually be. Please provide us with some detailed information how you have identified that those bets were either value bets or detected by a software.They are accusing me of either- placing value bets (please provide us with the mathematically prove for each bet for that)- using banned scanning services (please provide us with the software + screenshots of my markets at that software)If they are unable to provide any of this in a timely manner (which they wont be able to provide as I have done none of the two and maybe I havent highlighted yet - they only allowed me 60 minutes to do my KYC), this is a clear case of potential robbery and I will not accept it.Robbery is illegal in every country on this planet. Its a question of principles here and I will fight until I have the money which belongs to me which is the full balance.Head of SBR has been involved a few minutes ago aswell, continuing tomorrow in more forums with sharing the truth about this bookmaker and their business practice.",

Thanks and best of luck to all.I would like to ask Bitcointalk to block Betcoin.ag from anymore posting/advertising for now after this post.Everyone reading can see now:- First and most important: the company has still completely failed to provide any reasoning on how they came to the conclussion that I have violated their Terms&Conditons despite asked by me and even other individuals now.Please provide everyone reading with the bets, the prices, the time they were placed and explain how you came to the conclusion I have used a software detecting those.- The company is trying to take the \"wind out of the sail\" by now \"analysing for 7 days\" whatever- The company talks about \"taking\" my 0.1 BTC while they are actually withoding 0.29187 BTC of my balance- The company has still failed to provide us with a link where we can see they are still having a license.I have done some research myself and so far found out that the company behind Betcoin is Global Limited Holding EOOD. Because of the legal form of the company, it is very likely that they have their roots in Bulgaria. This may allow me to fill a lawsuit against the company regarding the confiscated amount they took without any proof from me but also the mental damage I am taking out of this proofless accusation.I see that I am receiving great support not only in this post but also via direct messages.Thanks a lot to everyone!Stay far away from this bookmaker, when you win significant amounts of money you will not get paid, they will scam you, try to rob not only your winnings but also your deposit and can not even back up their claims with a valid basis.",
