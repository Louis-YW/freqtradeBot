Although you did not mention any coin as a list for us to work with,  but then we must be talking about another meme coin altogether.",

I bet they will need some proof that you really did it because there will be people who will cheat and in the crypto world there are lots of them. Also, don't expect too much. It's not like this is the era where airdrops are worth it anymore. Most of them are either dust or developers just playing around and in the end, they will just take the money and run with it. It sounds pessimistic but it's the reality when it comes to bounties and I think this kind of test runs are just like them. Finally, be careful with what you will join in especially if they are requiring you to fill up information to prove your legitimacy. There are chances they will use your info for different bad purposes.",

Example of these are sei which has a very low value due to massive participants and a very few alloted budget for the testnet. Also the sui which chosen to do a random whitelisting which ignored the testnet users full activity and opted to do a small group of people reward by random lottery. Well some also low class projects giving a false hope and only non valued nfts.",

Most of them are not announced in advance and users should proceed with activities only based on rumors and you can't be 100% sure that something wouldn't go wrong. Many airdrop hunters expected a retrodrop from SUI and it ended being a waste of effort once it went public. 2.You need to pay the transaction fee with your own money at the time of activities. And if it is some kind of ETH L2, then these fees can be high, although you cannot be sure that you will not fail on some criteria or the retrodrop will take place at all.",

Bunch of projects copied it but don't really indicate that they will have an airdrop for users who participated. So it's easy to say to don't expect rewards from them. Though the airdrop rewards nowadays aren't that high anymore compared to the past once and people who tried where demotivated because they experience losses because of mainly the transaction fee spent.",

They pay out only every 20 projects, or less often. When you do testnets, be prepared that you will just waste your time and it will not be rewarded in any way. This is a feature of this industry, so don't expect every testnet to be rewarding. New testnets appear every day, and only 10-15 projects get good rewards per year.",

Sure, those testers that have done it on a project that became successful later on managed to get some airdrops and rewards from that. But you can't just hope that all of them are going to be the same. Having a timeframe for these projects is hard to expect to. If you're just for the testing, I think it's a good opportunity because you can add it on your portfolio as seems to be like a QA or project tester.Whether the project succeeds or not, you've got it on your file.",

Can you cite an example? Indeed, so many projects have been created but the majority of them are worthless. Therefore, I would tell you OP not to expect any rewards from them if ever you participated in their airdrops or bounties as you will just get disappointed. Well, I don't stop you from doing that but as I've said, never expect to much from them either.",

In reality, tasks for projects with Airdrop programs can be quite challenging for newcomers.
