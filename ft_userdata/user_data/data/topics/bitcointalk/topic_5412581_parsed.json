When you put zero effort on homepage hoping that maybe people won't be looking hard enough, you probably would do that with coding too. That combined with fast unlock time and anon devs makes me think of money grab disaster. But the review seems honest. Shows me that you aren't payed to do it, or if you are paid, you are not compromised with the outcome. Keep up the good work.",
