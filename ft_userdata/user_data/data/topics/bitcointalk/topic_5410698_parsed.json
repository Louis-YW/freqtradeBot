The comment on the internet about this selfies is bad, they said it sucks so much that people wouldn't want Zuckerberg meta, anyway, of course the idea behind metaverse will reshape the future, new technology and ideas will evolve from this day forward, its a shame that I don't have any metaverse project in my portfolio.",

I am giving him a chance though, he has the money and power, might as well use that for better production of a game. We are not 2D anymore. That's like 20 years ago with the playstation 1 and what he had done didn't make gamers crazy about it but instead doubt his capability of making a Metaverse world. Good news for other projects though as I am sure they will be hunted by those looking for a better graphics than this.",

I wouldn't say the current crypto metaverse projects are any good. They are all the same and people play/use the metaverse only for the \"profits\" they hope of making. All I have seen is those projects selling lands and people trying to flip them for some good profits.",

He just want to show a glimpse of what they are doing and they are doing it from scratch. Meta is not planning a mediocre metaverse like what we are seeing in crypto space because they are planning to have a metaverse that has global scope. They plan to this for many years so I’m sure he just want to show where they begin and update is on the improvement later on because you can’t showcase properly your product if you will not start first showing the ugly part.",

You may be surprised that they leaked this as well to see the publics reaction to their progress so far, that cannot be the final work, or even if it was, they have their response now and will definitely go back to work.

Leaked selfies of his grand MetaVerse vision are now the laughing stock of the tech community.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebVH65IL8FYI believe in the future of the metaverse, it will be the next trend in the market when the bull season comes. Not only Facebook, many other technology companies are also pouring capital into this supermarket. So its future is very bright. Yes, the photos of Mark Zuckerberg are really bad, the graphics are so bad coming from a technology company like FacebookI think we all acknowledge that the metaverse is the future, however how long it will take for the metaverse to become a reality? When it comes to social media the graphics aspect was never too much of a problem, however when it comes to the metaverse if things do not look realistic or at least appealing to the public many people will not use it, and the graphics on one of the images posted by the OP are terrible, supposedly Zuckerberg posted improved images but if it is still close to what we seen before then the only conclusion I can make is that we will have to wait a long time for a working and attractive metaverse.,",

This will create massive adoption. I agree to this. I think it's still to early to judge because of what the selfie of Mark Zuckerberg looks like. They invested few billions in it and I think that's not the final result they are offering to us. Our technology is evolving and Metaverse is trying to conquer the space by leading it. Remember what facebook looks like before and what it is now. Facebook is like now all in one platform and I expect to see a revolutionizing evolution from metaverse as time goes on. I also think they have plans to make it available into masses in the future knowing that most of the people have basic devices like smartphone and won't spend on something like Oculus.",

The world itself is full of non-fungible tokens (NFT), user-created environments.SAND was designed to be a mobile game in 2021. But later, SAND evolved into a more complex game and was built on the Ethereum network. Transactions in this game also use Ethereum and The Sandbox (SAND) token which aims to support the economy in the game.",
