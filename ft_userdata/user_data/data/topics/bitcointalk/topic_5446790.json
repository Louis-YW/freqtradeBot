I will like to know the estimated cost of setting up with Biowaste power supply and also how good is biowaste energy for mining bitcoin Estimated cost? I didn't know anyone deals with biowaste.... however, it cannot be good or bad, if you have energy it is good, maybe you asking how efficient it is, but that should be tested.If i plainly think about it, there's more than a way of making energy with biowaste, not completely sure what biowaste entiles tho.",

      "body": "Yes. I think bio-waste has the potential to supplement other sources of energy, but I do not think it will replace them completely. Bio-waste energy is still a relatively new technology and there are some limitations to its scalability. It is not a silver bullet, but it can certainly contribute to a more sustainable energy mix. And as the technology continues to improve and become more efficient, we can expect to see more widespread adoption of bio-waste energy in the future.",

One good paper on it is here. Aside from the source of gas the same generator(s) and ancillary equipment are used:You need a Prime Power rated generator. They are built for and intended to run 24x7 for months at a time with no shutdown required for maint or oil changes. Regular backup/standby power generators typically must be shut down and serviced after only a few days running 24x7.
