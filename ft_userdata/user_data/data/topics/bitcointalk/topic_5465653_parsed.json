      "body": "Bitcoin hasn't harmed the government, but the innovation that is in bitcoin makes most governments afraid. Governments are afraid because they can't control bitcoin, of course that has made some of them ban it. But I am grateful that my country's government has not banned bitcoin completely, I mean bitcoin can be traded even though it is not allowed to use it as legal tender.The policies taken by the government towards bitcoin are sometimes detrimental. Governments tend to say something negative about bitcoin, but they're basically just lying and pretending not to know. Bitcoin is just like any other currency, it can be misused for whatever reason. But that's not a good reason to ban a currency.",

Whether we want to be against those governments that has banned bitcoin, there is nothing we can do with that.The only thing is to wait for them to change and alter their decision into making it useful on their end. That's the start of it, they don't see the use and benefit of it and that's the reason why they're having regulations and worst, goes into a ban.We think that they're wrong in all forms because we're pro and investors of bitcoin. But looking at their perspective, they think that they're right and we're wrong.",

This statement can of course be refuted when legalities between countries are adjusted or changed from time to time. I agree that not many countries ban bitcoin - but still many countries don't let you use it as a means of payment or currency.There are interesting references regarding the legal status of bitcoin in various countries; find it here: Legality of cryptocurrency by country or territory",

(Partially controllable.)I think governments will always have a limited view of Bitcoin because of these things. I hope one day their understanding can change.",

Please correct me if I am wrong.What I know and think is the reason why the government still disagrees with bitcoin is that they cannot control our funds anymore once it becomes legal tender. Once it becomes legal tender, our money will be in our custody. We all know that if bitcoin becomes legal tender today, most of us will like to use it as a means of transaction because of the freedom it has. However, the government disagrees with bitcoin because they know that if they agree that we should use it, we are not going to put money into the banks again, and you can see how decentralised it is, so from there they will not get some revenue that banks usually generate for them.However, in my country, our government didn’t ban bitcoin, but rather, we can use it, but nothing concerns them if anything happens to our funds, and they can’t make it legal tender, so in my country, anyone who wishes to use it can go ahead.Quote from: boyptc on September 04, 2023, 07:06:17 PMWe think that they're wrong in all forms because we're pro and investors of bitcoin. But looking at their perspective, they think that they're right and we're wrong.Yes, mate, you know when you like something, you don't believe anything anyone says about it because all you want is that thing, and you want it done.However, normally, that is how things go in some cases. Some citizens will prefer to use something, while the government will disagree with such decisions made by their citizens. So for bitcoin, you know, the only reason they don’t want to legalise it is because of how anonymous and decentralised it is. You can see that most of them don’t have any knowledge related to bitcoin, and if they legalise it, it will have no use for the citizens.",

Please correct me if I am wrong.It's not that government doesn't know the importance of bitcoin, they only lauch attacks because they are afraid of allowing what will take financial power away from them, such that they won't be able to perform their secret enterprise, but the truth is that some individuals from these same governments will be wise enough to secretly admires and invest in bitcoin while joining in the attack on public because they don't want others to know about their secret, the conclusion now is that no matter how the attack may be, it will not be successful on a decentralized digital network of bitcoin, till government get tired, they won't achieve any attack aimed at bitcoin.",

Well, we shouldn't be quick to judge the intentions of the government, as they are more concerned with money laundering and a host of other neferous criminal activities that can be perpetuated with the anonymity of the decentralized network. El Salvador opened its arms to it, other countries may welcome the idea currently, but they only don't want to legally agree to its existence unless it is regulated, that is for those that even agree to its existence.",
