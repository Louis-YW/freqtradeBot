  "content": "@babydogeburn_ Twitter account has reported that over the past few hours, a whopping 2,018,896,967,261 Baby Doge Coins have been removed from the total circulating supply.The crypto was burned in three transfers of 876,668,446,039, 802,206,663,474 and 341,857,169,748 coins, which together are worth $3,372. By regular token burns, BabyDoge community hopes to reduce the supply in circulation to a degree when the meme coin becomes scarce and this would help its quotes go up significantly. Thus far, BabyDoge meme coins are getting locked in unspendable wallets – the same situation is happening to the second largest meme crypto Shiba Inu. Its community has been conducting daily and weekly burns since last year, however, it has not impacted the SHIB price positively yet.

      "body": "A small recovery for baby doge but 3k USD was very small compared with total supply of this token. Why don;t the community just send whole of their tokens to the burn address. Just curious how long will be taken to burn bunch of tokens that available in the market. Shiba has a platform that was supporting the burn but this babydoge token has nothing compared with shiba inu. That burned tokens were coming from the personal wallet. I remember when so many baby doge shillers were saying this will surpass shiba inu.",

      "body": "Is it too much fun to talk about this? The amount burned is so small compared to what's in circulation, just like someone bought it or them, and what impact it has here. I think in order for these memecoins to have pumps, they need influencers who love memes to keep the hype about them. Anyway, when comparing memecoins with each other, things shouldn't be too complicated. Just see what they will do during this period and how they will survive when the bear market is affecting everything.",

Its 0,0004% of supply. Even if they would burn such \"A whopping\" ammount every hour for entire year they would burn 3.7% of supply with is less than binance is burning with their quartery burns. this burn means nothing. meme coins are done. It was a 2021 joke. Its 2022. Its not funny any more. Buing meme coins now and getting excited about  0,0004% supply burn is crazy.",

Don't count too much on the burning as it is not a long-term solution to increase the coin value.What you are saying is very true because if someone only relies on burning to increase the price of any altcoin, it is completely wrong because burning only reduces the amount that is already there, not increases the number of buyers who buy more because more buyers buy is the basic criterion for every altcoin. in terms of price increases.",

Especially on altcoins which shown in the major projects movement against btc. Now, babydoge is one of those projects riding the fast movement of alts.Some memecoin like shiba and doge have even single transaction more worth than 3k so I doubt this will affcect a big consequency.",

This is very small and such a ridiculous amount could not affect the growth of BabyDoge. The BabyDoge team has full control over how many resources are burned each time and it's time to start thinking about bigger burns. Also, for a cryptocurrency to become widespread, it needs to add value and have a practical end use.",
