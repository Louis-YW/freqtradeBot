  "content": "Isn't the description \"Organization of Bitcoin and related projects, bounty campaigns, advertising etc.\" for this board a little wrong?I know that it was written in the early stages of the forum, In the meantime, bounty programs got their own section, maybe there should be a small update here. Older and more serious members know that bounty programs and their problems are not discussed here, but every now and then new offers or attempts at discussion by wannabe bounty managers appear.I believe that maybe this is not a \"big deal\", but considering that I visit this part often, (I am always interested in seeing new ideas), it can be boring to read about bounty problems or cheating in some shit token campaigns.Although everything looks like spam, it seems that it is not even only their fault. A couple of recent examplesThread: Cheater scamQuote from: Baunty detective agency on May 23, 2023, 05:44:12 AMAt present one person can use multiple accounts in Bounty camp in but it was not like this before so is the quality of our work decreasing day by day I request moderators and those who are in higher position to control this workor I am bounty professional managerQuote from: projectdevelopment on May 19, 2023, 04:46:35 AMI'm from the Project Development Baunty Management Community. I want to run a bounty campaign with your project. Let me know if you're interested. I've preached a lot of bounty campaigns before.

And this is something that could really hurt the system.http://www.zerohedge.com/article/december-7-unofficial-pan-european-bank-mutiny-dayThis might also be a great oportunity to promote bitcoin. This are the facebook pages of the organicers in each country. If you speak the language you could go to the facebook page and spread the word about bitcoin.

On the other hand, this forum has for years been a haven for shitcoin hunters and campaign managers who do little to explore references outside of the sub-board, except when it becomes their task.",
