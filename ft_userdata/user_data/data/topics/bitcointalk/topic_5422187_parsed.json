Most of altcoins lose their prices about -90% from their all time highs. So what do you plan to DCA with altcoins? The more you DCA, the more risk you are taking more loses.

That is really new word I have read associated with the trading after very long time. That’s why I’m specifically asking for this. As far as DCA is concerned I am already buying at various entry points and trying to keep my average price towards the lower side.  I think in case of twapping its more or less making purchases at right time or figuratively at times whenever price drops? I might be wrong but correct me if so. Thanks.",
