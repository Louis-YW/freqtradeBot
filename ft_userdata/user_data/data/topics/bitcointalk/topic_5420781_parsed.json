But with that fact, we can't disclose the fact it is being used to \"cheat\" things, in another scope, the story of a student that uses it to make an essay/paper.I don't know the ecosystem of an ebook marketplace on Amazon, but one thing I know for sure is some seller is producing public domain ebook verses and selling them for commercial which surely violates the actual producers/publishers' licenses, like gutenberg.org, and it is widely known. So surely this scam's motive was indeed planned and being done with minimum work, like set and forget type of fraud.It is funny since most NFTs are produced in an algorithmic generative way, yet this fraud is doing it in the same way but for an ebook instead of NFTs.",

I think we are far from that because if it happens it will be a boom for the whole world and not for NFT tokens, what is happening here is trying to get some demand from some enthusiastic customers and then everything will disappear.",

There is a lot of information about NFT on the Internet, so why buy useless waste paper without reviews of famous people in the crypto community?",
