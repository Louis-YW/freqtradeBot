Would like to see if some people can't reach that tooI got 4 of them and none can go over 76 stable under hiveosThat is the best hash rate geared to the power consumption I believe to be 50% or like near 180 Watt.If you want to go to that over 80 and the maximum of near 82 I think you should let the power at 100% plus the normal overclocks which are for this cardCore clock (Locked) at 1550Memory clock for HiveOS or any other Linux distro at +1700I think you are getting the best performance/power consumption ratio at near 77 Mhsh,if you want more I think it depends on the power factor or also in the memory silicon,if it is samsung,hynix,micron or elpida,they all act differently.Keep in mind though that this card is with Gddr6x and if you run it at full power chances are big for memory temperature to go over 100 degrees and start throttling if you don't have good cooling for the card/rig.",

After replacing the thermal pads, the problem is solved. If you use the fans at full capacity, it will break them. The problem is not always solved by buying expensive video cards. There are a lot of things to consider before building a mining farm.Yeah, thermal pads are problems but even if they can transmit the heat a 100% (no loss), you will be limited by the heat sink(metal quantity and airflow design). Even if you use the best of the best thermal pads and the heat sink is just 100grams of metal, you are not going to cool those cards whatever you do....maybe by putting them infront of an AC will do lol.Here is an example: 290/290x, when they are released the coolers are not enough, then same chip (refresh) 390, bigger cards, bigger coolers then the true potential of 290/290x are realized.I had R 390s and they were very hot too. But they were much better than the R 290.But if we are talking about heatsinks for the 3080ti/3080, then these models have high-quality cooling, and when replacing thermal pads, the problem with the hashrate drop ends.Not all have high quality cooling, palit 3080ti gaming pro is one. Just pointed it out that there are 1080tis that have better coolers(bigger) than some 3080ti, they are all good enough but in mining where you are reaching the temp limit of your mining area, you may have the chance to add 3-5 more gpus compared cheaper coolers (the room might get a bit hotter but the cards can handle it).I just observed, didn't look at the datasheets but 1080ti core is hot vram(gddr5x) is not as hot as gddr6x, now 3080ti, core is hot plus the vrams(gddr6x are hotter than gddr5x), imagine that 3080ti has a smaller cooler than the 1080ti.The 3080ti suprim x has exceeded the size of that 1080ti..suprim x is a superb cooler.",
