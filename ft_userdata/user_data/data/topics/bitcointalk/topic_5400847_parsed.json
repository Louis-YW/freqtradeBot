  "content": "Hello!I found about 3000+ ponzi scheme working sites operate with tron wallets.To this date of the post the links that I will send maybe will stop workin in the few months.You can check 1 2 links and see some youtube video, no need to post all I found that comes every day.https://89999new.com/#/loginhttps://thsdwshop.org/#/https://bentleymoney.in/Login.aspxhttps://volusion111.com/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS-38ZJ0MaMSo most of u get the point. It's MMM - something between MLM and HYIP.Users register via referral link only /there are exceptions/.User deposit usdt to scam site wallet via binance platform. After a successful deposit the user send screenshot from binance deposit to scam site support via whatsapp.The support check the income address and set virtual dolars to user account deposit equivalent.User start to make orders that are fake receives a commission. 50 orders a day. If user have users under him via referral he gets commission from them if they deposit and make \"orders\" every day. If u enter with 100$ U will get 250$ after 30 days. if u have 2000$ after 30 days 5000$.If u wanna withdrawal u send request via ponzi platform. Support check it and they decide to allow or not.Mostly in 1st 2 3 months there is no problem, but if U deposit a large sum of money the support block your withdrawal and ask from u to get more people under u with deposits.U know how it ends for the last users that join. When they close the scenario is the same - they lie that they have been hacked, they lie about everything and they say that all accounts are locked and they want 100 to unlock and close within a week. Wallet is growing relentlessly. Wallet can keep track of what's coming in and out of it.Ponzi.So this 3000+ I found - about 5 every day I see they are the same.I know how u like ponzi here....yeah yeah. And scam pm's will start after this post but anyway does anyone have the code on this platform ?",

And scam pm's will start after this post but anyway does anyone have the code on this platform ?It's very clear what a Ponzi scheme is, and it's considered a scam here. From what you posted, I can see you understand that it's scam, but I don't understand why you are looking for the code (I guess you mean referral code?)",

Say it curiosity, call it love or I want to work with this code. Reasons as much as you want. I see that you do not delete such topics here.In this forum I use search option and check that there are many ponzi scheme posts and active links to github but 100% of all code is from 2008 and works on php 5.*",
