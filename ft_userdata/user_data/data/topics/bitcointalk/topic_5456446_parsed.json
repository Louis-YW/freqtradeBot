So far, the project has managed to raise $500,000 out of the planned $750,000 to $3 million. While there are a few influencers who have been following the project, it's worth noting that Gain associates have also expressed their support and mentioned it on a few occasions in their Telegram group. Personally, I aspire to contribute to the project in some capacity before the crowdfunding campaign takes place next month, and I genuinely wish them success",
