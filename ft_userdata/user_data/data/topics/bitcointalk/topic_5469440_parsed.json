People shall leave this platform but i guess if majority of hunters were using the empty wallet. That's why the hacker was not able to farming as much as when they were hacking defi or another platform like exchange site.

I've saw on twitter that there are other similar platforms that are hacked and encouraging everyone to revoke the access to their wallet. This is why we should use other wallet to connect to platforms. This shows how easily our wallet can get wiped if incident like this happen again.",

Revoke.cash already made a tool for users to verify whether their wallets were part of the compromised wallets during the hack: https://revoke.cash/exploits/galxe?chainId=1Galxe already wrote a post-mortem: https://blog.galxe.com/oct-6th-dns-security-incident-statement-0cfc789bf9dcIt was a Frontend hack that originated with some impersonation and involved some redirection of the website to a phished version and users that interacted with that phished version were the ones that got compromised.",

It's a blessing in disguise about me turning on notifications in Galxe's updates in X, in which I've done my homework.As I have triple checked everything until today my wallet is healthy. No unauthorized transactions or balance drains happening in it. The address that was mentioned by Galxe for me to revoke, good thing it was not on my records for authorizing signatures or so. Make sure that from time to time when we are not using any Dapps, always make a habit of disconnecting and revoking permissions. Web3 still has long ways to go to ensure that this hacking incidents won't happen again.But stay SAFU and vigilant always as hackers are not stopping to find new ways to infiltrate our hard-earned money.",

One which you already mentioned that many wallets is still compromised where they gives permission to the hacker contract and still not revoked.The second one which mentioned by Galxe in their tweet. Galxe has updated their website while many user still seeing the phising site(old) due to DNS propagation and there are some people who are still connecting accountsÂ  Source tweet I have followed all social links of platforms i used daily and Gakxe,Taskon,Layer3 are some which I used frequently. If anyone has followed, I hope he would be safe as the news of hacking was disclosed at the twitter. I disconnected my wallet in no time.Â  I believe that more than 10% people still don't know about this incident because they are just airdrop hunters andÂ  have no interest in learning.",
