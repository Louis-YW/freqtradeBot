Though, a downtime didn’t reflect in the site downtime records within the last 24hours which implies, there wasn’t anything major about it. Which gives reasons to be cool about these brief sessions!There operandum is based on the networking of servers as in quote;QuoteThis server check is performed from an edge node closest to you, from a network that is present in over 285 cities and 100+ countries. We then check the server status code returned to show you if bitcointalk.org is up or down.Still a good one.",

There's much competition and with similar cryptocurrency platforms like bitcointalk.org who won't hesitate to take down the platform at any chance giving.Severally it has been due to a technical glitch on different occasions but we shouldn't assume it to always be a technical glitch when such challenge occurs. We should also weigh other options too.",
