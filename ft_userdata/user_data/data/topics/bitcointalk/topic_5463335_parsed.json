As for the wallets that have say tutorial  in built in them they are certainly few, although short demos are there to guide you for your first transaction but to have everything as a tutorial I think only centralized exchanges actually offer this functionality. The most common one is the binance Academy. But this isn’t a wallet but an exchange so do not go and save your funds there. Stick to wallets and if you run into any problems you can simply bring it up on the forum, there are capable hands to help you",

You are already aware that you need to keep the password to your Fiat account safe. The difference is that you need to keep your wallet seed phrase and password safe. Most wallets have tutorials on how to use them and you can also find many tutorials on the internet. You should start using the wallet by transacting small sums. You can also practice using two wallets to send and receive funds between themselves to help you master the wallet.

What wallet do you need. hehe. Just kidding dear. There is no such thing like Pro wallet or newbie wallet. Because if you started to tag things out on the basis of ranks then how you will become a pro one day.Why will you chose to be newbie because if you will chose the newbie wallet you will not become pro one until you use the pro one. SO, all wallet are equal security and UI levels and to understand about wallets you have to learn the basic of them from different sources. Instead of asking for one that is better for newbie. Because every wallet has sending and receiving options but some wallet are decentralized and provide some good level of securities like 2FA and Multisig etc. If you try not to use them then how will you succeed one day in making your side completely secure.",
