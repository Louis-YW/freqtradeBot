      "body": "Yes it can, but only when you're careless with your login details.We have several webpages that are designed to look exactly like Bitcointalk if you're not vigilant enough to take note of the web url you might think it's the actual Bitcointalk forum and if you should try to login into the fake bttalk your login details might get stolen. And it doesn't only apply to bttalk alone. There have been cases where users receive email containing phishing link and since most of them ain't acquainted with how to identify a phishing link it lead to them exposing some sensitive information that should have been kept private, for example Credit cards number, Wallet secret phrases, private key etc...But just leaving your account idle without using it or exposing your login details I'm not sure if it'll be that easy for it to get hacked.  update:By searching \"phishing quizzes site:Bitcointalk.org\" I was able to find this [LEARN & EARN] Phishing Quizzes - Beginners & Experts (You should consider checking out that thread if you want learn how to identify and prevent a phishing attack. ~Valar~",

I want to know if it's possible for my account to be hacked.Yes, it is. As said, the easiest is phishing sites impersonating bitcointalk.A very important part is to learn how to have your own local bitcoin wallet, how to sign a message with an address of your wallet (see here, easiest may be with Electrum), then stake your address. This will help you recover your account if it's hacked.",

It's not some great wisdom, nor does it require you to be some kind of super IT expert. When you are sure that you are on a legitimate forum, simply save that link in your bookmarks browser, and use only that link to visit the forum.Use a special e-mail that will be connected only to this forum, and set a unique and sufficiently complex password for that e-mail.The password you will use to log in to the forum should also be unique and should contain random characters (lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters of at least 10+ characters).Save all this data offline and never share it with anyone, which means that you do not log into the forum via public Wi-Fi or shared computers.Refrain from downloading risky content and visiting sites that may contain malware/viruses - and do not click on suspicious links in your e-mail.",

Some of the posts above already give pointers to pre-emptive measures you can take.There is also a topic on what to do where it to happen. Reading through you’ll see that staking a bitcoin address you fully control (i.e. generally one from a non-custodial wallet), from which you can sign a message, is one of the centre piece in account recoveries. (PGP is a valid alternative, but most go with the bitcoin staked address).",

Depends on how careless or careful you are with your devices and how strong or weak your account password is.Make sure you turn on 2FA of the email you used to register your forum account. Default, your email address is hidden at your profile page, remember don't turn it on.

I want to know if it's possible for my account to be hacked.The answer is preety simple that anything connected over internet has potential risk of being hacked and the forum account is also one of them if we are pretty negligent about it like sharing your mail over public in the forum or giving someone you don't trust the access to your device where you have logged in to the forum.There are many ways but you should always be careful in these matters and follow above links for your safety.The safety lies in your hand and you need to take necessary steps as precautionary measures against these hacks.",

      "body": "If you are too concerned about the security of your account, then you have seen examples of hacks? Isn't it? The above are great tips that you can use, but I would add a little more. After visiting the forum, always delete the cookies that are stored in the browser. It is advisable to delete everything so that if hackers get your browser data, they cannot get anything. I never open a forum and any other new sites I don't know, at the same time. Try splitting your sessions, or just use a different browser. In addition, do not decorate the browser with different extensions, which can also be dangerous.",
