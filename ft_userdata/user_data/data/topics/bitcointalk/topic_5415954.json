Traderboard does not promise any 'abnormal' return, it's just a software that gives you the opportunity of auto-copying traders from Binance Leaderboard.Who you follow and your profits are both none of our business.And yes, I'm using the tool myself following my favourite Traders.Quote from: palle11 on October 05, 2022, 09:28:02 AMNewbies coming up with apps for copy trading is looking suspicious. I guess you included binance to get traders attracted to the app because I clicked on your link to see if the sign up has any connection with binance but nothing of such. In order to provide auto-copy, we use Binance API.If you don't know what Binance Leaderboard is, inform yourself before defaming.",

      "body": "Hi Friend.I use another app to copytrade binance traders. If you choose a good trader you can always get profit. Now I saw your website. I think it is simular. After my subcription ends in other site I will try your app. But I have 4 questions.1- What is exactly multiplier? Is this setting affect binance leverage or is this multipling the trading amount of the followed trader?2- If I set \"Amounts per Trade\" to 100 usdt, then it will set always 100 usdt per trade or it depends of the amount of followed trader? What happen if followed Trader reduce or increase amount in position? Will it reduce or increase my 100usdt in Position?3- Can I set more then 1 Trader to copy?4- If I run your bot and copy a Leaderboard Trader can I use at same time my binance futures and open my own position?Sorry my english. I hope you understand my questions. I asked the same questions via your assistant on your website. Thank you in advance. Edit: I get all my answers via web site assistant very fast. I will try it.I know exactly what it does.",

Let me further what I was saying. Check this image which I screenshot on Binance leaderboard:All I saw was TraderWagon on Binance after clicking on leaderboard. You can choose to be a lead trader or a copy trader. If you want to read about the benefit of either lead trader (letting people to copy your trade) or copy trader (automatically copying trades of a lead trader of your choice), you can also see that there.I have said it on my first posts that people copy trade directly on exchanges is what I know, not a way to scam people. People should avoid you because it is only what I can say because I do not know what benefit you are providing than a means to scam.",

      "body": "I didn't check your tool and so I am far away to say if it's worth it's price or not. But what I think - even if it would be an attractive offer - it's not a nice thing to offend possible customers even if you feel offended by them. Just think of it, some people read these comments and like to decide if it's worth to try or not. What should we think will happen, if some problems occur? We will get offended too? Criticism should be allowed - even if it's unfair. 29$ a month is a big fee for most people and therefore good customer service should be a must.Personally I think your tool's main target is to copy trades automatically into one's binance account. If I understand correctly, this is your main feature. Please correct, if I am wrong.So my questions are:1. What does the tool do, if I do not have enough cash to follow? 2. What does the tool do, if the leader trades millions that I do not have?3. What happens if trades get worse? 4. Does the tool allow to change leaders on the fly (automatically or manually)?5. Do I have to give something like an API-key to your tool?Please understand, before I like to try out for one month or two, I like to gather some more information. As far as now, I am more interested to know a little bit more than to create a login. There are a lot of scammers in the cryptoworld and so publisher of tools need to give a valuable sum of thrustworthy to me, before I even try to dive into their pages.",

Sure I understand what you say, I just don't like when people get to conclusion too quickly.1) You decide how much to use per trade, so you can do a simple calculation and we can help you with that.2) It trades in percentage, you don't need millions, any amount is fine.3) What do you mean by 'get worse'? 4) Yes you can change the leader you follow at any time though we don't recommend to switch too often.5) Yes you must create binance API and enable futures trading (you can disable withdrawals).Hope you got answers you need",
