My approach to Bitcoin is an approach to it largely as savings: they're out there for when they might come in handy, I sell some occasionally when I need to or when the price is better, and I know I'll need some in the near future. The overall approach doesn't change for me in the bull or bear market, so I'm generally calm about that. I just find Bitcoin a better currency for savings than fiat is because fiat can and does suffer a lot from inflation, whereas Bitcoin seems to grow over time.",

Because 100k USD is not the top and it will go further than that. In fact, I believe Bitcoin will ultimately become the true global money once the governments of the world realize how useless fighting against it is and that Bitcoin will never be fully regulatable.I definitely see 1 million USD being reached within the next decade and even then, Bitcoin will go further and further. In fact, since Bitcoin is capped and therefore has a limited number, each Satoshi can be worth a lot of money in the future. There are around 8 billion people on earth soon. Divide Bitcoin up between 8 Billion. That is the current potential. But the population will grow and Bitcoin will become even rarer and more sought after.Fiat is money in control of the people while Bitcoin is people in control of the money.",

What if your altcoins do not bring profit in this next bull run, you can never be sure with altcoins, they have no usefulness; and calculating what you will do with your altcoin profits is more of a farce, you should convert your altcoins to BTC now because you may not have the chance to do it again when they collapse.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on May 03, 2023, 10:01:52 AMJust wondering what we are all planning to do when Bitcoin does reach $100k - are you selling or are you holding till the 2028/29 bull run? People will do different things, long term holders would continue to hold and spend occasionally like they have always been doing. BTC is a different kind of money, and i don't think i would ever have zero BTC, that is selling off all my BTC's, why would i do that and go back to a censorship currency like fiat, when i can use and control a censorship resistant and permissionless currency like BTC the way i like.",

Just wondering what we are all planning to do when Bitcoin does reach $100k - are you selling or are you holding till the 2028/29 bull run? I doubt that you can do this, Most likely you and others will gonna sold on the previous ATH before we reach again 100K mark. It’s very hard to reach that level due to the psychological barrier since most of institutional investors is on profit that time which they might unload some of there tokens and everyone will follow. I think reaching that level requires this institutional investors unload all there token to distribute to retail traders since their holdings existence will always be a threat for us instead of helping the price pump since they are financial institution and not a charity. If ever 100K reach, I will start unloading my Bitcoin stored in my hardware wallet that kept away out of my reach at this moment. Buying more is dangerous so I will take profit and start buying physical assets that time to secure my profit. Probably I might start my own agricultural farm to generate fix profit while waiting for Bitcoin to correct.",

Yes the probability of it reaching $100k isn’t that high but there many that are skeptical about it. Even though we have more people in bitcoin today and many more to come before the next halving and subsequently the bull run, there are economic crises that could affect it. Aside that even the expensive sale of mining equipment could contribute. Should we also be hit with any saga like those of exchanges then it will certainly affect the price raising negatively. But $100k is certainly achievable as it stands now but also bitcoin is volatile and this Makes it hard to been predictable.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on May 03, 2023, 10:01:52 AMJust wondering what we are all planning to do when Bitcoin does reach $100k - are you selling or are you holding till the 2028/29 bull run? Everyone has a target for every bull run. Some have invested some certain amount to withdraw after the halving regardless of the profit gain whereas there are others that have there funds in bitcoin and even if a $100k is reach today they wouldn’t be withdrawing. Most of these investors are people that save up their retirement funds in bitcoin and they aren’t move by the halving since they have set out a target of selling in probably 10 more years. I don’t know why you are emphasizing on this 2028/29 bull run is anything rumored to be happening? Because personally I have a profit target for each bull run and once each is meet I might be withdrawing them to avoid putting my self on unnecessary risk. Although there’s also some that are saved up for longer time target Quote from: spiker777 on May 03, 2023, 10:39:28 AMIt is very unlikely that I'll reach to $100k in Bitcoin anytime soon. but If i got there by chance then my plans are simple.

Holding is the safest move in cryptocurrency as it could save one from unnecessary losses and as such it seems like the smartest move to me. The likes of trading and selling IDOs requires one to have more knowledge about crypto and Also to been informed about its happenings every time and this is usually hard for someone new in bitcoin. Whereas holding is just buying low or through DCA method and leaving them off in a secure wallet till they hit the profit target.",

You do what you think is best, not what others do, because what you will do with your money and property should be your decision. I believe that most will sell at least part of the BTC they have if the price reaches $100k. It has nothing to do with something that may or may not happen in 5 or 6 years.",

I will advise you to take out your profit now and invest in BTC if you actually have the intention to do so now that the price of BTC is still low.If I eventually see $100k per BTC, I will be very glad, for I estimated $40–60k as the price on my hodling decision, so seeing $100k is another extra profit that I was not expecting.What I will do: It will really be wise for me no to be too greedy, and at the same time not to be in a hurry, I will pick few of my hodlings, sell them and take off my profit at that $100k per BTC, just as a member said here, $100k might be the ATH for the moment but it's not the limit for the entire life time, so for me not to be completely left behind, I will sell off few of my hodlings keep some of it and expect some other higher mover, so that I can sell more again, and if it happens that the price will drop first before it will eventually go back to the top, that gap between when the price will drop and when it will go back up, that's another great opportunity for me to use my accumulated profit and bag more for my self, since I already don't have any mapped out plan for my hodlings assets, their is nothing I really need those funds for now rather than using them to bag as much BTC as I can even if it takes for me to be buying and selling with price positive different on my favor.",

The market often moves against the crowd, I mean, when there are too many people expecting a $100k ATH, it's more likely not to happen. Like when too many people are confident and predict that bitcoin will hit $100k during the bull season in 2021. But in the end, that didn't happen, and many people didn't have time to sell their bitcoins and became reluctant long-term holders. That's also a good idea, and I'll think about it as my goal will also be to sell all my assets in the next bull season.",

Just wondering what we are all planning to do when Bitcoin does reach $100k - are you selling or are you holding till the 2028/29 bull run? Is the statement in bold a guarantee or just another speculation about the price? I noticed that some forum members have wallet addresses displayed on their profiles, and it appears that these wallets belong to them because they have received several donations to those addresses. What intrigued me about these wallets was that, even when Bitcoin was trading above $50k last year, the owners did not move a single sat from their wallet. This made me wonder how long they intend to hold onto their Bitcoin in that wallet. Some of these individuals received their first Bitcoin as far back as 2014 and they are still holding onto it, this proves just how committed they are to the idea of holding and not selling their Bitcoin anytime soon.I am not sure about what I will do if I end up holding a large amount of Bitcoin, but I have until 2028 to make that decision. When that time arrives, I will weigh my options and make a choice. However, I do hope to live long enough to see that year because death can come knock on the door unexpectedly.",

When we actually reach 101k, people will be so euphoric that it's very likely we'll go to 110k or 120k right away. The % gain from the ATH is also not showing 100k as an important level as the last bull market meant a growth of 350% from the  last ATH. Even if this time we were only to go 100%, that would be around 140k USD. So if you ever see 100k, don't go crazy selling everything, because chances are you'll miss out on another 50% move from there. I don't hold bitcoin to look for a good exchange point to exit to fiat. My goal is to have backup money, an inflation hedge, money that cannot be taken from me by the government. I won't sell at 100k and I won't sell at 500k.

I know Bitcoins have capabilities, and these are limited in numbers, so no matter what’s the price of the coin is, i try to accumulate as many coins as i can and store it.
