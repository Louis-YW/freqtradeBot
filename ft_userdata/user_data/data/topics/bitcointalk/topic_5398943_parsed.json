  "content": "The LUNAtic community have been thrown into distress in the late hours of Monday when the CEO of the stable coin DO KWONthat faced the biggest attack in cryptocurrency history in the last week when Luna market price crashed below the trench hold resulting in heavy losses to the stable coin holders, the community hope was beginning to see some light when some top cryptocurrency investors and experts e.g CZ CEO binance and the rest made suggestion of a burn and by a back mechanism in other for luna to make a bounce back. But the LUNA community was disappointed this evening when the CEO announced that the coin will change the chain and forking of the coin many see this as a waste of developers' funds and also minting new coin that will result in a loss of the value of Luna.Luna 2.0 version will this succeed or it will further destroy the stable coin value I do not think what the CEO (DO KWON) is prescribing will give a lasting solution to the LUNA network.Source: https://cryptonews.net/6644139/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign",

Maybe, as of now, he is just saying this revival plan just to save face. But can he really gain the trust again from his holders and investors? Okay, let us give him the benefit of the doubt. But as early as now, if you want to stake your funds on them, better buy bitcoin instead of their forked Luna 2.0. And without his team, I don't think he can carry the burden of his targets here.",

I am convinced that a large majority of investors will do this same.If he wanted to fix the errors that were in the LUNA algorithm, he should do it much earlier.Unfortunately, but after such a huge catastrophe associated with a whole series of mistakes he made, he will never be able to regain confidence in the cryptocurrency market. In my opinion, he should just change the industry.",

It's so hard to see that if LFG has been dumping 80k bitcoin for nothing right now. That's only still 313 bitcoin remaining on LFG wallet. This company is so stupid. They are only burning their money for nothing. So the new only choice to create the new token and then spread it to old of wallets that hodl UST and luna. So far only small amounts of money remaining on the LFG to be distributed again.",

I know that this is the only choice as terra foundation has no money to buy back and burn the tokens from the market. It's also very stupid decision. People will not believe with this blockchain again and im sure that others may be agreed with me about this.

So many fork tokens are worth nothing right now and i think this is enough to be a proof to make sure this proposal is not so effective to recover the lose. The investors are not only the one who have been loosing a lot but the company as well. Im feeling doubt if a miracle can come to this company.

It's very difficult to make up for what people expect, that it will be difficult to develop a new coin even if it has the support of the community but it won't do much for the old luna coin holders, but it will be profitable for new traders who just bought Luna at the lowest price.",

He only care with how try get much profit and actually when launching Luna 2.0 have ideas maybe with making pre sale again. He has take profit first with old Luna coin with added supply and sell trough price keep going dump.
