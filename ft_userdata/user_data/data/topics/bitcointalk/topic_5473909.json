But if you're into the forum, I'd say a yes because I know what you feel and been there done that. There's much more sense to talk and read topics that you are interested with and have some conversation rather than talking with someone in real life when you're not in mood.Quote from: L4rs_ on November 13, 2023, 01:24:05 PMI'm not the most active user on this forum and I haven't been here for long but there are just a few threads who really keep me interested, so I can't really relate to thisThat's okay, you'll learn to feel that someday.",

There is some things it is worth to have issues with but a internet bitcoin forum is not 1 of them.It is not embarrassing for you to share how you feel. There is many people who has some addictions and it can be a internet forum of any kind. And it can also be a mobile device and I think theres lot of people with this addiction.",

Yeah truly there is no work for now. but even when I had a job I was not always far from my mobile device. My mobile device has always serves as an inspiration, most of what I know today is as a result of mobile phone. My love for mobile device is exceptional and I don't get tired when am on it. and my wife has adapt to my lifestyle she doesn't worry anymore.One of the reasons why I spend my time here is because the environment I am is always full of gangsters and walking much might got me kidnapped, not because of having problem with my spouse@mich not that I don't take a break but just fell like to use this opportunity that I don't have work to understand more about bitcoin. I was introduced to the platform long time ago and I was not aware of it's mode of operation and what is all about. But as a lover of phone/internet I gave it a thought, that this my best time to study this forum so if I resume work I can be using the forum to keep myself busy when there is nothing to do.",
