      "body": "Did you write the lyrics? And who sang, who played the melody? I guess more info would be nice to understand how much input is yours. I like the overall feel of it, actually. Some of the lyrics feel a bit stretched to match the song rhythm, and sometimes it was pretty hard for me to understand the sense of some phrases because of pretty advanced vocabulary that you don't expect from a Christmas song. But again, the overall feel is nice. It's light, casual, and it does feel like Christmas. Nice job, op.",

      "body": "Well, a new song about Bitcoin and also Christmas song. I agree with the post above that it is much better if you provide more information about the song like who write the lyrics, the singer and the composer. I will check it out later and maybe I came to like it but who knows. I have heard some crypto song and they did a good job creating it and I enjoyed it a lot when listen to it. It's not everyday that someone or a group of people make songs about Cryptocurrency especially Bitcoin.",

If you wrote the lyrics, then whose voice is that? Yours? Though not my type of beats, you and your partner did well creating this. It really gives the soft Christmas vibe. Have you published this on other platforms? I mean like Spotify, etc? Because on YouTube, people may not be able to consistently stay there to play the song, but with some other audio streaming platforms, they can even put your song on repeat, or even add it to a Bitcoin song playlist where it could reach even more listeners.",

The time and effort given in this piece is meaningful, and it can be used as a form of advertisement for bitcoin to the crowd, as one of the best forms of advertisement is by song or video, but you did it both. Keep up the good work, and I hope you make more pieces like this to encourage more people with talent in the music industry to make more songs dedicated to bitcoin or crypto currency. We don't often see this kind of piece, so it's a big thing and a good thing someone has created a song and video for bitcoin.",

      "body": "I am currently listening to your Bitcoin Christmas song. Would you like some suggestions to improve it? The song has an old-fashioned vibe and should be more upbeat and celebratory for all ages. Suppose you could simplify the lyrics and make them more beginner-friendly with a joyful tune. In that case, I believe people would enjoy listening to it outside of Christmas, especially with the current rise in Bitcoin prices. Thanks for your effort and talent. Not everyone can create Christmas songs without expecting something in return.",

Although the song could have find a good jolly mood in my opinion, feel like it is very sad melody though.But in any case, it's good that we hear something different about Christmas and Bitcoin and what we should do about it (stacking sats).",
