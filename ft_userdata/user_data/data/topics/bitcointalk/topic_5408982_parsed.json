  "content": "I had a conversation with some friends of mine yesterday about Facebook Metaverse and they are like they don't like Zuckerberg, I read online that many don't like this man and yesterday it's been proven. Why do people hate him? Because he changes Facebook to Meta? Here is what people don't know Zuckerberg will be a big eye opening step for the whole metaverse, we will see metaverse projects with centralised systems and decentralised systems but Facebook meta will be centralised and will attract more people until they feel satisfied enough and start feeling to try out decentralised metaverse systems What do you think ðŸ’­",

      "body": "The biggest problem with Meta is centralization. Too much power in hands of Mark and too many decisions can be made by Mark. In technology, things change very fast and just a short period of wrong decision-making can put a corporation in negative growth time.If Metaverse is a future (assume so), Mark has made great decisions and initiatives for Facebook. It's not only about name changing but also the restructure of resources for development. Though, in theory it is a good decision (with assumption that Metaverse is a future), to succeed it requires many factors that we can not judge now. At least Meta is one of leaders in Metaverse and it gives them great advantage.",
