Dont let all these crypto actors and influencers discourage you about bitcoin or it current price, the value remain the same in as much that bitcoin can go as dip as $15k and still maintain close to $27k as at now, we are more expectant innthe coming days for better surge in it price.Quote from: EBMARYAM on May 24, 2023, 06:14:17 AMCrypto traders are uncertain as to how Bitcoin will behave over the next few days, weeks or even months.What are the use and functions of the market indicators when you can sit down to analyze everything and research about it, maybe you could also bring out something useful for other to have a look on as what the present or couple of days will look like, but we also needs to be reminded that bitcoin is a volatile currency, we often forget this, as a bitcoin trader, you can still make more money when bitcoin is dip, not only when it surges we realized income while trading.",

Since 2025 is all I got in mind for my Bitcoin and alt portfolio I don't need to be worried about the price action, I am not even done with accumulation yet lol, so I am fine with whatever Bitcoin is going to throw at the face of every investor this year, I will advise you do the same too because the long term will condone you the most.",

However, it went down in the last 24 hours, so obviously speculators are taking advantage of small increases to make money out of the weak market.So it might continue to trade sideways, nevertheless, still a good time to buy and continue to accumulate before the price blows up again in the future or before the bull run next year.",

      "body": "The Bitcoin's price will hold below $30k during the month of may. The news that you have shared might had a little impact of the price but I won't consider that as the main cause of the price holding. It's true that the Bitcoin has been holding around $27k for few days but soon we will see a huge price action. It can either go down to $26k range or will move up to $30k range after the month of may.The probability of defaulting if below low and that won't take place. Even if it happens the price of the Bitcoin will be impacted in the positive way. The default would work inverse way by altering a short time pump to the Bitcoin according to my speculation. I must say that in some cases there is a probable chance of Bitcoin going below $26k, but I hope that may not happen as that will be a huge burden for the bear market.Well, it has always been this way, the recommendation is to invest only the money that won't impact your life in anyway otherwise you should never invest in Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies. Just think like this way, the money that you put into crypto-currencies is the money that you have just thrown into a river. Just forget about it and set a price range in your mind and stick to that, don't let any emotions bother you during the holding process. The result will be a better future. You'll surely get good returns from your investments.",

Bitcoin investment is never for those who want to make quick money, it takes time and instead of focusing on time it's smarter to focus on more Bitcoin accumulation, do not let the media and FUD steal your Bitcoin from you, selling because you are tired of holding because or the market situation is simply enriching some people that have more patience than you.",
