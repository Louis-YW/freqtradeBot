  "content": "With the creation of Bitcoin and other digital money systems before this and afterwards. All of this was created in the private sector. Traditionally most of the fiat money systems were run and created by some branch of a government or public system.With this possible change of possible hands of where the money gets run and created from what are your thoughts on a private entity creating and controlling a new money system.Sure many of you may have lost confidence in the public system of money. What factors give you confidence in having the private sector control a new money system.Some of these private sectors are corporations too. Business as well, so more less to keep their money system in check, they have to figure ways to earn from the system. More less maintain a profit at least for the business to stay in business.Those are some of the things one must think about when moving the money system to private hands.With having the money in the public system. It is more on controlling the money as a service. Therefore no profit margin is needed when it comes to creating and controlling money in public system.With private sector the system is a different playing field. What factors would you need to maintain confidence in the private sector in creating and controlling a new money system? Thoughts",

It depends on the result.We have PayPal that is a payment system created by the private sector and is 100% centralized and yet people use it despite all of its flaws and weaknesses.Then we have Bitcoin that is 100% decentralized and is not controlled by anybody and people use that too.Then we have shitcoins that are centralized or semi-centralized and are only used to be pumped and dumped and yet people use them too.It all comes down to utility and what people are looking for. If they are looking for financial sovereignty bitcoin is the choice, if they look for a quick buck at a very high risk shitcoins are the choice, and if they want traditional systems then the centralized payment systems including banks are the choice.",

Traditionally most of the fiat money systems were run and created by some branch of a government or public system.This statement seems wrong to me. Actually most fiat money systems were created by private entities and later on, some of them were nationalized and/or regulated by the governments.The US federal reserve was basically a bunch of private banks, back in 1913. The first central banks (created centuries ago)were actually private. They were put under government control decades after their initial launch. The bank of England is a great example.All credit/debit card companies like VISA, Mastercard and American Express are private.All the digital payment services that are using fiat money are private-Paypal, Skrill, Zelle, Cashapp, Venmo. The list goes on and on.There's no \"private vs. public\" dichotomy, when we are talking about financial services. There's actually a symbiotic relationship, the private sector creates the financial innovation, but the government creates the regulation and tries to reduce the amount of financial scams.",

So as an answer to your general question I think the private sector tends to do things more efficiently than the public sector, and money creation was not going to be an exception. I don't mean to say that the private sector is perfect, as there is a lot of garbage in it, and scams, etc. But the public sector tends to be loss-making, so I am not surprised that the best payment system ever created was created and operates without state intervention.  Quote from: odolvlobo on May 29, 2022, 12:48:05 AMMany people might not realize it, but the Federal Reserve is a private entity.

When it comes down to privatisation of financial systems, you already loose the control over your funds. What bitcoin did is out of the box, it is giving us almost 100% control over it. There is no restrictions, there is no middle person or entity who can control it as broker or something.Basically we should not be looking forward to encourage these kinda services, they could change the way it works for us on individual basis.",

We are very much led again to different information about China's CBDC. Its actually a good platform and not meant to monitor us all. Its however still fiat which government digital fiat money is same with the fiat today.Transparency in  blockchain I think made users shift their trust to private currencies but more of Bitcoin actually. Bitcoin is BACKED by the most secured network and energy. USD is not backed with something. Bitcoin is the most trusted because they see there is no CEO that can be lobbied by government officials. If a token ETH are trusted more by users, who wouldn't trust Vitalik? The Russian government can actually hostage Vitalik's family and Putin's government can ask ETH's control. This also applies to ADA with Charles Hoskinson.",

But generally, I trust private corporations even less. The government, at least in a democracy, is held accountable for its mistakes and is at least somewhat under control of the civil society to ensure that there is no significant abuse of power going on. Private corporations, on the other hand, can use money to blind the authorities and are not as bound to, say, care about the safety of their customers' data, about their privacy etc. So fiat is bad, CBDC is worse, but, say, Facebook's centralized crypto is even worse to me. Bitcoin is the best ideologically because it's neither under governmental control nor under control of a private corporation.",
