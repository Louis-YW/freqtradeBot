  "content": "That website https://cryptocurrencyalerting.com/bitcoin-mempool.htmlprovides notifications via email, Telegram, Discord ... for mempool but it is not much useful. Because the option is for mempool size (total).I think it would be more useful if notification is for lowest fee rate in sat/vbyte for 1 or 4 MB from tip of mempool.A second site is https://txfees.watch/It has a feature I discussed but only provides notification via email.I think it will require a little bit modifications. Anyone can build it?Just my 2 sats idea for community as I knew some members built Telegram noification bots for other things.",
