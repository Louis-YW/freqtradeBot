  "content": "Hi,As we know Bitcoin was made for cash payments in the world. It’s system is designed and updated to perform over hundred years. Thus, one day with dollar inflation (if it still exists) and bitcoin desinflation, 1 satoshi or 0,00000001 BTC would has 1 dollar price or more. So, how to buy a item that cost less than the 1 satoshi price, considering that it is the smallest division (the BTC atom) of the bitcoin?The way I see it today, this problem could have two solutions:1. An upgrade making BTC having more divisible units. I think this is difficult because the bitcoin community has to change the original design of the project. And Satoshi Nakamoto must had thought that this day would come, was itentional the ideia that 1 satoshi could value the price of a expensive itens without the option of a pay back? We have to think that the purpose on the subject of bitcoin’s whitepapper mention the words cash payments, so bitcoin was design to it.Or2. Governments make it’s coins starts to being backed in bitcoin. Thus it’s coins and money could be more divisible and it would be a integrative way of the two systems. This way could be more easy to change and modify as soon as needed without any change in the original bitcoin’s system. However, people are going to not moving satoshis in the Bitcoin network, using the governmental network to pay things that cost less than 1 satoshi with payback.Today bitcoin is saw too as a value reseve over time (as gold) but the bitcoin originally was design to cash payments. So what do you think if the day the 1 satoshi has the price of expensive things? How to make a payback?Thank you",

But if something like that ever happens, we could have a hard fork to change some of the consensus rules regarding the supply and divisibility. A simple shift right one or two positions could be enough and UInt64 used for amounts already has some higher empty bits.#2 can not happen since you can never mix centralization (fiat) with decentralization (bitcoin).",

So it is certain that if one day there is inflation in the dollar and it occurs 1 satoshi = $ 1 dollar then surely at that time the price of goods will soar due to inflation in the dollar itself. so there will likely be no more items selling for under $1.",

We have to think that the purpose on the subject of bitcoin’s whitepapper mention the words cash payments, so bitcoin was design to it.Since we are talking about the bitcoin and cryptocurrencies market everything can be possible and we can't say if one satoshi will be worth more than one dollar or not because we know the inflation rate is rising every year and us dollar is losing it value against many assets an in other hand bitcoin price is bullish in long term, so that's possible. But even if this happens one day I guess people will start using other smaller current units instead of satoshi and even if that's necessary we will have an upgrade on the bitcoin core project for that.",

No one is going to do an upgrade because of that, and if an upgrade would happen, who will champion it? And do you think government care so much about Bitcoin to the point of working on your second suggested solution?Well, if 1 satoshi reaches $1 which I don't think is feasible soon, it would only increase the transactional cost, nothing else would be affected.",
