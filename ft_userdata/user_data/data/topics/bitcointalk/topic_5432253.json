If you try to break the laws, you maybe charged more with penalties later. Better pay your taxes legally on time.Alternatively, if you're doing bigger deals in crypto, why not move to a more crypto friendly country who take none or very less taxes on crypto (you can find many on google by yourself). Btw, would you mind posting your country's name?",

As far as ATM considered they will not ask you for KYC for limited cash but after that you may have to go for taxation. The best way-Pay only at shops where bitcoin is accepted. Pay to the peer directly from your wallet. OrConvert amount of bitcoin into fiat which is your calculated expense on monthly basis. Keep rest into bitcoin. Only pay taxes for expenses which will get reduced anyways since they are expenses.",

What is my best option to not get this money tracked and taxed?My simple advice to you in this regard is that you should be transparent about this as possible you could. Let me start by saying that it's the fault of the government of many countries for not making the adequate provision for a thing like this so that they could genuine tax transactions as it's being made. Instead, they are fighting crypto which supposes to earn them more revenue.As this is not your fault and there are no adequate provisions by law in this regard in most cases, just continue with your business and let your bank tax you only when you move monies from crypto to fiat.",

If the BTC address is not linked to your business, I guess that BTC is not recorded in your cashier's ledger and maybe it's safe to just use the BTC but if it's recorded there then it's taxable.Pay up your tax, after all, you are a citizen of your country.",

What is my best option to not get this money tracked and taxed?Why do you want to avoid taxes? Be a good citizen and pay your taxes honestly to avoid future hassles. Personally I don't recommend anyone to avoid taxes. In my country, I am legally liable to keep all records of my income for 7 years. The income tax department can contact me if they need any clarification for the transactions done 7 years earlier. So it's a serious matter. If you absolutely don't want to pay taxes, use anonymous cryptos like XMR or Zcash. Bitcoin is not fully anonymous!",

What is my best option to not get this money tracked and taxed?First i am not vast in tax laws but in my country, there is what is call income tax which means every amount that enter.an individual accounts is taxed.And also company tax is there and since you said, you recently start accepting bitcoin as payment means you have an existing company whcih is registered and duely taxed. But in the absenceof the above points ecery other ways and means you got your Bitcoin payment untaxed means a tax invasionand if you are guilty, you may face penalties.Â Quote from: franky1 on December 29, 2022, 01:07:26 PMif you are not well versed in the methods of legal tax avoidance, either find an accountant or dont take the riskbecause if you dont follow the loopholes that allow tax avoidance legally, you are then doing tax evasion whichcomese with stiff penalties far beyond what you can save(if you are discussing amounts under $1k)Yes a lot of individuals and companies in my country have been involved in tax invasion and because of weak tax laws in my region quite a good number of them are doing it but at the long run, the law will cash upon them.And from the title of the thread, one can easily see how ops mention laundering which points to potential tax invasion, and best for oos to take time and under the legal implication of tge crime and what it will cost him to be up.to date and the vest way to do that is through income tax.",

Question is, would the amount of bitcoins you have received as payment enough for you to not give a fuck about the future problems it may cause to you and your business? If the answer is yes, then go ahead and don't declare it as part of your profits; launder it as much as you can. If the answer is no, then just go to your tax department and ask for consultation on what needs to be done in order for you to continue receiving bitcoin payments and not cause a hassle to yourself in the future.
