Maybe during tourism, I may not consider that because I like to be extra careful while being on a foreign land. Some people gamble on land based casinos very well, not yet the thing of the past, but people are more exposed to gambling with the online casinos, it makes gambling easier done as you can play on your phone at anytime.",

I rarely travel but there are times when visiting family or relatives, we do make a plan on going to a casino that is near the area and have a good time.",

Of course, online casinos are the best. we can gamble without our neighbors and relatives knowing. don't care about them I just have fun at the casino and earn money.",

You can just test out a few bucks and then see where it's going.If you have time to allocate and visit those casinos in the country where you're going then it's up to your availability.Since the pandemic, I can no longer travel freely anymore. But if given the chance, I'd like to visit them, the closest to the port or airport if I travel.",

Do you visit casinos when you travel? How often? Which ones? Let's remember of old good times  I don't remember good old times from these offline casinos,they are rigid in the form that they cannot offer you the same number of slot machines available in online casinos from all the great providers we have and their game play mechanics of most of their slots is old and outdated to say the least.Some of them still use Admiral games or Apex or any other provider which are not that well known compared to our greatest providers like Play n Go,Pragmatic Play,Hacksaw gaming,No limit city and Relax gaming to name a few.Based on this I am not at all tempted to go and visit them because I have everything I need in my mobile phone nowadays and that is the great thing about technology,it empowers and makes our life easier.",

I made a couple of bad decisions and greedy bets. In the end, I was so frustrated during my whole trip because I keep thinking about my loss and I can’t focus on my vacation. Gambling while traveling is a bad idea because it can kill the mood if your purpose of travel is to have fun. Much better to gamble when you have time to focus and your mind is not occupied by other things.",

Do you visit casinos when you travel? How often? Which ones? Let's remember of old good times  Well visiting an offline casino seems to have more fun when you did not come from that place. But most of the time when I was in travel, I did not visit gambling casinos because I enjoyed those tourist places that commonly visit. Perhaps for me --Las Vegas is a nice place to visit when it comes to gambling casinos and I want to see a decent gambling room in any place abroad. However, online gambling casinos or i-games gambling industry is now very popular, so why I will spend time going to offline casino if they are the same and it is not popular the same Las Vegas?",

I gamble very little, just online (I went a couple of times to a Bingo in my city and it was nice, but they closed), so when travelling abroad I have been more interested in other entertainments, and I never thought about visiting casinos before.But I suppose that, taking into account the trend to virtualise everything, long time ago established casinos will be more and more a rarity in this world, so the next time I visit foreign cities I will consider visiting them, as something cultural more than to gamble my money there. Maybe to take a shot and see how others play. Nothing to say if I ever visit Las Vegas or Montecarlo.",

Not because I want to earn something from gambling abroad, but rather to get an impression on what's going there with my own eyes. And if you ask me what casino I would like to visit the most, it's this placeThe Venetian Macao. Has anyone from around here visited it? Share your memories and maybe photos, guys, please.",

Let's remember of old good times  There are a lot of people who travel because they want to visit casinos, why would people go to Macau, that's because of the casinos, Macau's casinos are the best in the industry, if you're a long-time player of physical casinos even if you shifted to online casinos you will still be curious to visit casinos on countries that you've visited, old habits just don't die easily especially if you're a gambler, the offline casinos are very much alive, there are people who still prefer the ambiance of playing in physical casinos.",

You mean the casino visited is a real/physical casino operating in a building/apartment/residential......!If that's what you mean, before the pandemic I used to visit often, but not recently, my country is currently in chaos. Residential casinos are not convenient to visit, Since the arrest of one of the governors in one of the provinces of my country, that's when many casinos are uncomfortable to visit.Before any action from the authorities carrying out routine raids, I used to often visit the casino located in the Robinson Apartments, I love visiting the casino there, if I go there it's like I am in Las Vegas, the casino there only operates three days a week, friday, saturday and sunday now i don't know anymore, risk.Although at this time there are still casinos that are comfortable to visit when traveling, but I'm a little tired of visiting there, I'm happier now betting and playing on online gambling sites rather than offline.",

Do you visit casinos when you travel? How often? Which ones? Let's remember of old good times  For me it's a definite yes. When I am travelling with friends and there is a fancy casino in the city we are in, we will definitely go there one evening and spend some money. Physical casinos have a great atmosphere and flair, that makes a good night out. Even when you only gamble a little it can still be fun to visit a casino. Usually there is very good food and affordable drinks in a casino and you can watch other gamblers play. It's been some time since I went to a casino during a vacation trip because of the covid pandemic. Before covid I used to travel one time per year to Prague or Amsterdam with 2 good friends and part of that trip was always to go to a local casino. A vacation trip is not a bad idea in general, because they usually have great hotels that are much cheaper than usually. If everything goes well I might be able to go to Macau next year, it's one of my dreams for a long time.",
