      "body": "When I watch this video, I really wonder how it is possible that Voyager had as many as 2.7 million clients who were so naive, and what's more, illiterate that they didn't even read the basic conditions that could cause them to lose the money they invested. It is incredible that Voyager gave loans to various, at the very least, dubious projects and companies, one of which was the infamously failed Luna of the now well-known South Korean scammer.When all that is taken into account and considering all the famous people who participated in it, it seems to me that all the companies from Voyager, Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, Terra/Luna participated in a literally criminal enterprise from the beginning. The damage they caused is certainly measured in more than $100 billion, and as far as I know, no one has been charged with anything yet (and the question is whether they ever will be).",

Responsible ones for the platforms didn't manage risks properly. They didn't care for investors' funds. They simply gave money away to scammers who borrowed money without giving enough collateral on counterpart to cover possible losses that ended becoming a reality. They criticize the traditional banking system and the constant print of money from thin air, although they are also adepts of putting investors' funds in currencies made of thin air (useless altcoins).",
