If you want to be a wallet developer, you will learn more about programming languages of the operating system that people are mostly using. You may not be a programmer and hold bitcoin instead. There is also another called mining. Once you have started to learn about bitcoin, you will choose the aspect that is best for you.",

You can learn HTML and make websites about cryptocurrency and bitcoin. Also HTML is easy to learn and you can understand other coding languages if you have knowledge of HTML.The choice is yours. What I am saying is get your basics first before jumping into other coding languages.",

      "body": "If you really want to learn programming, then your choice of language has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Code related to Bitcoin is written in all kinds of languages.I would suggest Python or Javascript for learning. But ultimately the languages that you use for production code may be something else.",

With python you could use libraries like \"bitcoinlib\" to further delve deeper into Bitcoin and blockchain development. You can use Python to create your own wallets and even you can create your own wallet software by using python programming language. In that case you could use library like \"python-bitcoinrpc\" to have direct communication with Bitcoin core and perform wallet related operations, and you could also use other library \"pywallet\" for creating such software. The programming language isn't limited for Bitcoin development only, you could use it to develop your own programs and games by learning various libraries.If you want to learn a programming language to support Bitcoin core development then you should go with C++ language. Bitcoin core is developed with C++ and if you master that programming language then you could support further development of the core. You could contribute your code for the enhancement of the core and that's really possible if you learn C++ in depth. This is the link to the core repository: Â https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin You should visit the link and learn more about it and its codebase. After that you could start providing your support in improving the core with your ideas and that way you will be a part of Bitcoin developer community.",

Learning it all together will get overwhelming.I suggest you start with Javascript - Python - C++. Just start from somewhere and build up your knowledge.",
