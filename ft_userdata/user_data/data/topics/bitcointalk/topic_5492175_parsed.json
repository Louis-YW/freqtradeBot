I think money can make anyone do anything so if the transaction fee is more than enough, any miner can ignore the “ethical concerns” and just process it.I think it should be the other way around. Even though the fee is set super high, no one dares to mine it as it is no longer “ethical concerns”, it is legal problems.. considering that all the mining pools except (Ocean) require KYC. Do you think anybody dares to touch that?So, eventually, no one will want to mine that. It will sink to the very bottom of the mempool.This is my thought. Feel free to feel differently.

Since blockchain transactions are public, people would notice the movement, leading to speculation and possibly impacting Bitcoin's price. However, I think miners, who validate transactions, are primarily motivated by the transaction fees and the block reward, not the origin of the funds. They might not necessarily refuse to confirm such transactions unless there's a legal directive to do so. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin means there isn't a central authority to block or reject transactions based on their history. It would be a significant event, but on my mind the funds could indeed move if someone attempts to do so.",

If a miner will not confirm a tx for whatever reasons, another miner will definitely pick it up as long as the required transaction fee is paid. Also if it gets confirmed, there's not going to be a blowback from the authorities for confirming the tx from a blacklisted address, since it is practically impossible to verify the identity of miners who process a transaction.",

The transactions will be included to the block and confirmed ASAP especially they willing to pay high fees.In as much as we have many miners and decentralization is a core part of bitcoin i wouldn’t be surprised to see some pools actually refusing to include the transaction into their block. We have seen in the past how pools like F2Pool and Mara have both censored some transactions they believed is illegal. What if many of this pools actually see this bitcoins too as stolen coins and don’t want to have them in their wallet. Although it will be bad and to me a direct attack on the decentralized system of bitcoin but I wouldn’t be too surprised.

Only binance even has up to $5Bn liquidity so the impact could be more of it is moved between many exchanges and sold there",
