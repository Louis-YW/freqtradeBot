Allow your child grow and explore all their investment options while guiding them with relevant knowledge and information.Quote from: sokani on January 17, 2023, 04:48:30 AMI believe this would in a little way help promote mass adoption of in my locality and the nation at large.Almost certainly not. No one would purchase an asset cause a random person bears that name, it would just be a story for bloggers at a time and can attract little attention, but nothing in the long term.Quote from: sokani on January 17, 2023, 04:48:30 AMIt would pop up questions like... what is bitcoin? Who created bitcoin? What are the advantages of bitcoin? How does one acquire bitcoin? etc... Â And this would accord me the opportunity to enlighten them about bitcoin and the advantages it has. How about starting a course to teach about bitcoin and interested people would find you out?- Jay -",

Dolla\" which has a meaning behind why the name is taught but in case of bitcoin, am totally in support of bearing the name but it would have been for yourself and not the new born child.",

I wouldn't agree on this, and it is not nice because for sure he/she will be bullied at school because of this, and for sure he/she will be hardheaded towards you and ask why you named him Bitcoin.

If you want your child to grow non-confident, secretive or even alone - continue what you are doing. You have said that you have chosen such name, because you believe in Bitcoins potential. What an awful way to express your support. If you are such a Bitcoin believer, why dont you have changed your name and surname? You know that adults can change their given name?

Sometimes people even find what is good and benefit by themselves not still we continue to make awareness of it. I believe Bitcoin is a better alternative currency to fiat currency and also good investment idea that people will later be looking for not still make much awareness of it. so i don't make much awareness rather than people see in me.",
