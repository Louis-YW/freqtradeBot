These ponzi-like systems print out tokens to reward their users; and printing tokens to no end is inflating the supply into oblivion.",

This will involve each individual site you are interested in.When using a crypto related app, or any app at all on your device, you have to verify the source; It gets bonus points if it is open source.If it is not open source, then you can consider it to be untrustworthy and never share sensitive information on it.Also, if a game or app presents an offer in redeemables that seems too good to be true. it probably is not true.",

People buy tokens, mint NFT, playing to earn. Then what is next after earning? They have to sell tokens on market to actually get cash and earn it. It is how selling pressure comes and how price of earn token (reward) will become disaster.",

For example, you've tried all of those that you've mentioned and you've made decent money from them, that can affect your trust to them and you're likely to say that you're trusting them because they made you money. That's why if it's about asking the trust of others for particular projects, there are bias answers and as well as subjective and reasonable answers as to why they think that the project and app is trustworthy and why not.",

Has anyone here made anything of value from either playing the games or using such applications?Don't give any overwhelming trust to any of them even if they provide promising profit to their investors since we don't know how they will end up or how long they will last. If you want to invest on the platforms you mention you better check the background as well the price history of their token so that you will not invest late or get a problem when those platform starting to give a head ache to their investors. Make sure always to sell once you are starting to accumulate their tokens to secure your capital and after that its up to you to decide what's next action you want to do.",

Has anyone here made anything of value from either playing the games or using such applications?Dont have any idea nor have the experience on acquiring these coins from playing games aside from the current NFT-based games we do have today but speaking on what you had mentioned above then earningby completing some simple task like walking or playing simple games and then acquiring it easily? Its good to hear off and good to acquire but dont expect that you would really be making nasty amounts of itwhich you cant even know if it would really be getting some value soon and if ever they do have some value but its just too low then the efforts you had made would really be just getting your some peanuts.So its up to you whether you would really be tending to get serious on accumulating these coins or would be putting yourself into other path?",

The reason is on the beginning, there's less people play, so the tokens are limited. When it's hyped, the price will increase and attract new people to play, due to limited token, not many people can afford or have it. Then, they will ask the developer to mint more token or increase the max supply, this will make the price drop due to no limited token. In the end, it will become worthless.",

So we need to think twice if we gonna invest on this and if we really like the idea or the game we better sell if we are in profit since securing profit is best than being a bag holder.",

Using application to participate in the game or any activity that will paid you tokens that can be redeemed into the stable tokens. How can bunch of people using the apps if they didn't even trust it? You must also use your logic. You didn't even need to buy any NFT if you wanna earn small amounts of money. Keep actively using the apps for that and you will able to earn based on sharing reward.",

So those rewards are nothing but which is same thing that exists now recreating the same thing with new technology still with no actual real utility.",

This is main problem when dealing with the play to earn gameHow do you know that so many people are playing the game? By looking at their statistics? But that can be fake out easily. Maybe there are legit players which are trying hard because they don't know anything that is legit and worth their time. They are still hoping on the promise given to them.And just because it's free, its also mean that is trusted already? I think that's a bad approach. We may not lose money but we can lose our precious time. If only we will be using that time into something which is really worth it, we can feel much better and maybe we can earn some cash. Many people play axie as a scholar where they didn't spend any penny but they are now complaining and leaving the game due to the cheap value of the token.",
