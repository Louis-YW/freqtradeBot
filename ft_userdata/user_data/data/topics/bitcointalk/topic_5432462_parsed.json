The Bitcoin Forum has been going through various changes, expansions, plans over time.  From 22 November 2009 to 17 June 2013 the forum rank fluctuated with no activity.At that time, the rank would change only when the full member had 100 posts, the senior member had 250 posts, the hero member had 500 posts and the legendary member had 1000 posts.18 June 2013 to 23 January 2018 requires activity with Bitcoin forum posts.  Brand New requires 0 posts 0 activities, Newbie 1-28 posts 28 activities, Junior members 30 activities, Members 60 activities, Full members 120 activities, Senior members 240 activities, Hero members 480 activities, Legendary members 960 activities.Since 24th January 2018, activity as well as merit system has been introduced.  Now it's not just about activity but it has to have merit number.Brand new/Newbie (0 activity, 0 merits)Junior member (30 activity, 1 merit required)Member ( 60 activity, 10 merit required)Full member ( 120 activity, 100 merit required)Senior member (240 activity, 250 merit required)Hero member (480 activity, 500 merit required)Legendary member ( 960-1000 activity, 1000 merits required)Please visit here for more information: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5170032.msg51993801#msg51993801",

These limits will be reduced to the point where you shouldn't usually notice them after you have participated in the forum for a few weeks. If you are on the forum to talk, then that's all you really need to know about rank. Don't worry about it too much, and you will eventually rank up.If you want to maximize your rank, then you need to increase two statistics which are listed on your profile:Activity, which is maximized by posting once per day on average. Posting more than that is useless in raising your activity.Merit, which is gained by making good posts.If you make ten thousand posts in a week, your activity will be capped and you will still be a Newbie. If you make ten thousand useless posts over any period of time, you will gain zero merit and you will still be a Newbie. You can rank up only by making good posts consistently. It's quality over quantity.When trying to write quality posts, a lot of people act as though they're writing a book report for school: putting facts that we already know into their own words. Nobody wants to read that, and you will not get merit for it. Moreover, the length of your post and the quality of your English are only minor factors. In trying to write a quality post worthy of merit, you should offer new ideas, personal experiences, or perspectives that other forum users will actually find new and interesting.It is good if you know about Forum purposes because it can help you be a better member in this community.QuoteThe purpose of the forumThis forum exists to provide a platform for the free (but ordered) exchange of ideas. If you have an idea to express, then it is probably possible to do it here as long as you follow the rules.A lot of people come here primarily looking to make money. The forum administration is very happy that people are able to use the forum in order to better themselves; indeed, one of the reasons for Bitcoin's creation was to break the artificial barriers which prevent so many people around the world from attaining prosperity. However, if your attempts to make money conflict with the forum's primary goal of enabling discussion, then you are swimming upstream, and you will not be sucessful in the end.If you view the forum as some sort of \"job\" where you complete some basic tasks and get paid, then you will almost certainly be disappointed, and the forum administration will not be sympathetic. If you do make money using the forum, then it will be through innovation and entrepreneurship, not any sort of mindless busywork.",

Take it constructively, but many merited posts are not generated by a quick thought, but rather require the author to elaborate a bit more based on either his already pre-acquired knowledge, or cross-referencing reading different sources on a matter, in order to become more fluent in it. Generally speaking, conversations taking place in off-topic are not going to be of much interest, and subsequently, won’t postulate to obtaining merits.Fun fact: You can, in fact, be re-ranked, though that is more of an anecdote, and takes place when posts are deleted by one or other party, to the point of losing Activity:https://public.tableau.com/views/BitcointalkMeritDashboard/De-ranked?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link",
