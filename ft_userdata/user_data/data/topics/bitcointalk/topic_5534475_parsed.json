As we already know, hodlers are people who hodl bitcoin for long periods of time; they are determined not to sell for the long term irrespective of the price change.Now here comes my question: If those who buy and hodl their coins on a noncustodial wallet where they have full control over the coin are referred to as hodlers, are those who also hodl under a custodial service where they don’t have full control of the coins also regarded as hodlers?If you leave your coins on a custodial exchange, the exchange is the one holding your coins and not you. What's available in your balance is what they can manually input. Since you don't have full control of the coin, you shouldn't be considered a hodler.Quote from: Synchronice on March 06, 2025, 09:46:31 PMNot your keys, not your coins (and not being a HODLer)Your keys, your coins (and you are HODLer)",

Someone who keeps their crypto coins on an exchange shouldnt really be called a \"hodler,\" at least not in a serious way. But, you know, it kind of depends on how we define \"hodler.\"If we think of a \"hodler\" as someone who saves, but specifically with Bitcoin, then we can compare it to how saving works in regular money. You can save money by keeping it at home, like in a piggy bank or a safe, and you can also save it by putting it into a savings account at a bank or another place that holds money for you.",

While holding it with the wallet that we hold the keys, there's the peace of mind and we can be proud to be called actual holders.

There are many exchanges where many people have held coins for a long time. So what would you say to those who have held tokens on exchanges for a long time? I think there can be any medium to hold tokens. No matter how you hold the coin, it will be holding and those who hold it are called holders.However, you can say here that exchanges are not safe for holding tokens/coins but holding coins on exchanges is definitely holding. We cannot trust it due to the bad condition of the exchanges but of course keeping our coins in wallets is most important for our security.",
