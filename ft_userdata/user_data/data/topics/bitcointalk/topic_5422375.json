  "content": "EDIT:Due to multiple requests, I try to link the tools in each case. I try to link to the original author's github repository when possible. If I have linked incorrectly or made a mistake in the author, please correct me - I am very grateful for corrections. I have also added few entries and info to the list.Hi all,there are dozens of tools available out there and I am not sure if I listed them all. Please add them if they're worth to mention. I am trying to find out which tools are preferable and mostly used out there. This list is focused on GPU capable tools, because using CPU only is kinda useless (except BSGS) for puzzle solving above #66. I thought I'd create an overview from which we can all benefit. I want to define the areas of application, which tool is suitable for which purpose, etc. Perhaps the developers of these tools can also get in touch and add the missing information or correct the information found here if something should be wrong. Please forgive me if I have described something wrong.keyhunt (+BSGS) (github link, forum link)- as far as I know, this is CPU version only. Keyhunt is memory-bound and makes use of lots of it in order to find keys.keyhunt-cuda (github link 1, github link 2)- this is the modified version of Albertos' original keyhunt which now is capable of CUDA. What's the main difference between keyhunt-cuda and bitcrack? both support CUDABitcrack github link, forum link)- supports GPU, but not really multi-gpu capable as described in its readme. You need to open one window and access gpu1 on your system (first bitcrack process running), open an additional new window and run another copy of bitcrack (second bitcrack process running) and so on.- does not support random mode- no progress status, you never know how much of the keyspace you already have scanned.- in my findings so far the keyrate achieved with Bitcrack or Bitcrack2 is always about 30% lower than when using keyhunt-cuda for searching the same keyspace. Your mileage may vary.Bitcrack2 (github link 1, cannot find forum link)- as far as I can tell the only addition in BitCrack2 is, that you can run it in random mode. It will then search randomly through the range search space.- has progress status, you see how many % of the keyspace search is completed and you also see what was the last keys that were tested so you get an idea where the search currently is located at- in my case the keyrate achieved with Bitcrack or Bitcrack2 is always about 30% lower than when using keyhunt-cuda for searching the same keyspace.Â  Your mileage may vary.VanBitCracken(Random) (github link, forum link)VanBitCrakcenS (github link, forum link)- VanBitKracken family of software was developed very recently in 2020-2021 by WanderingPhilosipher I have no idea how old and useful this tool might be and what the main differences to the other tools here presented are. Any information?EDIT: As the autor said in the forum link for this tool, this is Windows only edition, does not work on Linux. This is a mixed tool, something like between VanitySearch and BitCrack, especially made for supporting the Nvidia 3070 cards. As there are no source code files available on his github repository, only a windows .exe (which is highly dangerous to execute! no trust), I removed this tool from the list.Kangaroo (github link, forum link)This tool can be only used when the pubkey of an adress is known. That means that there must have been minimum one outgoing transaction from this address or a message that was signed by this address or the pubkey has been revealed otherwise.BSGS (github link )BSGS-Cuda (github link)- runs on CPU only and cannot make use of GPU. As far as I know there is a CUDA-capable modification available, however I was not able to install and run it. Is there anyone out there who can provide a download link for the old and free version of purebasic v5.3 ? Without purebasic it's impossible to run this tool which was made by Etayson. The user was online hear about 1-2years ago for the last time, no reaction at all. Any clues?Rotor-CUDA (github link)- was that a tool that was created and published before or after Bitcrack2, Kangaroo, etc... ? I have no idea how old and useful this tool might be and what the main differences to the other tools here presented are. Any information? As I understand Rotor-CUDA can use random search but Bitcrack2 is also capable of random searches as well as keyhunt-cuda. Did I miss any important feauture info ? What's that tool good for in comparison to the other mentioned ?Brainflayer (github link, source)that tool allow use to brute force the hex privatekeys in order to find the hash160 of an address. Basically it hunts for brainwallets. You feed it with a word list of phrases and try to find matches to valid and funded bitcoin addresses.Looking forward to hear your comments, what tool is best-suited for which purpose and case and which tools you puzzle-hunters out there are using.",

I have only one single GPU so I can speak only for that. I used an arbitrary keyspace where no key is found. The scans will yield the same results, they are reproduceable. For the comparison I used Bitcrack, Bitrack2, Rotor-CUDA, Keyhunt-CUDA because most of the puzzles no pubkey is known and thus you cannot use BSGS or Kangaroo.In all runs, Bitcrack and Bitcrack2 were the slowest (both about same performance)In all runs, Keyhunt-CUDA and Rotor-CUDA were about 33% faster than Bitcrack/Bitcrack2 (both, Keyhunt-CUDA and Rotor-CUDA about the same).These are my findings. What are your experiences you'd like to share ?",
