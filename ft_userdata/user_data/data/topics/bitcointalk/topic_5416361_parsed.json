  "content": "What is ZetaChain?ZetaChain is the foundational, public blockchain that enables omnichain, generic smart contracts and messaging between any blockchain. It solves the problems of “cross-chain” and “multi-chain” and aims to open the crypto and global financial ecosystem to anyone. ZetaChain envisions and supports a truly fluid, multi-chain crypto ecosystem, where users and developers can move between and appreciate the benefits of any blockchain: payments, DeFi, liquidity, games, art, social graphs, performance, security, privacy, and so on.View the whitepaper here for a closer look at ZetaChain's background and architecture.Key featuresDecentralized and publicZetaChain is a decentralized and public blockchain network. It is built on Cosmos SDK and Tendermint Consensus. While many cross-chain solutions like bridges have varying, often centralized trust models that have a track record for being susceptible to exploits and hacks, ZetaChain is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, where all transactions and activity on the platform -- even cross-chain transactions -- are fully transparent, verifiable, and function in a trust-minimized manner.Hyper-connected nodesZetaChain's nodes have observers that monitor transactions on every connected chain. Through ZetaChain's TSS architecture, the network can sign and verify transactions on every connected chain as a wallet can. By being able to read and write to connected chains in a secure, decentralized manner, these hyper-connected nodes provide a seamless omnichain environment for developers to build novel and powerful cross-chain applications on top of.Omnichain message passingA developer can pass messages (data + value) between chains and layers with simple function calls. Through message passing, a dApp developer can build powerful cross-chain applications by simply implementing a few functions within their existing smart contracts.Learn how to build dApps using ZetaChain's Connector here.Omnichain smart contractsSmart contracts can be deployed natively on ZetaChain that can read/write to connected chains. ZetaChain is the only public blockchain to support smart contracts with this capability, enabling a new paradigm of app development.Managed external assetsZetaChain's network and dApps built on top of ZetaChain can manage assets and vaults of external connected chains. This allows assets on any chain to be managed just as a smart contract on a single chain can manage assets on its respective chain. A dApp on ZetaChain can thus orchestrate and bring smart contract logic to any connected chain. This property applies to all chains, including non-smart-contract chains, like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.twitter:  https://twitter.com/zetablockchain",
