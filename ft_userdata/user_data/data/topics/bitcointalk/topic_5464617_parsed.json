But the fact is there are not.Quote from: Rikafip on August 25, 2023, 01:25:29 PMQuote from: BenCodie on August 25, 2023, 01:17:46 PMIf you really think the gambling board is as ethical as other boards this forum contains, you're out of touch with basic ethics. Lol, guy that is willing to promote something that he thinks is highly unethical and exploitative for a little bit of bitcoin will teach us about ethics.  I'm not promoting shit, they're leasing my sig space. I take zero responsibility for the service nor do I endorse it for as long as it's not a proven scam. Good job picking one thing out of all of the valid parts of what I said and using it to invalidate my post. Great job, actually. Very effective. Dumbass.Quote from: Rruchi man on August 25, 2023, 02:54:21 PMQuote from: BenCodie on August 25, 2023, 12:39:05 PM...If you have strong opinions, you should also have strong principles to suport it. You are not principled, if you were, you would never have agreed to apply and agree wear the signature and avatar to promote a casino here. Because of your unprincipled nature, you have no right to talk about ethics.Also not all discussions in the gambling board is about casinos, some discussions under its subboard \"gambling discussion\" address and talk about issues relating to gambling. Quote from: BenCodie on August 25, 2023, 12:39:05 PMI also think merits should not be focused on posts in this section. It does not positively contribute to the Bitcoin economy.Gambling involves use of bitcoins, and there are gamblers who have a preference for gambling with bitcoins. Believe it or not, the fact that bitcoins can also be useful for gambling can be a reason why some people have gotten bitcoins. Discussion about gambling is not worthy of needing a merit source. My post stands.My principles align with how the forum is conducted. If the principles of the forum were better, I would be better.I know that I'm not a scammer, a gambler, a scumbag, or anyone who contributes negatively to this community. So, anyone's judgement means absolutely 0 to me. I know my code, and I know that it's reasoned, refined and fine. Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on August 25, 2023, 02:38:21 PMWell, I was coming here to say that I also support cryptofrka's application, as I understand that he is a person who spends a lot of time in the gambling section and can help distribute merit to quality posts that often get buried between rubbish pages. But I'm also surprised that BenCodie is going as a moral defender here, I don't want to get too long with this because is kind of OT, but if you say this:Quote from: BenCodie on August 25, 2023, 01:17:46 PMAs for the question if gambling is unethical - it undoubtedly is. What you need to do is to stop wearing a gambling ad on your signature, especially because you get paid for it. I don't know where you learned ethics, but where I'm from someone who lets himself be bought to advertise something he thinks is wrong is not only behaving in a morally wrong way, he is also a hypocrite. All of you go back to the gambling board where you all came from and belong. If you can't read and understand a high IQ post, don't respond to it with bs personal attacks about my signature. I'm not a hypocrite for taking opportunity when it's available. And just because I wear a signature, thsn doesn't mean that should be a main focus to my valid opinion on a topic.All of you have a common theme - low IQ.I do not want to write these off-topic things in someone's merit source application thread. My first question to you was why do you think gambling board is unethical? If you think so, why are you promoting gambling through your signature space? What I believe is it depends from person to person and perspective. If you consider gambling as an unethical thing, Bitcoin is unethical as well from that perspective. Gambling is considered a sin in some religions. Having a girlfriend or an open relationship with any other girl is considered a sin as well. It's unethical to have a relationship with a girl without marrying her. It varies from culture to culture. You can have a girlfriend and have sex with her without even marrying her and it's not a problem in Western countries. If you do the same thing in Arab, the punishment is death in front of a thousand people. From that perspective, Bitcoin is unethical as well.If you want to talk against gambling, you still need a gambling board to discuss why it's bad and why people should not gamble. You cannot discuss gambling-related things on other boards. While you consider it as an unethical thing, you are promoting a casino through your signature space. People pointed it and you started attacking them while you claimed they attacked you. If you believe you are the only person with a super high IQ, then I have nothing to say about it. But it's an irony to promote something that you consider an unethical thing. Your campaign requires you to write five posts a week on a gambling board while you claim it as unethical and you asking them to move where they came from (Gambling board). If you cannot take healthy criticism, why are you on the internet forum?Let's have a healthy discussion about it. But, if you start using foul language and start throwing mud, I will lock the thread.",

I don't see the point on how it's being unethical while it's probably fair to players. Gamblers have a fair chance to win and lose here. It's our choice on how do we spend our money for entertainment.",

      "body": "Everyone has their own point of view where someone may consider something as good while others many consider it bad. There's nothing wrong with gambling if someone is willingly doing it because it's someone's personal choice to spend their money on gambling activities and no one else can interfere with their personal matters. Gambling is a choice and if someone is spending his/her money to gambling activity then he/she has the complete right to do that. I don't know about that guy but I believe that the casinos we promote through our signature space are the ones who trust and we believe that they can be helpful for other users as well. I know that promoting their signature can also give us some rewards in the form of Bitcoin, but I don't think that promoting a service solely to earn Bitcoin is the real reason of promoting it. Most of the casinos that we promote have been doing really great from the day the have launched their services and if we contribute to their success then there's nothing unethical in that approach. I also won't favor the casinos that are known for their shady ways and no other member of the forum would rent his/her signature space to those shady casinos. If we take the example of 1xBit then you can see that there are hardly any good members of the forum who promoted that casino after realizing that the casino was doing shady business.",

He is simply a hypocrite. He goes around giving moral lessons about how bad gambling is while promoting a gambling house on his signature and gets paid for it.It's the most serious case of hypocrisy I can remember in the time I've been on the forum.

Omar Khayyam has a verse: \"Everything is bought and sold, and life frankly laughs at us: We are indignant, we are indignant, but we are sold and bought.\" It's all about the price. If someone cannot be bought at one price, they will be bought at another. People primarily live for themselves and their own benefit. Of course, each of us always has the choice of participating in and promoting a particular company. But the main fact is the price. I think there are a lot of people on the forum who are forced to write posts on topics that they cannot justify in real life. And BenCodie isn't the only one. Another thing is important: how we, knowing this, begin to dissemble and pretend, proving a different point of view.Again, why is it here on the forum, on the Internet, to show your weaknesses by reacting negatively to posts that do not coincide with your opinion?

If people do not like it, there is that ignore button, if managers do not like his controversial statements, they can fire and exclude him.",

      "body": "My first question to this user was why he thinks that the gambling board is an unethical board which is why he does not support the merit source application. He believes there is no need for merit sources for the unethical board while he himself wearing a casino signature and promoting it. Isn't it ironic? He might have a different point of view but how is it when you say dealing drugs is unethical and you promote it through a billboard you own just because someone pays you money for that? I noticed whoever says something against his opinion, he starts talking to them aggressively and he believes they have low IQ and this user is the only person with super High IQ. I do not see any reason for insulting reputed members just because they shared their opinion about him and yet he expects everyone to accept his opinion (whoever does not agree with his opinion = Low IQ). Isn't it Ironic?",
