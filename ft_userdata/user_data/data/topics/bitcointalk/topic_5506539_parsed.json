      "body": "Bitcoin is the most conservative investment among cryptocurrencies and should correspond to the largest portion of an investor's bankroll. Everything else (altcoins) is high risk gambling. Since the beginning of this industry we have been seeing Bitcoin performing on the top position of this market, while altcoins are constantly going upside and down each new cycle.The only exception is Ethereum. Every other altcoins don't give you any realistic assurance to maintain their position on the following years. The point is that they promise high financial returns, which is something Bitcoin doesn't at the current stage it has reached. So investors go for the altcoins instead, expecting to make 100% or even 1000% profit by holding shitcoins, personified in the figure of memecoins which are quite popular right now.It's ok to play with altcoins, though, since you respect your limits and don't compromise a large percentage of your funds on it.",

It's just that in this case what distinguishes bitcoin and altcoin is a certainty where the risk when in bitcoin will be much smaller than we are in altcoin.QuoteI'll also advice you never use your all to invest!Of course this should be done and everyone should be aware of something like this because it would be ridiculous if they do (sacrifice) everything for the investment that we do.Although investment is good, we must realize that in the end when we want to do it, we need a good strategy and planning which of course refers to the financial management that we have.Do not let us be aggressive by risking everything just because we want to get a big profit because we need to think about the life we live today and not only focus on the future.There are expenses that we have to think about for life now so don't push yourself too much because the concept of being in my version of bitcoin is that when we invest in bitcoin then we must also be prepared to lose which of course this will be difficult for us to accept when we risk everything for bitcoin even though it is profitable for the future but we cannot torture ourselves for the life we live now.",

There won't be anything close to the gain that people that got in on bitcoin sub $1K currently enjoy — so it's normal to see people take their chances with these altcoins because unlike bitcoin, it doesn't take much to swing the price upwards. That's the reality right.For me, People kind of appeals to people with bigger capital size. Yesterday, a thought leader in Bitcoin shared a reddit post about a guy being excited about hitting the 0.1BTC mark after buying and DCAing for years. He noted that with each increase in the price, it becomes harder to acquire more bitcoin. Before being a wholecoiner was the goal. Now, there are people that see 0.1 BTC as the standard.",

This is just so simple, you can only suggest to people on a better option which you feel can be trusted when it comes to cryptocurrency investment and for sure Bitcoin remain the best among other cryptocurrencies due to it's life span and the proven track records but the choices are their for the investor to make given that a lot of people has had huge profit investing in alternative cryptocurrency and shitcoins as such they would always try to risk it no matter what the outcome come will be. Personally I consider shitcoin investment as a Ponzi system of investment because it kills faster than death and it gives profit wittin a short period of time also.",

Every risk has their repercussions and when some people are able to realize those repercussions and can get away with it, they don’t mind trying to diversify their portfolio into also altcoins.

Bitcoin still remains the best investment for those who actually understand how the system works. During dips, you might see how the value of your coins fluctuates and drops significantly especially when you bought at a higher price. But someone who already knows about this would have nothing to worry about since when the market goes up significantly you will gain alot of profis. Altcoins Carries more risks than Bitcoin. When Bitcoin falls to a certain percentage, most of these altcoins also follows and dips but then not all of them will be able to recover just same way as Bitcoin will always do.

Invest only a small portion in altcoins and make sure it is an amount we can afford to lose just like the amount we gamble. Our crypto portfolio, bitcoin should be 80% or more, I think we'll be fine. Also, bitcoin is safer and has more potential but it will all depend on our strategy and planning.

Proof of Work is not a savior benchmark for altcoins and it does not mean if they are Proof of Work altcoins, they can survive with time.Don't buy altcoins because they are top altcoinsOther than that, majority of altcoins are non-Proof-of-Work, they are mainly Proof of Stake, Smart Contract based and their founders can have big preminted, premined coins or tokens. With these tokens since start, they can easily dump those tokens on the market, get quick money and abandon their projects.
