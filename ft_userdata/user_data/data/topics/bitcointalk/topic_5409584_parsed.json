Any Kenyan person and European person is fineWhy you are not verifying identity by the documents of you? If you have less identity verification document then you can verify with the document of your parents. The verification you are trying to buy means you are trying to something wrong which can be money laundering or something like that.",

And if that person happened to be retired in the forum as some people i do know in the forum retired, so how will he do to get communication with the person that gives him documents. So nobody supposed to use a document of another to verify his account for security purpose. I concur with you",

Any Kenyan person and European person is fineLike every other user have said, I think you have to state a genuine reason why you need someone else you don't know in person to verify an account for you,Â  if you lack the necessary documents required, you can talk to your parents or other family members, or even close friends to do it for you, why want a person from different country to verify an account for you if what you plan to do with the account is legal?Quote from: elonsmask on September 09, 2022, 05:29:21 PMIs this still open? I can help with verifying kenyan accountsIf you have the slightly idea of the kind of problem helping an unknown person to verify account have put many people into, you would think twice before you consider doing a thing like this, even if the person is goin to pay you handsomely, that money can never be enough to get you out of the sh!t this careless act will get you into, this is if you don't lose your life in the process, so better be careful.",
