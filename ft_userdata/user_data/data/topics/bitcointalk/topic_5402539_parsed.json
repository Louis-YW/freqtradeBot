  "content": "I know almost all veteran members understand what's happening in the market. But, newbies like me still trying to figure out what's happening and the possible reason why it's happening. Now, People sharing their thought as if BTC is the only currency that is going down now. Every currency going down right except stable coins (We don't see the stable coins going down like Terra UST). The key point Reason for the Market Crash is Fear and Inflation.Here is an article worth reading from financial express.Cryptocurrency markets have crashed to a new low of this year today (13th June, 2022). The global market cap has shrunk below $1 trillion to $977 billion, around 12 % fall since yesterday. The global cryptocurrency market cap has fallen by around $1 trillion this year while almost every top coin is now worth half or even less than their all-time highs. The immediate trigger for the crypto crash appears to be a massive sell-off by investors amid heightened inflation fears and pausing of withdrawal by crypto lending service Celsius. Investors are also continuing to stay away from riskier assets, which is reflecting in the stock markets as well. “The crypto market has been under pressure from the Federal Reserve, hiking the interest rates to combat inflation over the past few months. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most cryptocurrencies suffered losses over the weekend after a broad sell-off following the data showing US inflation hitting a 40-year high,” said  Edul Patel Co-Founder and CEO of crypto investment platform Mudrex.“As investors seem to have panicked, the number of crypto liquidations has been high since Friday. Bitcoin and Ethereum plummeted as much as 7% each and are currently trading at their lowest at US$25,000 and US$1,300. The bearish trend may likely continue in the next coming days,” he added. While altcoins have historically underperformed Bitcoin, this time they have an added pressure of potential regulatory roadblocks. A report by CoinDesk quoted an expert as saying that only a small number of altcoins are likely to survive such market movements. Shivam Thakral, CEO of crypto exchange BuyUcoin said that the rising food, gas, and energy prices are putting tremendous pressure on the crypto market as Bitcoin and Ether have witnessed double-digit losses in the past 24 hours.“After the consumer price index reported the highest inflation since 1981, financial markets across the globe have seen a sharp downturn,” said Thakral. “The market is expected to remain choppy in the coming weeks and countries around the globe continue to report high inflation numbers. The current dip in the crypto prices allows investors to buy crypto at 2021 prices and we expect the seasoned investors to take advantage of the dip,” he added. According to Darshan Bathija, CEO of crypto exchange Vauld, most investors worry that unless inflation numbers start dropping soon, the US Fed may have to tighten reigns by increasing interest rates at a faster pace than anticipated.Source: https://www.financialexpress.com/digital-currency/crypto-crash-reason-6-13-why-is-crypto-crashing-today/2558313/",

We can't blame those sellers because the majority of them are just buying Bitcoin for profit alone and not like us that believes on it's future use case on the future of finances.Fiat is the root of all this problem in the economy. Maybe someday people will realize how cool Bitcoin is.",

I understand everything you are saying but for all the people who panic selling there must be opposite people happily Buying their Bitcoin up because it is not been sold into thin air. As I said, I understand why people will feel the way they do about the market but if Bitcoin could go from $20k to about $3k and was also able to come back from that to above $60k, this is just another phase but the recovery could take time no question.",

I thought that it was becoming more stable, losing a lower percentage of its value than it used to before. It's a very difficult time for Hodlers of bitcoin, and more difficult for those who bought the dip a few weeks before and are new to crypto, thinking that was the lowest the prices could get. Many plans have changed as a result of this further dip, for some a setback, for others who are both financially stable and confident an opportunity to buy more. We have to be prepared mentally for situations like this, just as we can't predict the how high the value of bitcoin can be, likewise the dump, we must as much as possible avoid to join the panic because in panic do people make wrong investment decisions.",

However, that might not only be the reason. There are many reasons why BTC is pumping and dumping without warning, but all I know is that it’s here to stay and may recover hopefully by the Q4 of this year or so.",

Those who panic when they experience bearish market is people who is not acquainted with the price regulations of cryptocurrencies. Because it's obvious that Bitcoin don't have a specific price",

People panic selling would cry later.For you maybe because you have less worries but for some it is a big deal since they expected that the price won't drop like this. They want bitcoin to recover now so that they can sell and pay the money that they loan for buying more bitcoins at the last dip. Volatility is the up and down of the price in a short duration and the gap is small only but what we are witnessing now is more than it, it is now called a dump or a bear because the price gets stable at the lowest points.There is no need to panic sell if it's only about btc since like you said this wasn't the first and this isn't also going to be the last but better if we practice ourselves to get used of this situation.",
