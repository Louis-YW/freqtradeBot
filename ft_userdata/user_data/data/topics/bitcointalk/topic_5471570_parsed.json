Not that I will not enjoy gambling if I am tracking it, but I have a gambling budget, which makes it a waste of time. Gambling budget is not also time demanding while calculating it.",

Many here will feel that this is waste of time and will also not let them enjoy the game peacefully. Do you also have same mentality? I enjoy playing computer games and I don't remember how many times I have played the game this year. I also see gambling as a form of entertainment so I don't need to keep records because it's just fun to me. It can be argued since we use money to place bets, it is important to keep records, but the funds I use are an insignificant part of my expenses. I just see it as a waste of time and energy to sit down and start calculating my bets and returns for the month or year. It might be necessary for people that gamble heavily for them to be able to control their gambling activities. It could also bring sadness, especially for people who have lost uncontrollably. Sometimes it is better to let the past walk away.",

      "body": "Sometimes I usually have that thought of keeping records for every dollar I spend on gambling so that I can know how much I am winning and how much I am losing too, but I still concluded that doing that and archiving the data I want would do me no good, so I just let go of the thought. I kind of imagine that I gamble not to make money but to have fun, although the winnings are never neglected. But it's never a priority that I must win because I know fully well that I don't run the game, so even putting in some money into gambling, I don't conceive any thought of certainty that I will win the game. I know it's already going to end in two ways, either loss or win, so what's the essence of keeping records?Sometimes, it's always said that before a gambler becomes lucky and wins a big amount, they might also lose a great amount that is above what they won. That's the only reason that would have made me consider keeping records of money spent on gambling so that I can confirm that it's possible for a gambler to lose a great deal of money even before they get lucky enough to win a huge amount too.For example, just yesterday, my fiancee was telling me that a colleague of her who's at her work place won about $3,850 on a spot game. According to the gambler, that was the first time he had ever won such a high amount in gambling. So, if I had had a gambling record of that guy, I would have really wanted to compare the amount he has lost in gambling right from when he started gambling and how much he has won.For myself, I wouldn't want to keep track of how much I lose from gambling, the reason being that keeping those records would not yield anything good.",

Many here will feel that this is waste of time and will also not let them enjoy the game peacefully. Do you also have same mentality? I used to be one of those gamblers who'd write down all my gambling wins and losses, thinking it'd help me make smarter bets.  But I realized it kinda took the fun out of everything.  I was so focused on the stats that I wasn't really enjoying myself and  these days when I gamble, I just try to relax and have a good time instead of stressing over every little win or loss. I feel like its better for me that way. Gambling should be about having fun, with the possibility of winning occasionally, but you shuldn't devote your life to it and try to make it your primary source of income. That's a wrong way of thinking, imho.How about you - do you keep close track of your gambling results? Or are you more a seat-of-the-pants player who goes with the flow?Quote from: Hatchy on October 25, 2023, 08:51:29 AMI think that there was a similar thread regarding keeping record of gambling winnings and losses.Not keeping records makes me a bad gambler? You're right; discussions about keeping records in gambling do come up from time to time. I feel like we get at least a couple threads on it throughout the year. It's always a good practice to take a quick look through old posts first before starting a new conversation about something that's been covered already.",

Many here will feel that this is waste of time and will also not let them enjoy the game peacefully. Do you also have same mentality? In times of gambling keeping records of your gambling statistics is totally depends on individual desire why they feel the need to keep the records of the money they spent while gambling maybe perhaps there reasons could be that keeping their gambling statistics will serve as a reminder of the money they have been spending on gambling. But for me I feel there is no need for me to keep those records of gambling because it could affect my mindset of gambling, because calculating the total money I have spent on gambling there is every possibility of me feeling bad or regretting not to have even gambled, so is better we just keep gambling instead of keeping records but however anyone who feel there is need to keep gambling records he should go ahead but for I feel it will affect me emotionally if seeing the total money I have lost on gambling.",

The company I register with have a nice record of this and that is more than enough. Through their platform,  you can see your gambling records on daily, weekly and even monthly  basis. There is also the flexibility of choosing a period and the records will be displayed, showing individual bets played, total won and total amount lost for the period chosen. I keep my gambling confidential even though few people that need to know about it as already aware. So I do not need to keep physical records anywhere since I have it handy at my personal online profile. Writing it down actually has its own benefit but that is not enough conviction for me to start it as the time spent on it can be used for something else.",

A similar thread like this was created recently, it won’t be a bad idea if you can lock this thread and visit the thread that I just posted below to check forum members opinions Not keeping records makes me a bad gambler?. But to me, it’s not really necessary to keep on having gambling records. I don’t even know how you will keep on documenting your wins and losses, I see it as a complete waste of time. So at the end of every day that I gamble, you expect me to document my win and loss, it’s not really making sense to me, and if your win and loss are documented, it won’t help you win your next bet.",

No, doesn't make sense for a gambler to record of the winnings and losses. It's not that it's a waste of time, it's not it will not bring anything to the gambler. What benefits? you will cry over your loses? Or see how much you win at that time period and the next week you lose everything? And if you are playing online, there is a record already, you can go back and see it. But for me, I also don't practice that.So just enjoy your gambling activity whether online or offline, and just play the money that you can afford to lose and everything will be good on your end. And probably this is one area that we really don't need any data to see if we are doing good or not.",

However, I will still answer that I am the person who records the wins and losses of my gambling activities. Maybe for some people this is very inconvenient because they have to record it in excel or their notepad, but I personally think that it is not a hassle at all because by recording my wins and losses I can see how my performance is.And not only do I record wins/losses, I also record expenses for each game I play and at the end of the month I sort it in Excel to see how much I earned and spent on my gambling.",

I keep seeing it, I have seen something similar like this yesterday and now here we are again, seems like there are many losses among gamblers recently.I will chip in my suggestion and u hope it helps. When I go to my bet history, I delete my loss bets as soon as they are loss, it keeps me going in rejuvenating hope in new bets that is currently going or that I newly stake, there is nothing good in staring at an already loss bets over and over, what is gone is gone and it Wil be deleted asap.However, I do take not of deposit and withdrawals, that is something I know I can't temper with, it can't be deleted and since is not a place I frequently check, I don't have problem with viewing it except when I want to check how much I deposited and how much I withdrew at the end of 30 days. That way, u will know if I have been productive in gambling on just fooling around with my money while making fun.",

In everything that we do in life that requires us to invest our time and finances in them, we need to always keep a proper record of them, as it might be needed some days for some unforeseen reasons. As a good gambler, it's important to always keep track of the amount you have spent in gambling over the week to see if you are still gambling within your budget range and not spending above what you have planned for. A proper record-keeping system can help you track that without stress. And again, keeping records also helps one discover if they have made any form of heavy winning from gambling over the time that they have been playing, and if possible, they can calculate all that they have spent in gambling, deduct any amount that they have won from it, and see if they are really wasting their time on it or not. If they are playing to make money out of it and not for fun, such a record can make one realise it is high time to call it a stop or still continue depending on the outcome of the record.",
