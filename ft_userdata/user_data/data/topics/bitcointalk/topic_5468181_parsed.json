The higher the chance the lower the odd while the lower the chance the higher the odd. It is left for you which one that you prefer.If it is sport, you have lower odds. Casinos are better I am post is about casinos alone just as it is in your question.",

But if you talk about poker, blackjack, baccarat etc those are skill based games and it should increase the percentage to win if you're really good with this games.Crash might fall to skill based games too.",

The game more likely to bring you a big win is the game you are more conversant with and know how to play best. It will not do you any good if you keep trying out every game when gambling, choose a niche and become a master of it. With that approach, your chances of winning improves. If you are used to slots, play slots.If you are used to table games in brick and mortar casinos, play them! or look for these games on online casinos where they are featured and play them.",

Here everyone can't be lucky as the win/loss could be at its best/worst. Going through few users sports betslips posted on different threads I find sports betting have got best chance of big win. All that required is the ability to predict the right outcome.Recently saw a person placing a multibet on a big list of events for a combined odds @86156 and the bet amount is just $2.49 worth bitcoin. He had won all the games and it gives a win of $214530. This particular user requested for users suggestion whether to Cashout before the last match @$94000 or risk for $214530. Finally his prediction have come right on the last match, and he hadn't disclosed whether he cashed it out earlier or won the final amount. Looking at these kind of sports betting it is true that sports betting gives high chance of big win.",

I never get 1000x on crash or other games so I am also biased towards slots.  But as I believe it is all random so we never know which games offer the best chance of a big win.  Sports betting maybe because the result is highly affected by the bettor's skills. If the bettor is highly skilled enough to guess all the right winning teams in the matches in a parlay,  then there is no doubt that it will really be a big win.",

(chance to lose is lower).I was going yo ask like Oshosondy did on what are crypto games as, my thoughts puts me about just any game that the base of its stake is cryptos.So I ask this instead, is that really a thing? (Crypto games AKA; Keno, Dice and what have you). Is that a collective name for games that fall on the category or it’s just a made up name.Haven’t played dice, I think it’s one game with a probable course and as such, you could have several turns that could turn into wins but, the it’s often about you taking more risk and without any algorithm to support. You simply submit yourself to luck of which, your over or under settings plays a major role to how far you could come. I’ll go with dice but really, just any game could give you some good wins.",

Perhaps, people in general could have a biased impression on how often and how high slots rewards can be, since slots big wins are usually promoted and shared in social media, special on official Twitter accounts of casinos.",

It all depends on how sure the game is and how big the odds are, then lastly, how much you used to bet on the games.In gambling, even if you have luck at winning, you can't win all the time because the reason why it is called gambling is because it is a try your luck, something. If it enters for you, that is your luck, but if it doesn't work out well for you, you can either quit it or continue gambling until it enters for you. Gambling is not always profitable, just like crypto investment and gambling has higher risk.Among all these games in the gambling industry, there are only a few that are more popular with people. I will use the soccer game as an example. Soccer games are a bit easy for people to predict and soccer games have more fans.",

I would also stay away from automated original games as the RTP of these games if most likely lower than what most site claim it to be. Speaking from my own experience these games often show mathematically almost impossible outcomes several times for the house but 0 times for the player.For example I had several times seen the house winning 15 times in a row at blackjack while the \"longest win streak\" I ever had at BJ stands at 5, hahaha. Needless to say that I lost 6 and more times in a row almost every session.Anyway, low house edge games is the way to go.If you just think of winning big of course then there are only slots. But you need a BIG miracle to do so.",

I still remember someone posted a winning bet that had a million multiplier on Stake and it was from a crypto game(probably hi-lo or limbo).",

So which is it?Based on my experience, it is more likely to bagged big wins in table games compared to slots. For instance, you can develop strategies and tactics when playing a table game, but in slots, you completely rely on your luck and you don't have a control about the outcome of the game.  One of the best example for table games which you can have tactics are blackjacks and poker. So, if you are skilled enough and know the basic strategies on these games, you have a higher probability of winning. Of course it still relies on luck, but your strategies can enhance the odds of your winning. Also, I only play slot games once in a while because wins are quite rare, at least for me.",

First is by betting big amount with normal odds such as 2x or 2nd way is by betting small amount to hunt huge multiplier. If we are talking about big bet with low odds, I believe most games are the same except slot because of its high house edge. But if we are talking about small bet for big win, slot games is the best because it gives you many possible payout in every single spin but of course the risk is high.",

In this case, in my opinion, table games are the ones that give the player the greatest chance of winning, but only if we are talking about card games, for example, in which it is possible to use your skills to obtain a greater advantage.In general, you will have more profits in all games in which the luck factor has reduced relevance in the game's outcome.
