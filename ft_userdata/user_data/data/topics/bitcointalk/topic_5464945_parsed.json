  "content": "Hey, BitcoinTalk community! This time again we've got something cool for you – a chance to try Zenland web3 escrow tool and earn $10 while you're at it. This campaign is exclusive for Member and higher rank users. Interested users can apply in this thread in standard format (username, Metamask wallet address, preferred network/currency [BSC, Gnosis, Polygon, Avalanche / USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD). You will receive a PM if you are accepted.What is it about?Zenland is a web3 escrow platform for buying or selling anything online through non-custodial smart contracts. These contracts can be deployed to Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom and Gnosis. Accepted users act as sellers following through a test contract with us (as buyers). After the contract is executed, they post a brief feedback on their experience.How it works?by \"you\" we mean accepted users1. We create an escrow contract on Zenland with you.2. You sign in to Zenland and approve the contract.3. We deploy the contract.4. You fulfill the contract. 5. We release the funds from the contract.6. You post your feedback on this thread. Important! When users complete Step 2 and Step 4, they must update their OP each time in this thread. That way, we will be notified at what stage your contract is and what the next step is. At the end of the test, your OP should look something like this:Quote1. BitcoinTalk Username: Zenland2. Bitcointalk Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile3. Preferred Network/Currency: BSC / USDT4. MetaMask address registered on ZenlandStep 1: Contract approved. Waiting for deployment. Step 2: Contract fulfilled. Waiting for funds release.Feedback: Overall experience is smooth and I especially like the way you can see the status of all your contracts on the Contracts page. Also, I would suggest changing the UI of the “Chats” page because it is confusing. How to get started if accepted?1. Go to https://app.zen.land and login with Metamask 2. You will see a notification about a new contract created with you. Open it and approve it. 3. Come back to your OP on this thread and leave the first timestamp that you approved the contract. 4. We deploy the contract and transfer your reward inside.5. Sign in back to Zenland, and complete (fulfil) the contract (we will send you native coin of the chosen network to cover the transaction fees).6. Come back to your OP on this thread and leave the second timestamp that you completed the contract.7. We see it and release the reward to your wallet address.That's it! Please consider this as an opportunity to test out a decentralized escrow tool at no cost. This is not a bounty program by any means. $10 is just a small reward to compensate for your time. For users who wants to get paid in BTC please let us know in your OP. Escrow contract for a price of 1 cent would be created with you. You still need to use your MetaMask account and choose the network.Feel free to ask in this thread if you have any questions.",

I received my funds.Feedback:The entire experience with ZenLand's escrow service was extremely smooth and simple to apply and even that I had an issue with my wallet which was comprised unfortunately ZenLand moved forward and sent my the funds. If I were to imagine myself selling or offering one of my services to someone and needed a secure low fee escrow I would certainly choose ZenLand for several reasons. One of them is its availability instead of contacting an escrow agent as an individual, this tool is always ready to use and easy to understand. There are just a few steps to complete the contract and then the buyer as in this experience you release the funds.What I've always appreciated about ZenLand is its decentralization anyone can use it without needing to provide personal information or documents. This makes it the third time I have tested ZenLand's tools, and I'm very pleased to see everything working smoothly as you are going from beta to the final version.",

In future, hopefully we see another method to connect wallet to website instead of Metamask.Best of Luck Zenland Escrow ContractThanks I received my reward",

Good to see that multiple network is available and i hope layer 2 networks arbitrum and Optimism network will also be added in the future. Notifications makes it easy to check any changes in contract or quickly check the message arrived. chat is very important and thanks zenland team for adding it. all limitations has been mentioned by other users so I think that's enough to improve in the future.",

Waiting for funds release.Feedback:It was smooth for what was involved, possibly because steps were clearly outlined, and I just had to click few buttons and there was reward to do so, which was certainly generous compared to what we were tasked to do. I have two points to make, positive being I loved how smooth the website was on mobile and negative being that live chat assistance is slow, just to check response time I sent a message, no answered received till now (more than 3 hours passed). This might not be a big deal but since the message said live assistance, I expect live assistance, and not being so, I write this as negative  Edit: I just released reward and it was promptly received, thank you.",
