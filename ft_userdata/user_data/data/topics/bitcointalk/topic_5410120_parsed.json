  "content": "I would like a discussion on the pros or cons of deflation. Please add in your 2 bits.I do not believe that either inflation nor deflation are bad if they are predictable and within a small percentage. It is the rapid inflation and deflation or unpredictability that causes massive failures.Deflation is inherent in the system that we live in. As humans, we try to produce everything more efficiently. It's what drives us. It frees us to deal with new or unexpected problems. Deflation is obtaining more value for less work. Deflation is the increased production efficiency of goods, which efficiency we should strive for.The typical argument against deflation is that it prevents spending, which causes a collapse of the system. This argument is self-defeating: if deflation causes collapse of the system, there is no reason to hold onto the coin that causes that deflation (and therefore deflation doesn't exist). Usually deflation is blamed for economic depressions, but instead, it's normally the other way around: massive inflation had preceded these depressions until production and investment capacity had become unsustainable and untethered to real value, which caused massive distrust of such systems. That distrust then led to deflation to find the ground-floor of value. Deflation is often the by-product of the poor preceding policies that perpetuated perennial problems, but was not the cause. Policies often try to alleviate this poor policy pain by inflating their currencies, but it is difficult to fight fire with more fire (but not impossible). Deflation can be a healthy, but painful, correction of these systems (as we see in bitcoin boom-bust cycles). It's better to have good policies in the first place instead of having to worry about how to make a 'soft landing'.Another argument against deflation is that people who were first into the system benefit more than people who enter later. This happens with any system, and inflation does not remove this problem. New amounts of money, the new inflated amounts, are normally awarded to those who maintain power over the system and causes similar, if not worse, rewards to those at top. In this sense, inflation is worse than deflation because it allows an artificial group to remain at the top, rather than allowing that money to be distributed throughout the system. Inflation without proper policy does not change this problem of deflation.A usual argument is that inflation allows people to pay off their debts. This is only true if people's salaries rise with the inflationary measures, which you are lucky if this holds true. The problem with inflation here is that the new inflation amounts of the currency are given originally to close allies, rather than through broad distribution among all classes. It is difficult to force all businesses to keep up with inflationary policies. Companies must have also received inflation-related gains to be able to award their employees with similar (or usually lower) gains. Employees also have to continue to receive those matching gains to benefit, so they must have enough soft power within their organisations to argue for those gains, otherwise they do not receive higher compensations. It is far too easy for companies higher in the chain of companies to keep their inflation-given gains and not pass them on, and for companies to not pass those inflation-given gains to their employees. Are there other arguments to inflation or deflation? I'm interested in hearing more discussion on this. Thanks.",

I'd like to live in a world where deflationary currency is used but I really doubt I ever will. For me the ideal situation would be either 0 inflation, or a small deflation. People would continue to spend money even knowing the currency deflates, but it would give them a chance to save if they wanted to. They wouldn't have to use banks for that and risk having their money taken away from them, like people in China.",

I don't think realistically in the world we live in, with all the anomalies that present themselves, low inflation is achievable in the long term. At the moment to slash inflation, we're basically introducing measures which will guarantee we have to raise inflation in the future. Allowing people to buy things cheaper, is only a temporary measure, and because of the way capitalism works, temporarily loaning people money or giving them allowances only helps in the short term, and again inflation rises in the long term.Capitalism, and inflation go hand in hand, but it doesn't work.

Prices keep increasing, the living costs increase and burden consumers who are looped into a vicious cycle of more and more expensive products. Certainly, both deflation and inflation are bad. I remember, a few weeks ago, reading an example of why deflation is worse than inflation. You're going to buy a car, the price has changed and now costs $500 less. Hearing this, you're waiting and expecting the price to drop even further, thus, you're not spending, the dealership is not making any money and is unable to pay their employees, who are made redundant. With inflation though, you're pressured to purchase in advance, because you're expecting price increases, thus, money is being spent, which is beneficial for the economy. A personal example, when the war started, we were expecting massive price increases in petrol. Thus, I proceeded to put fuel before the price increased any further. On the other hand, when oil crashed a few weeks ago, I waited a couple of days till gas prices dropped at the pumps.",

Just like the points have been made, one of the major disadvantage of deflation is that it doesn't encourage production in the country and that cause the country to earn less, also because of no production the job losses will be high as employment rate will decrease. At the long run it also may increase the rate of interest rate to loans to discourage more people from having excess money that will further increase the deflation but it also has some advantage which is the standard of living, reduced price and demand etc.",

      "body": "Interesting discussion. Odolvlobo has already written about the basic effects of each: Quote from: odolvlobo on August 16, 2022, 09:20:12 PMInflation encourages spending and investing, but discourages saving and lending. Deflation encourages saving and lending, but discourages spending and investing.But there is a small, but important twist.Deflation is when money is appreciating over time. It is however not the same than if your average salary (for the same work) is appreciating. Even if we have high (e.g. 10%/year) inflation, your hourly wage could grow 12% per year, and then you have a 2% surplus - your \"labor\" would be worth more each day.This is often what is tried to achieve by \"traditional\" central bank measures, i.e. trying to have a low, but positive inflation (most often the goal is 2%), to encourage spending, and at the same time make grow the real wages (i.e. those adjusted to inflation).You can then buy each time more things with your salary, even if there is inflation.How does saving and investing fit in these considerations?Saving is encouraged if a safe, (almost) risk-less way exists to save your money which gives higher returns than inflation. For example, if a savings account gives interests of 3%/year and inflation is 2%/year, then saving is encouraged even if inflation is over zero. Obviously, if the inflation is negative, then you can \"save\" even simply holding your money. But this is not necessarily good, as this money is taken out of circulation, while money from a saving accounts boosts the balance of the bank, and they can give out more loans.Obviously, in the last years due to extremely low interest rates saving accounts returns were near zero, so people went desperately searching other, more risky, saving alternatives. This \"cheap money policy\" benefitted Bitcoin, after all About investing, it is even more complex. Companies invest in new facilities etc. if there are 1) market opportunities (i.e. if they can get more profit after having invested) and 2) they can afford the interest rates for the loans they need. If there is deflation, the problem is 1) is unlikely to be met. Market opportunities, at least in the case of \"traditional\" joint-stock or limited corporations, need economic growth, as that is the most important factor for a share price increase. Deflation unfortunately often decreases growth as it discourages spending (in our current economic system). 2) can happen, if there is a low-interest policy.So the effect of deflation on investing is ambiguous (always talking about a pure, traditional capitalist economy, where joint-stock corporations are the most important business model).However, deflation could encourage investing in companies which are not so much dependant on economic growth. For example, a cooperative, in contrast to a joint-stock corporation or a Limited company, would benefit from deflation, as they are not so dependant on a share price increase, and their costs to operate the company would then be lower each time. Cooperatives benefit their members/investors by providing them services or goods, so there may be always a reason to found one and invest in it.Long term deflation would thus probably lead to incentives to transition from an economy where joint-stock/limited companies are \"the norm\" to a model close to cooperatives. This has advantages, as cooperatives are known to be very stable and long-lived, but also disadvantages, as their model does not encourage innovation - innovation would have to be encouraged by external means.(Sorry for the wall of text  )",
