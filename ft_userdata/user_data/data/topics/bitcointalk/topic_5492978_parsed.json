As a form of exchange, Bitcoin is not so widely accepted in the world right now because most countries have not yet shown the green flag to it and you can barely find people or places where Bitcoin is accepted apart from a few countries that are Bitcoin-friendly and allow this thing.The scarcity of Bitcoin is the reason why it's so popular because the demand keeps increasing and since it has a limited supply, it's value goes up every time the demand increases and more people want to have a share of the existing supply of it. This is also why the halving event is considered so important because it reduces the increasing supply of Bitcoin which makes it have a more stagnant circulating supply while the demand keeps increasing.",

Like gold, silver, etc. Bitcoin is not only valuable because of its supply. Instead the capped supply is a contributing factor, the main factor is its utilities.

You're right, creating a coin with a finite supply has never been too difficult, many altcoins also have this feature but it's confusing that many people always consider it the pride of bitcoin. In my opinion, the difference and most outstanding point of bitcoin is decentralization and so far no currency has achieved the level of decentralization like bitcoin. Additionally, an asset with a finite supply is useless if it has no use case. Bitcoin has many factors that set it apart from the rest of the world, not just its limited supply.",

However, they neglect the limitations it can cause for the progress of Bitcoin. No wonder some crypto projects avoided that limitation and even made their projects more scalable than Bitcoin. All these are pros even if we are finding some excuses to prove that Bitcoin is better. And of course, it's uncontroversial that Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency in the world. It prepared the table for other cryptocurrencies and is the pioneer, what do you expect? It is already inculcated into the mainstream of the financial market and I expect it to take the front roll and role for as long as possible.However, I hope the government will not someday clamp down on it, I don't trust them. This will be severe on the private and corporate users due to its decentralisation. Bitcoin is a true decentralised cryptocurrency, it has always been the headache of the government and they've never hidden their grievance about that. If that is left out of it, Bitcoin is the biggest name in the crypto space and will remain like that as long as cryptocurrency exists.",
