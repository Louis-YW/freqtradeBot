Mining requires you to make some calculations like electricity bill if the miner you bought and how easy you have access to 24 hours electricity throughout the whole week. Bitcoin holding is also different from trading, but you have to know what you want to invest on before investing.",

I don't mind buying Bitcoin from any of the trusted exchange because what matters most is where you store your Bitcoin and not where you buy them because most of the best places to buy Bitcoin are centralized exchange and you have to pass their  KYC process.To avoid been a victim of fraud, use top exchanges that are popular because this exchange won't have any criminal reasons to want to scam you. You can also buy Bitcoin from this forum as we have reputable members that'll be willing to sell you bitcoin and take your fiats.",

Mean there are CEXs (centralized exchanges) and DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) from where you could do p2p to buy BTC with your fiat. Most veteran people here prefer DEXs but many Newbies use CEXs. What is best for you? Answer of this query depends on the factor that either you want to remain anonymous while making P2P, because in CEXs you have to do KYC but in DEXs you do not have to do any KYC. I will mention both platforms here then the decision will be yours. Instead of sharing the names I think following threads will help you out:List of Decentralized/Centralized Exchanges--> by erzascarlet_30Current list of exchanges without KYC --> By Ratimov List of P2P/no-KYC exchanges--> By Wind_FURY If you do not know what is the importance of using decentralized exchanges and how much people are being careful with Centralized and Decentralized platforms then I suggest you to read this informative thread by Ratimov.My 7 years of experience with CEXs (4 years on Bitcointalk)To be Honest, I also realized the importance of DEXs and CEXs after reading this thread.",

You are right; almost every centralised exchange asks for KYC to perform p2p trading. Because it is written in the policy that they are asking for KYC to increase security and decrease scams, But there might be some exchanges that are providing p2p, but they are not on that list. In my opinion, if one wants to do p2p, he or she should go for BISQ or any other decentralised p2p trading platform.Because even if these centralised platforms allow you to do p2p trading for the first or third time, at some point they will ask you for KYC, which could also lead to the seizure of assets. So, the best thing is to use a decentralised platform for p2p purposes.If the OP does not care about anonymity and is open to all kinds of exposure and risk, If your key is not your coin, then he should use centralised exchanges like Binance or some other. But he should avoid Huobi, as Huobi is under great pressure.",

I think this will be the finest place for getting the appropriate guidance and instructions on how to get my coins so that I may also achieve my dream of owning bitcoin and begin trading.You are in the right place to get it done. But that bold part of the statement of fallacy. Any amount of money that you lost for anything, it pains the person. There was a time I loss almost $250 for trading, and I was doing as if all was well by the faces of others but my brothers and sisters all was not well, though I was having enough of it but the amount that lest me at that time pained me but since I could not do anything I have to let go. So no amount of money afford to lose and all amount is important.I know that others have said and told you where to get your bitcoins and also add it to what they have already said, you can purchase your bitcoin in decentralized exchanges and also some centralized exchange like Binance and KuCoin and the most important place to have it is the p2p. Buy it from someone you know very well and start your hodling from there.",

Not only the hack issue, but sometimes most of those centralised platforms come up with some kind of issue where they can disable withdrawal, and if you buy a chance and want to make use of your asset at that moment, you cannot withdraw it.

I've done my research now and i see they are back again [1]The exchange seems to be shrouded with drama. One of the co-founders Artur Schaback filed a lawsuit against the other co-founder, Ray Youssef who was the ceo at that time, and that was why they shut down. From what i also read Ray Youssef resigned from his position at that time, and suddenly the exchange is now back in operation without addressing any of the issues that made them close in the first place; i don't think anyone should trust this exchange.[1] https://www.google.com/amp/s/decrypt.co/139419/p2p-bitcoin-marketplace-paxful-reopens-after-abrupt-closure?amp=1",
