For each 2 merit points received you also get 1 \"Smerit\" (sendable merit) that you can give to other users. So 12 / 2 = 6You have 6 Smerits to send to others. Your received merit points will not change, even if the post gets deleted.More info here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2818350.0",

I will be pleased to know about this.Every merit you recieve, you will be able to send half of it, so if you receive 1 merit, you will be able to send half of 1 merit which is impossible, so you will have to receive 2 merits before you can send 1 merit. Since you are having 12 merits then you will be able to send 6 merits which is your smerit, their is difference between your main merit and your smerit, your merit is the total merit which you received, why your smerit is the total merit which you can send. If you you are sending merit to anyone, your total merit remains, only your smerit will be deducted, if you are having 12 merits and 6 smerit, if you send 1 merit to anyone, your 12 merits remains but your 6 smerit will reduce to 5 smerit.",

I’m pretty sure that the proportion of people that didn’t know the proper answer is higher than what the (mini) poll indicates, as often Beginners & Help is roamed by people that are not precisely beginners (in order to help Beginners out).",

I will be pleased to know about this.There are actually two types of merits that you have on the forum which is received merits and on that base you get smerits which you can give out to others.As others have already explained this concept to you in detail that for every merits you receive you get half of them as smerits to spend on the forum and your merit count will remain the same only.For example :You received 20 merits you get 10 smerits for them which you can give out to other members on the forum but your merits remain 20 onlyYou received 100 merits you get 50 smerits which you can send to other members overtime on the forum so you see for every 2 merits you get 1 smerit until you are merit source who get more merits to distribute to members.",

I will be pleased to know about this.I have one question for you that is much more important than what you are asking, and question is: for what reason are your topics locked and some of your posts deleted? I would be really surprised if you answer, because I know you have a lot of work to do with creating another low-value topic and maybe another alt account.",

I will be pleased to know about this.You've got 12 Merits already, which gives you an additional (6 sendable merits) which means on every acquired merit you earn, you will be given half of it as smerit, now this smerit is not useful to you than to give it out to someone whom you find with a quality post of your choice, no one determines who you should give or not but your judgement to decide but only give a quality post, the more you give from your smerits it decreases in numbers and the more you earn merits it adds more to your smerits",

For the statement about you can send it to whoever you want or who you think deserve it is not just what happened because I am sure you know that some people abused this which is to send smerits to an alt account, to sell for crypto that is why after the implementation of smerits theymos made changes and that's why there's now forum users who are merit sources.",
