Throughout this longstanding relationship with the community, I have actively contributed to numerous historical events that support the Bitcoin community. Many members have vouched for my contributions multiple times. My feedback page, which currently boasts 20 positive feedback, serves as a substantial reference. Although there are 3 negative feedback from two different users. It simply explains that in 9 years of being part of a community, it is impossible to please everyone.Screenshot of feedback page.I kindly request you to first read the 3 negative feedback, then review my portfolio and navigate to the ACTIVE CAMPAIGN(s) section. I consistently deliver the best value to the clients I work with and to the members who assist me in executing campaigns under my management. I comprehend the significance of the ROI for your project and possess a profound understanding of the community's ecosystem. Through the perfect balance, when I oversee your campaign, both you and the campaigners are content with the results. This satisfaction is reflected in the 20 positive feedback I have received and the recognition from top brands within their respective industries.QuoteYou're doing really good job, never regretted choosing you =)- Sinbad.io ManagementQuotecould be better cuz adv prices currently are too high for any crypto projecta lot of money going to advertisingi think we have good results anyway- Yo!Mix Management.Sinbad.io Bitcoin Mixer, Yo!Mix mixer, [banned mixer] mixer are top and the biggest mixers right now in bitcoin mixer industry.Sherbet.com, Moneypot are two promising gambling platform who are slowly making their business bigger to have a place in the TOP of the industry.

Even now, for the active projects mentioned above, I am holding over $35,000 worth of BTC in my personally secured wallet, which is a 2 of 2 multi-sig wallet. The annual turnover of my campaign management business exceeds $200,000. Bitcointalk Campaign Management (Signature & Bounty) has become a recognized brand within the community. Currently, 7 to 10 employees work for the brand on a full-time, part-time, or contract basis.I have never felt the need for a self-defense service discussion thread like this before. However, recently, I have considered it due to the false information being spread about my business by certain individuals. Over the years, I have also encountered jealousy from people, some of whom have gone to such extremes that one specific member called airfinex (though I believe there are a few others involved) has even contacted potential clients, attempting to dissuade them from hiring my services. An example of this is provided below.Image part -1Image part-2If you have received such a message already, I kindly request that you take a moment to thoroughly research all the information I have presented. Please examine the current projects and analyze their results. I urge you to conduct your own due diligence rather than swiftly changing your mind based on an unsolicited private message from a random Bitcointalk member. This individual appears to be retaliating, using selectively chosen quotes from different members to justify their actions. It's important to note that my business ranks among one of the top (I am sure members will give their opinion of what rank my service deserves) in this community, which receives three million monthly visitors.Your project deserves the expertise of the best marketing agency, and Bitcointalk Campaign Management (Signature & Bounty) is your ultimate trusted partner to elevate your brand to the top of your business niche.The thread is self-moderated (to prevent overzealous bad actors) and is exclusively open for constructive discussions.

Payouts are always accurate and on-time. As a campaign manager Royse777 has no control over whether a business ceases to operate or not, therefore I don't believe he is worthy of negative trust from failed businesses that he has ran campaigns for. From my experience if a business had valid negative allegations against them, Royse777 promptly ended his services appropriately. A good example of this is CoinPlay (referenced). I will update my feedback if my opinion ever changes in validity.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=366632 AHOYBRAUSE    2023-04-28        Great campaign manager.

He is a member with a long history full of accomplishments.I know Royse777 since late 2019 when he launched lending services for the first time and although I did not deal with him in lending, but I was noticing how integrated and his competence to management business. Then we worked together in the signing campaign for Bestchange and we were together among the few who defended Bestchange because of the attack on the service by many members (that campaign is still active for nearly 4 years today). Then we discussed a few times within the donation campaign that he launched during the Covid19 crisis (at that time, i wanted to help some of the needy, but it was not possible for many reasons). After the end of the Bitlucy crisis, which Royse777 was involved in (I blamed him at that time for his poor management of the crisis before the matter was finally remedied), I joined many of the signature campaigns he managed. Frankly, I found that he is a wonderful person, very understanding and managing his campaigns with a lot of professionalism, providing safety and cost-effectiveness for both; advertisers and participants in the campaigns.Just as I may thank him of his accomplishments in preserving Bitcointalk as a wonderful space that brings us together, I regret all the attacks led by many members who are jealous of his successes (there is no other explanation for all that drama led by some sick minds).",

On Sinbad mixer, I see him introducing innovative features that boost both the reward structure for the participants and the overall appeal of Sinbad, it's easy to conclude any enterprise that hires him for Bitcointalk will have made a wise business decision.",

      "body": "What an interesting way to spend your time on Bitcointalk. Follow someone's business ventures and contact those they work with or could possibly work with in private and suggest to them to change their minds. The BitLucy campaign left a very sour taste in his mind. For what it's worth, I have been a participant in some of your campaigns and haven't seen anything that would make me think twice about joining a campaign that you manage.",

      "body": "Royse is one of the most generous and trusted members of the forum. I have worked with him on a few signature campaigns and found him very honest and a respect worthy person. Other than signature campaigns I have also worked with him on two review campaigns and I can proudly say that the person is an amazing manager. All the work that I have done with Royse went very smoothly and I received my payments on time. That shows how good he is in management of funds and campaigns and any business who hires him for such work will see great results without any doubt.The members who are trying to degrade his reputation are the ones with internal hatred for him because I believe that Royse always give opportunity to the ones who deserve the opportunity. Royse is a manager who always give opportunity to the ones who work hard to contribute information on the forum. I got opportunity to work with Royse multiple times and surely I will love to work with him in future. I can confidently say that all the businesses, mixers, casinos, and other platforms that want to have proper marketing on this forum can trust Royse without any doubt.",

      "body": "I have also worked on his campaign. I do not count for how long I have worked, but I did not have any problem with his campaigns. I am a campaign participant and I can see how he cares about the quality of users' posts. Users get kicked out of the campaign if they cannot maintain the quality. This simply shows how he cares about his clients and their money. I would suggest his potential clients check the running projects that he is handling and how many projects he has handled so far. He does not have a single reason to scam anyone in the future. He can be a pretty good employe for your project. Good luck Roy!",

      "body": "I don't see why somebody would take it on as a job to attack another man's business/potential clients; this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. This is wrong. I previously underestimated Royse's management skills since I was looking at it from a distance, but as I came closer, I realised I was mistaken; I've been working for Royse for months and there have never been any payment issues. He accounts for every dime that passes through his fingers, and there have been no complaints about mismanagement or poor management of fundsHe works his tail off to ensure that his clients get the most value for their money. Royse does not simply select users for a job; he selects the best and demands the best from the people he works with. Royse earned my respect even before I began working with him. Keep up your great work, Royse; you don't need public validation when your work history and forum reputation speak for itself. Keep up Royse!!!",
