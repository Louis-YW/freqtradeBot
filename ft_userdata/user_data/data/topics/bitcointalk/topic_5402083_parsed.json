Or the Chinese, Japanese or Russian?AFAIK, the national legislation of the EU members is synchronized with the European rules and regulations, so there's no need to for a small business owner to check out both the national and the EU laws. I can't stand the European bureaucrats, but this isn't a reason for the EU to collapse. Is the EU guilty for many countries having their own shitty local and national laws and regulations? I don't think so.Are you facing difficulties with your own small business?",

      "body": "I don’t think this any different from legislation’s around the world. You have to pay to every government whether it’s state or national. The tax slots might be different throughout the world for every commodity but it’s nothing like it’s zero in one country and hundred in other country. Whether it’s USA, EU or Asia or any other continent the respective government will define such tax regulations because that’s what helps improve the nation and boost the development. That does not make the EU go down the sink, that makes its development and yes stress is on us as tax payer but we benefit too.",

We are talking about how EU is doing terrible right now like that is not a global problem, it is not just an EU problem.Sure, they are known to come out of these things usually without harm, and that is something I would have expected them to do again, but at this point I doubt that it would be similar at all, it would be smarter to let them be instead. Maybe in a few years, they would be doing much better, who knows? This is why it would be smarter to just wait and see how they are doing.",

      "body": "If it's hard starting a business in the EU due to legal things, it doesn't automatically mean that the EU economy is going down the drain (or, if it is, it's not necessarily due to difficulties with business). Perhaps what's hard about it to you is that you try to do it yourself and many probably hire a professional to do it for them (or to give them advice, at least). Also, I might be wrong but I thought taxes were quite different in various countries within the EU, and the amount of resources various EU countries spend on Ukraine, migrants and tolerance are certainly very different.",

      "body": "I think one of the reasons that small businesses are finding it difficult could be the issue of tax levy. The Europe economy is based on taxation and this is a big challenge that makes an individual find it difficult for entrepreneurship but nevertheless the government takes care of rural amenities. Europe however knows how to do bailout for each other in the case of economic crisis but that is still not the case.",

Talking micro business and you seem to understand the overall context of how the production system of one product with other goods.Based on your complaint it may be better for you to take the funding provided by the EU government. You can see several ways and categories of anyone who can get funding below:QuoteThe EU has several different funding programmes that you may be able to apply for, depending on the nature of your business or project. There are two different types:  direct funding and indirect funding.Direct fundingThe allocation of direct funding capital is managed by the European Institutions. There are two types of funding available: grants and contracts. You can apply for grants and contracts managed by the European Commission on the Funding and Tenders portal.GrantsGrants are given to specific projects that relate to EU policies, usually following a public announcement known as a call for proposals.Who is eligible?You may apply for a grant if you run a business or a related organisation (business associations, business support providers, consultants, etc.) that runs projects that further the interests of the EU, or if you contribute to the implementation of an EU programme or policy.ContractsContracts are issued by EU institutions to buy services, goods or works that they need for their operations – such as studies, training, conference organisation or IT equipment.Indirect fundingIndirect funding is managed by national and regional authorities and comprises nearly 80% of the EU budget, mainly through 5 big funds that come under the umbrella of the European Structural and Investment Funds.The funds are:European Regional Development Fund – regional and urban developmentEuropean Social Fund – social inclusion and good governanceCohesion Fund – economic convergence by less-developed regionsEuropean Agricultural Fund for Rural DevelopmentEuropean Maritime and Fisheries Fundsource : EU funding programmesIf in the end, you keep complaining about this and that, it means that the problem lies with you who do not like a state policy to carry out economic growth.",

      "body": "I am not from Europe, but i understand the problem to be a near universal one, small businesses (microeconomics) always struggle to get going at the beginning, either due to lack of funding/tax laws, etc, but it does not mean you can't still run your business in the midst of all this challenges. In fact, starting a business is always difficult, weathering the initial storm is what determines the level of success in the long run.Having said that, maybe you could move/relocate your business to areas that have less stringent laws/problems that directly affect your business, you could also seek funding/loans to get you started, and to solve some of the problems you are currently facing; mind you also that all of those laws have and serve a purpose, it might be a pain in the ass for you, but it does, you should seek professional advice and take a decison whether to go on with your business plan/idea or not.",
