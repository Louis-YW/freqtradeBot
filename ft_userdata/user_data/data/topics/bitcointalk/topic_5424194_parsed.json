As far as I know, they are struggling to find additional funds and one of the possible outcomes of this situation is that they might be forced to sell all the 643,572 bitcoins. How far BTC can drop if this will happen? Let's speculate. First of all, I don't think that they are that stupid to buy high and sell low. If they wanted to sell, they could have done that when the trend has change.However, let's speculate: it would depend greatly on how much time they have. If time is not a big issue (but then why don't just wait a couple more months?) then they (or their brokers) would sell so slowly you may not even notice. Then the price may not even go noticeably lower. If they just dump everything (which would be overly stupid for their business too), then the price will go much lower, but I don't know how low - it depends if it's done in steps, it depends where and how big the support amounts are - but going down to 10k, 8k or even lower would not be a surprise, especially as such a move comes with public declarations - sooner or later - and all the panic and drama you can imagine.",

      "body": "I'm pretty sure Grayscale isn't going to throw away all the bitcoins they've been holding for so long. Even if they are forced to sell, it is possible that their selling strategy will not be realized by most traders so that it will not damage the market price. After all, Grayscale would probably only sell some of their bitcoin if they wanted to, but not in the current market condition. Throwing bitcoin at the moment in large quantities is only hurting them instead of making a profit.",

How far BTC can drop if this will happen? What happened to crypto market when FTX collapsed? Nothing more than bear market, but bear market can be painful to some people, the people that invested at that time, especially on altcoins which are more volatile, but the crypto market still survive and an opportunity for those that buy after price fall because after bears are bulls. Nothing will happen to bitcoin than its price to decrease further and that does not mean it will not reach ATH when the time to reach that high price comes.",

Actually Grayscale has more than 14 digital assets invested, one of which is Bitcoin, of course there are many others.Proof:Grayscale Investments HoldingsIf I were to speculate, Grayscale's main goal is not to sell the underlying assets of 633.15K BTC and others, you can see their statement here.QuoteNotice: Grayscale does not sell the underlying assets within its trusts. If Grayscale's products have a decline in AUM, that is because of a decline in the price of the underlying asset.The decrease in holdings (negative number) in the chart refers to the annual fee deducted by the grayscale irregularly.Point, they only take profit/year of every asset they invest, so they don't sell it.",

      "body": "I have the same thoughts as with the previous response. Grayscale won’t even pursue to obtain and accumulate such volume of bitcoin if they will just end up being forced to sell it, they must have a plan, everybody in this market does. But, if they would allegedly proceed in disposing such, this will undoubtedly affect the market. And as mentioned, this will be a matter of when, how much and approach of selling their coins to the market. And if that happens, we could assume to see a huge drop, but it’s not an indication that it will be end. Surely, there are a lot of traders who are just waiting to buy more coins at this time, and that’s just one of the many factors that could let the circulation of the market to continue, then eventually to its way up to recovery.",

Everything would depend at the rate they do this, if they simply want to get out of their bitcoin position without making too much noise then they could sell 1000 BTC per day, which is the equivalent of more than 17 millions, and no one will notice as the volume is way higher than that, at this rate in less than two years they will sell all their bitcoin.However if Grayscale wanted to get rid of their coins in a month then they will need to sell more than 21k BTC per day, which is more than 363 millions, and such a huge amount will definitely affect the markets, especially since people will notice and the news that Grayscale is selling all their coins could crash the market.",

Grayscale in this scenario of dumping would probably crash the piece even if would spread it over weeks, it's 10 billion worth of coins with almost no buying power, with every company in debt and everyone seeking loans and a dump would just trigger more bankruptcies, and more money of what is still left fleeing to other \"safe\" assets.That being said, Grayscale has zero reasons to sell their coins at this point, absolutely none.Quote from: Husires on November 30, 2022, 02:11:05 PMWe will start thinking about many hypotheses, and the most expensive you will need a lot of details:There is another hypothesis, and that's actually the dangerous one because it has declined to publish its proof-of-reserves there is speculation that they actually don't have that many coins.
