  "content": "I'd love to hear how everyone get into Crypto!For myself , I started getting interested in Crypto (BTC) around the silk road days - through a documentary (I love those classic narco style docs) but I was about 15 at the time and didn't really have any money or the know how to buy it specifically in the New Zealand at the time. Fast forward 4 years I buy some Bitcoin the day i move to England just for some fun, completely forget about it for 2 years. One day I was completely broke and remembered I had brought some Bitcoin a few years back. I ended up making about £120 on my investment (crazy to me at the time).Fast forward I couple years and it's COVID, I've moved back in with my parents and I'm getting covid money form the government. I invest every single cent and I've been DCA fortnightly ever since! Would like to hear your stories!",

      "body": "This question has been raised multiple times on the forum but anyways here's my take. One of the reasons why I am into cryptocurrency was mainly because of my curiosity about tons of things way back in 2015. I've stumbled upon bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies while checking out multiple onions websites on deepweb since it was included on most transactions as a mode of payment. At that time, as a broke college student, I've become more interested in bitcoin and how to earn it.I've started earning bitcoin, litecoin, clam, dogecoin, and other cryptocurrencies thru faucets, and gambling sites and even tried mining using my laptop back then. I was able to earn at least 1-2dollars per day by doing those things until I visited this forum where I learn a lot of things and how to earn more thru campaigns and trading. Right now, Trading, campaigns, and gambling are my way of earning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which I think has a lot of potential to invest to. PS: I still am curious where I've saved my private key for my doge wallet as the value of the my doge that I've earned thru faucets is now much higher than before.",

      "body": "First found out about Bitcoin when I was young and stupid and was looking for easy ways of making money online. I stumbled upon Bitcoin mining, but my shitty laptop wasn't good enough to mine anything.Found out about Bitcoin the second time when the news broke that Bitfinex got hacked; it was in the frontpage of Reddit at that time. Realized that Bitcoin wasn't just something you solely make money on by mining so I dug deeper.If you want to read a lot more about this, there are these old threads:Topic: How did you find out about Bitcoin? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=162741.0Topic: When and how did you discover Bitcoin? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5378224.0",

So I don't have to rewrite about it. Newspapers and online media have invited me to this space.Quote from: BITCOIN4X on March 30, 2022, 08:06:33 PMI read newspapers and some other online media and I found bitcoin being talked about even though some of my friends have been here for bitcoin since mid 2015. I really didn't realize that until one day they admitted they had been here for a long time and even had hundreds of bitcoin. This is my 4th year on the forum, I'm really enjoying it now and I'm lucky during that time I'm enjoying some ATH.But wait, why am I starting to think your story is unbelievable?Quote from: feeling sound on August 01, 2022, 04:27:28 PMFast forward 4 years I buy some Bitcoin the day i move to England just for some fun, completely forget about it for 2 years.
