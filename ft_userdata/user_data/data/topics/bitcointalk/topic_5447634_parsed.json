  "content": "Disregard the Terrence Crawford and Keith Thurman. The match we have been waiting for is here! The two boxers who have never lost are on the same page. The date is June 17, and the location is Las Vegas, Nevada. When there were no promoters or other parties involved, the talks became effective. Terrence Crawford had previously told reporters that he would personally speak with Errol Spence and that was it. Someone that has 0 has to go. Another division that all alphabets will be unified. We are encouraging the other divisions to do the same, one champion.https://www.badlefthook.com/2023/4/5/23670821/errol-spence-vs-terence-crawford-fight-done-deal-june-17-las-vegas-showtime-ppv-boxing-news-2023",

It's going to be an exciting match.It's up to their strategies and execution, for sure. With their strengths in the ring, it's tough to predict, but I would go with Spence. Errol Spence has that power, skill, and condition. I'm basing the influence on his stats having a high percentage of knockouts. Maybe he can knock out Crawford. We will see.",

I don't think the delay will affect the hype of this fight. As long as both fighters remain champions and undefeated, people will still want to see their fight. The delay might be an attempt to build even more hype and make more money. If the fight takes place next year, that's okay. We already have a lot of big fights scheduled for this year, so let's save some for next year.",

Just wondering though why it will have to be announced on the fight of Tank Davis vs Ryan Garcia, what significant of that it being to make that important statement?But in any case, I agree with what the rest of the posters said, wait for it until it's become official. We have been anticipating that this fight is going to be made last year if I'm not mistaken, but the negotiations was bad and ugly according to Crawford. But maybe they patch things everything and sit down and try to understand the importance of this fight, and definitely for the money.",
