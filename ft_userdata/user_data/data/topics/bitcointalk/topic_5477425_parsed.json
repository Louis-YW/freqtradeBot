  "content": "This thread is dedicated to my fellow newbies and to whom else (other ranks) it may concern.I have been hovering over several boards in the forum not because I just want to jingle around but because most times if I am not inspired with meaningful contributions to the forum, I would just have to read in-between lines across different boards with the aim of learning how my superior members undernotes (constructs) their posts of qualitatives.Hence, we the newbies tends to grow and meets up to some certain heights and that can only be achieved if we could make constrictive and meaningful and quality posts in other to earn Merits.Formally I thought earning merits is such as making one of the long (lengthy) posts which could attract the Merit source person's but just a few moments ago, i came across one of the ranked legendary @Charles-Tim very brief post reply which earned 3 merits at my time of views.It was questionable to me on how could that be? Then I figured out that the post was merited because is has a solution to the thread on discuss https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5476902.msg63284065#msg63284065.Here I am to say it is not most about how lengthy or numerous times you contributes to the forum that earns you merits but what you offers to profer solutions and the level of qualities of how constructive your posts are.Let my fellow newbies take note.",

As long as everyone can understand what you are passing then it's good, when forum members advise about making constructive posts this is what they mean in a nutshell. One thing to focus, is your post shouldn't be congested but offer readability to all.",

I think the whole essence of the merit system is basically to encourage people to pass relevant and valuable information that will be of help to the forum and it has little or nothing to do with the length of your post. If you can write a 2-line  post that is of help to members of the forum, it's better and will even yield you more merit compared to trying to make your post bulky all because you want people to perceive that youre saying anything meaningful.No be everybody get time to de read your plenty grammar so if you have a contribution to make, do so in the most simple and straight forward way.If you're good at analysing post that gets the highest number of merit, you will find out that it's more of what value it has added to the forum and it jas nothing to do with how length or short it is.",

Don’t be surprised if a post of maybe 20 lines( just an example) doesn’t receive any merit, and a post of 1 line might end up receiving lots of merits. It’s not about the post length, it’s about the quality of the information you are passing and how useful your post is to the forum and the forum members. Don’t think you can use post length to deceive people, or you think they will just read the title of your post and merit you, most of them are always taking their time to read everything, and if they notice it’s useless, then no merit for you.",

Believe me, a few correct and well constructed sentence can earn a person much merit than a lengthy one as the post may lacks substance. The merit system is there to help gear up our style of posting, what we post and how useful it becomes after posting, so it should not be a matter of creating many post thread just to earn merits, make sure your post are always constructed carefully, then you can earn good merit if that is what you want.",

How can you impress experts in Bitcoin tech in the same subject? How do you impress people who have been in mining business for years on the same topic when you should be learning from them? It is truly frustrating trying to impress people in order to be rewarded with merits. The moment I realized my mistake of trying to impress people, I decided to stop and appreciate my position which was newbie then. I became more of a learner, asking relevant questions and engaging in discussions as freely and naturally as I could be. I reinvented my originality and that was when the merit started coming effortlessly. I simply stopped posting for the sake of earning merit but because I want to be part of discussion in various sections of the forum.",
