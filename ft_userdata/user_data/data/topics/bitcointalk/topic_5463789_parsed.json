  "content": "First of all, here's definition SEO spam for those who're not aware of such term.Quote from: https://www.malcare.com/blog/seo-spam/SEO spam attack is a black hat SEO technique used by hackers to manipulate search engine results by filling your website with spam links and keywords. Search engines like Google typically reject spammy links to fake products, pharmaceutical ads, and adult, or gambling sites. But, they may mistakenly index the spam pages on your site due to their SEO value and authority.While SEO spam usually removed on this forum in short interval, in past few months i notice higher frequency of SEO spam on some boards on this forum. In addition, i notice some technique which used to evade removal/report such as,1. Using white color and small font size.Code:[SIZE=1][url=ffstylishname[dot]com][color=#FFFFFF]Free Fire name style[/color][/url][/SIZE]Example of the BBcode was taken and modified from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441463.msg62717802#msg62717802. Backup link available on https://loyce.club/archive/posts/6271/62717802.html.2. Use AI generated text to make it less spammy.Screenshot taken from https://loyce.club/archive/posts/6266/62660310.html3. Create reply which contain generic response/AI generated text. But later it's edited add SEO spam link, which wouldn't be noticed by most member.4. Make reply/thread which actually engage some discussion, but padded with non relevant link. An example was mentioned on How are the rules on \"link dumps\"? Should this be forbidden?.Those technique has some success where some of those SEO spam post/thread manage to last few months to years before i accidentally notice and report those. So i'm here with following suggestion,1. Improve bot/tool which detect spam (such as MindlessElectron) to include post which combine URL with small text size or unusual color.2. Member should report post which contain non relevant link even when the text/content doesn't look spammy with reason \"SEO spam\".3. Agreeing with @NotATether post, all links posted by user should have rel=\"ugc\" attribute.",

What is direct spam is already deleted (took several minutes), what was quoted is not yet. If it will not be deleted from the posts with quotes we have another one problem: if someone will help a spammer with quotation it could stay. Don't quote spammers!",

What they should have done, is Report the post.Well, it took a little more time for these posts with spam quoting to be deleted, but they are deleted as well. Great! So we can report them too.  But unfortunately, and you are right in this, catching SEO spam in quotes is harder, because it can be in several posts from the original spam. So even if it would be deleted by report, it can be missed because links in quotes are not as visible.

I don't know if this can be considered as SEO spam, but as to me this type of spamming, when there are multiple posts \"as natural\" from newbies with promotion of some project (so called virus spam) should be considered as spam, because they are not natural. But how to report them?",

In addition, i notice some technique which used to evade removal/report such as,I'm sure Bitcointalk is a NOFOLLOW site, prior to March 1, 2020, all links on NOFOLLOW sites have no effect on indexing and ranking.QuoteGoogle introduced the nofollow attribute in 2005 as a way for publishers to address comment spam and shady links from user-generated content (UGC). Linking to spam or low-quality sites could hurt you, and nofollow offered publishers a way to protect themselves.But after March 1, 2020, Google treats links on NOFOLLOW sites as a hint to index or rank a site Quoterel=\"nofollow\": The nofollow attribute is for cases where you want to link to a page but don’t want to imply any type of endorsement, including passing along ranking credit to another page, Google said.Today vs March 2020: Today Google will treat the nofollow attribute as a hint for ranking purposes. Meaning Google might count a link as credit, consider it as part of spam analysis, or for other ranking purposes.On March 2, 2020, Google will use it also for crawling and indexing. That means will Google use it as a “hint” as to what should be indexed or crawled...So SEO spam is now being used to try to index or crawl a site, especially a new site. But I don't think Bitcointalk will be penalized for those Spam links but its recommended to be take these downQuoteTo be clear, if a site is properly using nofollow today, SEOs do not need to recommend any changes be made. Though sites are free to do so, they should not expect any rankings boost for doing so, or new penalties for not changing.https://searchengineland.com/google-to-treat-nofollow-link-attribute-as-a-hint-after-march-1-2020-321664https://moz.com/blog/nofollow-sponsored-ugcNote: I have the same response to one of your posts and this is the reason why there is a high frequency of SEO spam.",
