Whichever be the option, which of them is the most important factor for gambling success?Let me make it clear for you and everyone else that may be thinking skill can help somewhat,it cannot in 95% of the times and those 5% it can help is only when you play Poker games against other people like Texas holdem.Let's not go further than today lunch time games where Milan a heavy favorite was leading 0-2 and the game ended 2-2 with a goal void as otherwise Milan would have lost their game,now tell me if skill can help you here,it simply cannot.Better try the games that rely 100% on luck like slot machines as you know most likely you will lose but if you hit it big you will earn good money,while in sport betting you will be very sad to see lost tickets from teams like Milan which will happen a lot.",

Gambling is based on chance and probability depending on the type of game you are referring which means you can’t rely on it most the time when playing. But in general games, I believe being good on bankroll management and patience are the skills that you need to become successful in gambling.You will need luck always when gambling but the problem is there’s no way to attract it unless you have some amulet or lucky charm to use. I will go for skills that I mention above as most important thing to become successful in gambling considering that you can’t control your luck.",

Whichever be the option, which of them is the most important factor for gambling success?I'd say it's a bit of both, but it depends on what you're playing, generally the basic principle of gambling is luck.. As a previous user suggested, you'll need some knowledge to play poker or sports betting; you need to know your teams and their performances. Other games, such as dices, slots, roulette (this sits somewhere in the middle as well in terms of tactics), and so on, I'd say it's pure luck, like the majority of them out there. So I don't think there's much to do in terms of skills in gambling unless you're into sport betting, such as football or basketball, and start learning more about the involved teams, or is willing to take up poker, or other card games.",

Results are random and you have a house edge playing against you all the time, so even if you are the most skilled of the gamblers, you still have to expect being lucky in order to achieve interesting results from your gambling sessions. Without luck, you will be a skilled gambler in loss. So what is the point, after all?If you are focused in improving your skills you should do this regards a profession aiming to develop your career. There your skills will be put in better usage and return you consistent profits on long term, so you can use part of those profits for leisure purposes, such as gambling.

This you can comprehend once you have been observing games for long.Hence the term \"success\" in gambling has not concrete meaning, unless you make it up.

Gambling is a game of luck, their has been no time someone who have skill in gambling wins every gambling, but every result in gambling always ends as a result of luck.Luck is very important in gambling,  if luck hits your way it is possible to have good results in gambling always but skill doesn't determine if one will win every game in gambling.",

Over there it's not just luck, but also how other players strategize their moves and how you plan against them. But to say that skill is involved in gambling is just a misunderstanding of how chance based games work. Over time, the house edge just gets to you. No matter how patient or strategic you are, casino games have to be sustainable. So if you keep playing, you will go bust. Sadly there's no other way for game operators to keep running their games.

Even with card games such as poker which are considered as skill-based games cannot be won if you're not lucky, even if your the greatest poker player but if always gets a bad card then you will never won.But still, it's best to have a certain skills and knowledge on most gambling games to maximize your chance of winning and minimize your loses.",

But, if I had to choose an important one, then I would answer \"Skills\". That's because gambling is a game of numbers and measurables, so, if we have the skills, everything will be easy for us to read (exception for slot gambling).However, that doesn't mean luck isn't needed here, because as I said before, luck and skill are two things that must go together in gambling.",

That's why I'm playing gambling to have fun, not because I'm hoping for a lot of money.Although basically gambling is always nothing more than luck but when talking about some other bets such as sports betting then yes obviously you also really need skills if you really want to get a bigger chance. As we know that there is indeed gambling that is purely based on luck alone and there are also those that are based on skills such as sports, if indeed you have good skills and knowledge in the field of sports in any type of sport then in my opinion it is better for you to choose to bet there instead of pure luck gambling.Because with the skills you have it will make your chances of winning may be greater with some analysis that you do before betting and making decisions. But even though skill has a considerable influence in skill-based gambling I hope you still put the amount of budget that you can be responsible for whatever the final result is, because of course even then there is still a risk of losing. So by putting an amount that you can be responsible for you will be able to be more calm when the final result is not suitable. That's right, basically the casino will always win without you knowing so of course we shouldn't expect more and still think that it's nothing more than fun.",
