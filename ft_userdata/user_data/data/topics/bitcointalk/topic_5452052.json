Chipmixer is seized and the site is closed now. People are still taking advantage of this name and keep running the fake/phishing mixer site. Also, they are showing some fake notifications that how much is mixed in X minutes.Fake domain: archive: https://archive.ph/wip/mrRSTCode:https://chipmixer.be/Blender.io: According to this, blender.io service is also closed for maintenance. But one of the fake blender.io websites is still active and showing on Google's front page even has no 1 position.Fake domain: archive: https://archive.ph/dz4v4Code:https://blendor.io/Note: Especially for the Bitcoin Mixers, Due to highly profitable business, there are a lot of fake sites on the internet than the other crypto website. If you can earn money by working hard, don't be lazy when you try to use a Bitcoin mixer also. Always keep bookmarking your favorite website. and don't depend on only Google search results.

At first, I honestly didn't notice the difference until I noticed the letter (o), so there is a high probability that whoever uses Google will fall victim to this scam.As for Chipmixer, I don't think anyone will fall victim to a phishing site except the lazy ones who don't follow the news because everyone knows that the site has been shut down.",

Even their app store is plagued with malware. Fortunately, we can just use adblocker to solve most of these issues. You should use ToR anyway if you plan to use a mixer imo.",
