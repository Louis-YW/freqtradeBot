      "body": "Football, this sport is the only sport that has lost lot of money and I remember that time when the 2018 World Cup final was between France and Croatia.I dared to spend almost half of my savings to bet on Croatia, which had just reached the World Cup final for the first time. From the start of the qualifying round to qualifying for the final, Croatia was really very good they managed to beat several strong rival teams.At that time I knew that France had a squad dominated by young players but what Croatia had achieved made me brave enough to bet on them with full confidence.But everything failed, I lost the money and this became very meaningful experience for me in sports betting.From this experience plus several other experiences when the pandemic occurred which caused financial decline, it made me think about becoming wiser and more responsible person in gambling.Because I using money here, not everything can be obtained for free, so I have to manage my finances to avoid bad things that could make things difficult in the future.",

      "body": "Basketball, semi-finals. $25 each. 2 different bets for 2 teams. Did it ever make me bet that high again? No. It made me stop because I was just chasing losses at that time and luckily I won both of them. My bets are usually not going up by $10. Yeah, call me a cheap guy but sometimes I make 3-5 bets per event so you compute it. It's not like I am gambling the way others do. I put bets only to enhance the cheering part and the exciting part of the game, especially at crucial times. There are those who put more money in their bets but I don't have the courage and the money to make the same scary amount as them. I'd rather just enjoy it so that I won't get stressed the whole day that I lost an amount that could've been a day of food on the table and my wife will probably make me stop gambling if I do that again. Gotta avoid that.",

That alone was too big for me but it was a lot of fun.I don't gamble or bet on sports betting very often. Until now, I still bet on sports betting but not too often. Only if there is a certain event and I know about the event, then I place a bet. Of course, after I find out who will compete.But if I bet $5 on a game and lose, that makes me stop betting. Otherwise, I will spend even more money even though I want to limit my gambling activities.",

      "body": "I share my early experience in betting, initially I didn't understand about betting and gambling but I was inspired to see many people profit from betting and when they lose all their money in betting, they don't want to play anymore. I noticed that after winning three or four bets, they lost all the money after losing one bet, so I did not dare to bet for a long time, but suddenly one day it occurred to me that since I had  I have enough knowledge about cricket and football so I might use my knowledge to bet. This knowledge of cricket and football did not help me much and at first I lost some bets regularly and at one point I felt that I should withdraw from this betting and then I withdrew from betting temporarily. After a few days when the money was close I tried again and then adopted a different strategy. My strategy was that whichever match I could win and had a high chance of winning, I would bet on that match. I have won most of the bets using this strategy and till now I am betting with this strategy.",

My bet was on this past world cup finals between France and Argentina, I had so much confidence on France to win the game but it turned out the the game ended with a penalty kick and when I saw that it will be a penalty kick, I  knew it that I have lost it. This is because my luck is not always on penalty kick as anyone can win, even a weak team can win a strong team in penalty because it is totally based on luck. I will never forget that day because I lost big up to $300 which I have never used such amount to gamble in my entire life.",

At that time I was very confident that Argentina could win the World Cup, but people said France was the favorite, but we had the advantage of having the greatest player of all time, namely the superstar Lionel Messi.I was very worried because Argentina lead was always chased by France until the extra time ended and the score was tied at 3-3. that's where my heart beats during the penalty shootout. Will Argentina win the world cup by beating France because it is likely that this will be the last world cup for the mega star Lionel Messi. and finally my worries became joy because I got a big win at that time.
