  "content": "I recently completed a certification in Cyber security that is offered by ICS2 (International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium). ICS2 is prominent association of cyber security with around 500,000 members globally and is known for its CISSP(The Certified Information Systems Security Professional ). https://www.isc2.org/aboutThe certification is good for anyone who is perusing career in Cyber Security. The main reason I am sharing this certification is that you are free to attempt this course and once you clear it you need to pay 50$ (Annual Maintenance Fee) to become member of ICS2.Here is link to register for CC - Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) program offered by ICS2. https://www.isc2.org/landing/1mcc (This is not a referral link, just the ICS2 website link and I wont get any benefit with any new registration)Once you register you will get a promo code that allows to attempt the course for free.You can also find complete training course material once you register.",

      "body": "I am posting here after this thread was mentioned here: Cybersecurity subforumI have seen some reviews and discussion about the certification awarded by ICS2. The opinions have ranged varyingly but the one thing have not been called is a scam. Some have stated they feel the certificate was quite easy to obtain whereas some stated other things. In the end, this does not seem something I will be interested in but for those that might be, the OP has put links in his post.I am not advocating it, I would like to read opinions of forum members.",
