In terms of its energy efficiency, it is more profitable than older models and more profitable than Antminer E9 Pro, but there will be problems with the purchase. Antminer E9 Pro is sold from many trusted vendors for 4-4.5 thousand dollars at retail. Jasminer X16 I think will cost the same, but now it has to wait about 2 months.This clearly is a much better ASIC and I think it should be a great buy for anyone who has the money.For me I would buy the X4 if its price goes down with the release of this new one.Unfortunately there are not many people willing to sell used units of such good miners,even the E9 Pro which is more widely available I have checked locally and internationally and very few persons sell such devices,it means that there are people,a lot of them believing in the long term of mining success,I only wish had like 5000 dollars spare to buy one such device and keep it in my home and be extremely happy  .Jasminer are very expensive ASICs. Antminer E9 Pro will replace 7 Jasminer X4 ASICs. I think the Antminer E9 Pro update is coming soon and we will see even more hashrate to make the competitors lose out.Jasminer X4 1U ETC 5G Miner 520Mh/s | BT-MINERSVendor BT-MinersRegular price$  1,999.00Power   240Whttps://bt-miners.com/products/jasminer-x4-1u-etc-5g-miner-520mh-s?This one though is not that expensive at 2000 dollars I think,considering that Bitmain rarely makes efficient miners in terms of consumption (and I mean in the low side of power consumption because they may be very efficient with devices with much higher hash rate) and this can run at home very stable and very good.If I had to build a rig with 8 GPU-s to make it go to 520 mhsh I would most likely pay more money than 2000 dollars and surely that rig would need more maintenance than this X4 Asic device.I have never been a fan of ASICS exactly because of that higher power consumption but now seeing manufacturers that have lowered drastically the power consumption I am thinking seriously of owning one.I would study the prices of 3060 ti video cards in order to build a mining farm of 8 video cards. Most likely it will be more expensive, but you will have the choice to mine some profitable coins in the future. And with this ASIC you will have a choice of several popular coins.",

They really should of liquidated those GPUs during the POW days. The issue with those GPUs in particular is that they aren’t oriented for gaming. They got 1 output if I recall. So most likely no gamer will buy them.Add in bad profitability and hence the price. The seller probably assumed ETHW or ETC would gain more market cap and it would remain profitable however months have gone by and not much has changed.I think these rigs prices will even go more down with the passing of time and nothing happens in ETHW,ETC or ETF coins,these are the only GPU-s ETCHASH coins that can be mined,the top ones as there are others also but nothing is changing.I also changed from ETHW to ETC my mining rig only to get the money to my Atomic Wallet to directly exchange there in ZIL as I don't see that much other options for mining.With the passing of time most probably the people will start getting more angry and bored as they will see there is very little profit and sell even newer rigs at a very cheap price,I am exactly waiting for that moment.ETHW, ETC or ETF are coins for mining with the help of asics. I don’t see any hope of making a profit on these coins. There is little profit at an electricity price of 5 cents, but after 5 years of mining, video cards need to work for at least 3 years. This is a bad lottery.Yeah I have seen those Jasminer at just over 1 Ghsh for 340 watt power consumption and also the Ipollo Se and mini versions,they consume really low in terms of power and their hash rate is big enough,I think that you are right and maybe video cards are indeed a bad lottery which need to be changed for these types of efficient miners which anyone can keep in some space in their home no matter how small their home maybe,I love producers which make ASICS with low power consumption and a relatively good hash rate.If I had money to spare I would definitely buy that Jasminer X4 at 340 watt for 1040 Mhsh.A new ASIC model Jasminer X16 has already been released: 1845 MH/s at 630w. In terms of its energy efficiency, it is more profitable than older models and more profitable than Antminer E9 Pro, but there will be problems with the purchase.
