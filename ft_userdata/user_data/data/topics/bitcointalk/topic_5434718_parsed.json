      "body": "Since all investors are aware of the Ponzi scheme, it has almost vanished in recent months. However, the Ponzi scheme has recently popped up. I've been getting a lot of DMs lately about ponzi schemes. People are not investing much because of the bear market and are instead trying their luck with Ponzi schemes. Ponzi schemers take advantage of this. Anyway, I believe forum members are now well aware of ponzi schemes and high returns. Except for brand new cryptocurrency users, they should not fall victim. We must be cautious with our funds.",

      "body": "Ponzis never vanish they just come back after some time of low profile in another domain name in another web template.These guys seem to be peddling the copy-trade system as a method to make money, while I am sure they are doing nothing in reality and running only a MLM pyramid. These guys at least brought up something new.The reason they dont come to the forum much is because of the effective flagging system. But they run rampant in many social media. Newbies should learn how these scams work so they dont fall for them.",

      "body": "Ponzi operators are excellent promoters they know how to present their income plan even if it's outrageous, they are good at writing very compelling descriptions of their site, and they added all the elements on their website through testimonials, fake licenses, fake certificates, and they even hire office so you can trace on Google map, they hire fake people.Two of the most notorious Ponzi scheme in the Crypto sphere are Bitconnect and One Coin they scammed billions of dollars to so many investors in so many countries, and some of the operators are already prosecuted but I guess these Ponzi operators never learn, we still have a lot of Ponzi scheme, they come in many names and in many different platforms.",
