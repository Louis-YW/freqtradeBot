Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 25, 2022, 09:22:02 AMIt's usual aggressive promotion of a website/service where the user create same/similar thread on multiple boards. I've seen this kind of behavior at least once a week. I disagree about disabling link for new account/newbie, but people really have some security awareness and report this kind of post with note off-topic, spam or self-promotion on wrong board.We are already too harsh to newbies/jr members. Putting more restrictions will suck it more.",

      "body": "If you see something suspicious, you can use the Report button and report it, then moderators will handle it for you.[Unofficial Guide] Reporting effectivelyForum already has many restrictions on newbies and theymos does not want to implement more. Please read his postQuote from: theymos on June 25, 2018, 03:16:59 AMRight, I don't care about making money from the forum personally. (I've actually thought about getting rid of the forum ads, since it's often a big headache and the forum has enough reserves for a long time, but operating at a significant loss while there's money basically just sitting on the table feels wrong, even if the level of loss is sustainable for quite a while.)The things on the forum which encourage spam are allowed mainly because it's part of the forum's mission to be as free as possible. Eg. banning bounties would undoubtedly reduce spam, but that'd be destroying an entire economy/population/culture which has been able to develop due to the forum's freedom. I am willing to take this sort of action, but only as an absolute last resort. It's always preferable to handle these problems by reshaping the environment to make them non-problems, rather than removing some freedom.It's wonderful when someone is able to constructively do something on the forum instead of continuing with whatever they were expected to do under the status quo. Enabling that sort of thing is exactly why Bitcoin and this forum were created. Though bitcointalk.org is not a worldwide welfare organization, and people are not entitled to make money.Limiting newbie participation is very harmful for a community. Newbie jail will never return: I consider the newbie-jail period to have been extremely damaging to the forum. When barriers to participation are too high, then the best people often just won't go to the trouble of joining, and the people who are willing to jump through the hoops are often people who aren't good for the community: people with nothing better to do, scammers, get-rick-quickers, etc. Having a permanent newbie jail policy would improve things a lot in the short-term, but would end up being a fatal poison to the community.The low signal-to-noise is a real issue which seriously annoys me and is often on my mind. But as you mention, fixing it non-destructively is difficult.Quote from: theymos topic=https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/boixpg/comment/enhn6v6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2xPrimarily, it's just that freedom + size = mess, and with bitcointalk.org I've chosen to keep freedom about as high as possible, for example allowing paid signature ads, poor English, micro-earning services which often attract a spammy crowd, etc. Banning these things (and other noise-generating factors) would be easily possible, and would immediately lead to a cleaner environment, but it'd also be a less free environment. IMO there are enough highly-controlled platforms around, and I'd prefer to try maximizing the freedom axis. (Maximizing freedom on the forum was a policy started by Satoshi when he was an admin, BTW, though it was years after he left before the forum became large enough for freedom to actually come in conflict with signal much.)Bitcointalk.org is under active development on two parallel paths:First, although the outward appearance hasn't changed much at all since 2010, I have made tons of changes to the code, including many features. About a year ago for example I added the Merit system, which has improved signal-to-noise quite a bit, by means of changing incentives.Second, a completely new software platform has long been in development. This software is open source, can be run now, and an instance of it is available for example at https://www.cryptos-currencies.com/ . But I don't think that it's quite complete enough to migrate bitcointalk.org to it yet.On both development paths, we try to tackle signal-vs-noise by methods such as categorizing posts better, improving incentives, trying to create smaller sub-communities, etc., but not via restriction, if at all possible.While I don't claim to have nearly maximized the signal-to-noise which might be possible even given a high degree of freedom, bitcointalk.org is pretty anarchic, and it will always be so. (Though note that some sections are much better than others.) If that doesn't appeal to you, then you should use a different site. Smaller communities, like IRC channels and similar, can be both free and have a high signal-to-noise ratio. This was bitcointalk.org in 2010-2013, but it's now too large. You can also have large communities that are more strictly moderated, like r/Bitcoin.Some restrictions on NewbiesNewbie PM warningNewbie PM changes to address phishingNew PM limitsNewbie PM opt-inmore",

I looked at this site with the extension, the site certainly looks like something childish  The extension they offer can be downloaded as a crx file from github. Checked on virustotal, seems to be clean. But virustotal engines don't always detect viruses, as I've seen recently. It is unclear why their extension is not in the Google store.",

      "body": "This might be a little bit too complex, but making it by default that all links in posts are disabled from your point of perspective, but can be enabled in the forum settings for those that do want automatically clickable links. The thing is with that, it's likely to resource heavy. I do think there's an issue with the time to react to these sort of things. For those that get caught by patrollers fairly soon the damage is mitigated, but sometimes these sort of posts can go unnoticed, and potentially downloaded by several hundred users. I do think there's a common theme at hand here though, we keep restricting new users, that they basically don't want to sign up to the forum or continue using it because they feel restricted. Whereas, places like Reddit might not have such restrictions. So, we're sort of competing against something that's already probably more appealing to the vast majority of new users coming into Bitcoin. I personally think a shadow ban system for new users would be nice, but then again you could argue that's even more restrictive, and we'd have to have quicker response time than your average ambulance for it not to be too much of a problem.",

Let's suppose i am new on the forum and I am the owner of a legit crypto or gambling site and I want to post my site link on the forum. So I will not be able to do it as I am new on the forum. Also, i won't first be doing useless posts to increase my rank, get a merit and then share my site link after become Jr Member.   Genuine site owners will leave the site when they come across so may restrictions. Only the scammers will stay to first rank up and then share their scam links. Also, not everyone wants to buy a copper membership to overcome all these restrictions.",

It will divert the attention of scammers to merit abuse, where merit selling will become rampant. 2. It will not stop the sharing of scam links, it will only delay it.3. It will discourage newbies especially casino companies that came to promote their business. These newbies are able atleast make posts that link to their websites before they are advised to buy copper membership.4.
