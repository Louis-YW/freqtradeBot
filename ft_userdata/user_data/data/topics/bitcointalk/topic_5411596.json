Hal was obviously such a big part of bitcoins uprising and I always find it fascinating how he was just one of very few who took bitcoin seriously from the get go when Satoshi dropped the white paper.

But at least we have seen his writings in this community and other social media and you can see how he is really into bitcoin very early because he understand what \"anonymity\" means. He even have tweets about reducing CO2 emissions from bitcoin mining. He and others are really ahead of their time.",

And now, all of us here are enjoying the early works that he has done for bitcoin and for the community. Although, there would be speculations that he really is the actual satoshi but let's just separate the two personalities that have both changed the lives of many which includes me. Much respect for Hal for being selfless and for contributing a lot to the bitcoin project that has been once being doubted by many. But look at where it is right now, changed millions of lives and still going on.",

He was the first person Satoshi \"talked\" with, which I believe could be all by himself, looking at the last ever message given by Satoshi ever? It was before Hal died, and after he did, we have never heard from Satoshi ever again and he never publicly did anything.I know that it is not going to be that easy, and I know that it is quite a tough thing to accept that maybe satoshi is dead, but that is what I believe. Of course it is a possibility that we might be wrong, but that doesn't change the fact that we haven't heard from Satoshi since then, so why? Maybe it is actually true and not a mistake.",

Thanks, PowerGlove for including that link in your reply. I read the thread and indeed I was motivated not only by his contribution to Bitcoin but by his courage and doggedness. At a time when nobody believed in Bitcoin, he believed and engaged in the unbelievable. Not captivated by the get-rich-quick syndrome that is currently ravaging the world he patiently waited for the reward of his input in the development of Bitcoin. I am greatly motivated by his last days that was very challenging due to a deadly disease. Regardless of this illness, he still ensured that he was productive even when he had every reason to be otherwise. Indeed he is worth celebrating every year.",
