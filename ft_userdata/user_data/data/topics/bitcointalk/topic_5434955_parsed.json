Money matter no be small matter for this we country o.  Why was he not arrested before the change of the naira notes? It had to be now. I hope he is vindicated if found guilt free with substantial proof of whatever business he was involved in released and examined properly.",

I no know how CBN wan take run this matter. I keep asking myself wetin be their game plan for all this. Them wan render all man cashless so cos I no understand so. CBN una ask Nigeria citizens to return their old naira notes to the banks which they did, and the same bank wey  you ask them to deposit their old naira notes are yet to dish out the new naira notes you order them to. No be to tell you how funny the country d so. As far as I can tell so, this their deadline(31st Jan.) no go work.",
