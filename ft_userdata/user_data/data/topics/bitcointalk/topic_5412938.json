The problem that faced by ethereum has been exist since a long time ago and this already predicted by so many people and speculators.

Look at the US, they're having a proposal that they're going to ban proof of work.It is because POW is the threat to them and not POS. It's more securing to the network, so there's really nothing to worried about for bitcoin even if ETH's going to have that merge.",

Sooner or later you will have problems with stomach ulcers, liver disease, or heart disease just like most spitfires have. just love and be loved.

That could be said only by someone who knows about eth and btc only. The guy is talking about BTC maximalist not realizing he is a ETH maximalist. Before merge ETH was the most secured smart contract platform. It was expensive and slow but the most decentralized and safe. That's why it was not already killed by BNB,SOL,DOT and others. People chose to pay more for extra safety and decentralization. Now, after switch to POS it will have to compete with other altcoins on completely different level. So surpassing BTC is as possible as losing with BNB,SOL,AVAX nad dozens more and going down below top 10 CMC because ETH just gave up on the biggest advantage it had over other SC platforms.",

Possible, I believe it is possible but even if it doesn't, what if it just gets close to it?Possible but I don't think that it will happen. Let's just think of any possibility but going with the reality, it is very unlikely. The changes that ETH is getting are essential and have to happen and as for bitcoin, it will stay no matter what the changes are for the projects like Ethereum.Quote from: el kaka22 on September 10, 2022, 04:38:25 AMRight now, if you check the marketcaps, it is under 2x difference, meaning if ETH goes 2x higher while btc stays the same then eth will be over it.

That's still quite good.The market dominance for ETH and BTC is 2x and yeah, that's not really bad at all and it only shows that these two are reigning in the market. There's no need for any comparison between these two, they're like queen and king of the market.",

The whole point of bitcoin is that it has survived the test of time as PoW. If government bans it, it most likely moves to undergroud, where the liquidity would be way worse and trading against Fiat Money pairs would be banned.Turning to PoS would mean changing radically Bitcoin's code to whole another coin and that seems very unlikely as even smallest changes to code are avoided as they could compromise the code.But as Bitcoin trading would go to undergroud p2p, it would lose marketcap status by a landslide to others, and it would slowly fade as an old king.",

But overall, this Ethereum PoS a positive effect for cryptocurrency market.I think the battle between the pos and pow are already been there ever since before because there are already coins which are based on pos but the consensus in cryptos are not only limited to two. Let us not forget that there are also others out there like poa and poh (only to name a few).Each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages so we can't say that one can take over the other but all of them are only equal. Maybe eth will pump good after the transition but that shouldn't last long and the price will normalize again. Btc on the other hand can always catch up and will take the lead again once eth is done celebrating its new form.",
