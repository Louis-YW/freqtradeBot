When your league is in break, do you tend to try to follow other leagues that you're familiar with, or will you gamble on anything really? I'm interested to hear what other people have to say in this matter. As leagues go on break for the players to rest, the break is also for gamblers to rest too. When your favorite league to bet on is on break, you can take that time as a time to rest and steer clear from gambling. You do not need to gamble always or have alternative games to gamble on, there should be times when you give yourself a break so you do not become too addicted to gambling that you lose control of yourself. These break times in leagues is an opportunity for that.",

      "body": "This is really a good question because maybe some have advice or suggestions to share here, but betting on anything I have no clue about is no real alternative for me. I usually wait until that break is over, but since I like a lot of different kinds of sports there is rarely a time where there is nothing to bet on. I think when you are interested in football, tennis, basketball and some other sport like racing, there are opportunities for good and fun bets pretty much year round. But if there is nothing to really bet on and I want to have a good time, there is also stuff like poker or a round of blackjack. I would not make my biggest bets on sports that I like less as I rather save that for games I can watch and enjoy and also know a lot about. Maybe reducing the bets is a good suggestion to still have some fun, but hold back with the really exciting bets when the betting options are back to normal.",

Really in my opinion, gambling on leagues and sports that you know little to nothing about, only increases the edge against you. It depends on the the versatility of the gambler in question. They're gamblers who very good in betting on different sports and are still good in each of them while there are gamblers who are very selective in the kind of sports they gamble on. The gamblers that are very versatile when it comes to sports of specialization rarely stop gambling because when one particular sport is on break they switch to others while the ones that are very selective in the sport they gamble on tends to stop gambling whenever these very few sports are on break.",

Although is also very hard to see a gambler who only loves one line of games,  some of them are fans of multiple games and leagues,  and for they are always engaged and no dull moment for them as long as the season and breaks are concerned because while maybe football leagues are on break he continues with the NBA,  or Tennis etc,  that is how they go through the year making sure that they keep their engagement at all time.",

During those times, I usually just bet on whatever I think I'd enjoy, I still watch the vods though if I have time but I only vote on the ones I watch live. Especially if you consider how there's some new team unknown to me at some matches, can't help but lose interest by then. I usually enjoy matches with players I know after all. It is kind of dumb to bet on a sport you don't know about though, that's literally one of the important factors that separate sports gambling from plain gambling. A factor that you can see and derive how it can influence the match, and thereby make a bet based on that. If you don't know jack and start betting, might as well just play dice really.",

So if you look closely, league breaks are only for the players and not the fans or gamblers because of the last two,  all they want is just to have an available game to divert to immediately when one finishes.",

      "body": "Personally, I go for basketball games when my football league is on break. But, it's mainly a non technical kind of gambling. A type that doesn't require me to do enough analysis before betting. Because, due to my region, basketball isn't famous like soccer. So, I don't watch the game often. But, loves staking games on it, just for the fun. Instead of not gambling at all. Even most times, I still don't watch the game after betting on it, because I'm mainly used to watching football. Unless a big basket ball team wants to play. Seeing basketball stars play is always fun, the trills and magic they perform with the ball is quite memorable. I don't think that I'll ever look elsewhere in sports gambling, except these two games. Additionally, I feel relaxed watching basketball, as the teams are not emotionally attached to me. That's any team that wins I'm good. Never going to bother about it, like in football. Where I'd always want the team I bet to win and when they don't, I get a bit worried. This happens because I'd feel that my analysis on football game isn't improving.",

Really in my opinion, gambling on leagues and sports that you know little to nothing about, only increases the edge against you. We do know that we do really have that second teams or third ones and so forth. It doesnt really matter or an issue whether you would be having a break on betting too or would really be proceeding out just usual since you've seen that other teams or players hadnt a break on which you could really still be able to make out some bets out of that. It would really be that according into your own preference and liking yet there are individuals who do really strictly stick into their one team and on the time that they would really be making breaks then it would be understandable that you would really be also making a break too.Also we do have different sports that we do have on which we do have that specific favorites on a certain sport but of course it would really that dependingbecause not all would be having multiple favorite sport but rather sticking into one. There's no sense on making up some bets which you arenteven have the idea on what are the things happening.",

I'm also into NBA betting, and the league goes from October to June, and after that it's like 3-4 months of break.Nah, as for me, I don't play or bet on any other sports, or I don't like to bet on games that I don't know. So I also took a break as well, however, I also play casino games like slots, dice or even card games like Black Jack or Baccarat.So I agree with you, if you bet on sports that you know nothing about, you might end up losing big money. Well the positive side is that you will get that experience, but gonna be a expensive journey just to learn that sports.",

Also, there's the Olympics and the FIBA that I am looking forward to watching whenever those sports are on break. It's a good thing that both those events also happen during the NBA break or I think it was made for that purpose so both events won't collide. There are so many sports that can be watched and bet on. Boxing matches for example are done weekly on weekends and so do MMA so as long as you know something about the game you won't get that rest because the weekdays will be used to analyze what the results could be and that's also to enhance our chance of winning.",
