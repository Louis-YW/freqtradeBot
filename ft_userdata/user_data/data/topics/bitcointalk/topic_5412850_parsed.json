You contacted them just so you accuse them for a clear reason which is being angry. I don't use gate.io that much so i can't be that helpful i hope someone else can explain more for you. You also started accusing me that i woek for this platform and I'm lack of knowledge caus i joined on 2022. While you joined years ago. Well dear i have been useful and helpful for many users here as i learned many things in the forum more than you can do in 10 next years.

I will be following this case and confirm what's the real matter with TIPS token deposit issueI have been talking to support gate.io since February.But when my TIPS token switched to an imaginary TIPSO, I had to react.How can someone do that with someone else's property?8 months of talking with support is quite enough to bring the case to the public.And because of whom the deposit was falsely suspended, I will announce soon.",
