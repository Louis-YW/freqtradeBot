If more country would announce this one provably that it make Bitcoin became more stronger and lots of country would provably follow. This is how good when a powerful country like USA under Trump start their first move showing their support on Bitcoin since many countries will also look forward to follow what they do. If more good laws will be drafted in favor with Bitcoin then its expected that there are more countries which is speculating on the update towards Bitcoin might provably show up and do some good moves to do good move towards acquiring Bitcoin.",

In other words, every country that depends on the IMF and or any international financial institution will very likely have the same opinion on the subject.The way things are going, it seems that every country will have at least one politician/lobbyist who will collect their political points on this topic - even if they are fully aware that their chances are less than 1%.",

However, for now, these are just proposals and rumors. So far, only one nation has actually acted on it, and that is El Salvador, and they did it a long time ago. Hopefully, El Salvador can set a good example, and perhaps that success could help convince the bankers to come around.",

But that is fine! We surely cannot expect everyone to think alike. Also the problems and challenges are different for different countries. So when Switzerland is actively discussing this very same Idea, it's normal for other countries to have a different view on it. Honestly I do not want countries to invest in Bitcoin and keep it as a reserve.",

As soon as the USA sets up its SBR we will see how the state FOMO is unleashed.Maybe I'm mistaken, but the addition of BTC to US strategic reserves is still only a proposal of one senator and is not something that is seriously considered. As far as can be read, even if such a decision were made, the question arises as to who would guard that BTC. Even if that happens, I wonder if it will cause FOMO among central banks - because after all, this is an asset that is still extremely volatile and therefore not very attractive to most.",

Everyone was excited and putting their faith in Trump, and they started to FOMO even more when news came out that other countries were also interested in the idea. But most people forget that the Fed and central banks are the ones who manage national reserves. And the Fed also made a similar statement that it has no intention and does not agree with the idea of ​​using bitcoin as a national reserve.Obviously this idea doesn't have much chance of becoming a reality in the near future. So I think we should be realistic instead of expecting things that are too far-fetched.",

Almost all nations will have at least one Bitcoin supporter who will want to capitalize on the pro-Bitcoin view of the incoming US president to push for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It will take bravery for a country that receives financial support and advice from the IMF to implement this policy. Only El Salvador Bukele has had the guts to go against the dictates of the international lending body and went ahead with the country's Bitcoin accumulation policy. Instead of joining the list of countries who want to buy Bitcoin and use it as a reserve currency, I would have suggested that Chile copy from the small nation Bhutan by engaging in accumulation through mining.",

I am not surprised that Chile hopes to hop on the bitcoin movement. With El Salvador starting the movement of incorporating bitcoin to the country's financial reserves and USA planning to do the same thing as well, other countries in the american continent would not want to be left alone. QuoteAlthough this is going to be very tough as the Bank of Chile has rejected this idea.Why countries like El Salvador and the USA seem to be having an easy time with incorporating bitcoin to their economy is because their governments are united and have the same perspective to what bitcoin is and what it can do for their country. You would notice that the presidents of both countries are the ones that are actively pushing for bitcoin so I think as long as the leader of the country is convinced anything could be possible.",

What is happening in the United States is just a proposal by Senator Cynthia Lummis, a politician known to be very crypto-friendly. Apart from her, no other person or politician has discussed or agreed with this idea. Also, I hope you didn't miss Jerome Powell's recent statement that the Fed has also rejected the idea of ​​bitcoin reserve.I don't know about other countries but with the political polarization in the US, I don't think a bitcoin reserve proposal would be easy to pass even if proposed by the country's president.",
