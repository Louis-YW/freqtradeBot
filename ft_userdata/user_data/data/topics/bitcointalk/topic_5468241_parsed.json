At one point towards the end of the movie there is a huge wager placed on a round of golf between the two guys in this scene:  https://youtu.be/FUDeGD-Qox4?si=HuN1YnHjQPuGc7o5 the caddies are all watching behind the bushes and they're placing some side bets on anything and everything. One of the bets was that the nephew of one of the players who was a goof ball would pick his nose and he did, they doubled down on it and said I bet you he eats it for double! And he did. I always chuckled at that scene, but it always made me wonder what other kind of ridiculous bets that other people make.Here is the scene:  https://youtu.be/E-jlQS-Wuc0 Hope you all have a good laugh on this and if you haven't seen it watch the movie!",

And it's really fun because we will guess what someone will do and if the results are correct, we will win and vice versa.Maybe when I was a teenager, I often bet with my friends what color our teacher would wear when teaching in the morning. Or bet on anything else. We also used to bet on who would get the highest score after the exam. But unfortunately, I never won with all of them.",

This is a good story!!! You pretty much hustled them hahahha. You can't feel bad on that one though because you helped your handicap friend get some money that he needed. Kind of robinhoodish, taking from the rich and giving to the poor in a sort of way, eh? Thanks for sharing! I think for me it wasn't something that I did but something that I bet my brother to do for $10. I convinced him to jump into the putt putt waterfall pool when it was already pouring rain for $10 and it was hilarious. He actually ended up having a lot of fun, he had so much fun that our cousin went in to join him thinking I would give him $10 as well (which I didn't lol) we ended up getting kicked out of that place after that hahahha",

So, to make those chilly waits a bit more bearable, we started placing little bets on things like guessing the exact time the bus would show up or how late it would be that day.

Because we stayed up all night with friends, we once played betting when the morning sun had just risen with a type of game to guess which buses would pass from different directions on the inter-provincial highway. We did that when we were at school and we did this habit very often until we went to college.The video clip you shared made me remember the past before I was introduced to online gambling games.Every now and then when we meet, this type of betting game becomes a very meaningful story that gives rise to lots of laughter.",

I can't even think about it because it was quite unfortunately for me trying to bet more a casino after I had some huge winning on the casino and think it is going to be like that. I have to wager the remaining funds I have in the casino without think what if I lose. This was one of the painful greedy attempt I have ever indulge in and it hurt me a lot not getting what I intend to gain from the casino. I lost the funds and I regretted because I never think twice before I use those funds to bet creating a very big lose to me. We need to understand what action we are taking before we eventually put our funds to do such thing.",

I put the last chip on roulette number 8 ( my lucky number ), and it came. So I was back to 180euro, so I thought. The next spin 8 comes again and I feel frustrated cause I didn't bet again.Suddenly the groupier pushes another 180 in my direction. I didn't realize that my initial bet stayed on the table, so I won back to back.Now I was at 360, enough for the rent. I secured the 300 and played on with the 60 and made another 300.So I took home 600euro, paid my rent and lived happily ever after.  And all that after having 5euro and a 1/37 chance left. Best story in my eyes.",

I just watched the video, and it's really kind of funny how people gamble on petty things and still win, and when it comes to me, I just can't remember making such silly/petty gambling on any item before, but this video just reminds me of another gambling scene by Will Smith in a 2015 movie titled \"Focus\", which I must confess happens to be one of my best gambling scene how Will Smith won the in an attempt where there seems to be zero percent odd of him winning, but he eventually won & went away with the $2million.

The problem is they have the wrong mindset towards gambling which makes them fall for worse situations such as gambling addiction. Yes, we can't blame them for falling into addiction since that's their personal choice.It's fine to take a wild bet sometimes but if we will always do this, will will always put our funds into huge risks which we might only regret in the end. We should always be mindful of our actions no matter how big or small our bets are.",

      "body": "Some people enjoy turning everything into a gambling opportunity. When they discuss or argue about something you will find these kind of people placing bets on their beliefs. Sometimes it's cool and fun but other times it can lead to much trouble either because to lack of money to pay the bet and getting beaten or just losing too much money.I believe that when someone starts seeing everything as a gambling opportunity they might be addicted and should seek help to regain control of their life. This can even happen to non-addicted people who occasionally find themselves caught up in wild betting situations without an option but to accept that bet.I had a crazy friendly bet myself in school with a friend back in days. The bet started when he said I would easily pass my exams because i study more than him and I was telling him that I do really study I wouldn’t pass anything this year so we made a bet. Unfortunately what I did was regrettable because I had to intentionally fail my exams to fulfill the bet and win. As a result neither of us passed that year lol…. and I wasted a lot of time in my life just for a stupid bet and some cash.  I guess I was young and foolish but it was a valuable lesson learned about gambling.",
