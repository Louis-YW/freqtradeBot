  "content": "Whereas people get all giddy and excited when they see prices for their favorite products getting slashed during the Black Friday days, people panic and worry when the Bitcoin price goes similarly down.For what?Well, they say FTX is about to bite the dust which caused the already smashed Bitcoin price of $18K to shatter to $16.5K.This is a 45% discount from its normal price, assuming the normal price is $30K.So, why the need to panic? First of all, whereas with other products you will only save X%, by buying Bitcoin at this time, you will actually earn X% in profits when the Bitcoin price and the crypto world surrounding it gets back to normal. That is honestly the best deal I've ever seen.Besides, who cares if FTX bites the dust at this point? FTX traders, maybe. Well hopefully, you escape with your money, but the point being that there are so many other exchanges which are perfectly fine. It's not like Mt. Gox in 2014. FTX isn't even the primary exchange like Gox was - that title belongs to Coinbase.",

Bitcoin at $53,000 was really a steal. Good job for those who were able to take the opportunity and bought at that highly discounted price. Today, Bitcoin is showing some green candles. The price has even breached $58,000. Right now, it has fallen a little and stayed at $57,700",

The more down it goes the more it feels like to invest into it. I am also on the same note as hugeblack, I am short of cash too. I am not willing to purchase directly because our government has deployed their devil strategy of flat 30% taxes and 1% TDS for all the bitcoin tradings. I think once I get the cash I might need to go p2p and buy few chunks. You know it’s like, hands and mind are shaking how should I manage the cash without Government scans.",

I wouldn't go that far, but I would definitely say that BTC is available for purchase at a bargain price at the moment and whoever purchased it when it slid below 16 grand are the lucky ones. Why?Because I am confident that it will bounce back closer to 20 grand before the year ends which implies that they stand to receive close to 25% profits if they can HODL their stash till then.It could take even longer to rise back closer to 20 grand, but it will happen eventually in my opinion.",

Every price level at any given moment is the \"normal\" price level, because the supply and demand are getting in a temporary balance. A 60K Bitcoin price is as normal as a 10K Bitcoin price. Of course, our interpretation of what is normal on the market can be quite subjective. Some traders say that price bubbles are something normal for the markets, while others say that the price bubbles are what deviates the market from it's normal state.This \"Black Friday Deal\" joke about Bitcoin isn't funny anymore. Bitcoin will stay in the lower price range for the next 2 years. There will be way more opportunities to buy cheap Bitcoin than the \"Black Friday\".",

I simply estimated the average price of BTC over the last two years i.e. since the November 2020 bill run. No algorithms were used, I just eyeballed it. But $30K isn't too far from what most people are going to be seeing over the next two years (assuming we stay in a prolonged bear market the average will drop lower to $25K or so).It's like saying the average price of bitcoin was $6K between 2017 and 2020 - not far from the truth, even during the $3K crash of early 2018.",

The discount is good, but in the global picture this looks very bad because it scares the average investor, and even more encourages the authorities to increase regulations under the pretext of only protecting people.",

I wonder what is in the minds of all those people who invested in these tokens or so-called stablecoins, which were completely worthless to me personally from the very beginning.I can still somehow understand those young and naive people who are easily sold all kinds of stories, but all those companies and famous individuals who knowingly exposed themselves to such a risk are not at all clear to me.All in all, maybe everything won't be so dark if Bitcoin manages to recover before some new scandal surfaces, otherwise I wouldn't be surprised if it sinks below $10k.",
