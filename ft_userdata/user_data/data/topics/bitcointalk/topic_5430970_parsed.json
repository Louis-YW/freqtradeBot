Luckily she knows the PIN on it too.But I expect that in many cases the people here have their own bitcoins, in some cases their partners don't even know about those  (the equation might be different after marriage though).",

I've told her about the incidents on how people aren't good enough in keeping it and that's why she just let me have it.I've already told her how important it is and not to broadcast it to the public or to anyone in person but just me and her or anyone I would and she would trust the most.",

I will like to ask the women here how they will feel if their husbands refuse telling them their seed phrase?This is quite interesting you know. It is  well known in the Bible that a man and a woman coming together as husband and wife through holy matrimony will be joined as one so therefore whatever that belongs to the husband belongs to the wife and whatever belongs to the wife belongs to the husband as the case maybe it is still applicable to your topic. It is nice they both know and have access to such documents because such detail is very sensitive and would be good to be properly kept safe. The both parties have to discuss about it before conclusion so as to take a stand because sometimes funny things just might happen and all of a sudden and who ever is in possession or has such details with him, if no more posse to be a setback for the family if the asset or fund is a huge one. So I would advise that both parties should always open up to each other having knowledge of sensitive details or documents with key phrase and agreeing to where it should be kept safe or something  and can only be accessible based on the outcome of their agreement.",

But if we talk about the family, then in a normal family there should be some kind of common budget, and each of the spouses can have personal money, provided that both partners work. But if necessary, all personal money, of course, turns into a common one..I know that in Eastern families, money is always controlled by a man, and women have to constantly depend on him. In my opinion, this is not entirely fair, although, of course, I will not judge the customs of other countries.",

I don't want my partner to have access to the wallet's seed phrase, nor do I want anyone else to have access to it, because that opens up many security issues and possible hacks. I'm not saying that my partner would steal my money or use it for nefarious purposes, but I do want to protect my Bitcoin from potential hackers and other threats. I'm a responsible person, and so is my partner, but that doesn't mean that someone else can't find a way to steal our money if they get access to our wallet's seed phrase. She does, however, know where we keep our valuables, including a backup seed from my cold wallet, and has access to them. (In the event of my death or a medical emergency that prevents me from being able to.)If you're going to have a Bitcoin wallet that you share with someone else, then you should definitely consider getting them an additional hardware wallet for their own use. This way, you can keep your funds secure and accessible at the same time.",

Therefore, if there is no full trust, I would keep such sensitive things to myself, with of course ensuring that this information is transferred to that person in case something happens to me.Also, a lot depends on whether the husband and wife invest together in Bitcoin, which would then be a joint asset, or whether one of them does it individually from their personal earnings. In the end, it all boils down to trust - and today that is something that most people can't boast about, because marriage today is something that people don't value as much as before, that's why there are a lot of divorces.",

She could leak it from her own end and you will be hacked. That is why I will be careful to share it with my partner. When women knows that something is important to you, they will try to use it to test your patience during misunderstanding",

Personally, I so believe that nothing should be hidden from one's spouse. To answer the OP's question if a wife or husband should know about their seed phrase, I say it depends. First you have to know the level of interest your spouse has in knowing about bitcoin, cryptocurrency, wallet, seed phrase etc. Some spouse just want to be bothered about these things, they have other interests which in itself isn't bad. In this case, I wouldn't bother my spouse with knowing my seed phrase because it would be like you are pouring water into a basket. Otherwise, it is best to keep it safe. The  key takeaway is that know what the interest of your spouse is before telling them about your seed phrase.",
