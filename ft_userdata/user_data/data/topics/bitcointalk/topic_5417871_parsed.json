I think it'd make more sense to limit parliamentary officials expenses but then you'd have those same people taking free trips to places instead from companies so you'd have to limit how much could be accepted in donations and then it might incentivise politicians related to big lobbying companies to take up positions in their systems which could lead to further inefficiencies - they might not have to declare donations or they might be harder to call lobbying if the lobby groups are related to politicians.",

      "body": "What you are talking about is corruption which is the main problem for developing countries nowadays. Overwhelming corruption makes it difficult to achieve sustainably and cost-friendly developments. If your leader and policymakers don't have any moral values then only hardened the law won't change anything. If a child learned from a young age about increasing moral values and personality and how important it is then they will not easily fall for corruption.Also, some people think public prosecution of punishment is inhuman but I think this could lower corruption. If govt cut the hands of corrupt officials publicly then those who watch it will surely be frightened before doing anything illegal. This won't lower the corruption rate to zero but it will help to decrease it significantly.",

There is so much imbalanced in our social and governmental structure that it's almost impossible to make changes. Most of the time one person holds so much power that no one can dare to challenge it. They just only think of themselves and every decision they make is right even that doesn't contain anything valuable for the society. Politicians should be from certain background of people who will have certain quality of skills.",

To overcome this, the people of the country must have a system in place that checks the actions of the government. This would keep them accountable and transparent. Oversight committees are a good way to keep the government transparent and accountable to its people.",

These sort of institutions can take many generations to establish and it is their longevity that makes them more powerful, but obviously they need to have transparent and fair processes too - in case they get manipulated too. Having a free press is also important, but it must also have enough independent owners that are not in with government ministers, we're seeing in countries like Hungary how seemingly democratic states can be undermined because the leader is so rich and uses the media to suppress his rivals in many different ways.",

As long as there's a central banking that works with government, even with free market capitalism it's difficult for politicians to keep an independent relationship from the banking institutions.

All countries have this political disease, we cannot avoid it, even in a country with minimal corruption, such as North Korea, there is also a system of corruption. A country's economy is said to be developing when a government has the same goals. With reduced public confidence in the rulers who act as managers of the economy, it is difficult to achieve maximum growth. In addition to the long process, the economy has been hit by the current crisis, the conclusion is that they are securing state assets and putting the interests of the people aside.",

Every government official is just looking for their own interest and no one is sent to jail and punished because they have the power and influence. And even if we have a good President, if everyone under him is corrupt then there is nothing we can do. Maybe in the next election we should be careful on who the people is going to place in Congress or who will they vote for their Senators and President. At least carefully filter each and everyone because those who are going to take the seat next will be the one that will stir our country towards growth or downfall.",

Sadly most of these policymakers enact laws that are self-centered and anti-citizens. They have refused to cut down their salaries and other expenses even when the nation is heading toward a recession. The legislatures in my country are the highest paid, while we have the highest number of poor citizens. They award contracts to their relatives and cronies, who shabbily execute and sometimes abandon these projects. And a nation that lacks infrastructure would never attract investors. Bribery, corruption, and double taxation have all made businesses gradually die in the country which has led to a high level of unemployment. It is well-known that unemployment would give birth to a high rate of crime and insecurity. And there can never be economic development in an unsafe environment.Although the citizens also have some cardinal role to play in economic development, the government is the most important player. Our only tool as citizens is our vote during elections. We must ensure we give power to the most qualified candidate and issues like tribalism or political party shouldn't influence our choice of candidate.",
