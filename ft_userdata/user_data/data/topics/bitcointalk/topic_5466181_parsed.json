Like seriously? We aren't even talking days, hours or even minutes here. I personally felt embarrassed as a crypto fan to see headlines carrying 'Cryptocurrency boss' in such scandalous case reported by the news.This, I feel, is tarnishing the image of the cryptocurrencies to have defrauded businesses and move it through his company, Thodex. Thodex was founded in 2017 and became on of Turkey's largest exchange for digital currencies.I brought this topic here, firstly, because of the amazement, secondly to know if there are possibilities of stopping this from happening again tomorrow, even though, cryptocurrencies are decentralized and have little regulations. I felt numb to see such an 'acclaimed' crypto big whiz involved in scamming over 2,027 victims. I mean anyone from this forum could fall a victim.News sources: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66752785#https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/turkish-crypto-boss-sentenced-to-over-11-000-years-in-prisonhttps://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/09/turkish-crypto-boss-faruk-fatih-ozer-sentenced-to-11196-years-in-jail/My question is, how do we identify and overcome such fraudsters in the system, now and in future?",

Such harsh sentence was not expected but this guy going to jail will bring peace of mind to those who suffered because of his action. Meanwhile those investors of FTX are still suffering. I think such judgement won't tarnish the image of cryptocurrency but improve its reputation as people will now know that scammers cannot escape the law. There is cross border crypto regulation policy that will be up for discussion in the ongoing G20 summit in India. If the synthesis paper is approved then it won't be easy for such scammers in the future.",

But in truth though, I think it's difficult to get rid of fraudsters in the system, some appear legitimate at first and then when the right time happens that's when they show what they really are an defraud people. Two good examples of this is @Yogg and Bernie Madoff, they both came off as someone that was trustworthy but lo and behold, they decided to still scam people.",

I don't see any reason to feel pity for this fella, I reaped what he sow, I prefer spending some time thinking about those people he defraud of their hard-earned money, some people still invest more money than they should in crypto these days, they like risking it all, and imagine they meet this bad fate of Thodex founder? This is what Sam Bankman Fried or whatever his name is should face, but the US isn't Turkey anyway, the laws and upright of every countries are different, and yes Sam did used FTX customers fund to help some politicians, maybe the reason why this Thodex founder is facing this charges is because he took all the money for himself, he funded no politicians.The most corrupted people are in politics, if not I don't see why FTX case hasn't turned to something similar to this, anyway.Same thing is happening with Fiat too and I am sure that it happens more with Fiat than Crypto, because these criminals have understood that crypto money is traceable.Whatever this man did tarnished his own image not that of crypto, because there is crime in everything that's created to make life easier for the people.",

If this is true that that country sucks, but come to think about it, this man run away with his people's money, that's like destroying the lives of many Turkish citizen, now let's take this side by side with a rapist that have four or five victims, he will be fined and also sentenced, max of 15 years as I read after doing my own research, I am not saying raping is not a crime but I think it makes sense that the exchange CEO was given life imprisonment, there is more we might not know in this case, what if there are people who have committed suicide because they lose their hard-earned money to a criminal? I think this punishment fits the crime, correct me if I am wrong in anyway, a rapist can still have a change of heart and I am not saying it's good that women or females get raped, but up to 15 years is good enough for this crime, that's enough time to mess with one's head and regret their decisions, but financial crime looks cheap in our eyes because we don't think about the mess, hundreds of thousands of people are ruined here, maybe even more.",

Crypto fraud is a major issue, especially since the industry is decentralized and uncontrolled.Discuss solutions. There are ways to be more careful. Due diligence is essential. Research an investment or trading platform's founders, security protocols, user reviews, and reputation before investing or using it. Transparent companies are less likely to be scams.Improve regulations. I know crypto enthusiasts may object, but a little regulation could help weed out crooks.Educate and be educated.

The problem is, this group of criminals want to have an exclusive access, control and power on everything. When there comes someone with its own plan to become a criminal in certain niche, if this person or group won't cooperate with government, will automatically turn into its enemy and will end up in prison.I really hope that everyone knows that governments are actively into money laundering and illegal activities but they don't punish themselves but this is a different subject.By the way, have you guys seen movie The Midnight Express? It's a very interesting old movie about what happens in Turkish prisons, watch it if you have a time, it's really a great movie.Guys, what's your opinion about prison system, is Turkish system better to lower crime rate in country or is Norwegian system far better and beneficial?",

The media is quick to loud anything that cast aspersions on cryptocurrency but hesitant to write when it's good news. I ain't surprised about that. The only way you can embarrassed with such headlined news would be if you're in any way trying to prove a point to people that this industry is without blemish. I don't bother this day with such. However, let's face the fact. From what I read about the case, the Thodex boss committed the laundering and manipulative crimes years ago and ran away from the country. If this holds as truth, he should face the wrath of the law. There shouldn't be any emotions attached to it. A crime is a crime, it doesn't matter what colouration we give to it.QuoteMy question is, how do we identify and overcome such fraudsters in the system, now and in future?Criminals are clever. Most of them have a way of going under the radar. The best way to scheme them out will be to not be greedy in chasing ROI they always promise. Again, don't leave coins you can't avoid to lose of exchanges. As if there's any loss one won't feel its impact in a world where $5 means something 🙄",

I see that it's apparently common in Turkey, but still. Also, while fraud is a crime, I'm not sure if I believe that it's such a huge crime, if it wasn't violent (and I assume it wasn't in this case because it's online). Does a person even deserve life imprisonment for that? Wouldn't it be better to force him to repay all the debt to the victims and serve a reasonable prison sentence?As for identifying and overcoming such fraudsters in the future, it seems that the law enforcement is doing alright in that regard, and what people should do is avoid losing money on exchanges by simply never keeping a big amount on any exchanges, no matter how reputable they seem.",
