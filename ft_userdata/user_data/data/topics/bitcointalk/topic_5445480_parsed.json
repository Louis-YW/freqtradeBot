Because investors need to blame for their decision to invest, the cardinal rules in investing here in the Cryptocurrency market is only invest what you can afford to lose and dig deep and always get an update on your investment they failed to follow this so they are in a blaming game.QuoteThe project looks very promising when it came out, and these influencers also hold some bags too, this is why I will never be a crypto influencer because you can't predict what will happen to the project you are promoting. There are a lot of risks in becoming an influencer, they only thank you if you help them choose the right project to invest but if they lose you will get a lawsuit.QuoteIf this is happening with influencers, how about crypto investors?

You have to educate yourself on how to properly invest in the market it's not all profit, diversity is good but lessening the risk by picking the top coins that have proven their worth in the market for many years and checking signs if the project is going down, you should know when the boat is about to sink so you cut your losses.",

They invested in bitcoin and then added altcoin options and stated that they are diversifying to reduce risk. That is actually a complete misconception, as the entire crypto market follows the movement of bitcoin. In the case of bitcoin plummeting, those altcoins may never have a chance to recover. This is proof of what people call portfolio diversification with altcoins.",

Although it is bad to hold someone just accountable for what they don’t have much knowledge on. But FTX and Bitboy saga aside, in general influencers needs to ask more questions from the people they help promote their products or projects. Or rather they could just state it clearly that such and such project should be invested with a proper research, rather than following the scripts given by the promoters, as this will save them from being forced into sagas like this Quote from: Jawhead999 on March 19, 2023, 09:46:29 AMTop coins price are only following Bitcoin price, except it's a stable coin.

More so I noticed that if bitcoin moves for like 1% the likes of ETH, Solana or Matic moves beyond 3% and when they dump they fall way lower than bitcoin so I also don’t see them as diversification",

That’s why users who knowingly promote scam projects or casinos are red tagged as a consequence of their action. It’s your responsibility to do your due diligence before renting your avatar or signature to any service, though most times the responsibility falls mainly on the campaign manager. Most of these influencers or signature participants do not use the service or product they advertise. It’s common to see someone wearing a casino signature but doesn’t gamble.",

Bitboy deserves a jail time for the damage he done to many crypto user that follows him.Being an influencer doesn’t mean you need to shill.

Be safe. FTX was an exchange, and the solution to people who lost their entire net worth to FTX crash isn't diversification, except you are advising people to diversify funds across different exchanges, rather the solution is for people to use non custodial wallets and should not hodl their funds in exchanges.Having said that, Luna was a native token, should people even have been hodling such, let alone diversifying with some of it in their stash, the solution is for people to hodl a crypto that has a real utility like Bitcoin and diversify with other assets/commodities/businesses that are not intrinsically related to crypto.",

This was the same case with Kim Kardashian when she failed to disclose the money she received from the EMAX token to advertise the token on one of her social media accounts. It seems she was also avoiding to be the tax on the $250,000 she received from the crypto company. There should be a law that makes these social media influencers responsible to some extent for the loss of funds of customers incurred because of the failure of the firms they promoted. Sometimes these influencers don't care about the integrity or prospects of the firms they are promoting because they only care about their endorsement fees. They end up misleading their followers and when they are scammed, these celebrities will exonerate themselves from the firms.It is also possible that some of these influencers connive with the scam firms they are promoting to defraud their followers. There is nothing greed and selfishness cannot cause.",

This is not enough to save their asses if anything happens, at least that's what it looks like to me.I knew about some new crypto projects through them and some are pump and dump, but if you apply your own skill of research you will be able to figure out if the project will survive or not, the risk won't vanish due to research but will save you from scam projects at least.",
