  "content": "I created this topic mainly to gather more information about an ICO project that I highly suspect of being a scam. They started a social media bounty campaign in the bounties section, which can be found here: Finxbit.com | Future of Technology with FinXCoin | Bounty. This campaign ran from April 16, 2023, and had 383 participants, as evidenced in the spreadsheet here.It's important to note that the bounty campaign is being managed by Royse777, who has performed his role in the perfect way. But he has explicitly stated that his involvement is separate from the project itself since he is only managing this bounty and the participants take the full responsibility to DYOR. as indicated here.Quote Disclaimer: We would like to make it clear that ðŸ’¹ðŸ“ˆ Bitcointalk Campaign Management ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥ Signature & Bounty, managed by Bitcointalk member Royse777, is an independent entity and is not directly affiliated with any of the crypto startups we advertise. While we strive to promote these startups in the best possible light, our views and opinions expressed in our advertising materials do not necessarily reflect those of the startups themselves. We work with various clients across the crypto industry, and our goal is to provide high-quality advertising services to help them achieve their marketing objectives.I encountered this project when Royse firstly announced it in his Telegram group. My initial impression was that their website used a commonly utilized script that has been associated with numerous ICO projects that eventually turned out to be scams. Even though at that time there was no evidence to accuse or know the intentions behind this project.A few days later one of their team members posted a topic ( couldnâ€™t find it anymore) seeking a community manager. Given my experience with similar projects I decided to apply. But i wasnt accepted due to a better participant. The concerning aspect is that this project currently has no chat group (telegram or discord) where new users and investors can engage in discussions, ask questions, or share their opinions. I also noticed that their Discord server was shut, When a project ignore this important step such a community it very suspicion of being a scam.Also after the bounty campaign was over, Royse sent the spreadsheet to the manager for participant payouts and token distribution. But seeing in Royse Bounty Hunters telegram group i saw that participants are reporting delayed payments, and the team didnt provide any answers yet. This looks like potential rug pull to me.Lately they introduced us their CEO, co-founder, CTO, and others on LinkedIn, after examining their profiles they appear highly suspicious and resemble fake accounts in my opinion.Three of these profiles have one company in common as employments, called Transborder Ventures. And after doing a research about it I wasnt able to find any substantial information about this company or understand its purposes or relation with creating such a project. So in my opinion itâ€™s also fake or they bought it as a cover.The whitepaper is nearly lacking of information regarding the future of this project or the strategies employed for creating the token and conducting a presale which makes things also more suspicious.We canâ€™t currently prove anything against FinxCoin project. But based on my previous experiences with similar projects I can say that there is a high possibility (around 90%) that this project is a scam. It appears to be an attempt to collect investors' money and disapear.Â I sincerely hope that Royse provides us with positive updates regarding this issue and ensures that the participants receive their tokens that they can trade upon the project's launch.Â I am also certain that more users may have evidence to share regarding this project. I did my best here and nothing is yet certain.",

      "body": "Well, I looked through the team of this project. What is strange is that all they changed their pictures in the profile during last year. Next strange is that they use this pictures for this project only. And the third: if to search some team members with rare names like Gerald Provost, Mohammad Hasan Sajjad, Natali Nadoevi or Ketevan Chochia we can see that there are no other pictures of them in Internet. It is also unexpected. Usually many of us have some social life and there are pictures of us in our own social network accs or in accs of our friends. There are also pictures and videos in media if we are active enough. No pictures for majority of members of a team looks unexpected.Quote from: GxSTxV on June 03, 2023, 09:11:55 PMTransborder VenturesThe address provided on the website of this company (309 Fellowship Road Suite 200, Mount Laurel, NJ 08054, USA) is provided by virtual office for rent service. The same projects as mentioned on their page (which are the same as 25+ Collaborations On Boarded on FinXCoin site, most have address on 309 Fellowship Road Suite 200, Mount Laurel, NJ 08054, USA) are mentioned on the page of HSBLCO company from Bangladesh (821 (4th Floor), West Shawrapara, Begum Rokeya Sharani, Dhaka-1216, Bangladesh). And there we see Mohammad Hasan Sajjad (Sumon), Managing Director & CEO. If we'll look at the site how it looked on the 4th of April we'll see it had the same address on 309 Fellowship Road, Suite 200, Mt. Laurel, NJ 08054, USA.If we'll look at some store from the list of 25+ Collaborations (https://brandszoneglobal.com) it just doesn't work, there is only main page. I suppose other projects can be shells also.",

You are ignoring the fact that this project might be a possible scam ( i also didnâ€™t say that thereâ€™s clear evidence yet) and youâ€™re blaming the participants and think itâ€™s okay if Finxcoin doesnâ€™t pay them.I opened this topic because FinxCoin failed to pay the participants of the Royse bounty campaign. And Here is a reply from him about the matter :Quote Since I saw this, I am trying to contact them almost every day but no response.When we started the campaign they separated the allocated tokens in one of their wallet as according to them they were not comfortable to send it to me. here is the wallet: https://bscscan.com/address/0xF06Af4dD9C019409d186Ff74E4B15928De8fCAA8#tokentxnsThe tokens are there. But none of the contact persons are responding unfortunatelyWhen incidents like this occur in an ICO project there is a high possibility that the project is clearly aiming to raise money from investors with the Presale and then disappear.",

If you ask me, they don't value their token much which usually ends up badly for all those who invested their money, or time via bounty campaigns. One advice: when resizing images, you don't have to use both width and height because in majorify of cases you will mes up the ratio and images will look distorted, like in this case. Either width or height is enough and the other will adjust automatically.",

In this topic I highlihgted the lack of valuable information in their basic whitpaper and roadmap. their documents and plans doesnâ€™t show any value or what they offer to the market and potential investors thatâ€™s what making it more challenging to attract buyers and investors to their token and project. Beside that which is a very suspicious thing also despite having small and minimum awareness about this project on social media such as their Telegram chat group which is totally dead. Given all these circumstances and questions it is difficult to believe their claim of generating $1 million in sales during their private presale. Who will believe this honestly?",
