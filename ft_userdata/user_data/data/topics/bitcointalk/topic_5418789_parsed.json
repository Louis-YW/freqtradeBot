      "body": "The first flaw of the metaverse, in my opinion, is that there are too many of them. There is not a single virtual place that hosts all the virtual identities and their avatars. Each project has it's own metaverse, with own coin, own avatar possibilities, own NFTs, a handfull of compatible blockchains etc. So pretty hard to reach huge numbers of unique users hundred millions and up.At least for local implementations like a school, some courses etc sound more plausible. Use a certain address to login and use the same address to send them scholarship payments so you make sure he does not share the pk.",

Metaverse schooling is still an experimental and full with theory. The implementation may be different with what already expected as target by the developers of this metaverse. I think that it's too early to say that if it's the beauty of japanese. You shall pay attention with so many metaverse in the crypto. These metaverse have made their own claim about the successful from their projects but since some 3rd parties were doing audit and the result is even the biggest metaverse in the crypto has only a few users. Metaverse schooling was just an experimental idea",

Metaverse for now is just an idea, I guess we can have different thinking about that \"idea\", but the fact is that what we saw in some movies is far away. Mark (FB) started something, but as I see it it's just hype, they are far from finishing the product, and it's a big question how many people will buy VR or some other device to be able to check that Metaverse?The beauty of Metaverse is nothing compared to a real feeling.  Do we really want Metaverse?",

      "body": "The presence of the metaverse has indeed made the world of technology more sophisticated and jobs and other things like going to school are virtual. But this will also have an impact on our natural ability to move, because the metaverse limits our range of motion and just sits in our room with our eyes on VR. no physical social life. I myself will feel bored if I don't leave the house or just drink coffee in a cafe.Metaverse is a technology that is certainly very good and positive, depending on how you use it, not everything has to be in the metaverse, only in certain circumstances. But if physical presence is more needed, virtual is still another option.",

Metaverse will not make them following the class anytime. I think that this is not a solution for that thing. That needs a better dicipline to make sure if people will not try to leave from their school for something unuseful. It's people behavior and you can't change people behaviorn through let them all play in the metaverse for schooling purpose. Metaverse is not even successful to attract ordinary people come to the digital world. It's even harder to think if such idea can be successful. Im feeling skeptical about that. It's even too early to say that come for sure. It won't cure people's tardiness in studying but it can make class more interesting at the very least. We know that majority of the young Japanese are hooked to technology like gaming or even animation so moving into the Metaverse seems like a logical choice. This is a step up from regular online classes.",

In this case, metaverse will save you a lot of time, or use it for meetings instead of moving directly to the company. Metaverse is truly the technology of the future and it will be part of modern life. It is undeniable, the metaverse will be a part of our lives in the future and certainly a technology that will bring the era of modern humans to a higher level. But also keep in mind that every technology will have risks and some pros and cons. it's normal, you just need to make adjustments and what needs to be done in the metaverse must be done, but if you don't have to use the metaverse, put it aside and live as usual.",

When I've watched Ready Player One movie multiple times back then, I knew that one day this will gonna happen in the future and it came into reality.I've experienced it myself for the first time while I was attending Token 2049 event in Singapore shooting down alien ships. It's something that I will never ever forget since I cannot afford to buy VR goggles and equipment for now.",

Metaverse has come to stay.Then i do know if you wanna doing your school virtually and you could stay in your house and doing another other activities. lol. The reality was telling if metaverse has not yet got demand for now. What already explained by OP seems to be an idea without any execution to make it becomes a real thing. It seems like that idea will never be effective to decrease the absent in japanese. I guess people were taking absent caused by they have various reasons why they were doing it. This idea is too early to be used. People are not yet ready for this.",

If possible, though, could you also include the citation? to allow us to view the video, if one exists, or read the entire article. Both the investors and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole will benefit from this development. It's my opinion that a country like Japan, which is so committed to embracing cutting-edge innovations, would make every effort to figure out how to make the most of blockchain and other related technologies.",
