  "content": "I am increasingly feeling disillusioned with it. I hope some friends will be willing to chat when they have free time during their vacations. I'd like to hear everyone's thoughtsThe Tendency Toward MeaninglessnessIn the past few years, the blockchain industry has frequently discussed the following ideas:- Decentralized trust platform- Protects private property for its users- Resistance to the centralized system- New intellectual property- DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)- Non-state currenciesBut what floods the internet on the last day of 2024?- Meme coins, speculating under the banner of \"community governance\"- Meaningless tokens and flashy, hollow narrativesEven meme coins are glamorized as a form of community-driven de-VC (venture capital-free) initiatives. Bitcoin is about to surpass $100,000, but in my view, the vision of decentralization is being devoured by the greed of capital markets.The Illusion of DecentralizationDecentralization is the cornerstone of blockchain. But has this technology truly achieved what it set out to do?Take Bitcoin, for example. The PoW (Proof of Work) mechanism was once hailed as the pinnacle of decentralization. But what is the reality? Mining giants monopolize computing power, while individual miners are insignificant. It's like the wealth gap between you and Bezos, wrapped in the illusion that \"you're just not working hard enough.\"Now consider PoS (Proof of Stake) and its various iterations – the more you stake, the more stable your block-producing rights. How is this any different from the capital games of the real world? While ensuring on-chain security, it also erects new capital barriers. Large stakeholders on the chain mirror Wall Street capitalists.But tell me, how is this different from being crushed by capital during the GameStop saga? Okay, we believe blockchain won’t pause trading like the stock market did. But do you really think that? Many validators of high-market-cap blockchains are nominally different but practically centralized.Marginalization of Ordinary PeopleWhat initially fascinated me about blockchain was the vision of inclusive participation and fair network construction. But the reality? Ordinary people play insignificant roles in the front of the capital, and their assets feel more like \"temporary permits.\"The money we hold, or our wages, often feels like **temporary ownership**. The $100 bill we earn won’t suddenly be snatched away by a seagull mistaking it for fries. But:- Insurance companies will strip you bare.- You'll pay taxes for pointless studies on which squirrel runs faster.- Your property taxes must stay updated, or you risk losing your home.- Society forces you to constantly spend just to stay afloat.Insurance squeezes you dry, tax systems oppress you, and property taxes hound you. You think you own wealth, but in reality, you temporarily hold a few \"tokens\" under someone else’s rules.We often delude ourselves into thinking we have wealth, but it’s like arcade tickets – distributed by rules others created.Pessimistically speaking, regardless of how blockchain evolves, most people will gradually slide to the bottom of the pyramid over time. Because of the rules.The Social Responsibility of BlockchainI don’t like constantly criticizing. I want to talk about what I believe blockchain **should** shoulder as social responsibility:A decentralized institution composed of countless people worldwide. It carries parts of these individuals' lives and beliefs.This can be summed up in two points:1. Build a decentralized global wealth redistribution system2. Unify humanity’s collective beliefs and goals1. Decentralized Wealth Redistribution SystemHere’s an exaggerated example, but I hope it conveys my idea:- A public blockchain embedded with KYC (Know Your Customer), which automatically reclaims 50% of the balance from active accounts every two years and redistributes it to everyone.- Fully automated, no human intervention, and no compromise for unnecessary inefficient projects.- This isn’t taxation – it’s a true form of fair redistribution.Imagine a KYC-integrated blockchain that, at the end of every two-year cycle, reclaims 50% of active accounts' balances into a national treasury and redistributes it to everyone. Every person receives a share of the social balance. This could solve the problem of wealth redistribution, bringing continuous vitality to society.I know you might say, \"How is this different from a 50% universal tax?\" The difference is that it’s fully automated, non-negotiable, and doesn’t fund ridiculous studies on fast-running squirrels or policies you dislike.A blockchain reflecting the majority’s thoughts should attempt to change humanity’s distribution mechanism – not engage in incomprehensible projects. Blockchain should do what only blockchain can do.2. Unifying Humanity’s Collective BeliefThis is something our current social structure superficially aims to do. We encourage people to love science and do good deeds. But ultimately, political systems siphon resources into the hands of power holders, exploiting wealth, spirit, and faith – all for fleeting personal gain, not humanity’s future.Here’s an exaggerated scenario:Imagine a global blockchain project managed by a foundation whose sole goal is advancing humanity into space or achieving other great aspirations. It’s not about endless coin speculation. All funds are focused on this goal, and everyone can participate through token ownership and voting.Token prices would no longer reflect market speculation but humanity’s shared belief.However, unifying belief must rest on fair wealth distribution. Redistribution reduces economic friction and unleashes productivity, allowing shared belief to take root.If a homeless person cannot eat, how can you expect them to contribute to space exploration? (Though some remarkable, selfless people might.)Blockchain shouldn’t mimic current social structures or seek to join the ruling elite while pretending to decentralize.I hope the \"BOBD\" in the feature:Blockchain should do what only blockchain can do.",

It's like the wealth gap between you and Bezos, wrapped in the illusion that \"you're just not working hard enough.\"What you are describing has nothing to do with decentralization, it is about wealth inequality which is not something PoW was ever supposed to solve.PoW is still as decentralized as it has ever been meaning there is no restriction on who can make that investment into equipment needed to perform the \"work\" and you will only get paid depending on the amount of work you do.QuoteWhat initially fascinated me about blockchain was the vision of inclusive participation and fair network construction.That has not changed. Anybody can participate in the network by running a full node and anybody can freely use Bitcoin without any kind of restrictions whatsoever.Quote1. Build a decentralized global wealth redistribution system2. Unify humanity’s collective beliefs and goalsNeither of these are things that you can do with blockchain.Quote- A public blockchain embedded with KYC (Know Your Customer), which automatically reclaims 50% of the balance from active accounts every two years and redistributes it to everyone.First of all that is completely centralized and secondly it is unfair.Why should people get paid for doing nothing?!!!QuoteToken prices would no longer reflect market speculation but humanity’s shared belief.I don't see the difference.",

Keep in mind that decentralization is only a means to an end, the end being robustness and permissionlessness. Bitcoin inarguably succeeded on both fronts.Quote from: RRRocket on December 31, 2024, 02:50:01 PMEven meme coins are glamorized as a form of community-driven de-VC (venture capital-free) initiatives.

There's a reason why a lot of Bitcoiners are distancing themselve from the rest of the crypto market.",

How decentralized system supposed to verify the KYC data is real or fake?",

So it's obvious that the OP has some intention behind to used words like \"illusion\" and \"blockchain decentralization\".I wouldn't comment on the subject itself, because for me there is nothing to prove at this point. If this is the beginning, yeah this question might have some weight. But we have been like 10 years already, I know it is still in it's infancy, but we have seen that Bitcoin stands out amongst the rest of cryptos' altcoins and shit and meme coins.",
