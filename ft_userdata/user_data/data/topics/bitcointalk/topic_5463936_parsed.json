Not only web but full-stack. That's why I learned HTML and CSS, and I'm currently learning basic JavaScript. I have a roadmap; I want to finish my front-end learning within 3–4 months and then another 3–4 months in the back-end, like databases, MongoDB, React JS, React Plus, etc.So I wanted to know what your thoughts are about becoming a programmer, like a software developer or a web app developer, etc. What do you think of the future of this sector, and what would be your advice if anyone wanted to join this sector? I am hoping all seniors will help me with a straightforward reply.",

And they refuse to apologize for promoting violence because they are that unprofessional. Colleges are truly the worst. The flames of HELL are fueled by college degrees. People with college degrees are more likely to end up burning in Hell together with their bastard children.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

Your roadmap for becoming a full-stack developer sounds solid, and breaking it down into front-end and back-end learning is a smart approach.The tech industry, including software and web app development, is continuously evolving and shows no signs of slowing down. There's a growing demand for skilled developers across various sectors. So keep learning, stay curious, and don't hesitate to dive into projects – they're incredible learning opportunities.The key is not just to learn the languages and frameworks but also to understand problem-solving and coding concepts. The journey might have its challenges, but the rewards are worth it. Best of luck on your coding adventure!",

Just to see if it was something I was able to do in my future. But I did not handle it so well and now I can only do some basic programming with Java.",

It needs a lots of patient and time to become a good programmer. More you practice , the more you will found out new bugs and that will enhance your ability and help you to develop more. Of a programmer is very high. It's depend on you that how dedicative you are with your job. Js, ts, python there three language will be leading in future and will have higher demand in my opinion.",

It was hectic and I was just able to complete the task and pass the assignment on.Honestly for someone like me, I want to be one and I did my everything to at least understand all of the concepts of commands and other things like loops, etc. But when you start to do other things and you rarely program, you'll get rusty and will eventually forget all of those just like what happened to me.So if you want to pursue a career in programming, keep on making programs or system until you get hired and just add that to your portfolio. There's always a demand for the programmers, don't get scared with the AI craze that they're saying. Programmers are always needed.",
