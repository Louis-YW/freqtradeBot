Start investing again when that happens.Do you mean Bitcoin at 1000$ for you to buy in?I am neither a financial advisor nor a trader, but I believe that target price is a little bit exaggerated in my opinion, but again I am not an expert. Perhaps you are feeling specially bearish about this down cycle. If you are seeking to discuss price speculation, I'd suggest you to move this thread to a more suitable section where you will likely find traders on: Speculation, Trading Discussion, etc.Haven't you considered to DCA during the bear market instead waiting such a low price as 1K$ instead? Why are you betting on such price, might I ask?",

Who the fck will dump that hard even for months while you can gain easily if you long the dip of Bitcoin. 15K to 10K is possible but for 1K is insane price prediction(no offense). Even pandemic can't bring down Bitcoin at the level even though the price when pandemic hits was only 10K or so.",

I have seen people saying that the S&P 500 is going to go below 2,000, people saying that Bitcoin is going to go much lower than $20K, like in this case, that a crisis like we have never seen before is coming, much worse than the crash of '29. When you have been in this for a while you know that times like this are the best times to buy, just like last year when we hit $70K and the predictions were for a low of $100K, in some cases even approaching $0.5M for this cycle, it was a good time to sell.",

Start investing again when that happens.The tulip mania was based on aspirational value and the price of bitcoin is based on demand supply and production value. Both are different. Whatever experts have spoken against bitcoin, are the agents of banking industry. So I prefer not to look at them. Also I disagree when you say 1k is a good buying price! Bitcoin will never go back to that price again. So it's wise to start cost averaging by buying in small units at the current price level. If you wait for 1k, you will miss the entire opportunity.",

Bitcoins are the units in a ponzi and people can return their investment in that ponzi only if other people join the ponzi. In tulip mania people invested in tulips and thus, they had something by definition, without other people joining the mania. If no one joins the bitcoin ponzi people are left with nothing.",

But DCA is better than waiting a price mark, especially if it's so extremely low as 1000$, because the lower it is, the lower the chance to happen to touch that value.Will \"this crypto stuff\" drop to zero?

Probably too busy buying bitcoin at the all time high, and that's the reason you are salty now.
