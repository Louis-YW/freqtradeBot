Not saying the layout is bad or anything I kinda like it ngl, it is a little bright though hahaÂ  The design of the forum is the default layout of the Simple Machines forum software, the software which the forum is based on. It has not been changed ever since the forum was established. I don't think it ever will be changed, even when the new forum software is done (I believe from what I have read that the two will run hand in hand/alongside each other, I could be wrong about this though).",

The new forum software is in development mode for a quite long time and there's no certain time when we will have the new forum.Seems I won't be needing the new forum software anymore. There was when I was eager for it but it seems to me that this present interface we are using is the very best. I am used to it that the only thing I desire to get out of it is the dark mode. If the dark version can be launched I would be much ok with this forum appearance.",
