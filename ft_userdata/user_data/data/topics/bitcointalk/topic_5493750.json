You want bitcoin to have increased significantly in just two days after halving? If you make findings about the previous halvings, you will see how you are wrong.",

I will be disappointed if I don't see a massive sell-off from those who are disappointed because an overnight miracle didn't happen.I guess these are short-term investors who expected to double the capital in a couple of weeks",

The market seems undecided now.*made an edit since some people seem to be reading the title onlyIf you weren't disappointed then you wouldn't have created this thread. I'm guessing you're also getting impatient and you created this thread to see if more people feel as frustrated as you. From what I see, there are some investors who gradually started complaining and being disappointed that the market did not increase when the halving ended. I'm also watching this closely as I see this as a sign of a bull market. I think when a lot of people are frustrated, complaining about bitcoin not going up in price, they want to sell all their bitcoin. To me, that's a sign the bull market has arrived.",
