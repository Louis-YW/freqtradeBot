Exactly since there is no standard rule that says the highest transaction fee must be picked. So this certainly a behind the scene transaction where a certain miner or mining pool is tipped off to include the transaction into their block.

      "body": "Look at it this way in the past, I don't know if they still do, several pools would only transmit their payouts to miners at 1 sat / vb.If another pool picked it up, fine. If not it was mined in that pools next block since they gave it priority for themselves.ViaBTC / Coinex are another pair that could and may do this. Since they are so closely tied together. Withdraw from Coinex they send with a low fee, if it gets picked up and mined by another pool fine. If not, it goes out in Via's next block.And so on.Take everything else out of it, if I had a pool and enough hash I could with a bit of tweaking only mine tx that start at 1 sat /vb and go up from there instead of the way most pools do it now with the higher fees done 1st.Would not make financial logic but it does work.Also, cannot speak to how it works, but in the past it was the general consensus of users that when pools took BTC on the side to put low fee tx in to the blocks that money want to the pool operators NOT the miners. The miners got the block and the tx fees the side fees did not.-Dave",

It has been the best as it is. You can become a mining pool if you want, but it requires huge amount of money and skilled knowledge. Miners connect to mining pool to contribute their hashrate, and some mining pool still give the miners some offers like to be able to submit some transactions which the mining pool can accelerate for them.",

But, as of now you really do not have that many choices for acceleration. Adding another us good. Because if Foundry does it and ViaBTC is doing it possibly F2Pool will start, and undercut them a bit in price, then maybe Braiins decides to get in on it and drops their price a bit more and so on.Competition is good, it forces people to innovate and keeps prices down.The issue of $100000 at 1sat/b or any single larger TX comes back to being able to do a CPFP if you know what you are doing, and control the address, and you are the only receiver of the TX then you can always do it that way. (yes you can do it if more then 1 person is receiving funds but the CPFP is now subsidizing others) -Dave",
