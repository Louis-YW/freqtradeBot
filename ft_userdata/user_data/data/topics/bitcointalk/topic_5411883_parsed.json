  "content": "In the wake of the excitement around the NFT and the metaverse, there was a boom in interest in this kind of games. But I would like to note that there are not so many really interesting and high-quality projects. In this review, I want to introduce you to the Project Hive platform, which has interested many gamers.The basis is monetized content. The Hive gaming ecosystem is based on two tokens.HGT (Hive Governance Token):Which can be earned right in the gameplay by performing certain actions. That is, the token has a certain amount and after IDO it can only be obtained in the game. With it, you can vote, bid, buy in-game items, and more. After earning a token in-game, you can purchase accessories from the in-game store to upgrade your character with new weapons and armor. You can also bet on different betting pools.IGT (Immersion Generation Token):IGT, in turn, is an in-game token with an unlimited supply. It can be used to strengthen your characters, for example, by increasing the skills and mastery of a fighter, paying for many actions in the game system. This is the main gaming token of the Project Hive platform. By fighting in game events between different players, as well as participating in large-scale battles between clans, you can get a token for the main daily actions in the game. In the future, at your discretion, you can trade with other players by selling or buying a token on the market.Project Hive is a collaboration between developers and gamers.Together, this is used to create particularly engaging content that will satisfy many users and gamers. All 3D models are created by well-known artists and tokenized, which in turn will become your property if you purchase the NFT avatars that can be found on the site. There are 4 archetypes and 22 different fighter classes. The game provides many different mechanisms for obtaining tokens and using them in various actions, thereby increasing your level you will receive correspondingly more bonuses.To better understand the structure of tokenomics, I recommend that you read the technical information on the official website in the documentation section.I am not a financial advisor, much less give financial advice. This is the usual personal opinion of a person. Also not legal advice. That is to say, a simple look at the world around us.Website: https://project-hive.io/Telegram Chat: https://t.me/project_hive_chatTelegram Announcements: https://t.me/project_hive_officialMedium: https://project-hive.medium.com/Whitepaper: https://whitepaper.project-hive.io/project-hive/MagicEden: https://www.magiceden.io/marketplace/project_hive",
