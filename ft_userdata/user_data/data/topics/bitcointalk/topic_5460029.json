Do you believe bull market will happen soon? First, you have been in this forum for long to know the right boards to create your topic,  because as far as I know this thread belongs to Bitcoin speculations and not the altcoin board,  so you have to move the thread to the right board to get the right exposure that will give you the perfect analysis and market speculation. But then also you need to correct the $20 you wrote as your buy-in price in last year's because what I figure out is that you made a typo error and forget to put the k in front of the $20 you mentioned.",

What is your opinion.Always be depending on your price target or threshold on which we know that each person does have different goal when it comes to their selling point whether it would be 60k or 100k or more. This is why its really hard to answer up some questions about price limit or your goal when it comes to selling because it would really be in accordance into your preference or interest.In overall, if you do have plans on having short term bag and long termbag then its up to yours because there are ones who do make both things on which they could able to see profits in short term and at the same time you are holding for long term but well it would be accordance into your capital and capability when it comes to trading whether going for short term or long term approach.Just dont make yourself in a hurry when it comes on making money because this is where it usually make some do becomes that desperate when it comes to their investment which it would led upinto mistake or disaster just because they arent been able to make up good decisions basing up on what they are currently dealing with.",

I have seen many newbs making peanuts by day trading alts and btc and people who just forgot they owned alts and made insane profits. New assets need new approaches. Traditional ways and generic trading doesn't necessarily apply here. Or at least people doing that aren't making the most of this scene.",

What is your opinion.Patience is indeed crucial for BTC holders, especially when awaiting a bull market. The timing of market cycles can be unpredictable, and it's essential to stay focused on long-term goals. Congratulations on purchasing BTC at $20k last year, and it's promising to see the price rise to $30k. Remember, setting realistic expectations is important, and selling decisions should align with individual investment strategies. If the price reaches $40k next month, it's a personal decision whether to sell or hold. Some may choose to secure profits, while others might have a higher target in mind, such as $100k. It's crucial to evaluate the market conditions, conduct thorough research, and make informed decisions based on your own risk tolerance and investment objectives. Holding onto BTC can potentially lead to significant profits, but it's important to continuously monitor market trends and adjust your strategy accordingly",

What is your opinion.Well, this interests the OP, I have a question that we need to answer and consider, namely do we all here believe that the price of BTC will continue to rise or is there a possibility of a price correction in the near future? This is of course (besides our long term goals) in investing.Judging from your question above, \"If BTC price reaches $40k next month, will you sell it?\" The answer is variation cause many people have a certain price target before they sell their crypto assets and a decision to sell Bitcoin or other crypto assets.",
