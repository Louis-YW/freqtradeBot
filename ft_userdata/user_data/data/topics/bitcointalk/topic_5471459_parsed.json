But the story and beauty of Bitcoin does not stop here, after its break out, Short Squeeze, Forced Liquidations will boost Bitcoin up a lot.I love strong resistances because I know how Bitcoin will skyrocket after strong resistances are broken.QuoteI do not think this is true.

Effects from fake news can not last long but if people who were FOMO with fake news can sit back and think, they will know Bitcoin halving is far from today, 6 more months are far enough.Good news, but not fake news, for them is in SEC, there are two supporters for Bitcoin Spot ETF and we only need one more support to get an approval for a First Bitcoin Spot ETF in the USA. The last one supporter needed can be Gensler or one of two staffs in SEC.Because by laws, it only requires 3/5 vote on support to approve Bitcoin Spot ETF.",

The price fluctuating or skyrocketing is what is expected mostly as the rumours about the BTC ETF only ended as a rumour and as the halving is some months shy of six, is going to happen.The best bet is to find a good spot and trade at a margin possibly to avoid losing more, and keeping some aside in a secure wallet is ones investment in the future if BTC and cryptocurrencies in general.",

Massive pump is coming.They are indeed a key catalyst behind this recent market rally. Although after that fake ETF news, the one that kickstarted the market recovery before this big rally is Ripple’s recent victory over SEC in which we saw the price somewhere between $28k to almost $30k in range. As of this time of writing, BTC is now getting close to hitting $35k again (it touched this price earlier before pulled back to $34.4k+) and it would be very interesting for us to see where the market goes before the year ends as we are anticipating the much-awaited Bitcoin halving coming mid-next year. I believe we’re riding the FOMO wave now. As long the Bitcoin bulls can maintain the strong support level right now, there is a possibility that it can break the new resistance level. I’m happy that I keep holding BTC where I have done some DCA last year. Even I’m at a profit, selling is not in my plans yet as I have a specific target price for that.",

The ETF has been talked about for a long time and it's always said 'very soon'. In the long run you lose faith or no longer take further reports seriously. Especially not after the “fake news” from Cointelegraph. But what was crucial for me to answer here was the point I raised here:Quote from: seek3r on October 24, 2023, 11:15:31 AMThe Ishares Bitcoin ETF can already be found at https://www.dtcc.com/products/cs/exchange_traded_funds_plain_new.php under the trading symbol IBTC and the CUSIP number (security number of) 46438F101.I think this is strong evidence that things are finally gaining momentum.",

I do not think that the fake ETF news is responsible for the continued increase in price of Bitcoin. If you noticed, the price pumped when the news came out and dropped within a short interval when it was confirmed that the news was fake. Even though it is not clear what might be propelling the surge in price that we are seeing now, I do not think it will be unconnected from the increased interest in Bitcoin in preparation for the events of next year which include the halving and most likely the approval of some of the ETFs. Quote from: lombok on October 24, 2023, 10:43:21 AMPlus there is talk of reducing the interest rate from the FED.This seems more like a factor and it is strong enough to cause the recent gains in Bitcoin. Investors are simply moving their money to Bitcoin thereby creating  more demand and price rising accordingly. If this argument holds, the rise may not be sustained for long before market finds equilibrium pending when there also another solid fundamental to cause another significant rise in price.",
