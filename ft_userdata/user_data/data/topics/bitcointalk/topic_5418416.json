  "content": "Hello,I'm looking for someone who  know or familar with altcoin contract address,  and about its transaction (Whats in the contract address? Where he sent the money? From where that address get money, etc etc.)The payment is $50 in BTC, but i might increase it up to $100 if i feel satisfied with your explanation.The method is simple, if you are interested, reply on here/pm me, then i will give you the contract address & blockchain transaction and you need to find all information from that, then i will ask the questions , and  i will pay once i feel satisfied after you have answered my all questions.For your safety, i will use escrow, and i ask DireWolfM14's help to become the escrow. He will confirm on this thread with the money i have sent to him. Don't worry, i will pay the escrow fee.For transparency, we will use pm on here (bitcointalk) for every question and you must reply to me & DirewolfM14, so he can review the conversation as well (don't reply  to me only, you must use reply all).P.S Please , don't apply if you don't know or familar with altcoin contract address or the transaction, you will be only wasting our time.Thank you",

Please send me the questions on a PM and i will send the answers to both of you on PM.To get all the data from the smart contract i will use tools like https://bscscan.com/ or https://etherscan.io/ I hope i can be able to provide the right information that you are looking for.Tracking people with the address isn't always possible, and not sure if that's the goal, better let's talk all that in private.",

Maybe it would be helpful for others to know what detailed information can we get from bscscan and etherscan.io ?",

Maybe it would be helpful for others to know what detailed information can we get from bscscan and etherscan.io ?It's not sensitive, i was just asked him to check an altcoin contract address and few of the recent transaction and yeah, it was on binance smart chain, so seoincorporation has used bscscan and other tools to check the transactions.Update. @DireWolfM14 has released the money to @seoincorporation and i've paid the escrow fee to @DireWolfM14.
