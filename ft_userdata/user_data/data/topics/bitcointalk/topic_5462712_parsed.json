He's got Mr.P, Mr.W and Mr.M with him and he's the ultimate predictor. Okay don't leak their signals, just leak his report if you can.",

Or he thinks that by \"selling a shovel\" he will get more money than he himself will be able to find gold. But in any case, it all looks unethical: steal and sell for half price.",

Have you looked at the success rates? NO! Do you understand bankroll management and risk control? Do you know the capital a true trading strategy requires?Funny, because all these questions don't apply to the so-called \"leaked\" signals you are trying to milk out any cent possible.Quote from: aning97 on August 20, 2023, 08:11:07 PMI MERELY CREATED A POST IN WHICH I WROTE about leaking the best and highest-paid trading signals, and within the platform, with a $25 monthly fee, you get content worth over eight thousand euros.In my opinion, this seems like a nonsensical discussion meant to fill a post. It's not because I lack a rank in this forum that I'm unintelligent or anything else.You could as well come up with \"leaked\" fixed matches, why not?We have stupid traders here who don't know how to trade and do TA just like our beloved gamblers",

You could secure a loan or sell your property to invest with confidence, potentially paving the way for significant financial success. This approach might be more lucrative than selling signals for a small amount.",

I consider it illegal to subscribe to such as I'll not be happy if someone did same to my business.",
