Because I haven't seen a project that stand on its feet after making such a mistake,  they always go down.Let's see how events play out in the long run, luna chances of making a bounce back are slime coupled with the fact that not many of their investors are happy with the route the CEO is taking in process of the recovery. But to some extent few exchanges have pledged their support for the line 2.0 recovery process, what can not be ascertained at this time is how effective this recovery plan will work and that is left for time to tell.",

Because I haven't seen a project that stand on its feet after making such a mistake,  they always go down.Many of the holders of Luna are not happy with this current condition that had made the price to fall without given that holders a room to sell their holdings. CZ and the CEO of Luna are not in good bond because Binance had lost over a billion dollar on Luna. Since investors are not happy with the idea of the Luna 2.0 then I don't think there will be success with the idea of having a fork coin. Many of us that are holding Luna are waiting to get our money back. The CEO is very much afraid of what might happens next if he invested the over 10 billion dollar that was in reserve on buying back Luna to increase the value.",

Because I haven't seen a project that stand on its feet after making such a mistake,  they always go down.They're already about to make a comeback with that airdrop and the old one was already named classic. But what I'm expecting is that when the airdrop comes, it will be quickly dumped by everyone but because of the crowd, the volume will be high.Traders and scalpers will take advantage of it and they're the ones that will make a lot of profit from it. But if you're an investor and thinking that you'll still make money from it, maybe yes but it won't go beyond your expectation and there's lesser confidence with this foundation's project.",

I don't have to hate this project too much but still have a piece of advice for those who are betting on it.

The price of new luna will not as big as the old lune when it was reached 100 bucks but this can be worth at least a few dollars at the peak price. Im sure that if people are also aware about this. Luna is still having a chance but this may not work. Im still waiting for the result from the price of new luna. If this will worth less than a dollar and that may become the end for the old luna holders. They are loosing their life forever.",

One's a trust will be ruined,  it's hard to back it again but in this case luna price is drop without any cautions. But we do not know what's the mindset of other investors if they are still believe and invest luna or they are still participate in airdrops to gain more profits without doing something hard. But some investors will not take another risk  for the luna. Because they are trusted once and they will not do it again .",

This is based on the reason of their mistake. With the cade of Luna, its still depends since the founder are kinda arrogant even he is being pressed already for what happened. If you are like that then theres a lot of red flag from VCs, traders and investors that would likely wouldnt trust you again. If only his sincere to what happened, maybe or not? Im not really sure but this incident drag a lot even the market due to the possible outcome of such defi product which isnt safe that causes unbearable suicides.",

It is likely that the new luna will return to its lowest price, but for the initial appearance of the new luna it is likely to only recover a quarter of the total loss and I believe there will be no complete recovery, the profit factor is only for traders engaged in short term trades when the new luna is released on the exchange.",

Regardless of the success or failure of LUNA v2, I think the old LUNA will not be forgotten for some people because they spent a lot of money there but our hope is that LUNA v2 can return the losses of the old LUNA.",

So for now, it was a negative assumption as to what will happen to this upcoming airdrop but yes, we can't just leave the doubts vanish so easily.  - NO fate with Luna Project - The people around will still remember their issues no matter how hard they tried to erase them from our mind - this is not a winning tactic to win the game, Terra Luna has been distrusted already",
