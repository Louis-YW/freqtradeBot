Most people go as far as using financial advice to their own detriment and blame the adviser for wrong financial advice. Every advise is subject to your own analysis",

Yes, not a financial advice because anything that is trading, be it stock, forex and crypto trading are of high risk. No professional traders will even call it financial advice. Quote from: Zilon on August 02, 2022, 05:07:24 AMIt sounds funny.....Every financial advise is like a guide to your own analysis and not the sole base of making any investment decision they reason they warn they aren't giving any financial advice to their analysis.Not even financial advice, this is basically just about trading if I get libert19 correctly. I wonder why he called it financial advice because he is not financially advicing anyone to trade. People should just always know that they should not use more than what they can afford to lose to trade, that is just it. People should also follow their own analyses.",

This is the obvious you are saying. The jargons are what we need to put together and watch the little details to see what we can make out of it. Technical analysis is not an end in itself but you have to also use the fundamental indicators like news, market analysis, speculation and sentiment to follow up with your own biase and emotion. You don't have to take the up and down just that way and trade but to understand why it is going up and how long long it will last or if it will stay there.",

Other than technical analysis, there is also fundamental analysis but many traders didn't bother using this.I think the one that use it are investors. If only they will learn how to use and incorporate it with their trades along with the technical analysis then I think they can be more successful. Same with those who invest. They can also use technical analysis together with fundamental.",

Then everyone here knows that the price of Bitcoin and other altcoins in this industry goes up and down, what else can we expect from cryptocurrency trading? are there any other movements that can happen in the market apart from its rise and fall?I also don't get your point here on this topic, it seems like what you want to happen is to make every commenter guess what you did. We are not predictors who know what will happen to the possible price of the coins in the market. Almost all the answers of the members here in the forum are purely opinions or just subjective and not objective.",

Sometimes fundamental news that is suppose to be positive turns to negative on the market and you can't plot fundamental, only to act on it on your own believe so it is difficult for traders to rely on it but investors who jump on it.Quote from: jostorres on August 02, 2022, 01:24:33 PMI think the one that use it are investors.

Because it's not an exact science, that's why it's hard. I mean many people think that they could find something that is cool with the crypto world, but in reality they do not realize that it's actually good tough to do it. I personally do not believe that it's that hard, but many people think so because nobody I know realize that it's not going to be an easy task and it will fail many times.If you keep on thinking it will not fail, then you will soon lose a lot of money. If you do not make trades with 100% accuracy do not worry, that's suppose to happen because chart trading and TA are all things that give you a profit in the long run, not all the time.",
