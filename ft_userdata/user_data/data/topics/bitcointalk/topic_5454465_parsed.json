Now we risk nuclear war, if they push too far.I don't like ww3, when the internet, today's world information is easier and faster to find out, just like japan in the past century so they don't want to repeat that mistake again",

Thankfully most conflicts right now don't result in a quick war like in the old era where they quickly mass up and wage war against their enemy country. right now, they are always careful not to go first because they are calculating the deadly consequences. If it's me, I don't want any war because I know how tough it is to migrate all the time and you will gonna missed the comfortable bed you have at home once the war will broke out.",

Many innocent people will die and become displaced, Many properties will be destroyed before the war will stop. That crisis will spoil everything and every activity that someone has planned to do to better their life. Maybe it will help Bitcoins become more popular among people, but many Bitcoins will be lost too, many people who have them will die, may passphrase will be lost. The changes that Russia and Ukraine crisis have brought will be nothing compared to the changes if the war involves more countries.",

Everything else than China on that list are third world countries compared to countries backing Ukraine.Third world war would be close if USA would withdraw from Nato or that alliance would fall apart somehow. After that there would be less deterrent keeping Russia in check. Russia would definitely try to push some buttons like see what happens if they \"accidentally\" violated some airspaces again, and some other tactics they have tried before.",

Russian didn't think about the havoc it would unleash when it went ahead and started an all out invasion on Ukraine. Even if they did think about it, they didn't care. I believe WW3 will not happen because there are bodies to make sure it doesn't happen. If those bodies fail, then we might be in a lot of trouble. WW3 should be the dear of everybody alive.
