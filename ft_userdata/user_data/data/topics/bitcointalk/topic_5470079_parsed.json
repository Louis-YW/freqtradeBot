I laugh my ass off at this, because I understand that sometimes you want to make a self-moderated thread for certain reasons, but not because you don't like the economic arguments that someone may bring in this section.I am trying to put the countries by GDP from largest to smallest but I can't find the way. In any case it would be the first one still USA with $26.95T,  second China with $17.7T and third Germany with $4.43T. Japan has fallen behind with $4.23T. The GDP of the EU is about $16T, not far behind that of China. Let's see if we get a lot of congratulations in this thread, as happens in the typical Bitcoin Discussion threads when someone says they bought a bike with Bitcoin and such.",

Well, I don't know the reasons, but if you get some news, then share it, I would love to know the details of it. Or maybe you just shared the news even before the new-outlets. Well, congratulations to Germany for achieving this wonderful position.",

Nothing, they will continue to strive and go to their job. Honestly, this isn't should be discussed in economic section, if you really want to then try to come up with \"Germany and Japan economy status: German surpass Japan's economy by being the 3rd largest.....\" like that",

Need two more beers in the weekend and have the wife and kid away and I'm going to come up with something, need to spice up a bit the section anyhow!Problem is...I don't know how to ride a bike too well.  Quote from: Faisal2202 on October 12, 2023, 03:49:44 PMI am not able to find any news regarding to this, all I am seeing the news about India surpassing Japan and Germany. That's PPP, basically saying that if you have 5$ in India you're richer than someone having 100$ in Luxembourg.But since this is Bitcointalk, and we talk Bitcoin and the price is the same India is still a full 20% of GDP.I've always said that Country-level GDP PPP is just some stupid invention to tell poor people they are not that poor and that eating a loaf of bread equals eating a full meal at a restaurant.",

This is not a fake Russian economy, and not window dressing, this is real work on the problem, the mistakes of past governments. Germany is a pragmatic and purposeful country that can not only survive a difficult situation but also change it.Although there is no need to wear rose-colored glasses, since they are now actively trying to destabilize the world economy. The orderers of these destabilizing processes are known to everyone. I think that now the civilized world is coming to an understanding that it will be necessary to make a lot of efforts to eradicate terrorism, including economic terrorism, in order to stabilize the global economy. This path is not easy, but it is the only option to build a new world, where any crazy or notorious ruler will not be able to spoil the whole world...",

I believe their GDP growth rate (in USD) is still below the inflation rate. If so, it's not about Germany doing super-great, but about other countries (namely Japan in this case) doing worse than them.But, at the end of the day, from a geopolitical stance, it's not the actual GDP figures that matter, but rather how the country is performing in relation to others. So it's still a win.",

It's going to be tough but it's being done!Canada just launched a finished new pipeline that brings 600k barrels of oil to the coast, the US is going to hit a record in oil production this year, Enron is actually repairing Venezuela fields so it might return to production in 2 years and Australia digs out everything like mad, gas and coal and copper and bauxite, so soon some will realize that the west was doing fine even before there was trade with Russia!Quote from: pawel7777 on October 12, 2023, 10:59:18 PMIt's not about them becoming super-rich. I believe their GDP growth rate (in USD) is still below the inflation rate. That's the misleading thing when people say recession and all that, GDP figures of growth and shrinking are always inflation-adjusted,QuoteReal gross domestic product (GDP) is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the value of all goods and services produced by an economy in a given year. Real GDP is expressed in base-year prices. It is often referred to as constant-price GDP, inflation-corrected GDP, or constant-dollar GDP.so it does end in weird things, but the whole value expressed in dollars for example, or why not, in BTC as above is growing!That's why I always favor GDP nominal over GDP PPP as that one has to deal with country-level specific situations, just because you own a $10k flat in, how not to piss somebody, random name on Google Kochi, it doesn't mean that when selling you're going to get the same amount as somebody selling a flat with a square view on Chance Elysee.",

They shouldn't have gotten out of EU, that wasn't a smart deal and now it is costing them a lot. China being second doesn't really benefit them all that much lately, they are having some financial trouble and could go on for a while longer if they do not find a fix for it.",

If Germany is the third largest economy after China in the world then that is very interesting and amazing for me because this is a country that has very strong and intelligent soldiers with powerful history. It is very amazing for the government to have maintained the past glory of German even when things look like there was no hope. It means the level of poverty will decrease drastically to nothing soon and the economy will keep growing to keep up with China even when it looks like china is the hub of fast growing technology. Germany has been one of the languages I intend to learn and I think this will keep my interest high.",

Germany is the country with the largest economic power in Europe so it is no longer surprising.Apart from that, what makes Germany so advanced from an economic perspective is because this country has succeeded in becoming the axis and mecca in terms of technological, scientific and manufacturing development. Meanwhile, in today's life we cannot be separated from technology which of course can result in the need for technology continuing to increase so that several countries that focus on this field are very profitable.Moreover, apart from being successful in becoming one of the leading exporting countries in the world, several companies in Germany have also succeeded in becoming global leaders, especially in the automotive, engineering and machinery sectors.",
