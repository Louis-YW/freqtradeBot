The reason bitcoins are still on top is because realize their importance and how solid the project is, that's why it has remained on top. Don't buy altcoins because they are on top or simply because everyone is talking about them, before you choose to buy any altcoin, follow the advice that is usually given here by the more experienced persons in our midst that you should always do your research and decide for yourself if you are willing to risk it or not.",

Mostly the ranks based from the volume and how well those coins/tokens traded in time span of time. So it's not depends on if they use real case or adoption at all. It's based around the value.That's why if you want to invest your money into current altcoins, don't blatantly invest into top coins without any research at all. Things that are good today might be worse at later date.",

And, as of now, we look into the purpose of each altcoin and how it can help the cryptocurrency world and make the transaction much faster and easier to use. This is actually the point of how far altcoins will survive amidst the onslaught of new projects that offer many advantages. And we're always going to see a shift in the direction where the top-ranking altcoins are sliding over each other. Hype is indeed one of the places where altcoins can penetrate the high market, but it is not uncommon for them to return to their original state after the hype for them has ended or even until they are no longer heard of the coin's existence. There are also those who use the hype as a first step for them to stay at the top of the list.",

What I know is that some coins took over the top ones except for bitcoin and ether, but the coins still increased in price.I will agree with the OP that it is not advisable to buy top altcoins, as many of them will be replaced after each bear season ends. Investing in altcoins takes more experience and knowledge, don't just follow everyone's advice to buy the top 10 or 5 altcoins, it's a common mistake. But I disagree with your opinion, never buy altcoins, altcoins still have the potential to bring even bigger profits than bitcoin. Investing in it, as I also said, takes knowledge to choose an altcoin that can make a profit. Investing in altcoins is not for the risk-averse, so if you don't like risk, then don't invest in altcoins.",

For those, who do not know what namecoin was, it was a project where you could mine bitcoin and namecoin at the same time. You could't mine ripple because it was just two guys printing it out of thin air and saying it has a worth, still a shitcoin and was a shitcoin back then, and couldn't mine litecoin that way neither.But since early days, I guess around 2010 and onwards up until 2016 or so Namecoin stayed relevant as much as it can, by simply being a coin you could mine at the same time as bitcoin, it offered absolutely nothing else and I still have a few, just for nostalgic reasons, consider it like antique shopping.",

For example, if we see in the news that Elon decides to incorporate Dogecoin to Twitter, then is time to buy doge because it will bump. Buying Altcoins and hold for a long period is really risky, and personally, I don't recommend it. But remember, high risk can bring high profit.",

I still remember back in 2017 when i made my first steps in the crypto space i think that both IOTA and also Waves were in the top 20 or even in the top 10 in terms of total market cap and look at where they are now. IOTA is at rank 68 and Waves is even lower ranked with 125. So i also think that the current ranking in terms of marketcap does not automatically mean that those projects will also be among the big gainers once the next bullrun starts. I mean obviously those projects already did a x100 at least in most cases or they would not be in the top places. That being said, i still think that if you are only owning small cap projects at the moment then now is a good time to get at least a few established projects into your portfolio.",

We can see how Litecoin and XRP were at that time. But, they were replaced by new altcoins, Ethereum. And after that until now, only Ethereum becomes more stable to be after Bitcoin. And now, BNB is following. Will these two still exist and survive in the top coins? It will depend on the utility maintained by the team. Many top coins at that time couldn't even reach their previous ATH in the last bullish era. I still have some old top coins that are still holing in my wallet, because they are still not able to pass the previous ATH. But if I see the history, it may be too difficult for them to pass the previous ATH, because it seems like that their era has ended.",
