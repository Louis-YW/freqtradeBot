What similar features you are looking for in other site? If you want the casino to be trusted like stake then there are many old and reputable casinos where you can play. FortuneJack and Duelbits are currently one of the best casinos right now. If you are looking for sportsbook like stake, then sportsbet.io would be a good choice. Listen OP these are the sites where I have played before and hence recommending you. But I would suggest you that before depositing here, go through their terms and services and then only deposit.",

I'm just asking you this, because there are stakes that you don't need to go through the casino, there are stakes in centralized and decentralized exchanges as a matter of fact.        Why do you prefer crypto gambling? which in fact has a higher risk level if I compare it to the ones I mentioned above. But even so, it's still your choice to follow in the end. So the suggestion I can give is stakescom I think is good for this.",

I have done this and it worked for me, I was gambling on a online casino that I found on this forum and I started liking the casino because of the design and stuff, also because of how things works so well on this platform, the games and customer service are good, I was welcome with good amount of winnings, later I started losing and losing, this goes on for weeks and I was about to give up on gambling for good but my mind tell me to find another and sign up, which I did, then the result was different.",

I have seen games where stake offers 1.8 : 1,65 odds, what is this? Also the cash out feature is really \"cheap\" on sites like sportbet.io you get much more if you cash out. Also compared to other sites the reward system for playing sports is underwhelming. For playing casino you get rakeback but for sports it's basically nothing other than the weekly/monthly which considers casino just as much.",
