Is SUI a SCAM project or LEGIT?Don't trust any altcoin projects, it is better to have the mindset that you may not get paid for your efforts if you participate in an airdrop let's say among 100 projects that have airdrop only 20 will distribute the rewards to bounty hunters and remaining 80 will be a scam project who will nether get listed on an exchange or distribute tokens to either investor or bounty hunters. So altcoin is practically a gamble and at that, we must know how to take the risk when it comes to altcoins, I personally will not advise anyone to waste their time on any of such campaigns even if the task is very simple to accomplish.",

Is SUI a SCAM project or LEGIT?Don't expect anything on a platform to have a airdrop if they didn't give anything on that timespan then move on, its either they are not really paying or they don't ready yet to distribute the allocated budget intended for airdrop. Just try your luck on other testnet but also make sure you didn't spend any amount on any airdrop potential project to getting scam by those people who run a fake project in this space.Just try more free airdrops to get more higher chance to spot a good project among those newly or old platform running.",

It's because I've been seeing people that have been too hyped on this project and they're boasting that this could be the next ARB. Needless to say, don't be too trusting with these projects especially the new ones because you'll never know if the developers of it will go South and will change the terms and development of these projects that you're too optimistic with.",

Is SUI a SCAM project or LEGIT?Hard to tell a scam project until it happen. If they are able to attract good community then I think its better for them to focus on making it a good project. Airdrop is not necessary and there’s no assurance for this, since the hype of airdrop is coming back, many expect that every project will have this, again it will still depend on the project developer, though rewarding the community can still happen in other way.",

These are just the author's dreams that SUI can release airdrop. If we turn to the official information, we see that SUI never planned or promised airdrop. This was once again stated by the co-founder and product director of Mysten Labs, which is the developer of SUI: \"Stop spreading nonsense. There is NO Sui Airdrop. Not planned or ever will be.\" - https://twitter.com/EmanAbio/status/1645183702224506881",

Is SUI a SCAM project or LEGIT?You are wrong, they had a lot of notice before that they did not plan to distribute the rewards to the testers. But because people always hypothesize that they are just trying to lie to get rid of cheaters, and people still work hard and expect. Many people are disappointed with this result, but the testnet means that you participate voluntarily, no one is forcing you, nor is anyone promising to pay you a reward. I bet you're angry that they don't plan to distribute the airdrop, but it's clearly your fault for expecting too much.SUI is a very large project that is expected to bring huge profits for us. I find it quite funny how so many people who haven't done any research and don't know what's going on are slandering it.",

Is SUI a SCAM project or LEGIT?Not sure though is that is good project in the beginning, never heard of it before to be honest. But as you have said, when majority of the altcoins are doing airdrop to gain support from the community, they do the opposite by not doing it.Maybe they have their own reasons to do it, but then again, I would say that it's the norm in the community that at least a legit project should airdrop those who support them specially in the beginning. Perhaps the only reason I see them not doing it because they are afraid that those who are going to received it will dump the tokens right away.",

Is SUI a SCAM project or LEGIT?For the information I am seeing the developers never made any promise about an airdrop, and instead they seemed to have been very firm against the idea of ever having one, so anyone which participated on the testnet program does not have any legitimate reason to complain about the lack of an airdrop.Now about your question about this project being a scam, at least on this topic the answer is no, but you must never forget that many projects can turn into a scam in just a few seconds, so you need to remain vigilant in the case the developers of this project finally do something which can be interpreted as scamming their investors.",

Is SUI a SCAM project or LEGIT?The retroactive airdrops are always unsure. Some opt to give back to the community and some arent. Lets just move on if we participate on their testnet since every project has the right not to give and these are just speculations. Who knows they might give some on suprise or anything. Ive seen a lot who got dissapointed but thats fine. Maybe participating on their community sale is also a bonus since its quite low.",

Honestly, I see the project very clearly that it's just stubborn and greedy users that they will get the reward, in the crypto environment with airdrop participants they all use faith as the main thing so when things don't work out As they wish, they will always express their frustrations. I just feel like a lot of people are acting like scavenger vultures, the truth is that the project also repeats NO AIRDROP over and over again, anyway this is still a top project for me despite its problems. topic about this but it will continue to develop in the future.",
