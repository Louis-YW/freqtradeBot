      "body": "NO, but it depends on how good the trader is, but most people that think like this do not know much about trading and they have more chance to fail in trading, the reason not to think this way, having other work that you are doing is wise and better.I will not advice anyone that is trading to depend on it for a living, better to have other work that you are doing. But while having other work that you are doing and you are making profit from trading in a way your profit is significantly more than your loss, such people later can go for trading alone, but in a way they still have other things they are doing like their personal work, but leaving where they are employees.I will not advice anyone to fully depend on trading, but trading choose some people, this are the kind of people that really make it from trading, but this kind of people diversify by having other businesses.If I should choose yes or no, it is no. People should not depend only on trading for a living.",

You can only achieve this level once you already have good knowledge about cryptocurrency and same thing with trading, experience and trading is the key so if you are a newbie don't rush yourself to do full time, have some experience first and soon if you are already good enough, you can do full time in crypto, this will also depend on your dedication.",

Some people are very successful gamblers and make a living out of it.

You cannot make an investment in cryptocurrency and expecting a 100% return or predicting how it will turn out in the long run. It is possible to view cryptocurrency as a side business rather than a full-time job. However, this depends on your decision and your ability to control your emotions when the market doesn't work in your favor. Because of high hopes after investing in cryptocurrencies, most people commit suicide when they lose their bitcoin investments. Spending only what you can afford to lose is always advised. Your emotional state and level of mental readiness will determine whether you should pursue cryptocurrencies as a full  or part-time job.",

Although the truth is that with trading you can make a bigger profit from your paid job but at what time to get lucky for that or to have such profit can't be determined by the trader. So with such, a paid job is better to concentrate on because it is steady and you can plan your finance and family with an income that is stable and guarantee than what you can't determine like cryptocurrency trading. The returns from a good trader is higher than paid job only if you are willing for the risk against when you are having losses.",

In case you traded cryptos for a few years, maybe even stocks before that and you made good returns than I would say give it a try. It's very important to know what you get yourself into and if you are able to sustain such a lifestyle. You need to have a decent bankroll to start with, because otherwise your return expectations are unrealistic and you will take too much risk to chance returns. Let's say your yearly fix cost for food, rent and other bills are 10,000 USD. Then you would need to make 20% of 50k USD or 10% of 100,000 USD returns each year before breaking even. Without a decent starting capital it's not realistic in my opinion. Maybe give it a try first to start off part time and rely atleast partially on a second job.",

I mean the amount that you will get while doing trading is uncertain. It doesn’t depend what type of trading you do, but yes the income that you gonna generate will vary each day or week.If you can really survive on a uncertain amount, then yes you can completely rely on trading and will definitely survive from the money you make on trading.But on a safer side, you can do anything part time to get a fixed amount per month.",

But it won't be easy because they have to stay focused on trying to earn more money. Cryptocurrencies offer many ways for people to make money, one of which is by trading and this is not as easy as one might think. We must have the ability to trade so that we can make a decent profit every day and every month. I'm sure many of us have made a lot of money from cryptocurrencies and that opportunity is still open as long as we are willing to put in the effort.",
