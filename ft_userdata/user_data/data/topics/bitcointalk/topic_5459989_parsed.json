      "body": "I will like to know why the team is having presale at different prices. I am not a fan of having presale or even token sale at different price entries, no one wants to by something you know those that bought after you at the same stage can sell and make profit on you. I will also like to know if the team has raised any fund from through private sale or from seed investors. The project is in the right niche but the AI space is becoming extremely competitive and the team will need to get things right just not to be lost in the crowd",
