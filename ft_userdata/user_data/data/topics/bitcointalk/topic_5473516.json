  "content": "We saw the Bitcoin market touch $34,000 last October. The Bitcoin market has been bullish since the month of October, although BTC has started to rise since the end of the month and the market's candles are holding a green candle.Since the Bitcoin market has been bullish since the end of October, the following month in November, the market price did not drop much. Since the beginning of November, the Bitcoin market has planned to move higher and the markets are gradually moving higher. We have seen today's Bitcoin market pumped to its peak in 2023 and the price of BTC has moved closer to $38,000. The way we see the Bitcoin market change, if it continues like this, then we can definitely expect to see the price of Bitcoin at $45,000 dollars at the end of the month.And if we see the Bitcoin market at the end of November, then surely we will see more changes in the BTC market in December. If the Bitcoin market is bullish towards the end of November, it will certainly be bullish in December. I think the Bitcoin market may touch $45k to $50k by December. I think if it continues as per the current market position, the Bitcoin market may be at this stage by the end of 2023.Now my question is, will the BTC market touch, $45,000 on the End of November? Will the Bitcoin market touch $50,000 by the end of December 2023?BTC market chart by 2013 to 2023 November!!!Today BTC market",

As I type this market Bitcoin is trading just above $36k wherein it almost touched $38k as it was trading at $37972 today. There are two strong factor why I feel it would break the previous ATH is because of two reason which would bring in more investment into Bitcoin. One reason being the surge we have seen during last quarter and based on previous experiences bull market will lick on anytime. Secondly the Bitcoin ETF's possible approval.",

The volatility is so high and this makes some people very panicked in making decisions. Not sure if bitcoin price can touch $45k before the end of the year, but anything is possible if $40k is touched during November.I picked $45k to $48k in the Poll, it was the middle of the 5 picks that I wasn't completely sure about. If the $40k resistance is broken this month, then I believe another big rally will follow and we can expect more about a breakout of new resistance above.",

So not sure what kind of indicators have we reach as the price didn't hold and we have seen this kind of movement before. Hopefully I could be wrong as I'm thinking that this could be another sideways pattern.But barring all circumstances, I think we should be at least in the $40k'ish this November-December.Maybe we will retest $37k again and then move past forward as we are in the bullish sentiments. Maybe there are just sell orders at that price earlier and so it automatically sold by some short term speculators.",

Both of those questions have the answers of 'probably' and that's because we're moving up and since today, we've seen $37k again and then got some pull back. That's a normal move for Bitcoin and getting to see with some $8k gain for the entire month of November, plausible but again we can't have accurate answers for this one. So, while everyone is celebrating already, expect some pullbacks and corrections along its way to the top.",

We hear good predictions if the move is positively upwards and then if we see the negative price point going downhill then we're going to mostly hear that it's going to be bearish. You're right about that term that it's gonna be about variations or variables. So, what predictions we'll hear are dependent to it. And only a few predictions that we've heard to be stable from people that's keeping themselves bullish even during the bear market.",

But then I also have a positive mindset for Bitcoin market for the time being and I am sure that I will not be surprise to see a 40+k price record before the end the year.",

So let’s hope for the best.Right, it never ceases to amaze us how Bitcoin goes from last year lowest low of $15,500, to the current price of $37k. We have a thread that says that we are already up by 127%, so that is a big increase and I doubt that any other assets can give you that profit in just 24 hours. And so it's another indicator that there is really a demand, it might start very slow because of the bear market, but after a year, and as we approach block halving, market is slowly getting back and with that I have voted for $45k-$50k at the end of the month.I think this is the big number but as we have said, this market has a lot of surprises so it's possible that with the bullish sentiments still very high, the market will continue to grow. And yeah, just continue to accumulate, there's no secret formula here. If we wanted to make profits then that's it, buy, HODL and then wait for the right time to sell around 2025.",

Who are the people taking profits and how does their profit taking affect the price of Bitcoin? If you understand how the Bitcoin market works, you will see from the data the OP provided that the year leading to halving is not always the time for profit taking but time the big capital start entering the market, that is why the price don't always dump towards the end of the year. The people that are trading short term would have already taken their profits by now since they bought during the period of consolidation, around $26k-$29k and when price went down below $20k.

I don't expect much dumping again because there are many things that can make price pump hard.",

I think the market is just waiting especially with the ETF approval but if it could even hint a thing I guess the market would react pretty quickly that it may touch some of chart levels.",

Maybe all the members here really believe in bitcoin, it would be better if they trusted this asset and continued to buy it and hold it until the halving arrived.
