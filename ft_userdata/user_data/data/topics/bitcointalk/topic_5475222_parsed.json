When I been see your topic I been think say na another thing you wan talk, but as I open the thread na another thing I come see. To make am for this country dey very hard. And no matter what, people must think, because who get problem no dey sleep for night. But any how the country be person must not give up. Because giving up is the worst mistake.The position you dey today, I think e get some of your friends you start with, them been no believe for your dream but as e don be like this now them dey jelouse you. So for life no matter wetting we dey pass through make we no reason negatively, na because of hardship dey bring negative thinking. That's why you go see news for social media, as them dey use people pikin dey do ritual. Dem dey use jax collect people prick. And one thing be say if them catch you untop crime no excuse dem go Dill with you. Even that hardship wey make you go do crime go run leave you to suffer for jail. Make we just dey careful, work hard/smart and wait for wetting God go do for you.",

Not everyone value what you do for a living and not everyone will give you applause for how far you’ve come in this life. Don’t look farther away and envy those that have more than you but appreciate the one you have by looking out for those that don’t even have up to you. Life is a transitional process and what is meant for you will never pass you by no matter how long it will take you to achieve it. Then why rushing to reach the success point when it is not yet time? We all need to appreciate every little thing we have now while hoping for the best that is yet to come and working towards achieving it.",

But all we have to know and understand is that any position in life is temporary, whether rich status or poor status. It is temporary and will soon come to an end, so anything we are doing, we should be considering and trying our position best to look at those that are blowing us, not those above us, because when ever you look at the situation of someone who is blowing you or suffering more than you, you will value what you have more, but if you are always looking at those that have more than you and are stable, you will find out that you are not grateful and can jump to the wrong conclusion that you will end up regretting. This is the same factor that leads many youths in Nigeria to yahoo, fraud, armed robbery, money rituals, and a lot more, which is just as a result of not being grateful for what God has provided for them, and it is very bad because definitely one day they are all going to regret it. I just use this medium to add up my perception because I was inspired by the content of the OP post, so I also add up to what the OP has discussed in order for us to be more generous and grateful for what we have, and definitely we will get more by the grace of God.

It's hitting us fair and squarely without leaving anyone behind and we all are surviving based on the our very own capabilities. We can't really do more than intended of ourselves and it's a very big win for us to even scale through each day in this economy. Even with the unending laments, murmurs seeming like the economy would eat us all up, we've been doing our best to counter its attack on us.   We do not need to curse ourselves or our strength, this is no time for comparison rather at this time, everyone needs to concentrate on herself, know your weak point and your break point, do not exceed your limit, do your best to survive and live the rest. The economy has always been deteriorating, this time won't be the last so we should prepare and motivate ourselves for more cases like this to come. We'd definitely pull through, think of your comfortability at this moment first before trying to be a cheerful giver to people. Now is not the time to be unnecessarily benevolent, we have to be cautious of every of our activities that balls around the economy. The race ahead is still a long one.",

This economy hasn't exactly been the best for anyone because no matter how much you want to calm stability, the drastic change in the economy definitely ruffled a feather or two of not more.But instead of constantly complaining about the economy take a self-survey and rate yourself on what changed about you, how the economy has changed your habits and behaviors.For one, it definitely helped create a spending consciousness. Nobody can say he/she maintained their regular spending lifestyle. Worst comes to worst you overspent because you were considering the future if there will be a hike in price of a certain commodity or not. So to avoid that you bought now to save for the future.Another positive thing that came out of this economy was the need to learn a skill/get a virtual jobYes the economy hasn't been friendly but the fact that you are trying to sail through the storm and not wait for it to pass is a commendable thing. No one will give you as enough credit for what you do other than yourself so as you keep trying take time to praise yourself and tell yourself how proud you are that you have the strength to continue",

Gratitude writing may be quite beneficial because it allows us to dwell on the positive aspects of our life, no matter how insignificant they may appear. I believe that we might become so preoccupied with the unpleasant aspects of life that we lose sight of the positive. Keeping a thankfulness notebook can help us shift our focus and put things in perspective. And it doesn't have to be something elaborate or sophisticated; simply taking a few minutes each day to write down what you're grateful for may make a tremendous impact. So, when we are happy and thankful, our bodies may relax and perform more effectively.",
