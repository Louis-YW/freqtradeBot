  "content": "Hi, Bitcointalkers,I want to introduce an automated algo trading system which i have worked on and wrote the core strategy.From my experience it is amongst the best and most reliable crypto trading robots available on the market.If you keep reading and following the details you will find out why.July had 21.82% profit, however it was amongst record high and in general ~3%/month should be expected.Crypto Manager - https://www.cryptomanager.ai/A platform where there is one strategy and the user can only press START/STOP to start or stop the robot.Works with Bitmex and Deribit exchanges, Binance and FTX will be connected next month, currently supports BTC and ETH management, will add support for USDT from next month.I developed the strategy offered by Crypto Manager myself and have used it for more than 2.5 years, so I have a lot of confidence in it.Every single line of code is written with thorough attention to details and high safety standards.A lot of attention is also paid to security. For example api keys are not stored as text in the database, but a hardware module is used to encrypt them.The robot itself has many safeguards to prevent unexpected errors and is very well made.The returns are not super high (~3%/month is to be expected, although July has now been a record and earned over 21%), but the strategy itself withstands very large storms and is quite conservative, never using more than 2X leverage.There is essentially a market making/momentum strategy based on:a) VWAP (volume weighted average price)b) AI signal how the market will move in the next 3 days (analyzes detailed minutelt external data since 2018, blockchain txs, open interest, etc.)c) Market sentiment indicator (similar to crypto fear and greed)Video how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8X3882QK1wPrice: 20% of the earned profit and $5 for each start of the robot (colleagues allowed me to offer a promo, if you register and write to support that you came from bitcointalk.org, you will receive a $200 credit to use for running the bot).Pros: You don't have to pay if you don't make a profit. Developed and tested strategy, uses external data and has been working on the market for over two years. Very easy to use, no need to configure or know anything, has high security standards.Cons: Only one strategy so far, diversification and several uncorrelated strategies are still needed to professionally employ a larger amount. The platform is newly launched, so there may be all kinds of visual or technical bugs from the user panel.Looking forward to your comments, will keep this topic updated with new algo updates and monthly performance.",

We do have a demo account with $10.000 starting balance which we launched in 2022 June on Deribit and we can share view API keys with any interested client or a 3rd party service. I tried looking for a 3rd party solution that works, but did not have success with any of these. We want to showcase our Deribit account to add credibility to the track record.Besides this project, i launched a cryptocurrency exchange in 2015, and did a CRYPTO5 portfolio which did super well investment wise for all our clients, so i have a little bit of verifiable track record besides Crypto Manager, examples here:https://blog.kaiserex.com/2017/11/02/crypto5-portfolio-performance/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1744991https://uzdarbis.lt/t377337/investavimas-i-kriptografines-valiutasbitcoin-ir-kt/also we already have a few reviews from our current clients who made a nice profit in winter/spring:https://www.trustpilot.com/review/cryptomanager.aiQuote from: LoyceV on April 16, 2023, 08:23:35 AMQuote from: dealeris on April 14, 2023, 05:31:34 PMUpdating the topic with 1 year track record of the plaftormSo, to summarize, you went from 0.72BTC to 0.717BTC in a year.

It is pretty damn good not to lose money in a bearish year like we had in 2022, besides that, we fixed a few mistakes and improved the system substantially. As for track records, it is a very well known scammy practice to have multiple accounts and only show the winners and this skepticism is a must have in this market and very welcomed. Things change when you have an account with a sizeable amount like we have a demo account on Deribit with $10.000, you can not really afford to be losing on different accounts, because it will cost you way too much. In reality if you are doing less than perfect trading you might lose $50k per year to just have a fake track record with one account holding $10.000.Last month, Crypto Manager decided not to do any trades and just held the long positions it accumulated in the spring, which resulted in another amazing month with 22.73% profitability.Latest performance:MonthBalanceGain %Max drawdown %Max win %Trade countAverage trade sizeTotal trade amountAverage buy priceAverage sell price2023-06₿0.857222.73%-20.52%39.16%0nannannannan2023-05₿0.6985-5.31%-22.52%18.38%50$42.00$210028080.95nan2023-04₿0.73772.89%-5.29%8.15%357$64.98$2320028226.8229386.62023-03₿0.717015.03%-14.73%33.8%262$13.07$342521940nan2023-02₿0.71220.67%-4.75%8.21%154$13.31$205022078.99nan2023-01₿0.606017.53%-1.91%19.03%35$34.00$119016636.88nan2022-12₿0.6102-0.7%-1.69%0.86%315$12.30$387516749.49nan2022-11₿0.539813.05%-5.99%19.07%582$21.44$1248016749.6920219.642022-10₿0.53331.22%-1.17%1.66%481$21.89$1053019160.9320181.322022-09₿0.51144.27%-3.1%7.99%627$21.48$1347019347.920961.522022-08₿0.46679.58%-6.57%15.87%614$18.31$1124020962.923809.092022-07₿0.44026.03%-9.94%16.71%534$19.64$1048520274.522115.952022-06₿0.5457-19.34%-23.31%21.46%507$45.87$2325522214.7430608.922022-05₿0.6699-18.53%-42.15%35.9%202$69.83$1410537726.1730855.592022-04₿0.6876-2.58%-5.18%3.6%572$33.21$1899540811.6746343.812022-03₿0.7200-4.51%-8.16%6.36%563$231.48$13032541125.4242356.12",
