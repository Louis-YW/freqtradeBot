  "content": "Security is a very important topic in Blockchain applications and Bitcoin has proven to be reliable here, while many Altcoins have struggled to do so. For us, when our money is at stake, we need to do our research how a Coin is different, advantages, disadvantages to prevent a loss due to education. Here's a list after my research. 1. Bitcoin is well reviewedWhen Bitcoin was invented, it was set up to be a big security. Hacks should be impossible and get prevented by good code. Bitcoin attracted and still has a very large community of really educated developers. Bitcoin has a very reliable coder community, where flaws will be detected early before implementation and no risks are being taken. Many much smaller coins have a very flawed code review process.A large and educated coder community reviewing code during testing times is an important advantage for Bitcoin.And luckily, it saves us from possible hacks, when hackers are prevented from detecting flaws faster because all flaws are removed before implementation.We have seen so many hacks, where a flawed code was exploited and people lost money, like for Altcoin cross chain bridges recently or when Terra Luna failed.Still, people are buying coins from unreliable coders like Tron from Justin Sun or even weaker DeFi coins like Acala Stablecoin from Polkadot’s supplier Web 3. Unfortunately, some people will only learn after a loss. Some coins are very centralized and have a single point of failure like Solana, when it was down several times or devs have much power like in Binance Coin or Tron.And DeFi coins can easily print some more coins / tokens into existence.Bitcoin is having a big advantage here.2. Bitcoin has PoWIt is big controversy for a long time, if a coin makes PoW or PoS, like it was for Ethereum [ETH]. Not for Bitcoin because Bitcoin developers have decided PoW is best because of security. From what Experts have said so far, PoW is very hard or almost impossible to compromise instead of PoS, where more attack vectors can be found. Like Corona, we should trust mayority of experts who have education and experience in an issue. Satoshi implemented PoW not PoS because Satoshi knew. He was very experienced and called it right. PoS can be abused by rich stakers and makes a project centralized in many ways like premined coins and devs can create much influence by staking a large amount of PoS coins. PoW is not having such issues. 3. Security is Bitcoin’s priorityAs for a safe cryptocurrency, security standards are very important. First point, we need security standards and Satoshi implemented it right himself, when he developed Bitcoin. Early Bitcoin developers added more security standards. Second point is after some time, to NOT remove such security standards. First point and especially second point are relevant to many Altcoins, which is a big issue for Altcoins. Many Altcoins don’t offer anymore to create private and public keys to prove ownership of funds and access it. It is very concerning and seems mind blowing to many experienced coders.For example, when creating a Solana wallet or similar new Altcoins. Altcoin developers are not focussing on security. Or even MEW is bitching around more and more every time going away by implementing insecure patches. We need to have our private key offline. Many Altcoins are leaving people vulnerable which is very concerning. Bitcoin is better like Electrum for example. Its design is not so nice but Electrum is good tech and recommended by many experts. Bitcoin is still having very high security standards today because of Bitcoin does not want to build a hype coin, Bitcoin wants to build a safe coin. It is our duty to select a safe coin instead of an unsafe hype coin.",

Bitcoin has good and experienced developers who are maintaining the network, which is absolutely fine, and they have been doing so well with the help of a large community and support, which bitcoin also has. But just because it has not been hacked yet does not mean it's not hackable. Let's just be a little guided and don't give it our all in the aspect of feeling reluctant. No one is praying for it to be hacked, but it's not completely immune from being hacked.",

Bitcoin has hundreds of contributors, while altcoins have just a few or a small team. Another big difference is motivation - Bitcoin devs work on Bitcoin because they are enthusiastic about it, altcoin devs just launch a coin to sell their premine or are hired by someone who will do the same. So Bitcoin is in the same league as large open-source projects like Linux, while altcoins are closer to penny stocks scams.",

I quite agree with you on this. Developers aren't responsible for the creation of Bitcoin but you wouldn't blame the op for using that word because for some, due to the fact that it's uses a decentralized Blockchain technology most will easily mistakely attribute the creation of Bitcoin to developers but in another angle, Satoshi nakamoto could be a developer.  Much credit needs to go to Satoshi for his foresight to have been able to create a coin that can safely serve as an alternative to fiat and also act as a hedge against inflation.",

Like what Investopedia is saying here https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.aspGood points by the way OP.I believe there are simple things about Bitcoin that makes it a good coin. 1. The developer really cares about Decentralization.2. He understand what true decentralization feels like. 3. He knew that the only way to maintain true decentralization is to become unknown. To make a decentralized coin survive in a centralized planet, there will be so many hate and war ahead, he got it all figured out, he built Bitcoin without waiting to claim the glory, he became a nameless person for the sake of Bitcoin and it's future. Today many developers don't think before building, they just build because they have something that can work.Satoshi Nakamoto is more than just a builder, He is a Revolutionist.",

Most of the people are not very eager to learn and adopt the BTC Technology. As, most of the people are interested in BTC just because they know that BTC is a hedge against inflation and they can store their money/assets in BTC for a long period of time and by holding these they can make money too while if they hold their assets in fiat then they will lose their money. Besides this fact, most of the people are coming to trading to change their life. Many people are tired of their 9 to 5 jobs and want to perform something that will pay them within 24 hours. And they should be their own bosses, working only when they choose to. This means that they can either do it or ignore it. There are hundreds of other reasons to explain why people wanted to adopt BTC but believe me very few people are interested in the technology that BTC brings (use cases it brings).",
