Even higher ranked accounts can scam after they successfully got their loans. So with your new account, no chance to get any loan without collateral. Actually when you ask for a loan, who care what you need money to do for what purpose? The loan provider can not verify reasons you said so actually they don't mind about such.",

I think all bitcoin borrowers will at least take advantage of volatility to add value in addition to earning interest. So, thinking about it will only add to another student's inability to pay back.The cardinal rule, \"borrowing for crypto is too risky\".",

If you're looking to ask for a loan specifically to pay out student debt I am not sure this forum will be able to help you with that or something because as what the other guy have pointed out, people who provide loans in this forum don't really care about your reasons for taking out a debt. As long as you have a valid collateral and is someone that could be trusted, you're good to go.",

If they feel the sense of security that you will pay for your loan, they can accept your loan even without collateral.  But mostly for those who have not proven themselves or are not a ressident of the forum with higher rank, you need to provide collateral in order to get a loan else the request will be denied.Besides, the lender doesn't ask about the borrower's information.  It is just a matter of trust and/or collateral.Quote from: Mr.right85 on March 23, 2023, 07:17:59 PMQuote from: Rockson1 on March 23, 2023, 02:46:04 PMGood day guys; I said  let me know if the forum have a board where students are being support in education by giving them student loan To help them in education, so many members here I believe are students in various higher institutions so many of them fine it difficult to pay school fee's or pay rented apartment,buy textbooks and hand outs or even feed very well or access to student loan boad,please I want to know if there is any room for students in this forum in universities to access student Ioan, i said let me drop it here because I have not seeing education board.Don't know how this might sound to you but, you might not be a very good student! Your probably not the best to seek this, having to write all that wall of text and your punctuations are placed in any manner.Lol, there is no need to judge a member here whether he is a good student or not, I think it is out of the line to assume and state that @OP is a very good student publicly (that is somehow a kind of bullying).",

However, you can try it though, at least you know the results of your application and the reason if it might be denied. Try and consider this advice, OP. You cannot be considered for the loan board because your account is still new and reputation is very important in this forum. Before you can be considered for a non-coletaral loan, you must have been a member of the forum for a long time, not just a few months. As a student, I understand how difficult it can be at times, but simply look for a reputable source in your country where you can obtain the loan. There are some banks in my country that provide student loans that they can repay after they graduate, I don't know if your country don't have any of such. Else, You could also ask your friend; who knows, maybe you can get help from them.",

Many reputable forum members take loans and return them when agreed upon between them and the borrower. You're a newbie, and your account isn't reputable enough to be granted access to a loan (though the person lending you the money will decide). If everyone in the forum is given access to loans, there will be a lot of fraud and the lender will go bankrupt. Create a much more reputable account in the forum first in order to get good access to loans. If not that, then you’ll need a collateral to be used when applying for the loan.",

I reckon it's just a matter of a lot of paperwork and you'd be able to apply for one. I'd honestly doubt you can find one here since I reckon it's be a pretty big loan, most of the lenders here would probably require collateral or outright not give it. Plus, I don't think borrowing Bitcoin for a long period of time is good due to how volatile it is, especially if we consider how you're borrowing it as a student loan, which (afaik) only gets paid when you graduate and get work.",

If your problem is the borrower will pay less in the dollar value, you can make an agreement where you will always win.If the dollar equivalent is less than the amount you've loaned before, you can ask him to pay in BTC equivalent and vice versa.
