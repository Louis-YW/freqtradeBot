It took me some time to be able to think of something that I could do that will not cost me too much money since I do not have so much of that, and also something that will not require me to talk to people directly because I can get shy.I decided to get stickers that I intend to distribute among transporters to put in their vehicles and tricycles, and also to put them in places that people can easily see.I will appreciate someone help preview the post so my stickers can be seen.",

I can't see the whole caption, but it's something along the lines of \"Bitcoin can give you financial stability\", which is somewhat true, but what about the other risky side that includes volatility, secure storage, crypto scams?Perhaps it would be wise to post a link in the form of a QR code that would lead to some legitimate source of information such as https://bitcoin.org/en/ with the note that this website comes translated into various languages, which should be taken into account if it supports your language. If you just let people know that Bitcoin exists, many will end up on that well-known website that promotes fake bitcoin, or they will become victims of some crypto scam, whether it's fake wallets, exchanges or doublers.",

I live in a country where bitcoin is a completely government-proclaimed banned currency. I can't promote Bitcoin everywhere, but I'm not far from promoting Bitcoin, I walk the streets with the Bitcoin logo printed on my t-shirt. I will make a visiting card on Bitcoin centered around one of the upcoming festivals. And I will promote that visiting card from all my social media.",

You can still add the investment part while letting them know the importance of not having centralized services like banks to interfere with your funds or transactions. The suggestion of Lucius could also work for this.",

There are no currencies that can promise financial independence. We must put in a lot of effort to achieve that by starting our own business, getting a good job, and creating many sources of income. Bitcoin is a digital currency that aims to become the same as the money we use every day. What would happen if a poor person saw one of your stickers and spent all of his or her small savings to buy bitcoin? Is that person going to become financially independent? Sorry but the stickers, in my opinion, are deceptive.",

Just knowing is not enough without additional knowledge on how to use it, education is needed through face-to-face socialization between you and people who want to learn more about Bitcoin. Some people want to know more about Bitcoin, but they are embarrassed to ask. Socialization will help them become closer to Bitcoin because have been equipped with basic knowledge of storing and using Bitcoin properly.",

Instead, show courage because that is the only way you can pick up new skills quickly. I can see you're trying to raise Bitcoin awareness, which is why you went ahead and made those stickers. It is admirable that you are attempting to raise knowledge about Bitcoin, but you should take additional steps to ensure that the public has access to accurate information by placing some websites names on the sticker so they can get full information aboutÂ  Bitcoin there.",
