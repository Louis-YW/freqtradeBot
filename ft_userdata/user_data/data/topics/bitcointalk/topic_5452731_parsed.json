It's not something anyone should care about. In fact, this is the only liquidity the token has. All in all, this is more of a disadvantage than an advantage of the project. And the fact that it's locked to 260 doesn't mean it can't be withdrawn by devs. All they have to do is to dump the rest of the tokens they have in this LP to get most of BUSD back.Quote from: johsmith27 on May 14, 2023, 07:27:12 PMAs you guys know, we are living the early periods of the crypto market in which what determines if a coin/token thrives is not just utility but irrational hypes from internet communities. Just Look at Pepe and other meme-CoinsIts not how it works. Some meme coins give such returns not because they have funny name and people wants to have it. its because they are created by people with great capital who manipulate valuations at the beggining of project and pay for huge marketing campaigns which manipulate people with the help of depth psychology by showing huge pumps as an argument that it is a good project and that it will continue to grow.My description has nothing to do with the token you bring here- not even a fake utility, no website, no marketing campaign, no capital ($800 is not capital). So far its not even worth 4000$ because everyone can create such token after 1 hour youtube tutorial and 5 min of coding.Quote from: johsmith27 on May 14, 2023, 07:27:12 PMWhen I say life changing I mean getting retired from working.Just stop with this BS.",

What do you guys think? let's discuss about this project. I want to read some opinions.So checking out the chart and seeing the project that its 10 days old as of this writing and checking out those candles which it did make out  some  pump and dump on its first day. Is this really something new on bsc-based meme coins? No its not. It wont really be that shocking nor surprising on the time that you would really tending to look around on BSC space and i do really tend to avoid up that 0/0 tax which this is where rugpulls do usually happen. Why? How can the team or dev would be able to make money if they arent really getting any tax on buy and sell? This is why being that sensible itself or having the common sense would really be saving up yourself on getting scammed just because people would really be diving in into something having that zero tax and same goes into those  coins which are gettingin lined with the current hype. I was aware about orange but the hype now is sticking into cartoon characters.",
