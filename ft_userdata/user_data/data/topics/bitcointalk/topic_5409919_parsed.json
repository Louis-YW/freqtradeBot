What you should really be focusing on (if you're planning to build a wallet) is how you're going to attract the users. Since there are many wallets to choose from (which have been around for quite some time) your product has to be better in every aspect (more features, better UI/UX, supports multiple platforms, etc.).",

Unless it's a custodian service (which is not really a proper wallet, since it's not your keys it's working with), a wallet doesn't charge extra fees. So all the fees are miner fees and the wallet developer earns nothing off it.Custodian services do ask you to overpay for the fee and many make money off that, but, as I said, those are not really wallets (although I know that many tend to use even exchanges as wallet services).",
