      "body": "The information text you received indicates that the transaction is already been propagated/sent within the network but it is still pending/unconfirmed. The hint that it will get reflected in a while doesn't quite accurate. It depends on the current network congestion and the GAS fee that you've paid, so it could be the reason why it has been an hour ago, but at that time it doesn't get confirmed yet.You can see the rough estimation of the current mempool on https://bscscan.com/gastracker, but since you are created a new token, surely it requires a much higher amount than a simple transaction/transfer.",
