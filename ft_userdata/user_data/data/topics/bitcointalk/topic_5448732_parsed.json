Also, withdrawal is easy nowadays just comply with the requirements and follow the rules of the site you should experience no problem.",

Most likely.If the account is frozen, there must be reasons why it has gone to that point and to make it possible to get that withdrawal is they will require you some certain documents. But as you've said, you don't have the documents that they might be asking for you to proceed with that withdrawal so it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to access that and get into the process.",

So what they did actually asked out? Some documents which is usually the case. So if you arent the owner of the said account which means that the previous owner did really sent out documents earlier or not?If yes then you would be needing to provide the same documents but if this is the first time then i dont see any problems since you would really be just needing to comply on whats been asked.The only problem on here is that if you do make use of VPN then for sure they would really be that keen when it comes to location specially on the IP address which it shouldreally be correlate out on what you have have submitted.",

You are probably stuck until you manage to get your personal identification documents, so yes.Also, why would you gamble while not having your passport or ID readily on hand? It is well known that casinos and gambling platforms reserve the right to ask you for those papers whenever they need them or deem them necessary.It seems rather reckless of you, to be honest.Until you cannot prove your identity, they may assume there is some suspicious activity going on. Good luck.",

This is also why I consider the pro of KYC; to avoid easily withdrawing my funds from the account. We'll never know; online platforms are prone with viruses and devices with malwares if you won't be that secured always. So atleast, you'd have the assurance that you will be the only one to use your funds at a time you would want to. If it is regarding frozen account, then that would be another thing. You'd appear suspiscious on the viewpoint of the gambling site. This should be discussed on their support to check if there would be way to do so.",

In most cases, casino sites have strict policies in place to prevent fraudulent activity, and they require proper identification documents to verify your identity. I know this will be of little help to you right now, but you should have known better than to deposit your funds into someone else's casino account. This is probably also against the terms of use of the platform.",

Although, the fact that the casino states that they won't be needing kyc for withdrawal does not mean that they can't request it, like for a recent thread where a user was asked for KYC completion after the casino wrote on their website that KYC is not required. And since yours has been frozen they are likely going to ask you to submit your documents depending on what made them freeze the account in the first place. If it's about identity issues then it's certain.",

I mean no proper/legal business would ever accept only proof of payment as the proof for identity, both needs to match. People can borrow from other people to pay stuff, but you can't exactly go about borrowing other people's identity now.In the first place though shouldn't you be able to contact the og user of the account? Seeing as you funded his account through your own methods after all. That is unless you're using a different identity then well, all the blame is on you.",
