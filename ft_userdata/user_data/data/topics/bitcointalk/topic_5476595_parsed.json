The next interesting phases in the immediate short term is the combined effects of the Christmas rally, and the January 1 ETF decisions. All it takes is 1 ETFA to get a gauge on whether the others will move into the approval phase as well.Great job on your T.A.

Well, Bitcoin can technically cross even $200k in this bull run but as a safe prediction I would say that $120k or above is going to be the next ATH that we are going to see in the upcoming bull run. That target will be achieved for sure without any doubt within just two years. I believe that 2025 is going to be the best year for the holders who want to have their investment 3x to 7x depending on when they have invested into Bitcoin.I even think that there is a possibility for Bitcoin to reach to $500k price mark in the bull run if it gets intense because the powerful hedge funds are now moving towards Bitcoin and 2025 can change the mind of people regarding Bitcoin a lot. Who knows that even we see Bitcoin at $1M level in this bull run but that's a very high level expectation but still that's possible.",

In these 24 weeks we did not visualize a carry on process but when price reach the value of 38k$ so again it down to 34k$ and now its increasing and beat worth of 40k$ in less time.It is important to note that short term depletion is not a talk of worrying but it is the time to be patience and get reward because of this patience in coming Bull run. Soon bitcoin will go upward and the price will be 100k$ very soon so if someone has not purchase bitcoin yet so they should start working on it therefore they will be rewarded with huge profit shortly.",

I do not doubt that by November many investors would have made good profits. This is one of the most accurate predictions I have come across in recent times. Great work OP.

If someone can not buy at ones, DCA can be used for the buying.I also thought that buying now is a bad idea because the price might drop in the future especially if the SEC fails to approve the spot ETF. But I think I was wrong because the price might not be solely dependent on the ETF. Anybody waiting for the price to go down for him to buy might be disappointed because it might never happen. With the current move in the price, buying now is not a bad investment decision.",

We are all seeing the price movement and of bitcoin and we can’t say buy hope that it will still going higher till halving and post halving time to when the bitcoin bull run is expected to happen. Your prediction of bitcoin price to reach $173,566 before November is actually possible, but people will be scared to let it wait till then before selling. So that they won’t miss out at selling at an higher price if it doesn’t eventually reach there. For this prediction, even after the halving is not a bad time to accumulate bitcoin for the profit that will come at bull run.",

If it happened too fast a free fall will follow, meaning there is no strong side ways building up with time before surging, I don't always like such moves unless we are in a full hard blown bull run, this is also why I am not a big fan of trading, because even if you are sure that a move is coming you won't know the exact timing. I think the second bull run is just getting started, the first phase started months back while people are expecting a massive pump, it's over, even if there will be some retracement next year it won't be as deep like people are hoping for, unless a very scary event takes place. Just because of Covid, something that haven't happened before in the history of people Hit very hard in 2020 I believe that's why we saw new lows in that year and sadly people have now use that to become a sitting duck, by not taking any action, waiting that something like that Covid period will happen again. It was a pleasant surprise in 2020, and now it's the fools game of not buying Bitcoin and waiting, many will watch the bull market return without taking any actions, they will ape in when nothing happen this time around.",
