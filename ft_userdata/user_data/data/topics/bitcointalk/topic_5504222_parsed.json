For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? Yes of course, high transaction fee irritates everyone who is about to use the network at that time of congestion and that is why you see that most regular bitcoin users who are on small transactions will pause using bitcoin and use altcoins whose transaction fees are very cheap, until Bitcoin blockchain becomes free from attack.What I do is that I don't act as if I have bitcoin at that moment when the blockchain is congested so that I don't get frustrated with high transaction fees. I don't use LN because opening a channel is what I am not use to and I don't want to learn it for some personal reasons.",

I think that all the topics you have created arise from your psychological state at the moment. And if you check the mempool today, then you have nothing to worry about. On the other hand, the person who understands why high commissions arise understands perfectly well and has a strong nervous system to worry in vain since everything is temporary. But if such a question is raised by you, OP, you need sedatives to create topics with a deeper meaning.",

Nobody is comfortable paying high transaction fees because many embraced Bitcoin due to low transaction fees. I have learned not to be over-troubled by what I don't have control over. Periodic high transaction fees have come to stay until a solution is devised to stop the attack on the mempool. Instead of being irritated, it will be better to devise means of paying low fees. Consider consolidating your transactions if you have many deposits (UTXOs) when the transaction fees is down.",

What question is this? no one likes high transaction fees on the bitcoin blockchain, especially if we want to make bitcoin transactions. Moreover this is a problem for adopters who do not have a lot of bitcoins, solutions already exist for this problem, you can use LN for small transactions, this will not be a problem for those who have a large bitcoin balance. If I had a lot of bitcoin, even 500 sat/vB wouldn't irritate me either.",

I mean the majority of people in the world will use bitcoin, and that will also cause the bitcoin network to become congested and transaction fees will remain high forever, not temporarily like now. Not to mention, spammers will not stop and you can also see that after BRC20 passes, we already have Rune, and I believe that in the future there will be something else to replace Rune to continue spamming the network. I don't believe anyone would feel comfortable wanting to move bitcoin, but high transaction fees have slowed things down. So we'd be fooling ourselves if we said we weren't upset when bitcoin fees skyrocketed.",

All of us gets irritated when we're about to do a transaction and the fees are outrageous. The only people that aren't irritated with that are the miners. But except them, all of us are seriously not impressed when we have to pay more than the amount that we're about to transact.

Transaction fee is mostly considered base on the mempool and the number of inputs we are using for making the transaction, but by now, i don't expect to see many claiming that bitcoin transaction fee is still extremely high because what we are having now is very much affordable by all, there are times it get high and other times the transaction fee get low when the mempool is less congested.",

In my experience, sometimes the fees truly get high, but sometimes websites that monitor average transaction fees, as well as wallet recommendations can be wrong and make one overpay. So checking the fees on Mempool is a good practice.When the fees are above $10, it makes me upset, but I know that it is temporary, and I try to wait them out. If I need to sell urgently, I do it despite the fees, but that is pretty rare. Large fees show that Bitcoin is often not suitable as a form of money, at least not for daily usage and on-chain transactions.",

And I always hope it the network congestions doesn't happen on the day I need to change some bitcoin to fiat. I remember one time it happened and the my transaction was stuck for 78 hours. I had to use the bump feature and paid more on transaction fee because I had no option at that time and needed the money badly. The new strategy for this is to have a close friend send me some altcoin or usdt during this congestion period and pay back when then network is less congested and the fees have reduced. I do the same thing with funding my gambling wallet, I just use USDT.",

For some reason maybe for some people it will be inconvenient when the amount of bitcoin fees will obviously be a little annoying especially when we need it for a fast time but until now for me personally I have never felt that way because I rarely make transactions in bitcoin and when the network fee is high enough I prefer to wait a few days until the network fee is in accordance with what I expect because indeed the increase in network fees to date is not too long lasting and at most only a few days so I am more inclined to just wait in the end especially in this case for transactions as well I am just moving to the main wallet.   So, i don't feel bothered by it. But even though it doesn't bother me i still don't expect a significant increase in bitcoin fees because after all, surely everyone wants the same thing with good enough speed but cheap fees because after all, that's probably the hope of most people.",

To be honest with you, I wish there is alternative to this problems but when you complain, some Bitcoin supporters comes for you like you don't like Bitcoin. I like Bitcoin with all my heart, no digital currency comes close when it comes to everything about it but you see this congestion, it sucks when there too many transactions on the network and you are left with no choice than to wait because the asking fee is even bigger than what you want to send to another wallet.If you want to bye pass this problems in future, make sure you consolidate your inputs into a single place, it helps you spend low fees when it comes to times like this, consolidation of inputs helps you get small inputs and this help you mini reduces the amount you will spend for every input in your transaction because segwit address fees are actually low but this doesn't mean you wouldn't pay more if there is high congestion, you sometimes need to pay optimum to be able to get your transaction through.",
