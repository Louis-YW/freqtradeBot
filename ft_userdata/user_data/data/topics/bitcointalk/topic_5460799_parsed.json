  "content": "Hey, crypto fans! I've been hanging out on this forum for a while now and I have to say, I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge most people here have about crypto and blockchain. It's got me wondering, are there any crypto experts in the house who works in the blockchain/crypto sector? If you're working in the industry, I'm curious to hear about your role, how long you've been in the game, and your career goals. Are you employed by a company or you work as a freelance? No need to share personal info, just give us the scoop! By the way, I'm a fashion lover with no in-depth experience in crypto, but I'm here to soak up some knowledge and share the little I have. Also, this is borne out of sheer curiosity.",

Also, this is borne out of sheer curiosity. If by Expert and Work you mean people who are really good at solving problems in Crypto space, you will find one or few in this forum. But don't expect to find employed people in real (decentralized, open-source) cryptocurrency space.  As a crypto worker or problem solver you need little to no permission to participate or work on true cryptocurrency projects. Your contributions are considered based on their merits and you will probably get paid via voluntary donations. These are some of the most important characteristics you must look out for when searching for true cryptocurrency projects to work for. The typical career goal here is to help build choas-resistance parallel society based in cyberspace and in real world. There are very few people, typically the real Heads, who are quite unpopular, prefer to be discreet but are very powerful and influencial.... one of their roles is to guide the space. They have been in the space for as long as 7 years, could be higher or lower, what matters most is how long they have been working on similar idea before discovering cryptocurrency. It's likely so long depending on whether it's the role they were created to serve or fulfill.",
