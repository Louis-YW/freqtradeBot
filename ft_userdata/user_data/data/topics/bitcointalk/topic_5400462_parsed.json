Warning that other wallet might be buggy/unstable?References to other wallets aren't the concern of Bitcoin Core developers so I'd leave it to those wallets to mention if they are experimental/beta.As to how it should be altered, nothing fancy - just delete that sentence that says it's experimental software (it stopped being so since the wave of BTC forks happened).",

I say leave it as it is until those who work on it decide to change the experimental prefix. It would be interesting to ask them via GitHub and see why exactly that is and what needs to happen for Bitcoin Core to no longer be experimental?",

Besides, as ETFBitcoin pointed out, the [No] Warranty section already warns users that devs won't be responsible for bugs or vulns inside the software.It's more of a matter of \"Read the license of the software you're using\".",

This is regardless of \"beta\" status. There has been a lot of work put into bitcoin core, including by many talented people, however, it is still far from perfect. Further, the warning to not keep all your money in bitcoin is very much valid, as cryptocurrencies are still very new, and there is a very real risk that the price of bitcoin will one day go to very near zero.I understand that the factoids were submitted by those who purchased a \"donator\" membership and being able to do so was one of the \"perks\" of having a donator membership. I believe theymos may have previously removed factoids with broken links.",

There are several instances of simplistic firmware, scripts, shared libraries, or even simple applications like notepad (even though a new version is apparently being released now.. which will likely introduce bugs ). On an individual basis, I'd probably see some of these as no longer experimental, although certainly the overwhelming amount of applications out there today are far from perfection, and it is continually spit out with seemingly subpar developers and lack of good quality assurance checks.Quote from: LoyceV on May 30, 2022, 02:27:16 PMSo the difference between beta and stable is accepting the remaining bugs as \"normal\" Sadly, which probably includes bugs nobody is even aware of and/or have yet to be discovered.. but then I guess they are not 'normal' anymore, once discovered.. at least, we'd hope.",

A warning on a discussion forum that is not officially associated with the project is unlikely to provide any legal protections to the devs of said project.",
