A special type of database, very good for decentralized and trustless use because, especially if built in the way Bitcoin's blockchain is done, they will not allow modifying data from the past.The rest of info, especially details on what does Bitcoin's blockchain store and how, will be there in the links already provided by others.",

Then come back and tell us what you don't get or what you want more information about.  All answer is actually in google, they can search all they want and the meaning of those words will pop up but there are some newbies are skipping to do that because they want to short cut things since they don't want to do further research.Its really good to do research first before asking since you will get more additional info' coming here then you will not skip any basic information which is important things you need to learn.",

For you to grow in this forum you should have the habit of reading and learning on your own for vast knowledge. Anybody that is learning about crpto should be able to first know what blockchain is. Tim-Charles has given you good articles to read on blockchain. Learning is intersting when you can easily get the information if what you need to know about from google.",
