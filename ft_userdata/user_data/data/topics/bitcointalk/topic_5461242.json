      "body": "Regardless of whether they provide alternative API resources, I don't think you can deny an API going down if it basically fails at the exchange endpoint. Or if you need to, contact the Excchange's core-developers to gain access to the data legally through a webscrap process or something like that.I think you should take a look at CryptoCompare, they also provide an API for development purposes.",

Pretty sure they have all the data going back to the beginning.They basically save the API data and then sell it for quant reasons. Just google and find a service. Keep in mind it wonâ€™t be cheap.",

Right now, you are on your own.I have no knowledge of how this things work, but if I should why op need such a data, i see no other reason aside the fact that maybe he or she is planning on developing an exchange, and need such a data to work.My question now is, why is he or she particularly interested in that of FTX? he can get the same from other exchanges that are still functioning, or maybe he thinks he or she could get this FTX bitcoin and derivative data particularly for free since the exchange is no longer existing, this I highly doubt.Anyways, i leave the final reason why needs this , to him or her to answer whenever he or she comes back to this thread.",

FTX was one of the major exchanges and was hoping to find all bitcoin related datasets from ftxSo if it's only for research purposes, I recommend using the exchanges that exist to this day, which did not turn out to be a big scam (perhaps their transactions were also falsified). The largest exchanges that have both spot and derivatives market are binance, kucoin, bybit. all of them have good API.",
