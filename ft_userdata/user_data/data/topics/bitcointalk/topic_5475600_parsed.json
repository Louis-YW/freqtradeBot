  "content": "https://positivebetting.com/Example of a profitable bet- Over $200 profit and a $3795 total bet between the 2, making it a 5%+ ROI bet. PM me if you have any questions and I would love to help. If you had a 20k bankroll you could make $1054 in a day betting these games. Then you would have to withdrawal all the money, wait for it to deposit in your bank and then re add to the sites. (or if you're lucky, half the bets will win on each site so you don't need to reconcile on each) If you like sports betting, try arbitraging games live. You make a small RIO per bet 3-5% but that can be hundreds if not thousands per day with good schedules. I'd recommend having a bankroll of $20k to start because you shouldn't be betting less than a few hundred per game, otherwise the profit per bet will be too small. [Must be in the US and be in a state that allows sports betting with some good options]I personally arbitrage and have made $100k this year. Arbitraging is far from risk free, and even if you bet both sides of the game you can run into issues like the sites going bankrupt, or grading differently if the game doesn't finish. (This happens with baseball alot) What are your experiences with arbitraging?",

There are some risks associated with the bets though like you mentioned. If you bet over/under on points scored in a baseball game, different sites have rules if the game doesn't finish. SO in this case, you could potentially have a loss and a void on a bet depending on the sites rules. If you're betting a ML then its like a 99.99% chance that you make money with American sports outside of soccer where you can have a draw. (assuming you're not using a book that goes bankrupt before you withdrawal)",

      "body": "All forms of betting is risky, of which arbitrage is not an exception to it, considering the fact that mostly in sport betting (i.e soccer) it involves 3 major options (Home, Away or Draw),  of which if you bet on either Home to win, you still have 2 other options (i.e Away or Draw), likely to make you lose your bet if the prediction doesn't go as played, and same goes to when you bet on either \"Away\" or \"Draw\", unless only when you bet on Over & Under (i.e Ov2.5 & Un2.5), that the options are likely to be only 2, but yet it's odds are always very small.But yet, if there is anyway you could teach those who will be interested in learning arbitrage betting here on this forum, it will be a pleasure, rather than referring us to a third party website.",

If they're licensed they can handle the bets, and I wouldn't recommend betting more than 2k for your first bet so you shouldn't run into trouble. You're correct though, arbitraging you need to move fast, if the lines move in a negative direction then you would need to take a loss. You'll get more bets in than the sites changing odds on you though, so its still profitable.",

You can bet for example Barcelona in different options usually direct win, win either half, over 2.5. So in such instance, the match can end up as Barcelona losing the match to the opponent. What such means is that the gamblers options ended as losing, it is as simple as that. Usually this is to the dismay of the gambler and you keep wondering what hardluck that came to you. Arbitrage can also be profitable and you win lots of money from it.",

You also get access to live webinars where you watch me live arbitrage.Yeah, you need to complete KYC and be in a state that allows sports betting. I do not recommend anyone to use a VPN, and you need to use your details. The other hard part of arbitraging initially, is I recommend you have $3-5k to deposit to multiple sites, so that you can make multiple bets before having to withdrawal and redeposit.You would get limited if caught arbitraging. But you can withdrawal. There are other risks associated with arbitraging which is also explained.But I wouldn't work with anyone who is outside the US or in a state that doesn't allow sportsbetting like TX.",
