It is ironic to note that this day BTC and many altcoins are experiencing some red days. Anyway, celebration can come in many ways...just remembering the day is one of them. I am just wondering who or what organization is now controlling the domain name of Bitcoin....?",

Another reason I believe that most community members are active on the forum than the website. Though Bitcoin.org is the only website where you can read the whitepaper in different languages which according to me is a big achievement.",

We individually add value and meaning to whatever we want, so that shouldn't be a problem. You can also celebrate it from your end if you want.",

I haven't forgotten it but I did find out about it today. Same feelings dear mate, That information was also new to me and this was also a new set of information but tbh i am bad at remembering dates so the chances of forgetting this information next year are so high. But still i would try to celebrate it next year. And then i will try to mention this OP to invite in that celebration. Bitcoin.ORG was the domain name of BTC website while this forum is known as Bitcointalk. Both are although two different names but are made for the same purpose of BTC. So, i think it really deserved a chance of celebration and to celebrate we could donate to this domain if there is any donation address.",

So OP I think you need to have a look again on your topic because Bitcoin.org is a hardware store and provides other information related to Bitcoin as communities, and other types of Guides etc etc. I had never seen a dedicated topic for the Bitcoin.org Aniversday. If OP is confused with both then he should at least go for a quick go through if not I'm not sure Why because we even do celebrate different events as Pizza Day.

I'd argue that the fact that the industry is able to move on from mundane stuff like this is a great enough sign that we're progressing and developing at a breakneck pace, which is good for everyone involved, whether you're a builder or an investor. Of course it's great every now and then to reminisce about the simpler times, but between then and now where bitcoin is significantly more valuable, I'd choose today. It's one thing to recall and reminisce, it's another to look back and retain past habits just cause.",

People who have bitcoins are more interested in getting more that marking a historic date. If you know about the date, you can personally have your celebrations, there is no need to make a big deal from it. There are better things that can be celebrated about bitcoins and we hope to celebrate acceptance and adoption of bitcoins above everything else.",
