It's wild, never seen something before, can you add more information please about it and actually stick some proofs here, maybe you got statistics of this method or logs.Stories like that sounds strange, text and your telegram account is not enough to get some customers in this forum. \"Escrow\" word are using to get more trust, but in this case it's make no sense.more looks like scam",

I have seen many \"offers\" of this type for many years now and I can tell you that a 40% daily return is a scam that only people who do not know mathematics fall for.If you invest as little as $100, with a 40% daily return, reinvesting what you earn each day, at the end of just one month (30 days) you would have $2,420,143.24. You tell me what the fuck the OP is doing here promoting his \"system\" instead of being on his way to his private island with his yacht full of models and bottles of champagne.",

It's not possible to earn +40% of whatever deposit per day and if someone offers such things then surely there's shady part in that. I'm pretty sure that no one will fall into your scam but still I would warn anyone to not deal with you. I highly agree with Poker Player because someone who's going to scam others will put such offers so guys be careful from the OP.",

This simple thing some fool people can not understand is that if I would have something to earn a guaranteed good amount every day why I make it public? It's nothing but PONZI SCHEME.

How much is the price then? Could you tell us? Maybe you can give us more insights  rather than \"fashionable\" adjectives. I am not a P2P expert (that earns through P2P), so I could not tell if you're trying to scam anyone. So I think you should be be a little bit transparent. Just a bit. The overview. Not the adjectives. I'm still unsure if it's a scam, as I believe there might be legitimate ways to profit from P2P transactions on exchanges.",

If you are serious to advertise your so called get rich quick scheme, then you should've come out in a more convincing way as an experienced scammer, but here I see a baby, hungry scammer who doesn't even know a bit about good packaging. 40% ROI daily is a lot man, does the money fall from the sky or what?. how do you or the system now make their money if they allow such cash outs?. This forum is full of very experienced people for you to come and pull such a cheap stunt man. I think you need to get something good and reputable doing with your time and life instead of looking for a way to scam others. Its Christmas time, all of you scammers have crawled out of your hibernation to start pulling one fast stunt or the other to get illegal funds for your merriment, I gat one word for you and your likes. You guys will surely be disappointed.",

If you are making claims about this, you should have very tangible evidence, like people who are already in this f**king system and making 40% of their deposit every day. Although there is nothing that seems very impossible for scamers to do this day, you can actually do some forgery and make another claim that it's your investors that have made such a profit in the past.Honestly, I am very skeptical about what you say here; there is no p2p system that can offer someone this amount of daily profit. Guys, be wise and don't ingage, so that you don't get scammed. As for OP, you can say something that is more convincing.",
