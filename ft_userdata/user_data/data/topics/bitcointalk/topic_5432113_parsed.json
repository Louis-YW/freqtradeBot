The most important thing is that you learn how to manage risks and control yourself when any losses occur.Loss will happen even to the most experienced traders, but only the rich are the ones who turn that loss into gain, whether in the short, medium or long term. Therefore, learning to trade is easy, but risk management is the hardest.[1] https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demo-account.asp#:~:text=A%20trading%20demo%20account%20is,trading%20venues%2C%20and%20commodities%20exchanges.",

I got into stocks from their mentoring when I started earning.Crypto was something I started doing on my own side by side, for me this volatility was obviously more, but did not affect me much because I was primed form my previous experience. Gradually I understood that to mitigate the crypto market's massive day changes, you need to do it long term and that is what has been maximally profitable for me. I do understand that day trading on crypto can be massive, but that risk gives me discomfort and hence I avoid it.Tutor yourself either from a family member who has interest in your well being or do it yourself by dummy trading, the second one is tough.",

Having another trader put you through along your trading experience will help you to get the required confidence for the trade ahead. Sometimes it is good and going to reinforce what you already know, building your confidence if you see another trader showing you the road.

If the trading you are doing makes you get more losses than the gambling you did before, then you need to study again. trading is not only a technical and fundamental problem, it is also related to psychology if you are not ready then you will lose anything when trading. over time, the losses you get will provide more lessons and knowledge so that trading can be successful and provide benefits.So make sure when learning to trade using financial management, and risk management properly and we must also be aware that trading will not always provide benefits.",

But those that use little amount of money prefer to use very high leverage which can bring emotion to them. There have been many position I had opened in the past, but high leverage made me to lose as the position opened is high.Quote from: Ratimov on December 28, 2022, 10:19:42 PMI am convinced that trading cannot be taught.

Those who fail to understand continue to waste their time and money trying to master this profession.Of course it is possible to learn trading if your mind to  tried. If something can be tried by oneself then it is definitely possible to get success. If a newbie wants to learn to trade, he needs to spend a lot of time on cryptocurrencies. And he needs to acquire a lot of knowledge about crypto currency. But that doesn't mean it's just profitable.No matter how much knowledge he acquires about crypto, he will definitely lose when he first enters the market and if he catches his mistakes from there and corrects those mistakes later on, he can definitely become a professional trader. It is not impossible. You just have to have your own morale, desire and hard work.",
