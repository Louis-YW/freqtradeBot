Of course, this doesn't mean trustwallet is secure. Trustwallet is close source and we don't know whether they have access to users keys or not. It's also possible that you can't recover some of your altcoins due to not knowing the derivation path used by trustwallet. The best is to avoid any close source wallet like trustwallet.",

That's in theory.In reality, nobody could answer your question, nor should risk guessing. In the same way SBF had his backdoor in FTX accounting software, we just cannot know if this closed source wallet is nice and clean or not. In theory, it is, but that's only in theory.And as long as trust wallet is closed source, whatever its developers (or Binance official) will tell ... you have to trust them and they may be lying or not. Even more, as long as they keep lying it's open source, I choose not to believe them, I choose to use an actually open source wallet.",

The question shouldn't be if Trust Wallet is decentralized. You should be asking if the wallet is open-source and/or non-custodial. Trust Wallet is non-custodial but it's not open-source. You have access to your recovery phrase and/or private keys, but no one knows if someone else has or what is happening in the codebase. That's the issue with any closed-source software or hardware wallet Quote from: istiak2277 on November 13, 2022, 05:17:48 AMI am using a multi wallet in trust wallet that has BTC, ETH, BNB, dot and most other blockchain which i can access through one mnemonic phase. I see no reason to hold bitcoin in a multi-currency wallet when there are so many good standalone clients available for various devices and operating systems. Even ETH can be safely stored on MetaMask, which is both non-custodial and open-source, and a decent choice on a clean system. Not to mention hardware wallets. No idea what kind of wallets are available for DOT or BNB though. A multi-coin client should be a last resort if you can't find better alternatives. Your first priority shouldn't be convenience and having only one wallet and one seed instead of multiple ones. It should be the safety of your coins.",

If that's out of your budget, then use open source wallet as mentioned above and run it on a secure device. It might take some time and money to move and organize your funds by doing this but at least you are not depending on a software that may or may not has a backdoor. While Trustwallet has some good features for coins management, don't rely on them if your focus is security.",

It's also possible to extend the seed with a passphrase and it's got a TOR on/off switch in the settings. I didn't play with the TOR feature though. When you create a new wallet, it gives you a choice to make a backup of your seed. You don't have to display it on the screen at all to write it down. What I noticed is the long sync time for bitcoin. In the wallet tab, it allows you to add the cryptocurrencies you want to keep track of. If you select bitcoin, the wallet takes a good 5 minutes to sync with the server. The positive thing is that you can't generate a new BTC receiving address until you have clicked on show seed on screen in the settings. With this feature, the developers are trying to make you backup your seed before you can start receiving any coins.",

Normally the reason I would use multi-coin wallets in the first place is because I need to receive an obscure coin & network combo e.g. USDT on TRC-20, and there are maybe only 2 or 3 wallets that support such coins.It kind of puts me off of using most altcoins (that is not even counting the thousands of dormant coins & tokens that will never get a wallet) - if there isn't a suitable wallet for them, why bother?",
