Saying bitcoin will not reach all-time-high but increase just to $35000 or $40000 would be wrong and no good analyses can point to that.",

Come to think if we do speak about 2 years from now then for sure we are already on a bull runor even past bull run season on which we know that we arent that blind on what are those probabilities for the price on shooting up on breaking ATH's on the time that we are experiencing this season. We've been there and we arent that blind and dumb enough on not to see those high numbers. There are really just those people who do really love with those crashes and dips even it turns out not to be that realistic at all already.Motivation? It would really be entirely depending on what are the things that you are really that dealing with and what are the factors that you are really that seeing and what you are believing.It is really just that there are ones who do mold up their own approaches and decisions.",

A courageous trader wouldn't wait for the perfect time when the market is just set and prices are okay before they swoop in. They make the magic happen from any point and turn it to bliss. BTC is still going to rise, but what remains constant is it position on the top and the assurance of better service  delivery to it vast customers. Am very happy to be one of those who would get to witness the halving and would tell the tale because I understand what it is and the best I can do for myself right now, is buy BTC, HoDL BTC and DCA BTC.",

And there is nothing to learn about because all the things both the predictions the op has made have been discussed so nothing new in the op. Even last year when the price came down to 15k and 16k US dollar, many people who were saying to buy could not buy any unit so it is not a new thing again. And I believed even last year it was in the month of August that bitcoin drastically come down very well. So as it is coming down again in this month, those who have been in the forum understand what is happening so they would not panic. And also, I don't think bitcoin will still go down to 15-16k US dollar in this year. But let see what will happen at the first week of September, if the movement in the bitcoin market goes down then the price might reach 15-16 again but if the price is on this range then 15-16k will be a nightmare.",

This price will be exceeded by the end of the year. In my opinion, buying for $15k or less is not realistic. And $19,300 in the next year is also out of the question because there aren't enough proofs that can be identified right now that will lead to that.",

But price movements in the market are more complex than can be analyzed. Even though technically I see that the price will indeed go to 24 and then to 22. But still, all of that still doesn't guarantee that the price will actually go there. But for those of us who are doing DCA, I think it doesn't matter where the price moves. If it goes down we buy more. And if it goes up I buy less and wait for the dip to come back to buy more. My nets are currently installed up to 22. It would be great if the nets I installed can be filled. maybe if the price passes 22. I also have to start planning to set up nets at lower levels. But I think area 22 has very strong support.",

We know that there's no assurance in speaking about price movement since this market is really that unpredictable and totally that random at all and there's no way on which path it would really be taking into. 2 years time and just been said by others that we are already past bull run on that time which does indicate that we might really be that in other market cycle on which we know that might be able to see some numbers that we arent expecting. We cant really even tell if there would be some huge spike in price.Now, people would already be that positive and hopeful for the price to come up considering that we are fast approaching with the halving event where most people believe thatthis one would really be a solid catalyst on bringing out the market into the positive side of things.This is why it would be wise that you should really know on when to pace yourself.",

Although that is possible to happen but it's too far from the truth. $15k is very low and surely investors won't let it to be happened. In my opinion, what's happening in the market now is just a pullback because we are still in the bullish trend. $25k has a strong support, meaning the demand sitting there are so big, and I think it would be enough for the price to increase higher. Possibly the price would hit $35k to $37k this year.",

Because in the next year bitcoin will face a halving cycle, which usually bitcoin price will increase. Indeed, there will always be a decline in the price of bitcoin, including in the next year. But I think your prediction is too exaggerated. Because as far as I know, the price of bitcoin will experience a fairly deep decline, that will be after the bull run market is over, and that might happen in the 2025-2026 range. Why is that, it's because when a bull run market occurs, many bitcoin investors sell their assets, so the price of bitcoin will definitely decrease.QuoteAnd It seems like 35-40k highest price for btc.in the next 2 years.In my personal opinion, the price of bitcoin will be more than the price you mentioned. Because if you don't know, as I wrote above, next year bitcoin will face a cycle called halving. So after the halving occurs, the price of bitcoin will usually experience a sizeable increase or what is known as a bull run market. Well, it all happened, because it has become a trend for investors in bitcoin every four years. What makes bitcoin investors hodl their respective bitcoin assets, to wait for the halving and the bull run market to sell the bitcoin assets they own.And OP, advice from me, looks like you should learn a lot more before making a thread like this, because by now I see you've got two red stamps.",
