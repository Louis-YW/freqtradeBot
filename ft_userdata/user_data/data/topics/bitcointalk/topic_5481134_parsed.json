Thread link: My question: Quote The question is: who hacked the SEC account? I mean US SEC, which is supposed to take their security very seriously, and they don't know when their official page was compromised and news was made about it...  Which user, @tvplus006, gave a very perfect answer to the question, which was too simple for me to believe until now?Quote The answer may be too simple to be believed. There is an assumption that this was a delayed publication, which was supposed to appear tomorrow, January 10, as previously expected, when the SEC was supposed to announce its decision. But obviously, the account admin has confused something with the dates.  The good news is, it was finally approved after all this time and all the speculation.",

Let's wait and see how he reacts.It's really strange, it's officially approved as it seems but there is a big inactivity on market. The market was volatile like this yesterday and the moment before announcement too, charts speak themselves. People are probably looking for official twitter post or aren't immediately acting because they are afraid they'll become a victim of what happened yesterday. We aren't seeing buy the rumor, sell the news either. It's a very curious, I am not going to sleep for a while to see what will happen.Quote from: BitMaxz on January 10, 2024, 09:59:19 PMIt seems the link or the page was hacked because the PDF file is gone or SEC just intentionally removed itIf they have such a big problems, they should close themselves  They are toying with Bitcoin's price.",

He definitely didn't want them approved. I guess he put up a good fight. But too much pressure from giants ... cough cough BlackrockNow that the ETF is approved I guess Bitcoin might seem a bit more legitimate to ppl when they see names like Blackrock, Fidelity ARK and the like. Although spot ETF's have been approved in other countries like Australia and it didn't have much effect. But I guess the SEC approval has been publicised and built up much more and thus we hopefully see new ppl investing in crypto. So hope for big bull runs!",
