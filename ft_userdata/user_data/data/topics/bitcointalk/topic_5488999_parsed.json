Finally, people can move on with all this stuff that's been obvious for everyone. Craig is a really good man when it comes to wasting everyone's time and it's such a funny thing too for him to be providing all the falsified evidences when in reality, the people that wanted to believe that he's Satoshi was asking simple requests that would prove him to be the enigmatic bitcoin founder but no, he attacked and made a circus of himself and the hearings that he's been in. Appeal might still happen but who's the judge that would consider it? Laughable but definitely an admirable fight for Faketoshi's quest for proving what he's really not in any circumstances.",

I saw this news yesterday but it's surprising how one will just be too thick skinned to let go off his false claims even from the first time in 2016 when he spoke about it, I wonder what was is drive all these years since we know deep down he knows that in the end he will definitely lose the case",

Well, I feel for the real Satoshi right now, I hope he/they are still alive to witness all that is happening as many people are shamelessly laying claims to it.I know that the project is such that could be done by more than one person with each person given different responsibilities in the project. There could also be a division between them which makes the issue so confusing since it was a project done with the top aim of anonymity. I believe they never expected Bitcoin to be this successful and the pace of the success is so fast as well.Well, the court has delivered its verdits, he may appeal it if he wants, but if he is not the one, then he could be charged for the whitepaper claims on perjury and forgery if there is a prosecutor.",

Right now much really better for anyone to buried up their thoughts or curiosity about the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto and respect his total disappearance since this is maybe what he like so people could focus on anything they want to do with bitcoins he or they created.",

If his main objective was to get some sort of attention, he has achieved that but l hope he gets slammed for perjury. In the UK, he can get a maximum of 7 years or a fine for perjury.",
