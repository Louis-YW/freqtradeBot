But so far nothing of that theory surfaces this year, so still the 4 year cycle is going to be the norm for us.",

Here we are now and I am worried if we are going to bounce back up or going to convert this long term support to resistance.In 2019 first quarter, we had a sharp rise up to $15k level from the 2018's bottom of $3800. Similarly we could expect bounce back of bitcoin market from here onward which may lead to sideways conditions till the end of 2023. From these I am sceptical about being tied on the current levels till April of next year.We have been into more than 12 months long bear market; so there are lesser possibilities about its persistence for another three months of time.",

I don't disagree, in fact am very open to amplitudes no longer following a pattern as this cycle has already invalidated one bottom pattern (that the current cycle's bottom will never be lower than the past cycle's ATH).",

This is all affected by global economics and the more inflation grows while FED manipulated rates to decreasing hence causing recession, the more we are going to see an unrealistic sell pressure in bitcoin market.Again the inflation-recession combo in US economy (that also affects most of the world's economy) is not something you could have speculated on by looking at bitcoin charts!It is going to be the same in the future. The moment inflation stops growing and FED accepts the reality and stops manipulating interest rates, is the moment we can go back to realistic bitcoin prices and a realistic market again. Until then we are going to continue seeing a struggle to go back up.I don't see any more drops though because the more rate increase by FED is not going to affect anything whatsoever.Quote from: ImThour on December 17, 2022, 05:22:16 AMSome people who are part of Bitcoin still don't believe in the four year cycle, foolish for them.Nobody should believe in the 4-year cycle from the start of 2022 considering nothing of this last cycle has been like the previous ones:1. Not the same overall rise at all2. No bubbles whatsoever3. A big crash regardless of the lack of bubble4. The bottom so far has been below previous cycle's ATH which is a first.People who naively claim this is another cycle are only looking at 20% of the cycle ie. the crash and ignore literary every other aspects of the cycle!

Lots of news and events did really happen into this market on 1 year time or span which its one of the contributors on why we are seeing these numbers now.",
