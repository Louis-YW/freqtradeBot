  "content": "I'm requesting a ban for user Snowshow due to violation of three forum rules. Specifically, ban evasion, troll posting and pointless talking. 1. Ban evasion.Snowshow is the person behind multiple accounts, one of which is already banned. Specifically: fxsurfer (banned), antikvark, Antithesis. Besides raising the same kind of \"issues\", such as \"Bitcoin has no value\", \"Satoshi lies\", \"Bitcoin doesn't exist\", \"Bitcoin exists to Satoshi's imagination\" etc., they also have similar writing style. Let me find some strong similarities that make a splash:Numbers in a database:Quote from: Snowshow on May 10, 2022, 12:24:36 PMBitcoin is a name that creates the illusion of asset. And thus, a scam. Those who are in the system are deceiving people by claiming they own asset or money while only name and numbers attributed to their addresses exist. That's why one can benefit only if new investors enter the system. Hence, classical investment scam.Quote from: Antithesis on February 01, 2022, 12:53:34 PMAnd now the questions: if I can purchase a picture of a sunset for a couple of bucks on Shutterstock and watch something aesthetically rich, why on Earth would I purchase number \"1\" for $37,000 and watch something aesthetically poor?Quote from: antikvark on September 10, 2019, 12:47:45 PMSo bitcoin is just a worthless number in a database that was smartly disguised as a real money and market instrument in order to lure the public to purchase it. And this is basically how investment scams operate. Every investment scam uses some worthless item that is disguised as something valuable to attract investors. In our case this item was a number in a database.Quote from: fxsurfer on March 07, 2019, 12:53:48 PMAlso, bitcoin is not a commodity. That's why bitcoin is NOT money. Bitcoin is just a fancy name for a DB entry.Satoshi Nakamoto fools the world:Quote from: Snowshow on March 15, 2022, 02:12:39 PMBut regardless, Nakamoto’s false claims fooled many people around the world and made them to invest in the system.Quote from: Antithesis on June 06, 2021, 08:10:33 AMNamely, an anonymous author called Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a computer program that sends quantity data to the virtual addresses of people who maintain a database with these quantities and addresses.Quote from: Antithesis on February 13, 2022, 07:30:15 AMWhat you all have in common is that you were fooled into believing that you participated in an economic transaction. But you didn't. An economic transaction is the exchange of ownerships.YouTube videos FTW:Quote from: SnowshowHere's a more detailed explanation of the discovery: https://youtu.be/AUvPzegOuZAQuote from: Antithesis on February 02, 2022, 02:25:48 PMBank notes or numbers on my banking account secure the capital that I invested in them because the borrowers are forced, via collateral, to use these notes or numbers to repay their loans. Here you have video explaining that: https://youtu.be/p37Wg6h2PJ4Or: https://youtu.be/aBl-O_3g_58Quote from: fxsurfer on February 06, 2018, 08:28:28 AMWhen I presented arguments like the one in the the video below, people just ignored them. Now, they will learn the hard way what it means to be a part of a Ponzi scheme.Bitcoin And Cryptocurrencies - Ponzi Schemes Dressed Up And Sold As Moneyhttps://youtu.be/gcNngl8fCUYQuote from: antikvark on April 06, 2020, 05:39:11 PMIn the below linked presentation, Bitcoin is exposed as a fake investment product, which as such, is a total waste of energy. This also applies to all cryptocurrencies. Why is bitcoin a fake investment product? Or, to put it another way, how do we even differentiate between real and fake ones. Well, it's easy. In a real investment product, your investment of property or work is invested into something actual, which in the future, can provide you similar benefit. In a fake investment product, your investment is not actually invested into something, but is rather, just transferred from you as a new investor to old investor. Historically, there is no exception to the rule that all such products end up collapsing.The rest here: https://youtu.be/N5RKm7_scL4Casino mania:Quote from: Antithesis on September 13, 2021, 05:26:44 PMFirst, any price of bitcoin above zero is infinitely expensive (price of bitcoin devided by zero redemption value gives infinity). Second, bitcoin is similar to a losing lottery ticket, to a stock of a bankrupt company, to a currency of a former county or to a casino token of a bankrupt casino.Quote from: Snowshow on March 23, 2022, 09:00:31 AMSo, if that guy Satoshi claims that the numbers that his system is writing down are coins than he is actually claiming that someone has the liability to redeem them. Like banks redeem their records via loan repayments, like casinos redeem their records (tokens), like retailers redeem their gift cards, or corporations their bonds. But no entity exists that has the liability to redeem the record next to addresses in Satoshi's system.Quote from: fxsurfer on March 07, 2019, 12:53:48 PMEven casino chips are form of money as they grant specific rights, i.e. - casinos are legally obligated to cash chips they issued. On the other hand, when numbers are added next to someone's virtual address in a DB called blockchain, NOBODY is legally obligated to cash these numbers or to exchange them for goods or services, which means that no right is granted by bitcoin.In fact, he's even reported of evading ban before. 2. Troll postingThis scumbag appears to annoy the Bitcoin Discussion board by making the same kind of posts wherein he reveals his completely lack of comprehension of the subject. No matter how many times we've debunked all these concerns he does did have, he'll just continue seeking for attention with the same nonsense; \"Bitcoin is a scam\", \"Bitcoin doesn't exist\", \"Bitcoin is Nakamoto's ponzi scheme\" etc. 3. Pointless discussionAs you might have understood so far, there's no point in having a conversation with him, because what he wants is to just make some noise so a few Internet strangers can take the time to engage with him. His furious behavior to create alts, just to be proved right, no matter the endless list of arguments we've used, proves it. In 19th this month, he made another thread: Bitcoins are Not Real — Or how People Blindly Accepted Nakamoto's Nonsense. Can we just give an end to this drama?",

Snowshow, antikvark, Antithesis, fxsurfer they are all here to campaign against bitcoin. And the leader of them all is Snowshow. If Snowshow and his accounting farming accounts are here speaking bad on bitcoin, he or she is doing worst in real life. So the best option for him as for me is to ban and delete all the accounts related to the user. Why I said delete because if it is banned the user name can still be seeing in the forum software but if it is deleted, just like it has been rooted from the forum so there will be no trace. And the drama he or she is performing will be no where to be found. It is good to move it to off topic but people would still see it there because sometime we go there to read some trash and to got information. Snowshow who is the spearheaded leader of the drama group should be ban. Because he did not understand bitcoin and he his not here to learn.",

Evil points get added to your IP address and similar ranges if you do some \"evil\". Remember that we had those cases in the Croatian section where it was reported that friends of our local community members couldn't register because their newly-created accounts got evil points assigned to them? That happened despite them never having used Bitcointalk before. That's also one of the reasons why we have some users who can now whitelist accounts that have been branded as evil.I don't think IPs get banned here because many people use VPNs and TOR.
