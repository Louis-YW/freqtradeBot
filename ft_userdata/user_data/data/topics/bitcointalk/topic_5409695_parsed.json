Bitcoin is pseudonymous, so there really isn't much way to know unless they publicly disclose their positions (which they obviously wont, because it's obviously not a good idea).",

Quote from: Anonohmon on August 13, 2022, 04:05:46 AMOr have pretty much all of the ancient whales touched an exchange or cashed out? No one way to know that. Most of the bitcoin addresses that you see that doesn't have its contents moved for a long time can easily be assumed as an 'early adopter' wallet, although there are also a good number of those untouched addresses that may no longer be accessible. You can always get a good guesstimate, but unless one such whale confirms that he/she is still active and still is a whale at this point, you will never know who are the ones that are still around.",

It depends upon individual users and the time they sold their coins and through which medium, if you are planning to sell huge number of coins now a days, you need to verify your KYC with a centralized authority to carry on with the transaction now a days, but if you are planning to sell small amounts you can use DEX to trade without worrying about verifying anything. Things are changing with time and in the future we might be forced to carry on verification even for small amounts.",

Having cashed out2. Having lost their access to wallets3. Some have possibly (god forbid) left us, without informing their next-in-kin about their bitcoin holdings.The maximum I see about such whales is sudden news articles about some bitcoin whale address moving funds - this is a nice method to generate a lot of FUD and eventual market drop in bitcoin price, it is safe to ignore these news articles and stay away from trading for a few days surrounding such events.",

Unfortunatelly, I was wrong XD On the actuall topic, recently I watched a docu with a hacker Gummo on the Soft White Underbelly channel where he talks about early BTC mining and amount he was able to acumulate in the early days, and honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if there were a lot more like him that mayve only tuched a small percentage of their accumulation.",

And are now moving the markets buying and selling. Is that still a thing or not? I guess when bitcoin becomes an asset, store of value or even currency, the narrative has change. And then there are world financial bodies that want to control it, imposing KYC's. So yeah, that thing is gone already.Quote from: Anonohmon on August 13, 2022, 04:05:46 AMOr have pretty much all of the ancient whales touched an exchange or cashed out? Maybe some of them haven't touch their bitcoin or cash it out. Others may have done it in succession every bull run, like in 2017 or 2021. Or some may have totally lost their access already, like this guy: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/uk-man-makes-last-ditch-effort-to-recover-lost-bitcoin-hard-drive.html",

We don’t know exactly if this wallets is really permanently or recoverable.This data can be determine easily using glassnode analysis but since it needs premium access to view chart. It will be hard to determine exact numbers of whale wallet that has no activity for a long time.",
