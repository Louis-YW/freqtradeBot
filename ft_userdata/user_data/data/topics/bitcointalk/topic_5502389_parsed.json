  "content": "Any experts in quantum computing kicking around? I've managed to develope some interesting quantum algorithms around bitcoin. Right now nothing too breaking but I've significantly reduced the search space for a valid header. On historical data it is crazy efficient. There is still work to do on live blocks.Recently I have turned my attention to the 1000btc puzzle. I was able to examine the current data and discern a pattern. So I created a quantum machine learning algorithms to translate the pattern into usable information. Here is the thing, I'm still in the process of converting the features and target to their quantum states, but as I continue to do so it's becoming readily apparent that the algorithm used to generate the puzzle describes perfectly the evolution of a quantum system. Was this intentional? An accident? Some form of mastery of some brach of mathematics that was so complete they were able to describe a perfect working of the fundemental nature of our universe? Or did they do this on purpose?I thought my algorithms were a decade ahead of the competition, but now I'm wondering if it's possible there is another me out there somewhere. Anyway I'd love to make a new Quantum friend. Also stay tuned to this account. I'm days away from solving the puzzle. History is in the making.",

      "body": "Hello Qstar, when I read the title of the thread I was thinking it would be Just another topic about how quantum computers representa a risk of the bitcoin encryption. But after reading it i linked the focus.I have to say there is no parten in the puzzle of the 1000 btc, in the past I try to find a partern with Mach√≠n learning, trying to make a linear regression, but my R was away from 1. I didn't do it with quantum computing but I understand what are you talking about.The address of the puzzle were renerated random in the rank between x and y. So, bruteforce is the only way to solve the puzzle.",

Assuming it's truly a decade ahead, you could either make a fortune by patenting it or advance scientific by sharing the algorithm publicly.",
