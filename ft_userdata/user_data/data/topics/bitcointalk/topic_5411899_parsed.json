  "content": "There's a new blockchain network called \"Dogechain\" which aims to bring the world of \"De-Fi\" into Dogecoin. It's sort of like a sidechain living on Polygon (MATIC) with its own token for TX fees (dubbed DC). Existing DOGE holders can use the \"bridge\" to convert DOGE into DC and gain access to \"De-Fi\". Some people are saying Dogechain is a scam, especially when most of the tokens are allocated to the development team. The chain is fairly new to the world, so we should give it some time to see what happens.What do you think about Dogechain? It is a good investment? If not, why? Do you think it's a good idea to bring smart contracts to Dogecoin? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

After rejection by doge coin CEO and that makes doge coin has no affiliation with doge coin anymore. The chance to become second layer solution has gone.It might've been created with the purpose of enriching developers themselves. The token allocation tells us that the project should be taken with a grain of salt. I don't get what the hype is all about, when anyone can create a separate chain using Polygon's SDK. What matters is what real use cases the project provides that would make it unique among its competitors. \"Meme\" coins have made a lot of \"buzz\" ever since Elon Musk shilled the Dogecoin project, so we should expect the unexpected.One thing for sure is that the vast majority of projects are nothing more than pure cash grabs. That's why you should do your own research before deciding to invest into a new cryptocurrency project with your hard-earned money. Who knows if Dogechain (DC) won't last for long? Just my thoughts",

It was called \"wDOGE\" but now they just call it \"DOGE,\" which is pretty misleading, but then again so are most aspects of this project.DC is the \"utility token\" of the network, separate from wDOGE. As with all other tokens on its platform it is only good for pump n dumps.Quote from: X-ray on September 02, 2022, 02:30:08 AMAfter rejection by doge coin CEO and that makes doge coin has no affiliation with doge coin anymore. Heh, that was Billy Markus, co-creator of Dogecoin, that rejected the offer. There is no Dogecoin CEO. And it never actually had an affiliation with Dogecoin... it just tries to convince people that it does.In short, I recommend staying away from it. If the economy doesn't tank during the rest of the year, now might be the perfect time to pick up the real $DOGE. Can't say the same for $DC -- it is unproven and my belief is its only a matter of time before their bridge is compromised.",

Well, as a joke network, you can use it of course, but take it as a full-fledged player in the world of smart contracts? Never. If this network will start, then it's possible, that all sorts of nft projects and marketplaces will grow on this blockchain, where they will try to trade this garbage",

Even if they will work closely with DOGE they still have no right to use that name especially if there’s no agreement between two parties. I will also avoid this one because I know how this project will end, this can be a more useless project that wont survive the bear market.",

It shows us developers only created the chain with the sole purpose of filling their pockets with money. I'm not surprised because I've seen such schemes ever since I've joined the crypto/Blockchain revolution. Newcomers will totally go \"rekt\" if they keep pumping money into Dogechain hoping the token will soar all the way to the moon. But veteran crypto users like myself, will think twice before investing into anything which claims to be the \"next big thing\" in crypto. The \"meme\" coin hype hasn't ended yet, so it's going to take a while before we see \"shit projects\" fade away into oblivion.Ultimately, people will decide which coins to support and which ones to abandon. As long as governments do their job in hunting scammers, there should be nothing to worry about. Just my opinion",

The way tokens were distributed among developers, tells us exactly what's going on behind the scenes. Yet, most people will fall prey to this scheme as they're willing to make a quick buck. They think just because Dogecoin was a huge success, the same will happen with other meme-themed projects. I'm afraid many investors will go \"rekt\" with this new token (DC) once developers run away with the money. Scams will continue to affect this industry until regulators weigh in.At least, there are many of options to choose from in this ever-growing industry. Always remember to do your own research about the project you're willing to invest, and you'll avoid many troubles in the long run. As long as you don't invest more than what you can't afford to lose, there should be nothing to worry about. Just my opinion",
