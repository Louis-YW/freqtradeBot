A single scam attempt is enough to destroy the years of reputation you have built, so if you scam and there is evidence labelled against you, that's the beginning of your trust failure from customers and the community.Why should a company jeopardize its reputation when they stand to earn a lot from the trust they have built over time? There is nothing positive about scams, just look at 1xbit company and how worthless they have become on the forum, everyone fears them, including their banner.",

But I just hope that the casino can solve the problem soon and explain what really happened and if indeed the gambler can win a certain amount of money, then the casino should allow the gambler to withdraw the money. It is the casino's responsibility to gamblers who can win big money. It could be that the accusation is due to a misunderstanding between the casino to the gambler or vice versa.",

If a gambling site is reputable on this forum and one of its users come up here with an accusation in a way the betting site wants to scam or cheat him, I think this would be resolved by the casino site because the gambling site will not want to lose its reputation. If the scam is legit and proven true, people that rated the site positive will likely change it to negative if the case is not resolved in favour of the victim.",

Doesn't mean their reputation would be completely gone, if they've been operating for years, this could be a result of mismanagement or dropping the ball rather than malicious intent. However, I do find that certain gambling companies seem to play on their terms of service a lot, and they've written it in such a way that it can pretty much get them out of any situation they find themselves in. There's been a few examples of this with the big fiat operating gambling sites, where they've actually been taken to court, and lost.",

They are not allowed to deny the withdrawal if the winning is legitimate and doesn't violates any of their terms.",

At least on this forum, one legitimate accusation is enough to make certain DT members give the casino a negative rating. Although, people with no complaints about the casino will continue to patronize it. If a casino doesn’t have a track record of disproving any and all allegations against them, it’s simply impossible to give them a good rating.",

Reputation means the casino doesn't have any existing legit scam accusation. Many casinos fall victim to this, especially when paying the players who won a huge jackpot prize. I think we know already what casino you are pertaining but their reputation will loss unless they solved the case since DT system here is fair and just.There's no need for for more complicated discussion here because the answer will be too obvious no matter how huge the reputation of this said casino.",

Every casino and sportsbook should be fully honest about their processes, but just like players can make mistakes - it can even happen on the company side too. I would say it definitely takes a pattern of bad behaviour and many complaints from a variety of players to identify a bad company. Individual complaints can be complicated and the person complaining sometimes leave out significant facts when presenting their case and due to privacy restrictions the sportsbook might not be able to show all the facts either.",

We all know how reputations and trust work, it's not just in casinos, it's literally how it works on everything. Trust is something REALLY hard to build up but if it's properly done, then you can rest assured it'd be steady, but if a crack forms, then that crack will stay and get worse over time, slowly destroying everything. No need for any discussion, if they fail to resolve it or just straight up ignored it, then that's a red mark for their reputation.",

Actually here in online it's not that easy, but with the help of google, all websites that has negative feedbacks is visible tbh. Even you make a simple research about scams websites or platforms you can get a list easily . and also with the help of some websites that listing scam platforms it's so easy to terminate as long as all the feedbacks is valid and many people are reporting it, surely they will put reg tag on it.",

I don't doubt a casino will do it especially if they've become a trusted one by the community.But if from the beginning they already tried scamming, its hard to build by admitting they've made mistake like the 1xbit.
