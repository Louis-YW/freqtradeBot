To prove that some sellers are using alts, you will have to provide some evidence of it (which won't be easy). Least you can do is to report couple of posts (explain why exactly you are reporting them) and see whether they get deleted.",

Is there any way to put a check on this ? Apart from it being unethical leaving positive review(s) on personal thread(s) with an alt, I don't think it's even an issue bumping one's thread with an alt. Alts are frown at when there's a motif to cheat or circumvent a process as it would be when leaving positive reviews judging with this alleged case, otherwise it shouldn't matter. Beyond that, I don't know why anyone would want to bump their thread with an alt when they can do it from their original account. All one has to do is just make sure it's at least 24hrs before repeating the bump by also deleting their previous. However, OP, if you notice an abuse of this process; report it to a moderator by hitting the link on the down right side of the post. It's that easy.",

Having a hunch that the accounts are connected or operated by the same individual is not enough to be considered evidence. It could in reality be different people who have decided to partner up and bump each other's threads. It will be difficult to prove it's the same person if they are careful.
