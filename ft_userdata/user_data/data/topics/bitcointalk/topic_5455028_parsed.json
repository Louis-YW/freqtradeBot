The block was mined by a single miner, but I was thinking that how a solo miner could possibly do that in current difficulty? Either the miner is rich enough to have very high hash rate that he/she doesn't need a pool for mining of a block or it can be purely a sign of luck. Because as we all know that the difficulty changes every 2 weeks, and that might be helpful for solo miners if it reduces sometimes.Someone with proper knowledge about it should clear out my mind that how is that possible? And, what's probability for a solo miner to mine a block in current difficulty level. Even in current difficultly level a solo miner with 7524 TH/s hash rate would require almost a year to mine a block. I have checked that using Cryptocompare Bitcoin mining calculator, but I'm not sure if that is correct in the calculation or not. Can someone please reply with a proper answer to clear my doubts about this?",

He only had 8.3 TH of hashrate, which was around 0.000004% of the total hashrate at the time. This means he had a 1 in 25 million chance of successfully finding a block. At an average of 144 blocks a day, it would have taken him ~476 years to be successful. Yet he found a block.",

That guy was truly lucky because it's almost unbelievable that a person could find a block with that low hash rate. It's really inspiring to know that, and thanks a lot for sharing that information. I'm sure that many people will get inspired by that because if someone with 0.000004% chance can find a block then anyone who's lucky enough can find a block with low hash rate.I must say that such people are truly one in billions and are among the luckiest people of the world. I think there might be few more such cases, but even this one proves that luck really works, and even a miner could be lucky enough like the one in that example.",
