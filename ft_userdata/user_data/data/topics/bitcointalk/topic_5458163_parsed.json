I think this KYC of a thing should be optional. It has nothing to do with being unfair. It is a normal policy for all exchanges to ask for KYC before using their platform but KuCoin was lenient enough to allow users engage in other services without KYC. They just want to step up and operate like other exchanges and it shouldn’t be something of great concern since we all know what centralized exchanges are known for.Talking about their security, they’re undoubtedly good at securing funds that’s not a guarantee to totally depend on centralized exchanges for your savings.",
