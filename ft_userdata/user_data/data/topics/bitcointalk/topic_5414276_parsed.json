To start off, I have personal information in two almost identical books.I used the wrong book, couldn't log in because of that error. I tried resetting for my password, multiple times and that didn't work to help me get access to my account. I am asking for assistance to get back into my account. I even tried using my old password but since I tried resetting password a couple times, the password I was using wouldn't work. So I'm locked out of my account mostly because I used the wrong book to find my password and the information wasn't there. Do you have any suggestions or could you help me get back into my account with the password I started out with?Please help! I hope you understand my situation. I just want to get back in with my original password.Thank youfor your assistance.",

So, follow the top message on that thread, and that should be able to get you in as long as you try to include as much information as possible to how it happened. I'm also assuming there's a language barrier, and that's why the confusion. I'm assuming since this is in Meta, that it's indeed a Bitcointalk, and it would somewhat make sense with it being locked in that case. Are you provided with a email address by any chance when you hit the error? If not, you'll have to email the recovery email in that thread I've linked.",

I just want to get back in with my original password.Thank youfor your assistance.If you can tell us a little more information about what account you're talking about, then I'm sure you'll get the answer right from the start. But if you see this, tell me what account you want to recover.I don't want to guess, but it looks like the account you're referring to is a bitcointalk account. Try resetting your password via email and clicking the link sent to your email to set a new password. But you can only do that if you use an active email in your forum account. But first, complete your information when asking for help so as not to cause confusion.Can someone of you tell me why the search feature via email to find members in this forum is disabled?",

An email address should be 'secret', except it is a throw-away email address, and any email address used to register on this forum isn't a throw-away email, users' can either reset their passwords through it, and on the other hand, can be hacked through it if compromised, thus the forum shouldn't have any reason to enable search via email, so users' do not naively give out their email address for any reason, except to the forum administration.",

This could lead to users randomly running through public emails, to know if it has a match on the forum.",

I agree that many people care deeply about privacy and security. Email is a contact one of your contacts where someone might take advantage of some of your vulnerabilities to hack and test how well you secure yourself via email. I know some users might display an email in their account but I'm sure it's not an active email so they shouldn't be afraid of phishing attempts or anything like that. So it's appropriate that email should be hidden by default in every forum account, unless the user displays it.",
