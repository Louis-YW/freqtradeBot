Spamming with many messages all over the telegram or Twitter we only bother the community managers and moderator to ban those bot continuously I don't respect this kind of service this is the kind of service that scammers are using, a good project doesn't need this kind of service its spamming, and I don't support and block groups that add me or I get messages from people or bots about certain projects if a project is serious in promoting their project they can launch a bounty campaign and delegate task to human instead of bots, it's very annoying to see in a legit telegram groups bots that send you random messages about projects that has nothing to do with the groups you are in.",

Either case, a total waste of money.I agree they may have upgraded or added new features but it's still the same spamming and shilling service those ICO back then are using, there's a big difference between shilling your project through bots and branding your project through natural means and people don't trust bots seeing a company promoted that way, we want real people talking about good projects because of their experiences on that project, one good testimonial is better than 100 shilling bots.",
