All that matters is that this is an emerging market that Bitcoin is still used as an indicator and therefore its price movement is followed by the prices of alternative cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, not all altcoins move according to the movement of the bitcoin price as if they are chasing it, but there are currencies whose price sometimes takes an upward trend when the price of bitcoin is going down. There is no official rule for price movement except the law of supply and demand, which is still relatively affected by Bitcoin.",

BTC's algorithm has nothing to do with price, mate. Currently, the capitalization of bitcoin still accounts for most of the market that you can see on coinmaketcap, the capitalization of bitcoin is more than 400 billion and the capitalization of the entire crypto market is $943 billion, this is not a small cap, it is ~50% of the market cap. So it's no surprise that all altcoins are dependent on bitcoin's price reaction.Perhaps there will come a time when this dependence will be reduced, when the market grows stronger like stocks or forex, things will gradually change.",

You should know years ago, altcoins have trading pairs with Bitcoin as their first ones. Before appearance of stable coins, Bitcoin >< altcoins, Bitcoin >< fiat currency, altcoin >< fiat currency.Nowadays, in crypto market, you have stable coins and altcoins have lot of trading pairs with different stable coins (USDT, USDC, etc.) and pairs between 2 altcoins such as ERC-20 token with Ethereum ETH. The domination and significant effect of Bitcoin is there.Importantly, Bitcoin is the biggest cryptocurrency in marketcap so it is natural to see it affects and leads the market. Same with stock market, blue-chip stocks lead stock market.Historical snapshot at 28 April 2013: https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20130428/",

But the problem is that there is no better coin than Bitcoin so altcoins also tend to decline when good coins like Bitcoin start to fall. There are two things that make Bitcoin always strong in its influence in the market;1. Bitcoin Dominance in Crypto Market CapThe fundamental reason behind altcoins following Bitcoin is because the price of altcoins is usually measured in Bitcoins. These pioneering crypto assets may be flanked by more than 3,000 competitors, but still account for more than half of the entire crypto asset market cap. This dominance of the crypto market gives Bitcoin a lot of influence and control.2. Bitcoin is the Reserve Currency for TransactionsAccording to Blockchain.com, there are now more than 18 million Bitcoins in circulation in the crypto asset market globally. Meanwhile, in terms of market capitalization, CoinMarketCap data notes that Bitcoin's dominance continues to decline, and is now at 46 percent of the overall market.When there is an increased outflow of Bitcoin from the largest exchanges in the industry, investors tend to see this as a positive sign for the cryptocurrency.This is because investors predict Bitcoin is entering an accumulation phase, which means a bull market may be imminent. This confidence can flow into competing altcoins and benefit the cryptocurrency market more broadly. Source: pluang.com",
