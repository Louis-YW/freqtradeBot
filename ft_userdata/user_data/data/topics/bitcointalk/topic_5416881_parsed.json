You are not a financial operator, but just a company registered in an offshore jurisdiction without any license in the financial field. Doing any business activity involving currency exchange without a license already makes you an illegal service. Note that just having a registered company doesn't give you a legal permission to perform such business.I would argue about your statement on Tornado Cash, because they aren't an illegal service comparing with yours, since you are violating far more laws by operating a financial service without an appropriate license.Without a license for the activity you are performing and being an illegal service you are not required to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, thus, the following term of yours makes absolutely no sense:Quote4.2.
