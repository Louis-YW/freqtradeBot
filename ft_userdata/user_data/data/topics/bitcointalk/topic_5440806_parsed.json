Tokenomics and automated incentives make Exorde an ultra-reactive data network, the first of its kind.The protocol produces data that feeds into e-reputation measurement data products. Exorde processes more than 90 million unique URLs per day through a robust infrastructure based on SKALE, IPFS and Filecoin. Exorde already processes more transactions than Polygon and Ethereum today.Exorde's code is transparent, all transactions are public and the data it provides is stored publicly on Filecoin. The first and only Web3 BigData analysis project with a simple EXD utility token driving supply and demand. Exorde is an information processing machine/protocol. Clients pay the network to collect, retrieve, and analyze information about the sites/topics they want. The processing power of the Exorde protocol is constantly auctioned via its token to the highest bidder, and the Exorde network prioritizes the highest bids.EXD is a true utility that truly captures the demand side of the data economy.
