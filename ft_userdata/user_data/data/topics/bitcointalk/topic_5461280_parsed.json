FedNow is an instant payment service developed by the Federal Reserve for depository institutions in the United States, which allows individuals and businesses to send and receive money.So I saw this and I see nobody talking about it, so I reckon people either do not know about it or it is not seen as a potential threat to Bitcoin. (Yes, I know it is focused only at the US, but I reckon it will branch out to the rest of the world soon.. or they will link to it) Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedNowI think this is something that are worthy of a discussion and I want to know if you see this as a threat or real competition to Bitcoin and other Crypto currencies?

      "body": "It is a copycat or an imitation of the Bitcoin payment system. The peer-to-peer system is been replaced with account-to-account (A2A) transactions. It also seeks to remove middlemen in the banking system, imitating the decentralization feature of Bitcoin. But I don't see it as a threat to Bitcoin because it is nothing but a fiat payment system. It is not even a blockchain technology and is highly centralized. The only difference is that transaction time will be faster than normal and It also promises to be effective at all times throughout the year. The US is not the first country to adopt this payment system as it has been available in some European nations, Canada, and even India and it has not limited Bitcoin growth in these nations. People that place importance on their privacy and freedom will always choose the original payment system.",

Because I found if they want to opt out the instant app feature then they need to in Fed network which makes it as a middle man like one for all just eliminated the bank but its not sustainable and sine you mentioned that it is already implemented even in countries like India where the operation cost is higher and customers are forced to pay lot of hidden charges which many of them don't like.So. IMO it is not even close to be considered as a potential threat to bitcoin cause imagining the FedNow instant to kick in different parts of world it would take huge infrastructure as well as few decades.",

QuoteFedNow is expected to be more widely available and easier to use than the RTP network and allow participating financial institutions to send and receive payments with each other directly, eliminating the need for intermediaries such as the clearinghouse.https://laporte.com/knowledgecenter/financial-services/financial-services-update-fednow-banking-results-reinsurance-disruption",

This news is not new, and I think everyone knows about it and people don't care about it because it is still a centralized system run by the government. So it cannot compete with or harm bitcoin. For me, only if there is a completely decentralized and safer system, faster than bitcoin, that's when bitcoin lovers like us need to worry. Also, no matter how many new payment and currency systems are created but still under government control, a centralized system, they are not comparable to bitcoin.",

It can't be a threat to BTC when it doesn't solve any of the problems that BTC solves. FedNow is an instant payment system, BTC transactions are confirmed ~ 10 minutes on average, BTC is a currency, FedNow is a payment service, FedNow is a threat to other payment services like Cash App, Paypal, Venmo, etc and not BTC.FedNow is not a bad service for Americans that want to use an instant payment service, and it is not in competition with BTC because they have different use cases, BTC is for people that want a decentralized currency that is permissionless and censorship resistant, it isn't for people who want to make payments instantly.",

Lets not forget about the reversibility of such \"instant transfers\" in the centralized world.Do they actually transfer any money from one bank account to another account in a same bank system and external bank system?What they transfer is a number which has no value. Surely they can do it instantly but if their bank collapses, the number of money we have in a bank account has no value and becomes useless.Quote from: Husires on July 28, 2023, 09:01:05 AMCBDCs are not a threat to Bitcoin because it still has the same characteristics as cash, which is peer-to-peer payment, but in a digital form with complete centralization, the possibility of knowing your balance, the possibility of freezing your funds and a lot of things that may make a pass to become an alternative to cash very difficult in democratic countries. if there is success in launching such currencies, there will be a logical reason for using Bitcoin, but I do not expect that to happen during the next few years.Agree with you.Why people always see threats, enemies but I see bank transfers, CBDC transfer, Bitcoin transactions will be used in a society. Bitcoin is not a threat for fiat currencies, CBDCs or bank system. Banks, CBDCs are not threats of Bitcoin.When they see others as threats, enemies, they will have bad responses with each other.",
