  "content": "Before each game, players and officials took a knee to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Sky Sports commentators wore pins to show their support for the movement, and people talked more openly about racism in football. This doesn't mean that this solved the problem of racism in society as a whole, because of course it didn't. Still, it showed again how powerful football can be in politics.Politics and football are so intertwined that it is impossible to separate them. It has always been. Politics haven't been added to football recently. It has been the place where political and social issues have been played out over and over again, for better or for worse.During the 1970s and 1980s, football grounds were one of the most obvious places where racism was still alive and well in Britain. The rise of hooliganism also showed that some people were unhappy with society as a whole.Because football is so popular, it shows society and its problems in a way that few other things do. Because it is so well-known, it could be a strong voice for change, like Black Lives Matter.Marcus Rashford most recently used this voice to support free school meals. The 23-year-old forward has been very vocal about how he doesn't agree with the government's plans to cut off provision during school breaks.People who say politics shouldn't be in football only say this about things they don't want to deal with. Because football is so popular, any issue it takes on gets a lot of attention. Most of the time, this doesn't seem to be a big deal. Football often backs campaigns about prostate cancer, men's mental health, and the rainbow laces campaign, which wants to make the sport more welcoming to LGBT people.Do you think that politics and football should be separate?",

My views as to politics and sports brings me to a point of dishonest practices where some players could be favoured more than others as per figuring in a game, where referees seems to give the home base team a chance to lead, where players of clubs origin are rationed to have more playing time as opposed to others despite qualifications and fitness.Although, in the context you've raised which I see to be more of societal ills, football as a sport and sports in general is one solution to them. It doenst matter that athletes are there to compete but, it showcases the talents in them races, generates income for a course, teach reasons to why what should be what and harmonises the people. Sports and football in particular is doing a lot to correcting certain societal ills and should be left that way.",

However, in reality, there is so many cases that politics affect the result or the fair of sport.",

Politics games are the most decisive game you ever know because your friend today will become your enemy tomorrow just because of their ambition to become the highest rank of all.",

The view is to have the countries players having more minutes in competitive club football. Football has been used to hault even wars in the past. We can't take politics outta football and sport but it should be reduce to the barest minimum, so as not to take away the fun",
