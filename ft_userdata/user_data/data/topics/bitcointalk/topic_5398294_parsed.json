  "content": "There's no gainsaying that there's panic everywhere. Some people have likened the 2022 Bitcoin and crypto market crash to watching their house getting burnt down. And at this moment, it doesn't matter whether you invested $100 or $1000 in the market, everyone is feeling the heat. Today, I woke up feeling sober. I was thinking deeply about how much stress, anxiety, depression, and the toll the recent market crash has on the mental health of those who in the crypto community. I also thought about what strategies people are using to cope with the loss. For me, practicing gratitude is my number one go-to-coping strategy. So, every morning, I look in the mirror and say aloud three(3) things that I am most grateful for. Today 12th May 2022, I am most grateful for:1- The gift of Life: So long as I am alive, I have hope for recovery, regardless of how much I lost.2- Family: I have received so much love and support from them in past few days.3- Roof over my head: I have lost so much but at least, I still have a roof over my head. What are your strategies for coping with the Bitcoin and crypto market crash?",

For someone who has 100% of their savings invested in Bitcoin or any altcoins, such moments are without a doubt a real tragedy, although it is an even greater tragedy if they sell everything they have and thus make a real loss.Quote from: Davidvictorson on May 12, 2022, 10:34:29 AMWhat are your strategies for coping with the Bitcoin and crypto market crash? My strategy is to be fully aware that I can lose everything at any moment, and when something bad happens it doesn’t affect me like you or some other people. This is not the first or last time something like this has happened, and it would be good for people to learn something from it all. The things you mentioned are really much more important in life than the price of Bitcoin, which will soar again in the future. We may have to wait for that until the next halving, it may happen sooner - but the fact is that after every similar situation Bitcoin will be even stronger.",

You can also get headache and heart attacks in worst time. I don't want anyone to get health issues because failure in investment but it is what traders and speculators have to carry in their lives.Bitcoin is good one for investment, deflationary, decentralized and you have your keys to protect your coins. Nobody can seize your bitcoin it they can not have access to your wallet or your account on exchanges; or can freeze your Bitcoin in your wallet (non custodial wallet)",

If you are new to the crypto environment, one can easily get affected mentally during times like this where the market crashes. One thought to console self with is that - \"you are not alone\", the market situation is in no way a fault of yours or a result of your actions, so you don't have to get depressed about it. You are not the only one being affected, so you have to be strong. Worrying about something you cannot change is futile.Your strategy at this point is to take calculated actions to try and mitigate the losses for the now. It is a temporary market situation and that should give you hope as well.",

As you garner more experience in the market, you grow thicker skin such that when the market plummets you don't even bat an eyelid . However, I am still curious to know how were able to deal with the emotions you felt at the time when you experienced your first bitcoin/ crypto market crash?",

We will keep fighting until we are dead, this market crash is nothing to what we have experienced, we can still hope for a brighter future while we are still breathing.I am very thankful to have a wonderful family, they support me in times of lost, not just in times of ease. You know sometimes you can really see who are the people that loves you the most when yo are in distressed.A nice and humble home is enough, if there are more to come why not. There are people around the world that doesn't have a home to live in. Good thing I am not only into Crypto currencies, we have our own real jobs and thankfully we are in still good standing.

If you did not cash out, you have not lost is what I believe, in the morning when I woke up it was around -10% and then right now it's around -7% which means that there is still hope! Bitcoin is definitely showing signs of crash some people are also saying it's *price correction* but I do think it's just few factors which we will get over soon enough. 1. Fed rates increase 2. Stock sell off 3. Extreme inflation We have already learned how it is not easy to wait but if you are patience then at the end of the day you would be able to navigate through the whole market. Trading is also the option as well but it's better to hold and wait and resist selling.",

Anyway, the best strategy to cope with this so-called market crash is to continue believing in the crypto industry, particularly in Bitcoin because it already happened before and in the end, the result was still the same. Bitcoin will always recover with flying colors.",

I can't even imagine how those people that invested on top are feeling right now, let alone those that do leveraged trading and have had their positions liquidated. And while we're at it, let us also think how awful those people that have used money that they could not afford to lose and really lost it must be feeling right now. No wise or great quotes out there would be able to erase the pain, the self blame and disappointment that most are currently experiencing in a bearish season such as this one. But yes, there are ways to reduce these negative feelings making what you mentioned a part of those ways. Another one of them is acceptance which makes grief pass faster. Of course, this is only true to myself and may not work for everyone since not everyone are having the same experiences as the other. Heck, there may be some people that have lost everything.",
