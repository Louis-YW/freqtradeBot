I have seen video cards with a non-working cooling system, where there is no gas, and repair is impossible.And some users may not know that this is a video card problem, and they will not receive a discount?",

Many tech companies do this.Cisco was notorious for buying their unsold products at retail for the sole purpose of destroying them to prevent them from being sold to anyone else.I'm surprised the 3060ti is included in the buyback as it's the newest available in it's class. I thought they'd wait for the 4060ti to be out.I'm not in UK but I have a couple of cards on the list would trade.",

They are just the promoters of the promotion.I'm sure they are working with a company that will check and validate the cards sent, according to the established criteria. Afterwards, this company will recycle the equipment or recondition it. Hence it is very difficult to know what will happen, if it is not said directly.",

It's been done before where a company buys back and destroys their unsold stock so they can sell more of their new stock at higher prices.This seems like a variation with the same purpose.Nvidia doesn't sell many anyway so it's more attractive for the OEMs to do it.Edit: If Nvidia had such a promotion, regardless of the disposition of the returned cards, the OEMs would be screaming. The main reason EVGA droppedGPUs is because Nvidia sell directly and compete with them.",
