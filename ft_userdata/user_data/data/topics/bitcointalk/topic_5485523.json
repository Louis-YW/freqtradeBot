With your post history I just finds it hard to buy your story any more. Politely op for your knowledge I suppose there are two Bitcoins ATMs in Nigeria Op well I live in Lagos so there is one over there in my area is presently at 1 Dazey Lounge Lagos Nigeria You can take a look at it on the map hereWell their dedication rate is too high well when I got there I bought a Bitcoin worth 100$ and the gas fee I was to pay was close to 20$. But most said if one is lucky they can charge 10$ or 15$ what they said but for me, I don't believe that.Quote from: PytagoraZ on February 18, 2024, 12:38:37 AMIt's just an image taken from Google.

Certainly, this is not yet popular here in my country and it can take maybe another decade before I can see one in at least some major cities or locations. I too am looking forward to see it and so some transaction with it. I am just wondering: is it just like a normal ATM where you need a card to be able to withdraw some cash? I am hoping that you did make video with the whole thing so we can see some semblance of that actual beast in action. The only problem am seeing is that many operators of Bitcoin ATM are reportedly not doing a profitable business so that is why this is not growing a lot.",

      "body": "The first time I ever used a bitcoin ATM was in Japan, back in 2019 when there still were some ATMs. It was surprisingly easy and I got the coins real quick. The fee was also still \"ok\" compared to later experiences in other countries and ATMs.Back then I paid like 6% in fees which of course is not low but also below standard, at least in Asia.In Taiwan I used ATMs a lot to get money for living expenses and so on, because my credit card ran out of time and I was basically stuck there until Japan reopens the border (covid time).The fees though have been horrendous. At the first ATM I used in Taipei the fee was like 15-18% for buying, and similar for selling.And 1 time I sold a little bit of btc for around 400$, which was around 12000NT$ local currency. For some reason the ATM was out of \"big bills\", 1000NT$ is the biggest common bill, so it gave me 120 100NT$ bills. That was quite stressful and took a long time cause the bills came out one by one.Lucky I later found a much better ATM which had better fees, but still around 10%   . And for some reason all ATMs stopped buying btc and just sold (as well as other currencies), that was quite annoying.",

I'm not aware if there is one already in our country, and if there is, it might be far from my location or only available in the capital.Hi OP, can you provide additional details or evidence to support your claims, such as a picture of yourself at the ATM or a transaction receipt?Anyway,  I found this typical process on the internet for using a Bitcoin ATM:1. Verification: Some machines require some form of identity verification. This could be a simple SMS verification or even ID scan in some cases.2. Provide Bitcoin Address: You’ll need to enter your Bitcoin address, usually by scanning the QR code from your digital wallet.3. Insert Cash: Insert the amount of cash for which you want to buy Bitcoins.4. Confirm Operation: Confirm the operation and check your Bitcoin wallet for the new balance.It’s always a good idea to be aware of the fees before making a transaction; fees can vary greatly depending on the Bitcoin ATM provider.",
