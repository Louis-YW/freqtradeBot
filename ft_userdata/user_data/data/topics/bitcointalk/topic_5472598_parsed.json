This is what you are asking if I understand your post well. A fund part reserved for emergency is to make sure you will have enough money to use, when your investment is in a bad status such as Bitcoin is in a bear market that usually lasts two or three years",

And that’s why whenever you’re investing into anything one of the fundamental principles is to have a mapped out risk management plans. If you read posts of experienced investors or traders they will tell you to invest what you can afford to lose and also have an emergency plan to turn on to. Personally I have hit rock bottom in some situations before and I somehow have to pause a little and retract my former decisions, if they are experts i engage them in the talk and see maybe they have encountered such blow and what they did to come out of it. There also people that prefers to stick to there plan because they believe that it will be the only way to help them gain more experience and knowledge but for me most at times I pause a little and then re strategize This belongs to economic board,",

But the difference between plan B and the initial plan is that is does not follow the rigorous structure of plan A but at least you won't lose. For me, things have been working as planned but not in my investment life cause I do have one yet but certainly will get one soon. Every of my plans that has fallen in place as planned did not just work as sort of a miracle, it is as a result of consistency, firstly what I do personally, is to write down this plans a book according to how I want to achieve them. Next is to type or write it on a carbon paper  of different colors. The colors are representing how soon I need to achieve it, then the last color is always \"green\" meaning I have achieved it already with this conviction in me. I then parse it on my notice board, which is directly facing my bed. Weird right? Yeah that how i keep my self on track when I sleep and wake up I look directly to it and immediately my mind adjust to the plans making me conscious of every action i take during my daily activities to avoid disruption on my plans. When there are emergencies that tries to pull me off this plans, I gentle go through the plan again and add the emergency situation to the plan not adjust the original plan. I just add the situation to it and boom i will figure out how the situation can still push me to the track. But if it gets to a level that i can't handle then my plan B comes in but finally the plan is still achieved.",

Despite our best efforts there are instances where sticking rigorously to a plan becomes challenging due to the unpredictable nature of life. We cannot time the market, even if we spend hours or days analyzing it. It will make unexpected moves that will force us to make changes in our plans, but first, it will destroy our pre-planning. That's such a sad moment, not because we are losing money, but because we made efforts and applied all the basic rules of technical and fundamental analysis, but still, the market made a move totally on useless and fake things.But that's so obvious because BTC is the market of demand and supply. If good news is thrown in the news websites with good traffic, then hype will be created, which in turn will return the demand because people will throw more money into BTC and demand will increase, resulting in an increase in price. And the opposite will happen if bad news is thrown into the market.I also faced such a situation because there is not a single possibility that anyone in the BTC market would have not faced such a situation. Take the example of the recent unexpected fake news from the Cointelegraph channel.",

When folks just getting into Bitcoin ask me how to put their money in, I also tell them you gotta make a plan and follow it.  But to be honest, I wasn't always so disciplined myself.  Life has a funny way of messin with ya, and sometimes you gotta tweak your moves based on whatever curveballs it throws.  Being flexible can make all the difference when you're trying to make bank in this crazy world.  I remember when I first started buyin Bitcoin back in 2020 and  i was sure it would keep shooting up forever.  So I put way more cash into it than I should've.  But of course after hitting 60k for the first time, it crashed hard.  If I had stuck to my plan of investin 10% of my income, I wouldn't have lost so much.  But at least I learned my lesson about letting FOMO drive my choices.  These days, no matter how tempted I get when Bitcoin's pumping I stay disciplined.  So especially when you're new make a reasonable plan and try to follow it.  Still, you can't be too rigid either.  Don't be afraid to make little adjustments if the situation changes.  Nothing ever goes 100% to plan with investing.  You gotta balance commitment with flexibility if you wanna succeed long-term in this game.",

With life, it is unpredictable and some unforeseen things might come. I am sticking to the plan but that doesn't mean that I shouldn't also adjust if some things happen. I've got my holdings prepared for the next bull run and some of those are for the long term basis where I won't spend or sell any penny from it. But if some things have come and another opportunity has come in where I have to sell a part of it, I'd do it. I've done that in the past and even before the 2021 bull run. No regrets on my end because most of the plans that I did have been executed even if some unexpected things have come.

It's actually good to have a solid plan before you decide to invest. That will serve as your motivation to keep on going because you certainly have a goal to achieve. But sometimes, due to the market volatility and unforeseen events suddenly happen, we are forced to change plans because things have been working not based on our plans. And I don't see wrong of that because it only means that you are flexible enough to any market changes. That does not mean also that once you change plans, there is less likely to achieve your goal. Of course, the same goal is there. It's just that a change of action is needed that you think will be more effective so that the goal of your investment will still be achieved. If there's a need to adjust, then accept it. After all, no plan is perfect because we don't know what the future holds. Just be flexible whenever its needed.",

Life itself is unpredictable so is investment in any sector. But regardless of these uncertainties we still need to make plans based on our prediction of the future. Sometimes it works as planned in some case it will have some hurdles that derails our roadmaps. This is why before we invest we should have emergency plans. One of the reasons why our plans change is because of financial emergency. In some cases, we are pressured to sell our coins because of unforeseen needs.
