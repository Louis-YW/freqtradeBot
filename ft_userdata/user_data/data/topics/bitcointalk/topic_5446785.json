      "body": "Selling off some properties to invest in Bitcoin is nothing but a grab opportunity. Land values barely appreciate in a short time, but BTC does. I am not saying there is definitely going to be a huge gain from bitcoin investment in a short period of time, but the percentage of higher ROI is higher than that of land. I'm already holding a small amount of bitcoin, which is not enough for me; if I see an opportunity to grab more, I will probably do that.It's better for me to invest in Bitcoin than to have landed properties, whose value might likely depreciate over time, and to maintain them, which is not free but will cost you additional money that could have been avoided. I can sell off any property of mine to invest in bitcoin, provided it's not something I use in my daily life but something I actually own for the sake of investment.Quote from: KiaKia on March 29, 2023, 02:16:07 PMWhat are you doing to get yours? Let's talk I have not actually sold out any property of mine to acquire Bitcoin, but I have sacrificed something worth more than property to acquire it, which is my time working in different paid jobs to earn a living and at the same time be able to save up for my Bitcoin bagging. The goal is to get what we can with what ever we can afford.",

Selling them is not a bad idea as Bitcoin is in its bear market and next year, a new bull run likely will come with a next block reward halving.After taking profit in 2024, you can use money to buy those land tiles back. I guess they won't increase too much in value as consequences of Pandemic and economic recession globally and locally.",

Also share me what you have sold this year to buy some Bitcoin, we will still be here in 2025 and I can't wait to share my incredible success story on the forum, Bitcoin loading, 100% acquired. What are you doing to get yours? Let's talk Diversification of investment is an important factor when taking decision in business. Investing is bitcoin is a great decision to take but it is also necessary to have other sources of income. It is possible that you can make so much money to buy more lands in 2024 and it is also possible that you might not make any profit. Nothing is certain in the bitcoin sphere that is why you are always advised to invest what you can afford to bear when you lose. For me, if the land is not fetching me any profit and the price might not appreciate within a projected period of time, selling it to buy bitcoin is not a bad idea. But if the land is in a choice area that can appreciate or rise more than 100% like in my country, I will keep the landed property. For now I have not sold anything to buy bitcoin because I have a plan that includes buying bitcoin every month from my monthly savings. I will keep accumulating with my little savings until I get maybe 1bitcoin in few years  .",

A stupid decision or a brilliant one? How will you take this? If your land is really big and selling a small part will not make the remaining too small for whatever you have in mind, you can sell small as a means to have investment in land and also in bitcoins. Deciding to want to sell your land because you feel this year will be good for bitcoins and that you can easily get another land may be a decision you get to regret. Land is as much as an important investment as bitcoins are.Quote from: KiaKia on March 29, 2023, 02:16:07 PMWhat are you doing to get yours?For me, the only thing I that I can get rid off so I can accumulate more bitcoins is \"habit\".

Firstly, I just don't have any major property or different assets, but secondly, if I had, say, a flat of my own, I wouldn't have sold it for Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may rise in value, selling property like that means having to rent and spend money on that, and the same goes for other major things to sell: there are significant trade-offs. And if you have, like, several flat or something, you probably don't need Bitcoin because you're already fairly well-off as is and can profit from lending your property or, at some point, from selling some of it when the market feels right. I think the best rule is to invest what you can afford to lose and if property or something else is that thing, it's alright to sell it and invest.",

A stupid decision or a brilliant one? How will you take this? 2023 will be an incredible year for crypto investors, but that does not justify putting oneself under pressure to sell something valuable in one's life. It has been said that you should only invest what you can afford to lose. In a real-world scenario, are you willing to lose your land after investing in bitcoin with it? We believe bitcoin will not fall or you will lose your asset, but let us not do or go beyond what we can control in the future.QuoteAlso share me what you have sold this year to buy some Bitcoin, we will still be here in 2025 and I can't wait to share my incredible success story on the forum, Bitcoin loading, 100% acquired.
