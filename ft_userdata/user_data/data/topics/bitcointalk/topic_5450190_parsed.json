      "body": "Usually there will be no efforts trying for the eNaira to be effective and adopted. It can only be functional if the Nigerian Government can start allowing transacting cryptocurrency directly to our banks, I can sense is because of restricting everyone from not associating their bank details with cryptocurrency. Seeing the popularity cryptocurrency gain, this results them to carve out a means of something that relates to it thinking restrictions will bring a huge adoption of eNaira. Believe me or not the eNaira will start being effective and adopted by Nigerian Youths if they free up cryptocurrency transaction to be as the previous then the youth would put the eNaira in consideration. Who are those actively using the eNaira? They are still the youth, I don't think those old men would consider using it due to their lack of time and patient.",

At first there were alot of interest from the public but now, it seems like a failed project. I will like to know what really affected the adoption of the eNaira? Thou, I can't speak on behave of others, but for me, I think the reason why I haven't given the use of eNaira a try is simply because almost all the features which the launched eNaira is said to have, the mobile apps which I used seems to have them all, but just the fact that the app which I used can't be used for International transaction like the eNaira, of which i'm not worried about that yet, since I don't have anyone abroad. So I use Opay and Palmpay for almost all my transactions, of which all transactions are free and I also stand the chance of receiving daily interest on my deposited funds (Owealth). So I don't know about you, what's your reason why you haven't used the eNaira?",
