This tokens mostly would have been ongoing this process for like many months or years and when the listing period is been announced you would clearly see the hype in it. Some investors who even have more will start predicting ridiculous listing price and this is where the hype is. QuoteSummarily exchanges significantly impact the performance of newly listed tokens, although this may vary in tokens or exchanges. Exactly the impact when top exchanges like Binance or either KuCoin have when listing tokens is not compared to other exchanges. In fact some project teams actually use this listing to lure people into investing into some of these tokens. Many Alticoin investors or traders believe that tokens listed on these top exchanges actually have great potential. Example currently is the hype around SUI and Arbitrum",

As a trader or investor, can you relate to these findings?Yes i can relate to these findings that, in the purchasing frenzy people make mistake mostly the newbies because they think they will make profit when the token is already going up. For example, a new token is launched and a newbie set limit to buy it and then set new limit to sell it like bought it around 10$ and set the limit at around 15$ and the funny thing is the $10 price is the maximum price of that token, it could reach.Means now it is not going to make that newbie any profits and thus all of his efforts are in vain. And, i do agree with your other points that, promotion and listing news of the coins on some major exchanges could create great hype among the investors and traders. But that moment is for those who have bought the token at ICO or IEO at lower prices. I hope, we as newbies or pro should avoid to get loss in the heavily flowing river means when the token is already in hype. we should avoid to take part in it. I have faced some loss too and i am saying it with experience.",

      "body": "In my personal view, social media plays a significant role in the cryptocurrency world, second only to exchanges. The wealthiest individuals in cryptocurrency are often exchange owners due to the influence they hold. Manipulative activities are often associated with social media, and being listed on top exchanges can overshadow the need for a coin to have practical use cases. For instance, SONM, a project on Binance whose team has left, continues to generate profits for holders solely because Binance chose to retain it. This illustrates the crucial role that exchanges play at the core of the cryptocurrency space",

As a trader or investor, can you relate to these findings?Listing in a major exchange is obviously just a big sham and popularity. And when a token gets listed on a big exchange honestly it's just the investors who have been holding it earlier gain something the ones who want to enjoy the pump and dump often end up earning nothing infact do end up losing a lot of times. But yes if you have an insider news about any listing it's good to trade that coin and mint some money.",

I think is very good ideas adopting for newly listed coin on some exchange how to protect about coin reputation from lower price after first time listing on the market.  They have make price target from first listing until 5x or 10x depend on how interested with their coins when pre sale release.

The exchange may influence with the anticipation of traders towards the project but in the long run, it is how the team will do their job in sustaining that eagerness.But if the project is gaining attraction from the community, the team should better strike while the iron is hot. Because people move on if they see that there's nothing for them in that project, they can easily see if it is just all talk with empty promises.",

I believe there’s a big impact on the project if you get listed to a popular exchange, they can help your project being recognized by many investors and that’s the start of your success.",

Once the listing news is released, it will raise a huge amount of anticipation in the minds of investors who are ready to buy. Most times, the listed price of a token is only being purchased by one investor, and after that, the price might drop a bit, but as people keep buying, due to the pressure, the token can keep pumping. Some people too have FOMO for newly listed coins on a CEX because they feel the price can skyrocket and they will just take profit and pull out of the market, but sometimes there is not enough luck on their side.",

      "body": "Obviously exchanges impact about the performance of newly listed tokes and they can change the whole game for a project. Here are some of my observations:1. Top tier exchanges already have a significant amount of active traders and investors so if a new token is listed then it has a huge possibility that many of the investors will buy it or trade it. Then surely it will gain more investment and also active users.2. It will help to increase liquidity and trade volume which will help to get top ranked in Coinmarketcap or in a Coin Tracker website. So additionally exchanges are helping to promote the project and make it trustworthy. When a project reach to top list with higher trading volume or investors it will surely create a positive vibe for the new investors. And we oftenly feel safe to invest in a top ranked projects so that we can minimize our investment risks. 3. Even exchanges can make a memecoin project more potential or valuable than a strong project. So listing in a top exchange should be a goal for every potential projects. But I will never suggest to invest in a newly listed token to gain huge profit in short term as we can't predict about it's base price. Because from of beginning of listing it remains too volatile or may have much manipulation. So we should research before buying a new token. I will personally suggest to invest in top ranked Cryptocurrencies only.",
