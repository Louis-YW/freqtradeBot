You shouldn't have tried to get around the system and start out with a full member account. You should have just built an account on your own. Your $40 is gone sadly.

In your specific case it makes me distrust you because instead of doing things as they should be done you have started in the forum trying to cheat the system, to get faster to earn money, which shows that you only care about money in this forum.With a good use of the forum, money should be seen as a complement to the activity you perform in it, which should entail a certain enjoyment when discussing bitcoin and related topics.",

I don't want to make any assumptions yet, but why would someone share the same Bitcoin address? It seems sketchy enough for me to call it I guess we should wait for his response before confirming something.Regarding the OP now, I'm sorry, but there's a decent chance that you won't get your money back. Your logic of purchasing an account while you recently signed up on the forum is flawed, to say the least. This forum isn't a gold mine, and you aren't supposed to take advantage of the opportunities it provides. There's no shortcut to ranking up; do it at your own pace, proving your worth. Now, you've lost your money and the chance of actually ranking up in the future because your account is now tagged. It's against the rules to purchase an account. I don't agree with you being scammed, but your way of thinking betrayed you and got you burned.",

We can't make unilateral decisions after BTC address linked with @LDL and actually we need his waiting respond, hope OP can get back his refund.By the way, fund $40 still in that address and don't worry for OP maybe topman21 used other BTC address without any permission yet.Quote from: LDL on May 09, 2023, 11:21:28 PMDear @Hhampuz sirDue to excessive amount of Transaction fees , i need to change my wallet address. I would be very grateful if you could change my wallet please.My Old address: bc1q2qufsr2f760jkd7wzzk99nhy2329e39zc6t3dgMy new address: bc1qah37sm35g509yjs00g4ddyjxtvwcfvqc42h4w2ku9p6uzeazssxqldjdauWhat are the chances of LDL not being associated with this Topman21 guy or actually being the scammer himself? I don't want to make any assumptions yet, but why would someone share the same Bitcoin address? It seems sketchy enough for me to call it I guess we should wait for his response before confirming something.Regarding the OP now, I'm sorry, but there's a decent chance that you won't get your money back. Your logic of purchasing an account while you recently signed up on the forum is flawed, to say the least. This forum isn't a gold mine, and you aren't supposed to take advantage of the opportunities it provides. There's no shortcut to ranking up; do it at your own pace, proving your worth. Now, you've lost your money and the chance of actually ranking up in the future because your account is now tagged. It's against the rules to purchase an account. I don't agree with you being scammed, but your way of thinking betrayed you and got you burned.LDL responded here and to my PM. At this point we cannot prove anything except and account on telegram gave his address and money was sent. He might be the account seller and he might not be. He could be telling the truth and someone is trying to nail him to the wall. Cannot say 1 way or the other honestly. I advised him to pm the OP and refund the money minus transaction fee. OP will lose a few bucks but learn a valuable lesson.",

I know nothing about this.Can you explain more details? How can someone use your address to ruin your reputation? Has your wallet been emptied, or is it that $40?It's a strange coincidence, so try to explain in detail, otherwise you will be accused.",

But has possibility with the scammer linked or use @LDL BTC address and its good for refunding later.

No need to send money to me then me to OP and lose more in fees for him.LDL can quote the address and post a txid for proof.",
