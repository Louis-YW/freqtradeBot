      "body": "1. Yes, you can. See here[1].2. This is a non-custodial wallet and not an exchange, so whenever you're transferring funds, you're using the bitcoin network. Whether you're sending them to one of your other addresses, or to somebody else, the fees will be based on the transaction size (inputs and outputs).3.  Ledger uses Changelly as an exchange partner[2]. The fees for Changelly are 0.25% + network fee. I'm not sure if the ledger takes a cut as well.[1] https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389482641-Add-your-accounts?docs=true[2] https://www.ledger.com/swap-bitcoin",

I haven't seen you talk about 'Ledger Nano' in any of your post, do you perhaps mean \"2 Bitcoin addresses in the same wallet\"?If so, that's normally the case in non-custodial wallets (not all though). Custodial services/wallets usually limit their clients with 1 Bitcoin address.For the fee, in non-custodial wallets, it'll depend on a few factors like size of the transaction and the number of unconfirmed txns, but it'll not be based on the amount of BTC.The lowest can be as low as 1sat/vB which is way less than a cent (at your example price) when used in a 1input-2outputs transaction.For custodial wallets, it will depend on their service's rate.",

Yes, if the wallet using HD wallets[1]. And if the wallet software has multi account feature.Quote from: sima_sara on November 10, 2022, 11:14:28 AM2. if so, assume that bitcoin is $100.  You transfer 1 BTC from wallet A to wallet B within the same ledger.  is there a transfer fee?  if so, roughly how much?Yes, bitcoin transaction require a fee, unless it's an exchange and it is called internal transfer. Regarding the fee, it depends on the network (considering you just bought the $100 from an exchange with a single input)  higher fee if congested network, smaller fee if the opposite. But first, transfering coin from the same wallet is not reasonable it is a waste of fee, you will also see a warning doing that.Quote from: sima_sara on November 10, 2022, 11:14:28 AM3.  still assume bitcoin is $100.  You convert this to tether.  a month later, you can convert this back to BTC.  assume BTC stayed at $100 the whole time.  Roughly, how much fee will I be hit with?  Base on the number 2 answer, it will not be $100 anymore. Regarding the conversion, it still a fee so depends on the conversion fee. Now regarding the fees, it still depends on what platform you use to convert. Fees are dynamic, so no one can tell if how much is it on the time of transaction and conversion.[1] https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/hd-wallets",

But it is often not taken into account that when it comes to money transfers between your own accounts and wallets, bitcoin begins to rapidly lose its position as an ideal substitute for cash transactions. Considering the simple fact that bitcoin doesn't care to whom a particular address belongs, it requires paying a fee for each transaction, even for those funds that don't change ownership upon movement. In bitcoin, you are severely limited in your ability to manage your own accounts because of that: every time you send, you pay.",
