In addition, the phishing domain's age, as per Whois, is only 20 days, while the official domain of ChangeNow.io has been around for six years; by these superficial details and checking and paying attention to the words of the domain and what the domain ends after 'dot' can prevent a person from falling into a scam if this scam phishing domain is sent to him by strangers on Change.io communities or through advertisements that appear in search engines and social media.Thank you, Op. Now, I will submit the first report and complaint to the domain registrar on my part.",

That is a shitty behaviour of google accepting ads from scammers without having a thorough quality assurance. This is one of the reasons why is use adblocker to remove those google ads when searching things online because they show in top of the legit results.",

Other way is by accessing it through the link provided in the platforms' ANN threads by the official account of that platform.As Sinbad were mentioned, I'd like to add as well that yes, there are a lot of phishing site trying to take advantage of Sinbad. The official webpage of sinbad will beCode:onion: http://[directing people to darknet sites is not allowed].onion/clearnet: https://sinbad.io/",

Always cross check the web address, letter by letter before engaging with a service for business. Always use addons like uBlock Origin that can minimize the risks of getting phishing sites that are advertised by Google and show up at the top.",

No reply yet from the .fi holderGoogle dont check ID on google ads.\"This advertiser is from Ukraine, unverified\" Probably bought their google developer account from timebucks or whatever.Since Google doesn't take their time to check the security risks involved in some ads they approve for display, to some point I believe they take the reports of ads very seriously, as I have reported a few from my end and I barely come across them again when I am browsing. Maybe they take the ads very seriously because they have nothing to lose after all, as the advertiser should already have paid for those services. This days any identity can be bought online; there is nothing hackers don't sell online again. Don't be surprised that the developer account you think was purchased might actually be created by the scammer's self, and if that's what requires a verification document, it can also be gotten elsewhere. So don't be deceived by some information you get about a scammer online; nothing seems impossible for them, especially impersonation.",

Most likely the above site will have more efficiently Optimized that keyword on search. Even though Sindbad is a well-known mixing service here their brand keyword is not properly Search Engine optimized.  It's not advisable to blindly visit websites based solely on tickers or keywords. Instead, it's safer to verify the domain below. Moreover, using the Onion address or the official redirect link is a more secure choice compared to mixing platforms. Neglecting proper URL checks can result in financial losses.",
