A big % of mining share too - around the size of antpool and f2pool at the time).",

US has a huge list of sanctions and restrictions to certain areas which wouldn't allow the chips to be exported there at all.It wouldn't be clear if Intel would be interested to market them to the retail market or to provide them directly to the companies which would reduce the cost and complexity for them as well. The continual improvement in ASICs efficiency is a common theme throughout the lifetime of Bitcoin mining. It is well known that for an increase in the supply of efficient ASICs, the rest of the network would be stuck with their own equipment and would earn less, at a worse efficiency.",

So, while new products might temporarily set them apart compared to the competition, the margins get lesser as time goes on, until eventually affordable options are out there for everyone. At the moment, we're at the point where mining is relatively priced out for those without quite substantial investments. That should change in time though as above.",

I think we should separate mining from ASIC technology, to not create confusion about zero sum game.

In a logical and perfect scenario, each miner mines at the optimum MPB/MPC and that is the market equilibrium.This makes it such that a smaller change actually makes it more rational for a miner to either scrap and sell it or to turn it off. The phenomenon which the miner actually finds it more efficient to mine at a specific point in time would then be a market failure due to the time lag or lack of perfect information. Hence, in essence the market logic would still apply, but it gets more skewed in the real world.",

(cheaper to buy than to mine)where there is more market buying with less market selling which then causes a decrease in hashrate as there are less asics mining. and an increase of market pricewhich can cause the hashrate competition for the 100btc back into alignment of the shares of the reward covering the costs because if less people are taking from the reward, more reward goes to each remaining miners...so in this instance its not a race to the top or bottom, its rebalancing",

EG imagine transistors 'switch' based on a receipt of 0.1 volt. new 7nm transistors could \"switch\" at 0.05volt. meaning the 'density' of the transistor has not changed. but less overall voltage is needed. and less voltage means less heat and so the gaps in the chip between transistors and thus the gaps on the circuit board between chips and thus the gaps between different circuit boards can be pushed tighter together, due to less heat generation...... this then means either less electric used per hash if same hash per second.. thus cheaper..or due to tighter circuit boards inside the asic, fit more circuits and double up hashrate. even when the nm size of transistors has not changed.or looking at the macro level.. although the network does have ~1.5mill asics running at the same time.. nothing stops people just buying more asics.",
