  "content": "Fueled by BTC historic achievement of reaching a new ATH before its next halving event, the cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity. This is a unique occurrence in Bitcoin's history, and it has propelled BTC into the mainstream media spotlight. News magazines and national television stations are frequently discussing Bitcoin, reflecting the public's growing fascination with this digital asset and the potential for significant investment returns.Major corporations are recognizing the potential of BTC and are looking for ways to benefit from it. While large-scale investment might only be practical for a select few like Tesla or MicroStrategy, accepting BTC payments offers a more accessible entry point for most businesses. In fact, several companies already embrace this method, including tech giants like Microsoft and AT&T, alongside familiar brands like KFC [1]. The travel industry is also jumping on board, with Travala.com, a leading crypto-friendly platform, having previously accepted bookings using nearly 100 cryptocurrencies, including BTC [2].Travala has launched a new initiative to capitalize on the growing popularity of BTC. The program offers top-tier travelers a compelling incentive: 10% cashback on their travel bookings in the form of BTC. This strategy aims to not only encourage users to book more travel through Travala but also introduce them to the world of crypto.Travala.com CEO Juan Otero: “Bitcoin is here to stay, and it’s now becoming more appealing to mainstream audiences, thanks to the recent approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund” [3].Travala's new BTC rewards program capitalizes on BTC's popularity, making it a highly sought-after incentive for travelers. For many, these earned BTC could be their first foray into crypto, potentially turning them into long-term crypto users and investors. I believe that this innovative program is a win-win, attracting new customers to Travala while boosting brand awareness within the crypto community.Inspired by Travala's idea, I predict a future where many companies offer similar loyalty programs. Beyond its role as a currency, BTC is increasingly recognized as a valuable brand. I, for one, would be eager to participate in programs that reward everyday purchases with BTC, from groceries and beauty products to airline tickets.I would like to know your opinion on the wave of BTC adoption by companies:Do you think BTC programs will be useful for companies in their efforts to reach users?Are you willing to receive rewards in BTC when using future services?If you have your own company, are you willing to accept BTC or launch BTC programs?References:[1] Who Accepts Bitcoin as Payment?[2] Travala: Payment options[3] Travala’s new Bitcoin rewards program targets top-tier travelers as BTC fever rises",

For the businessmen, any improvement is good because it's way for them to promote their company. But for the customers, they need to accept to lose their privacy because it will link their identity with Bitcoin. Since Travala is a booking service, I remembered with a case to Russian investment blogger gets robbed in hotel.2. If I link my identity, I won't. If I don't need to link my identity, why not?3. Not yet, I will accept when Bitcoin is already become a normal thing, so whenever people know someone own Bitcoin, they didn't think every people who own Bitcoin is rich.",

It allows them to tap a new set of audiences. So I think slowly big corporates will come forward and will allow crypto payment in their platform. But it doesn't really matter everytime what a big corporate thinks. A lot depends on the local legislation as well. There are many countries where crypto is not seen as a legal tender. So it may become challenging for the companies to accept crypto payments in those countries. But I see there's a great amount of positivity around cryptocurrency right now. Usually it happens during any bull run. I just hope this bull run continues and the positivity stays as it is.",

But in this case I have to follow some rules. It is as I wish, but I cannot do everything. I must obey the government rules of the country in which I live.

I, for one, would be eager to participate in programs that reward everyday purchases with BTC, from groceries and beauty products to airline tickets. No doubt, a lot of positive news has been coming in favor of BTC and lots of organizations that are good at seizing opportunities to their advantage would normally want to jump in and see how to be part of this global crypto users and supporters and giving out an incentive as this could be part of a business strategy that could work too well in bringing the attention of most crypto enthusiast into wanting to be a part of the organization and this business strategy has obviously made them popular in the crypto ecosystem.  With how constantly bullish Bitcoin is going and the high rate of popularity and adoption it has witnessed recently, it won't be surprising to see more organizations adopting Bitcoin as a means of payments and maybe give reduction in the price to be payed for any customer that chooses to pay in BTC.Quote from: Vincom on March 08, 2024, 01:03:21 AMAre you willing to receive rewards in BTC when using future services?why not? If you pay me $50 worth of BTC as a reward for using your service that cost me up to $1000, I'm at a serious gain because if I decide to Hold the $50 worth of BTC till the market becomes more bullish, I would have gained almost twice or thrice the incentive you gave me. If you're giving someone that's totally new to crypto, it could be one good reason they would probably try investing into Bitcoin out and you've used that medium to increase the number of Bitcoin user in our ecosystem.Quote from: Vincom on March 08, 2024, 01:03:21 AMIf you have your own company, are you willing to accept BTC or launch BTC programs? absolutely yes. I'm a very good business strategist and I sure know the importance of getting customers from different niches and I can tell you for free that in my country where almost all the youths are active crypto users, if you run an eatery or a travel agency that accepts crypto as an option of making payments, you've gained at least 60% of the youthfull population  to your brand.",

Not all businesses are suitable for customers to pay for products or services with Bitcoins, accepting bitcoins too in some businesses too may not work because the client base or the age grade the business focuses on may not be the type that there is a high interest to have and use bitcoins.

Since I'm not sending out anything, this will relieve some of my stress and add to it as well. The network issue will be the first source of stress, and additional stress will come from needing to have the correct decimals for each product and from the fact that the price of bitcoin is unstable and must constantly be updated to avoid going over or even lower. Bitcoin transactions aren't limited to techies, in my opinion. Any industry can choose to utilize bitcoin. Since its a good store value i don't think it should be spent. Its there coin and anyone can decide what to do with there coin. They want to spend it fine and good. Because even countries that invested in bitcoin am sure they will be making money by now bitcoin depends on how you use it.",

Because investing in it is different from accept it. In investment you use p2p to get it and store it in the non custodial wallet and the government can't do anything to control your end but if you accept it in the payment method then they can control your payment because if they know that you are accepting bitcoin as a payment method.

Is there a potential to make it big in the future or not? The good thing about this is that anyone can join if they believe it, or not opt to get on it. No one is forcing you to include the btc payment in your financial transactions. It is your choice and no one can shove it on your face.",
