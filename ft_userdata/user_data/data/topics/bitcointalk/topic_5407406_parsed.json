Especially the wallet on mobile.\"Blue Wallet\" on Android supports signing message with bech32 or legacy addresses.Of course, not Taproot since it doesn't support the address yet.Electrum Mobile on the other hand doesn't have a sign message feature.But if it's to prove ownership, why use a wallet with addresses that you do not use?",

Especially the wallet on mobile.Any wallet with any serious amounts should never be created on a laptop or desktop or phone but on a separate hardware device.I think the number I times I have wanted to / had to sign something with an address on my mobile wallet over the last 8 years or so can be counted on the fingers of one hand. There are a few that do some signing of certain types, none that do all, and as far as I know none that do taproot.-Dave",

Especially the wallet on mobile.You need private key to sign message, which used to prove ownership of a Bitcoin address. That means you automatically store your Bitcoin on that wallet.The way I read it, OP doesn't want to deposit Bitcoin to that wallet. In that case: @BlackBoss_: what exactly are you trying to accomplish? I can think of Stake your Bitcoin address here, but you don't need different address formats for that.",

If a wallet supports Legacy, Nested and Native Segwit to sign message, it is perfect. I do not find a wallet that support signing message from Taproot address.No idea why more mobile wallets don't have this useful functionality, but it's probably more complicated to make something like this.Apart from Mycelium, Blue Wallet and Coinomi I am not supporting or recommending other wallets in any way, but since you won't use it for storing bitcoin or making transactions, I think that Samourai wallet can also sign a message on mobile.This is open source wallet that is controversial for some people, but here is instructions how to sign a message with this wallet: https://samourai.kayako.com/article/44-sign-a-message-with-a-utxo",
