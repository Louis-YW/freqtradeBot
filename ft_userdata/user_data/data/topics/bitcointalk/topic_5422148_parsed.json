  "content": "The bookmaker froze my bets for almost a month, which won. And after sleeping a month, he sent a letter about the violation of the rules, in which it is written about the gaming syndicate and about arbitration situations and about automated software. In general, just like many fraudulent bookmakers say \"You are guilty, we will not prove it.\" And winning bets were assigned the status of \"Loss\". $338 stolen. There is nowhere to complain, because they do not have a license. I just want new customers to know that the office without evidence and only at its own discretion can take money and easily write down bets as lost ones. It's even worse than a refund. All bets that the client makes, the this casino has the right to take for itself, simply by calling you an arbitrageur.Bookmaker's answer:Hello,Our technical and risk management departments have noticed that you were repeatedly violating clause 2 of the GENERAL RULES. Accordingly, we have deducted a number of your bets to cover the company’s losses caused by your actions. The decision is final. We strongly recommend you not to violate the company's rules in the future.Best regards, Karin!",

Two I placed last night (European time), and one this morning. Nardi won the match and covered the plus handicap, so all these bets should have been settled as winners.Instead, on inspecting after the match, they were mysteriously cancelled. I contacted the support team, as initially I just suspected it was a simple error, and I was informed that the bets were cancelled due to 'there being an error with the odds'.I could perfectly understand this if they had displayed the odds the wrong way around or were miles away from consensus market lines, but this was absolutely not the case. In fact, at the time of my first bet (match odds at 2.23 decimal), bet365 were offering 2.50, and Pinnacle too were offering ~2.30. You can verify these facts on oddsportal.The second match odds bet is the same story, I bet at 1.84, and again, this was a market consensus price at the time of striking.There was strong line movement in favour of Nardi, but the whole market was offering 2.20+ last night and indeed many books even closed above 1.84 so to claim either of these bets, or the handicap, was down to an error with the odds is just nonsense. Indeed, if every time one gets good line movement the bets are cancelled due to an 'error', what is the point of betting at all? One cannot win!As far as I can see it, they were beaten fair and square, and are now cheating me of my winnings!I am happy to provide any more information for anyone who can help in this case.I have a screenshot of the bets in question, though I am not allowed to include links in this post.Thank you.TomDate of experience: December 08, 2021Quote from: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/sportbet.oneCancel your winning bets, but not your losing ones...I would strongly advise against using this website. I've been betting on and off with them and had no problems but recently they have been cancelling alot of my bets. The message im given is the same as someone else who has left a review - because \"the odds are wrong\". If they're wrong, then why on earth are you letting me bet on them?It's also interesting that the bets are only really cancelled once the match has finished. If it wins, they will cancel the bet. If it loses, they won't cancel and they'll say that your bet lost.I've not had a single bet that has lost cancelled. It's a shame there's no regulatory body to complain to as it's simply criminal what they are doing.Date of experience: July 23, 2022as i understand this problem you had many other customers of theirs also had the same problem, if you had taken at least 15 minutes and researched you would have seen this and you would not have used this casino, but now you already know that they are not to be trusted, I suggest you use other reputable casinos that have been doing this shit for years. there is the casino that is in my signature, they are an excellent casino, you can use itQuote from: Fivestar4everMVP on November 18, 2022, 08:28:11 PMWow, this is amazing, but from the initial stage, did you do some research before joining this casino ? because after reading your post, I tried to do a little research on the sportbet.com and i discovered the casino has been around since 1997, a casino that has been around for this long can not be a scam, by the several complained and negative reviews they would have gathered, they should be out of business already .without you providing prove as to why you think this casino is a scam, I am personally having difficulty believing you.Any one interested can read about sportbet reviews in the following links provided below.https://www.legitgamblingsites.com/reviews/sportbet-com-review/https://www.gamblingsites.com/reviews/sportbet/Registered On: 2019-03-27Updated On: 2022-03-02https://who.is/whois/sportbet.onehow do they exist since 1997? they have scam accusations on trustpilot, I posted the link, it seems to me this is not a reliable casino, I advise OP and people not to use this casino because they can lose money, there are good and reliable casinos in this forum. I still don't understand why people choose weird casinos with scam accusations or customer complaints, what's the cost of taking 15 minutes and doing research before creating a casino account? but people feel lazy to do research before creating a casino account",

I personally don't know sportbet.one but I'm pretty sure that I won't do bets on that betting site. There are so many reputable gambling site here that has proven and been tested for countless of times already. I don't see why people still choose to do bets on unknown betting site given that the risk of being scammed is high. The best thing you can do now is to make a scam accusation to be able for other user to be warned about this  casino so they won't be possibly victimized if your claims is true. I've seen that their bitcointalk account was active a month a go. Let's hope that they will be back to clarify your issue.",

Don't know where did @Fivestar4everMVP found that the gambling site is created at 1997 but indeed that it seems unbelievable because I think there are no online gambling sites who are built that time but who.is is more of a trusted source for looking up site information and it's clearly stated there that the site is built on 2019.The reason why people can sometimes choose a scam gambling site is because they don't do a research but just pick up a random site anywhere. Before all of this, I was thinking earlier that this site has a relation to Sportsbet.io but the real Sportsbet is legit.",
