  "content": "I need help with Electrum... I lost my computer data and had to re-set my computer and reinstall Electrum. Originally, I had Electrum 2.8.2 and created 2 accounts with the same seed. I have the seed for the first wallet which is default_wallet. I restored this wallet using the seed and it's working.The second wallet had the same seed and I do know my password... but how do I pull up the second wallet. When I had both wallets on the same computer I could just change default wallets. I believe the first wallet was just default_wallet and the second wallet (from memory) was default_wallet1... I just added a 1 to default_wallet to differentiate the two. But now that I re-installed Electrum on my updated computer it can not find the second wallet folder on this computer. Any advice as to how to recover the 2nd wallet from the new download? As a reminder, both wallets have the same seed... Thanks!",

      "body": "If two wallets have the same seed phrase, they are the same wallets with exactly same addresses, unless you have extended one of the seed phrases with a passphrase. Did you add any passphrase when creating the wallet? If no, you actually have only one wallet. Note that the wallet name doesn't matter at all. When you recover your wallet using your seed phrase, you can choose any name you want.",

      "body": "Also know that the wallet password does not mean anything. Assuming you have a wallet x on a device and you forget the password. You can simply just import the wallet and you will have access to your coins on the wallet x. Wallet name and password does not mean anything to be able to have access to your coins, your wallet x is still your wallet x if you import the seed phrase again. The importation does not need the wallet name nor the password. Only what is needed is the seed phrase.The only thing that can happen is to extend the word using passphrase (extended word) just as hosseinimr93 commented about it already. Without the extended word, different keys and addresses would be generated. But I doubt that is what you did. And if that is what you did, you need the extended word or characters for you to be able to recover your coins.",

      "body": "Thx guys, from my understanding... they are 2 separate wallets with the same seed. One was default_wallet and I added a 1 to the second wallet and it was default_wallet1. I had 2 passwords. Part of the problem is when I had both wallets on the computer before it crashed... I could just choose default_wallet or choose the other folder default_wallet1. Whichever, I chose, I would just put that PW in. I just added a 2 to the second PW.But now, that folder is gone from my computer... I don't know how to restore it. I do have default_wallet on this computer. But, I can't figure out how to access the second account now that I lost that folder the deafault_wallet1. Not sure, if explaining it correctly... but they were 2 accounts with the same seed but to different folder names and 2 different PW's.It's been about 7-8 years... from memory, I did not extend the seed...",

As already said above, two wallets that have the same seed phrase (assuming there is no passphrase) are the same wallets.You can create different wallets with a single seed phrase only if the seed phrase is BIP39 and you use different derivation paths. Is your seed phrase BIP39 or you have generated your seed phrase in electrum itself? Do you remember how you generated your seed phrase? Again, it doesn't matter what was the wallet name and what was the password.",

Before you click on \"Next\", some text will show up under the box you entered your seed phrase in. Something along the lines of \"Seed Type: legacy\" or \"BIP39 (checksum: ok)\". What does yours say?Are you absolutely certain both wallets used the same seed phrase?Did the addresses in both wallets start with \"1\"?How did you lose the wallet files?

How about you remember maybe theirs is differentials in the funds stored on both. The collision probability is high to create same seed for two separate wallets",
