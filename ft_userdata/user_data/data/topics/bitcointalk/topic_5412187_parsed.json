There are hundreds that use tokens, some that use crypto for Pay2Win stuff, but so far I have found none that allow you to sell loot to other players for POW mined crypto.If anyone is aware of any, please let me know.",

In a world where play 2 earn games are still struggling to have a home this is the last time any developers should come up with. In the early days of the internet, a lot of companies tried to create their own custom closed versions. They all failed. I think tokens have their place, but I feel that games just staking a bunch of tokens are actually doing the same thing as those people that wanted to replace the internet with their own local version. It is like they are using tokens (or NFTs) as a gimmick and afraid to use a real cryptocurrency. P2E games have a multi-billion dollar niche already using a token model, so they are definitely here to stay. And to be honest, most of those games would be considered trash if you ignored their NFTs and tokens. There are a lot of ways to drastically improve P2E.Using a fairly mined POW coin should also encourage people to trust the game economy more. The cryptocurrency is a separate from the game so incidents like what happened to Axie Infinity and their SLP coin couldn't happen.",

And to be honest, most of those games would be considered trash if you ignored their NFTs and tokens. There are a lot of ways to drastically improve P2E.~I think they aren't afraid to use a direct cryptocurrency instead, it is just how the userbase and the community are already centered in the token model. It's like the ecosystem is already somewhat \"matured\", so they all didn't have to reinvent the wheel.Anyway, regarding your question, have you ever taken a look at https://zebedee.io/?There aren't any exact MMORPG games, but the whole idea itself is probable using the platform. A few examples of the game is:- https://zebedee.io/play/sarutobi- https://zebedee.io/play/zbd-kartOr it is simply an app on top of game(CS GO): https://zebedee.io/play/infuse",
