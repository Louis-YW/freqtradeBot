It seems to me that you have a lot of competition around here, and not mentioning anything about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies seems like a disadvantage. On the other hand, I would say that here in the forum you pay more for projects than a monthly flat fee, which is what you are proposing. But, hey, good luck with your pitch.",

For interested people we are going to show everything on the Zoom call  For someone who presents himself as the lead of the marketing team, you should definitely introduce yourself better.

You have mentioned vouched and trusted but in the description of the post, I have never seen who has vouched for you and how you are trusted. You have mentioned that you have experience in the community management service from 2018 but you have not mentioned any experience. If you really have experience then you should update that on the op.",

It is certain that no one will be interested if they first have to talk to you and believe what you are saying. Even if you have outstanding negotiation skills, everyone will want some more tangible proof that you really do it.QuoteAs for \"Vouched and Trusted\", we have worked and are working with many well-known projects, so I think there's more than enough trust. You are still a newbie here with zero trust, who wants to introduce yourself via voice call, although this is a forum where people communicate in written text.Quote from: ThomasGD on August 23, 2023, 09:48:12 PMYes, we are actually rebranding right now, so it's offline.  As you can see, things like this show more about you than a Zoom call.

Which projects have you worked with why aren't you telling names of famous projects you're trusted with. We don't know you so you're not trusted. If we don't know who's vouched for you how's it making trust. You should say their names.Quote from: ThomasGD on August 23, 2023, 09:48:12 PMYes, we are actually rebranding right now, so it's offline.  You shouldn't annouce projects until your website's ready.
