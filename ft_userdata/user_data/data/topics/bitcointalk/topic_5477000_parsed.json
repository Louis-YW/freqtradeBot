Because there is no economy which has nothing to do with people of that nation.",

To know that we need to take a look on median salary, not GDP or average salary. If there are 100 people, consist of: 10 rich people, 30 average people and 60 poor people. Judging it from GDP or average salary, we might judge the country has a good economy since the 10 rich people net worth is same to 10,000 poor people. But judging it from median salary, there's a problem on wealth distribution.",

To know that we need to take a look on median salary, not GDP or average salary. Bigger pay = more happiness? I am far from this statement. I am far from saying that a higher average salary = more happiness in society. According to the great writer and historian - Harrari, it is possible that we were happiest as humanity before the Neolithic agrarian revolution, 10,000 years ago, as hunters and gatherers and the domestication of plants and animals was our curse. median salary was equal to 0$. @OP In the USA, everything is expensive, but you also earn much more. And ultimately, if you have to buy something in another country, it is better to buy living and earning money in a country with high GDP from a country with low GDP than the other way around. for example, a new iPhone 15 costs $800 in the USA, which is 6 days of work taking into account the median salary. in my country it is 15 days, in poorer African countries it is several months. The same applies to cars, computers, and household appliances. In my country, 1 m^2 of an apartment takes about 5-10 weeks of work to buy, in the USA it takes 4-7 weeks. But there are states in the US where you can still live the life you described. buy a big ranch in texas and raise your own cattle. no one is forcing you to live in manhattan",

GDP is useful to get an idea, but if you want to know more about the reality of a country's economy, especially the economy of the people, you will need to know more about average and median wages. In the stock market it is similar, a central concept to decide whether to buy a share is the P/E ratio, but you can't just stick to that, you have to compare it with the sector, the debt, the free cash flow, the evolution in the last five years, etc.",

That means considering GDP = happiness or prosperity of the people would be flawed and wrong. Increased GDP stimulates production, but economic growth promoting increased demand is reasonable, but on the contrary, it will push the economy into deficit and increase inflation. Therefore, I agree that GDP does not reflect or represent people's lives. Specifically, when GDP increases, only a small part will benefit, the rest will bear big risks from work, income, environment, health, education... That is even a serious imbalance.",

According to the happiness indicators prepared by specialized research centers, several criteria are based, of which the gross domestic product is one of them. The result is that the happiest countries, according to these studies, almost all of them do not have a good raw domestic product, meaning that the country’s economy is not that good.Gross domestic product is generally an economic indicator for comparison between economies and not between individuals from one country to another.",

A high GDP doesn't necessarily mean the people are happy. A high GDP doesn't even mean the people are living well.

Just take India for example, they have a pretty alright GDP but they are pretty much still on the rural-based economy with a lot of their citizens in the considerable poverty line. Does that mean that India is dying economy-wise? Nope. In fact it states that they are doing quite fine. But is their GDP indicative of their progress as a country? Nope, we have other factors for that. The only mistake you made is mistaking GDP for the Growth Index of a country. Don't worry, it happens to the best of us.

Try researching about Bhutan's GNH index and how they consider GNH over GDP.I quite understand your plight and the Gross National Happiness you are talking about, in fact, a less-rich country could be happier than the richer country and this depends on many factors which includes money and the ease of getting the money. However, we can't use this to entirely remove the principle of economics which drives an economy itself, we can never remove the fact that the GDP is not a yardstick that contributes to the economy of a nation. GDP can never be underestimated here, and a major contributor for that matter, and it will be so nice that you do not entirely link happiness with richness and how progressive a country is, there are a lot that contribute to happiness, not money alone nor the economy.Mind you, in those countries that are doing well, it's not the government that is doing the majority of things for them but the ability of the private citizens to think and create wealth for themselves (creativity and willingness) and also get to create businesses where a lot of people could also be employed. If this is happening in the opposite in any country, it's the responsibility of the citizens and government to change the narrative, but people often believe that the government should do everything for them. And if the GDP is progressive and people suffer, then it's highly possible that people are not doing enough and still believe the government must do more because I've seen cases where the government tried its best but it didn't work much.With this mindset, citizens reduce the productivity and efficiency of the human resources in the country which is part of what drives the economy. Everyone wants cheap money and this often sets them even back more.",
