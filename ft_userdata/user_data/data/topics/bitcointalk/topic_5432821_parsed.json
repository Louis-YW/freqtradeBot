Have you ever thought about this ? Please share your thoughts.Have you heard the saying money don't buy you happiness then there's also a saying that before you join people in saying that, you should get the money first. This should also applied here, this means before you begin worrying about insecurities you should get the money first. Don't because of this stay poor as it's far better been a rich guy worrying about insecurity than a poor guy. Atleast when you're rich you can do something about the insecurity by securing yourself.Don't also forget that you can be rich and not loud, the loud ones are mostly the target of this insecurities. You could leave a quiet life and enjoy all your richest why not worrying about getting attack. For example, with Bitcoin you could own millions of dollars and yet nobody knows about it. You can then leave a comfortable life and enjoy your wealth.",

Security that you won't have to think about tomorrow and you need to hustle for you to have something to eat.If a person tells you that it doesn't give any upperhand then take his money and let him be problematic about tomorrow. At least for those rich people, they've been through having riches and they're having just sort of another problem that also exists in people who are struggling to make ends meet.While those that are struggling, they have to deal with being problematic about money and as well as those other existing problems one may face.",

I agree that rich people have to worry about being a target, about potential safety risks to them and to their loved ones because of their money. But they can normally also afford good security. If you are poor, though, it doesn't mean you're safe, especially if you live in a country where the rich and the poor live in different districts, because in that case there's more crime in poor areas, and you can be in danger even if you are poor. So I'm not sure, actually, that having money means you're more likely to experience a robbery or safety risks.",

I can say that anxiety can be way worse than fear, because it's a condition that is pretty much genetically determined.What is most important in life is to not get attached too much to material possessions. The existential suffering is caused by the desire for various things-money, power, even women. Controlling your desires will help you take control over your anxiety.Money brings a false sense of security, but nobody is safe from accidents and nobody knows how and when death will come our way.You can be poor and feel secure, while there are rich people, who will always feel insecure. My point is that our state of mind has little to do with our financial situation.",

Money doesn’t bring total security as it actually doesn’t guarantee anything.Asides all that, someone with all the money in the world could come down with a terminal disease and would slowly and gradually die. Or someone with all the billions could drop dead in an instant. How’s that for security? I personally think that nothing is guaranteed in this life as we could at any time die and leave this earth.

Yes money bring comfort especially now life is so hard due to crisis where inflation rise up and the prices of basic goods are so high. Some people they are okay without money but in reality its really hard, imagine how they can survive everyday if they are they are living a hard life.Anxiety or insecurity maybe for somethings they didn't own especially if they cannot use their wealth with it, but rich people can cope up with it as they can use their money to entertain their selves and the only thing they need is to sustain their income flow to live a life where they are so comfortable on.",

Sure, having a little extra cash in the bank can definitely provide some peace of mind and make certain things in life easier. But at the end of the day, true security comes from within. It's about feeling confident in yourself and your abilities under unpleasant conditions, having a strong support system, and finding joy and purpose in life. Money can definitely help with some of that, but it's not the be-all and end-all. Just my two cents...",

They definitely had to hustle and to grind in order to sustain their living or at least to meet their monthly obligations. Personally, majority of those rich people who feel fear and anxiety are the ones who are most likely to succeed and maintain their status quo in the society. Money will definitely give you the sense of security since almost everything revolves around it. If you have a handful amount of resources, then you have access to every possible avenue of healthcare, housing, education, food, etc. that will make your life relatively comfortable.",

In fact, the lives of the rich are far more at risk because there will be a source or center of attention. This also applies to poor people whose lives are uncertain, who die from hunger, live in places full of threats, and are often seen as victims of injustice.",

I believe that money can be used to gain security. For example, to buy an apartment in a calm and safe area, not in a ghetto. If you have enough money, you can move to a country with a high standard of living, where you don't have to worry about your safety and the safety of your savings. It seems to me that OP exaggerates the possible fears of rich people. The rich can organize their lives in such a way that any anxieties and fears will be excluded.It is difficult to objectively evaluate those situations that you have never experienced. That's when you become rich, I would like to hear the answer to whether money brings you a sense of security.",
