  "content": "Does anyone know of a way to disable Asicboost on the new generation of miners like S19/S19J, Whatminers m20/m30 etc?It seems like these miners will refuse to has if the stratum sends a version-rolling=false when requested. Is there any way to disable Overt AsicBoost on these miners be it on their original firmware or custom firmware (this is already in the wild).Thanks!",

But you can still download it from the archive.org here below- https://web.archive.org/web/20220206132736/https://shop.bitmain.com/support/download?product=Flashing%20SD%20card%20with%20imageDon't click the download instead right-click then copy the link and paste it to another tab make sure to delete the archive.org link before you enter.Then follow the instruction here on how to flash it through SD card.About Whatsminer it seems there is no way to disable ASICboost because I think their units don't have ASICboost. Are trying to mine on Nicehash? I heard that the new Whatsminer units do not support ASICboost pools if you have problem connecting to any pool try to use a pool with no ASICboost or that can switch to non-ASICboost server.",

As for S19 and the like it seems that there is no way to go without AB else the older machines seem to throttle down hashing by over 50%.There's nothing we can do with Whatsminer units have you tried to contact their support and ask for older firmware? I think their old version doesn't have ASICboost yet.About s19 have you tried to use Braiins as suggested above? You can able to disable AB but I don't think it throttles down the hashing to 50% it depends in your tune or just use auto-tuning and let the braiins set power and frequency for you while AB is disabled let see what's the difference if you enable and disable AB.",
