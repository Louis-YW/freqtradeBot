  "content": "I've found that many westerners is really out of context about reasons of this war and other things related to slav/russian/ukrainian culture. So, they trying to explain things in a wrong way. Look at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo6w5R6Uo8Y Author trying to tell us that the main reason of War is the \"fight over resources\". This is of course total bullshit. Russia has the biggestamount of resources in the world. It would never start a full scale war  with danger of getting into high sanction pressure (i need to remind you that for russians, and even dwarf putin it was not obvious, would the West implement strong sanctions or not) just because of \"resouces\".So I will create this topic so that any people from other countries could better understand the main background, causes and goals of russian invasion to Ukraine. If i will find some interesting thread or some cultural pattern not obvious to you, i will share it here and translate if necessary (because a huge amount of interesting staff are in russian only). Maybe it will look a little \"out of context\", but anyway, it's worth it. List of good authors i recommend to you (and who are deeply in slav culture by themselves) (i will expand it soon)The First One is: Kamil Galeev. Writting in english, a lot of interesting longreads, native tatar from Tatarstan (region in russia). His most interesting (and important for westerner, for better understanding) threads which shows the main reason of this war: 1. War of memes: why Z-war won't end with peace  (johhnyUA: I consider this thread as the most important in understanding about current war and russian goals. Under \"russian goals\" i mean not only Kremlin or just Kremlin. I mean the whole imperialistic russian nation)\"Russia aims to extirpating Ukrainian culture\"2. What's happening in Russia?  (johhnyUA: thread about sentiment in russian society about war in Ukraine. As author says \"To put it simply, it's going full fascist\")3. Why East Ukraine fights so hard? 4. How popular is Z-war in Russia?4. The place of Chechnya within the Russian regime (johhnyUA: this is also ultra interesting thread)\"Russia is extremely centralised  which makes it fragile. It needs an informal and largely independent face to make the regime more robust. That's why Kadyrov is the last line of Putin's defence\"And some useful threads about russian military (johhnyUA: aspects which were totally ignored by western experts):1) Russian armz and russian goals (johhnyUA: because of low morale troops it's artillery based with a lot of useless and harful staff)\"Every time Putin needed to confirm his alpha status he would devastate some little country with a Special Operation. They didn't require proper preparation because they bore no existential risk to Russia or to him. Like, the fuck they're gonna do? No risk = no need to bother\" 2) Why russian army is so bad (a little more about reasons why Kremlin don't want to create high morale army with famous generals). \"Let's go a bit deeper in history. When Bolsheviks took power in 1917 they were constantly comparing themselves with English and French revolutionaries. As they new well, both English and French revolutions ended with military usurpations done by victorious revolutionary generals.... That probably explains why the victorious Red Army had so many commanders killed under mysterious circumstances. According to official narrative - by the enemy fire, but suspectedly - by assassins shooting at their back from the close range. Like Schors\" 3) Why Russian army is so weak? \"Notwithstanding with its warlike image, boosted by massive PR campaign, Russian military have nearly zero experience of fighting conventional wars against other regular armies. They were quite successful in suppressing civilian riots ofc, in Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968, etc\" \"That's their mode of thinking. Killing Nemtsov is a special operation. Invasion of Ukraine is a special operation. Sounds dumb isn't it? Actually it makes sense. Russian regime is regime of cosplayers: state security agents who pretend to be soldiers and desire the military glory. State security playing soldiers launched a Special Operation and accidentally got into a real war. They're scared.\"4) World War Z and Russian minorities\"Russian minorities are wildly overrepresented on Ukrainian battlefields as cannon fodder. In return for their blood they are awarded with forced assimilation and loss autonomy. Many question their support of Z\"5) Why Russia is losing this war?\"The failure of many analysts to correctly predict the course of Z-war resulted from three factors. First, they greatly overestimated (or rather misunderstood) the Russian-Soviet army. Second, they underestimated the Ukrainian one. Third, they ignored the Russian political goals\"The Second One: Sergej Sumlenny. Also writting in english so it will be easy to read himInteresting threads:1. How russia prepared it's own people for a big war through weird literature\"Let's start a long thread about how Russian book market prepared Russians for a full-scale war against Ukraine, NATO, the West, and promoted stalinism and nazism, and how this was ignored by the West. Keep seat belts fasten, you will see a lot of nasty things here.\"Local rule: Topic is self moderated. Well known trolls or insane guys who are not allowed to write here: BADecker, be.open. This list can be extended in the future.",

And look into the names of such squads - \"«Bяткa», «Пapмa», «Aлгa», «Tимep», бaтaльoн имeни Шaймypaтoвa.\". This all local mythology and history. Not Moscow or empire (in that case such squads would be named after empire heroes, like \"Cyвopoв\" or \"Epмaк\" ) Russia already has one succesfull case of local army - Chechnya. And as you know, Chechnya ultra independent compared to other regions. \"Chechnya is a vassal kingdom of Kadyrov in personal union with Russia. It's not an integral part of Russia and its troops are not  part of Russian army.Chechen conscript don't go to Russian army, they go to its \"Chechen regiments\" which are led by and personally loyal to Kadyrov\"https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1504585734212055076Such things will bring an end to the russian empire. Local rules gets more power and authority if they have their own armed forces.LPR and DPR was at frist such kingdoms too, with a lot of warlords handling their own armies. Russian didn't have direct control over them. So, one by one, russians assasinated all of this warlords and established FSB control over territory. Few longreads about Chechnya (this is enough interesting to read):- Kadyrov's kingdom- TikTok warlord- The place of Chechnya within the Russian regime\"TL;DR Russia is extremely centralised  which makes it fragile.

Even on this forum you can see the same people peddling e.g. US election conspiracies and anti-Ukraine propaganda.I'd like to believe that Russia as a country can fix itself like most post-Soviet shitholes did, and it isn't really all about imperialism and totalitarianism, but the more the war goes on the more I think that I'm probably wrong about that.",

Let me show you where. From todays Putin talk on Saint Petersburg economic forum: \"Peшeниe cпeцoпepaции нa Дoнбacce былo вынyждeнным и нeoбxoдимым, ocнoвaнным нa пpaвe cyвepeннoгo гocyдapcтвa Poccии oтcтaивaть cвoю бeзoпacнocть, пpaвo нa cвoбoднoe paзвитиe\", — Пyтин (https://t.me/ressentiment_channel/25151)Let me translate bold text: \"Our decision (johhnyUA: to start a war) was based on the right of sovereign state to protect it's security\" This is not a talk of 20th century, no. This is typical way of thinking of politician from 19th century, when a war was a right to any sovereign state. In 19th (and earlier) century any sovereign country could declare wars at its own will. So yeah, you're half right. Russia is, in fact, fused between some soviet era details and russian empire.Quote from: suchmoon on June 17, 2022, 10:16:05 PMI'd like to believe that Russia as a country can fix itself like most post-Soviet shitholes did, and it isn't really all about imperialism and totalitarianism, but the more the war goes on the more I think that I'm probably wrong about that.This is the main problem of westerners. They're not a bad people and they don't want to imagine that they faced the problem the same as their granda in the past (Third Reich). It's easier to imagine that it's not about imperialism and fascism. Anyway, I advice you to look into those threads. And in the future i will try to translate few posts from main russian propagandists. Their talk is full of hate to ukrainians. The main take is \"we need to resolve ukrainian question\". They saying it's directly, in the same manner. And the most funny moment (and also really frightening) that they now that this is allusion to what nazi propaganda told about jews. But they are fine with that. So yeah, or we fall under russian pressure, or we destroy it (regime and country as it is for now), with further reorganization of russian society. Like it was done with germans (and you can see results now. Germany is normal federative country)Quote from: johhnyUA on June 17, 2022, 11:04:59 PMFrom todays Putin talk on Saint Petersburg economic forum: \"Peшeниe cпeцoпepaции нa Дoнбacce былo вынyждeнным и нeoбxoдимым, ocнoвaнным нa пpaвe cyвepeннoгo гocyдapcтвa Poccии oтcтaивaть cвoю бeзoпacнocть, пpaвo нa cвoбoднoe paзвитиe\", — Пyтин (https://t.me/ressentiment_channel/25151)Let me translate bold text: \"Our decision (johhnyUA: to start a war) was based on the right of sovereign state to protect it's security\" This is not a talk of 20th century, no.

It's easier to imagine that it's not about imperialism and fascism. I meant the Russian \"nation\", population, or whatever it should be called (not the government or its propagandists). Is the population as a whole hopelessly totalitarian/imperialist, or just transiently brainwashed? They seemingly had the same chance to reach for freedom like everyone else in the former Soviet block in the 1990s and they managed to squander it. On the other hand, they haven't had much (or any really) non-imperialist/non-totalitarian history in the last few hundred years. Can this be fixed in a generation? Two? Three? Will it take a revolution and/or civil war to get there?",

Here is a thread about that fact (if you want to know why is so): Why russians call everyone - \"nazi\" If you want to know in short, here is few screenshots: And guys, here is an example right from this forum:Quote from: Veleor on August 03, 2022, 09:11:31 PMQuote from: paxmao on August 01, 2022, 11:02:35 PMOh... so the Ukrainians are right when they call the Orcs \"tourists\". Putin is still calling this a \"special operation\", yet he is at war. Nothing of what he says can be trusted (any enemy communication is by definition disinformation). However you can rely on facts [...]What are the nicknames \"orcs\", are you a Nazi or what? And I read your last post here...Quote from: paxmao on August 03, 2022, 06:10:50 PMI wonder how many people in the RF really believe the crap or they are just trying hard to believe it so that they do not feel part of the scum of the Earth.Maybe your grandfather or great-grandfather fought on the side of the Nazi troops in World War II? That would explain a lot.Look at this. User Veleor (russian) asking @paxmao if the is a nazi, just because paxmao voices statements which is unpleasant to veleor's ears. If you against russia or russian - you're 100 % nazi (Again, if you want to know why so - you should read the twitter thread and another thread in the OP post -  War of memes: why Z-war won't end with peace)Interesting fact: Russian propaganda is using narratives and posters of the time of russo-japanese war. Despite the fact, that russia lost this war with humiliating results. Despription under a picture: \"In short, about russo-japaneese relationships\"Why doest it uses old posters (of the lost war, and ordinary russian knows it) and doesn't create something new, without such grim background? Also, take a look at pinned message: \"Ceгoдня ocoбeннo мнoгo тpaнcyx и вcякoй нeчиcти нa кaнaлe\" Translation: \"Today there too many trans and other shit on the channel\" Russian propaganda (as a russian society) is now is ultra homophobic, rasist and antisemitic. Here also one example: This is the channel of russian ethno nationalist, \"Бyльбa пpecтoлoв\" (bulba de thrones), his last post on the channel: \"Чтo и тpeбoвaлocь дoкaзaть.

Look how author pays attention to the nationality (ethnic jews) of Primakov jr (Head of the Rossotrudnichestvo) and russian progandaist Nadana Friedrichson. And later accuses jews in \"killing russian soldiers and blackmailing ethnic russian journalists\"His post Bulba ends with the conspiracy that Primakov jr is recruited by Israel intelligence. Another interesting pattern of russian logic: Quote from: _Ragnarok_ on June 20, 2022, 05:40:35 PMecть тaкoe пoнятиe кaк cyдьбa. тaк вoт кaк бы вы нe кpyтили poccия вaшa cyдьбa. этo кaк мeкcикa для aмepики =никyдa нe pыпнeтcя вoзмoжнo вce cкopo измeнитьcя и вы caми coглacитecь пpиcoeдинитьcя \"Russia is your fate the same as Mexico's fate is to be with USA\".  Russian are obsessed with the idea to be \"Big White People\". They're trying to be the same as colonial superpowers (Britain Empire or USA) in 19th centrury. This is the ideal of any russian \"philosopher\" (black natives from this picture is of course ukrainians, kazakhs, central asia citizens, finns and so on)Here is it one quote\"Кoгдa бeлыe, цивилизoвaнныe люди гpaбят, oни вceгдa избeгaют излишниx жepтв и жecтoкocти. \" (https://t.me/bulbe_de_trones/170)Translation: \"When white, civilized people plunder, they always try to minimize number of victims and violence\"Do you feel the vibe? \"The White Man's Burden\" is the Bible for russian society (it doesn't matter are you stalinist-tankie or right nazionalist-patriot). So, because of that, they (russians) often try to justify their actions \"because USA do the same\". It's not only about \"whataboutism\", mean \"trying to turn focus to opponents problems\". Honestly, russians do not mind about USA/China/Britain/France would do something bad (like invasion of Iraq). They just want to do the same to their neighboors. If someone interested, I can find you A LOT of such examples, I'm lazy so I can't collect a lot of examples of such logic from russian thinkers. You can check Egor Kholmogorov and Galkovsky (the last one is in fact the man who created all russian mythology, even putin quota him) The main ideolog of all Russian nationalistsDEG (that's how they call him) Dmirtry Eugenievich Galkovsky In one of my posts I've mentioned interesting word: Quote from: johhnyUA on July 09, 2022, 11:02:31 AMYou're wrong here. Despite the fact that noone had seen any \"nato general\" through captive on Azovstal, russian in general still believe in existence of such generals. The reason why they don't see them for russian is easy: \"Our NOVIOPS already exchanged generals behind our backs\"NOVIOP (нoвиoп). Do you know what Does it mean? I doubt about it. But, this one of the most important words in russian discourse.Noviop - \"new people's population\", means a human that hasn't nationality and doesn't want to obtain. Some kind of \"internationalist\" but with a bad connotation. For any man who consider himself as a \"russian nationalist\" this one of the worst insults. Like \"Cuckold\" within alt-rights in USA. Noviop is natural enemy to any russian, because noviop wants ti turn russian into ukrainian, belarus, pomor or any other \"fake nation/ethnicity\". And one important moment, unlike \"cuckold\" which is just means a guy who allow to fuck his wife to anyone, noviop can be only from former russians. Westerner can't be \"noviop\". Look at this guy (russian nationalist). He calls \"noviops\" all those who he's doesn't like : Even russian liberals and left-winged using this word, but with ironic context (some kind of self-irony): This guy calls himself \"Steppe Noviop\":CRYPTOCOLONY (Кpиптoкoлoния)Another important word. This, in fact, any country except USA and UK (which is bitter enemy, in world of Galkovsky), Third Reich (until it was destroyed) and Russian Empire (until 1917). Following to Galkovsky, even USSR was a cryptocolony of UK (to fight USA). And now such \"cryptocolony\" of UK is CHINA  ULTRAVOLYAPUK (yльтpaвoляпюк)Means \"fake language\" created to derussify russians. Great example - ukrainian (yeah, many russian nationalists consider ukrainian as \"fake language\" ) It's only few terms of the \"World of Galkovsky\", but you can't even imagine how much this guy influence all russian discourse. Here also important thread from Kamil about Galkovsky and his Theory of Everything: The Magic Worlds of Dmitry Galkovsky",

They were quite successful in suppressing civilian riots ofc, in Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968, etc\" \"That's their mode of thinking. Killing Nemtsov is a special operation. Invasion of Ukraine is a special operation. Sounds dumb isn't it? Actually it makes sense. Russian regime is regime of cosplayers: state security agents who pretend to be soldiers and desire the military glory. State security playing soldiers launched a Special Operation and accidentally got into a real war. They're scared.\"4) World War Z and Russian minorities\"Russian minorities are wildly overrepresented on Ukrainian battlefields as cannon fodder. In return for their blood they are awarded with forced assimilation and loss autonomy. Many question their support of Z\"5) Why Russia is losing this war?\"The failure of many analysts to correctly predict the course of Z-war resulted from three factors. First, they greatly overestimated (or rather misunderstood) the Russian-Soviet army. Second, they underestimated the Ukrainian one. Third, they ignored the Russian political goals\"The Second One: Sergej Sumlenny. Also writting in english so it will be easy to read himInteresting threads:1. How russia prepared it's own people for a big war through weird literature\"Let's start a long thread about how Russian book market prepared Russians for a full-scale war against Ukraine, NATO, the West, and promoted stalinism and nazism, and how this was ignored by the West.

This list can be extended in the future. the reason for this war is capitalismthose russians that tried to declare autonomy wanted to found and own and run their own central bank for that they had to undermine the ukrainian state,it is pretty much the same they did like what the ukrainian baltic and eastern european oligarchs did to the russians.the eastern europeans want to declare independence from russia but don't allow russians to declare independence from them,because if the oprthodox russians would do that they would be not able to afford the alliance with the liberal usa. because the west will simply drain them of their labour and no labour would come to them from russia thats why they are screwed. they are the nazis that pretend to fight nazis",

      "body": "I am one who thinks that this war has a lot to do with resources. Not as much capturing the Ukrainian resources (mineral, oil, gas, food, water,... ) but rather about not allowing those resources to actually being put to use by Europe in collaboration with Ukraine. But there is a lot more about the war:- From Adolf Putin's perspective, his conceptual map of the RF is large cities in Russia (mainly Moscow & St Petersb.) + others to be ignored, dominated or controlled. This is based on how the draft and the recruitment for the army is conducted and the casualties that prove that nationalities and soldiers from economically deprived and politically ignored regions are killed more often.This strategy is not specific to this war, it is just the way RF wages war with Putin. Offering salaries that make a big difference for people from minorities and poorer regions so that they go and fight the minorities in other countries and kill each other while the Russians of Moscow reap the earnings and manage \"Russia Inc.\" Soldiers will sign-up as they may simply not have any other perspective of progress.Just imagine an scenario in which the regions of RF that really hold the economic resources (Siberia) decided that they would be better-off without someone in Moscow telling them what to do. Would it not be interesting, it is much better to keep them ignorant, poor and let them kill among themselves.- As of today \"Russia Inc.\", similarly to \"Saudi Arabia Inc.\" is mainly a petroleum export based economy. It is not the only export, but it is a huge export and Putin's RF tends to wage war when oil prices are high. The EU does not expect the RF to respond to sanctions. It expects to drastically reduce the flow of money that is required to pay the troops, the logistics and the production. More than 50% of energy exports go to China + Germany. More than 50% of exports are oil & energy.To put it plainly, Ukraine is in the middle between point A and point B in the oil and gas trade. A huge mega-project (Nordstream 2) has been built just to skip that \"problem\", but a corridor between RF and \"Transnistria\" would allow a route right into the norther Balkans area, with the chance to get strategic dominance of the area as well. Needless to say that cutting Ukraine from the sea would give a 100% leverage to RF over the Ukrainian economy apart of the side advantage of having more frost free ports.I believe that US & UK have been very keen in not letting this happen. The resources used to protect Odessa allowed for the sinking of the Moskva (which I personally believe had plenty of US support in the operation that is NOT being as prolific in the east).- I think that the US has a mixed interest. They can certainly supply \"attack\" capabilities. The moment that HIMARS were supplied, many advanced munition and weapons depots \"mysteriously\" exploded. And that is without the 300 km specialist munition yet being supplied. This is the US solution to not shooting into RF territory but also deplete the front of shelling and fuel supplies.Anyway, many angles in this war. Not everything is what it seems. I am now trying to make sense of what will happen with the nearly 2 million Ukrainians have been \"moved\", many presumably by force (so deported), to RF territory. Will they be used to reconstruct the flattened \"new republics\"? used as slave labour? We may not know in decades.To add, nations usually take a while to assume they are no longer an Empire, it usually takes an event that evidences this situation. With the Romans, it was the fall of the Capital, with Byzantium it was the siege of Byzantium (Constantinople, Istanbul), with Spain the loss of Cuba and Philippines, the UK has not realised it yet   ... Wil this failed war with Ukraine the point in history in which the RF starts to figure out their new place in the world?Quote from: DrBeer on July 09, 2022, 07:25:19 PMQuote from: KingScorpio on July 09, 2022, 02:35:29 PM....the reason for this war is capitalismthose russians that tried to declare autonomy wanted to found and own and run their own central bank for that they had to undermine the ukrainian state,it is pretty much the same they did like what the ukrainian baltic and eastern european oligarchs did to the russians.the eastern europeans want to declare independence from russia but don't allow russians to declare independence from them,because if the oprthodox russians would do that they would be not able to afford the alliance with the liberal usa. because the west will simply drain them of their labour and no labour would come to them from russia thats why they are screwed. they are the nazis that pretend to fight nazisI recommend that you look into one more issue - these are the features of the language Russian is a nationality.

A person who is Russian by nationality - Russian2. An individual who is a citizen of Russia and the bearer of the concept of the \"Russian world\" - rashistEven in English is incorrect to refer to any RF citizen as \"Russian\" and to the RF as \"Russia\".At a certain point I started changing Russia for \"the RF\" in my posting just because as you say \"Russia\", the territory, is currently part of a state \"the Russian Federation\". I should also get used to call the orcs \"RF soldiers\", as many of them are precisely not Russian as you point out.I agree, this is Russia and even just Moscow, St Peters and others attributing to themselves the authenticity of \"the Russian culture\" because it is very easy to sell to the commoners that this is \"Western culture\" versus \"Eastern Culture\". It is much more difficult to convince someone to wage war speaking of gas pipes, economy, geostrategy and taxes.I think that our way of dealing with it should precisely be clear on the economic and strategic objectives that Adolf Putin is trying to achieve, which are unrelated to Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky or borscht.@KingScorpio states that Ukraine does not allow parts of the territory to become independent and classes these a Russians. In my view, a referendum for independence or even for a certain degree of autonomy is impossible when RF has been providing supplies and organising armed forces in the two \"statelets\" in Donbas. If they wanted to discuss independence, it would require a de-militarisation and a period of pacific conversations and political discussions to begin with. The invasion is not a solution.Quote from: suchmoon on June 17, 2022, 11:27:03 PMQuote from: johhnyUA on June 17, 2022, 11:04:59 PMThis is the main problem of westerners. They're not a bad people and they don't want to imagine that they faced the problem the same as their granda in the past (Third Reich). It's easier to imagine that it's not about imperialism and fascism. I meant the Russian \"nation\", population, or whatever it should be called (not the government or its propagandists). Is the population as a whole hopelessly totalitarian/imperialist, or just transiently brainwashed? They seemingly had the same chance to reach for freedom like everyone else in the former Soviet block in the 1990s and they managed to squander it. On the other hand, they haven't had much (or any really) non-imperialist/non-totalitarian history in the last few hundred years. Can this be fixed in a generation? Two? Three? Will it take a revolution and/or civil war to get there?Unfortunately, they did not have the same opportunities as everyone else. They come from a totalitarian regime with extremely strong \"Intelligence\" Services. USSR excelled at keeping their citizens inline even mentally.Of the pillars of democracy, one often forgotten is education While the former USSR citizens have an excellent level of education in science and, to a point, in may arts and humanities, it is not so in Politics and democracy. If you think of it, the US, which pretty much self-refers to itself and example of freedom, will have soon a candidate for presidency who has already attempted a coup d'etat and is actually still very much supported by many rich and poor alike. In my view, this is a result of the failure of the US education system to provide sufficient understanding of what is a democracy and how it works to large masses of their citizens (among other thinks I reckon).Do you think that anyone would be surprised is Trump wins the next US elections and then he decides that the 22nd amendment (rule of having only two mandates) does not really apply to him? Something along the line of \"since I was not allowed two consecutive terms due to the stolen elections, I am going to be a candidate again\" or \"the nation is in such state of danger that, against my will, I need to be here until this is shorted out\".Would that be Trump at his best or not?",

Depends on their size and my own budget I will buy a drone, or thermal vision camera because guys has only this white Lahoux from me. One thermal camera for 32 soldiers   If you have a drone or thermal/night vision and do not need it, you can also donate it to UVA, I'll cover all shipment duties.

      "body": "Let's start with the main thing: Russian aggression against Ukraine has historical roots and lasts for about 400 years.We expect the question - what are the reasons. I answer: having studied the real history of the formation that is now called Russia, you will be surprised to learn that before the 18th century, no Russia and Russians existed. Generally !There was a Moscow ulus, which in 1721 came up with a new name - \"Russia\". The reasons ? By the beginning of the 18th century, Khazanat (a legacy of the Mongol-Tatar yoke) had lost ground, began to lose strength, and began to fall apart. The Crimean Khanate, which was the owner and ruler of the Moscow ulus, also weakened and began to give up its positions.Muscovy needed to quickly rebuild and try to become part of an actively developing Europe. How to become a respected people from savages? In general, almost nothing, or a century of work on oneself. To work and achieve is not characteristic of Muscovites (Russians).And they decided to go the old proven way, so beloved by them - STEAL! But steal not money, a horse, a cart, but HISTORY! The history of Orthodox RUSSIA, with the center in Kyiv. Which by the 17th century had reached a high level of development, were the center of Slavism, Orthodoxy, had weight in European politics and economics, European history, and culture.As you can guess - in order to steal something and hide the traces - you need to destroy the old owner of the stolen. So there will be no copyright owner of the stolen, and it will be possible to calmly pass off the stolen as \"historically mine\".And now we come to the first few important facts. When I talk about facts, I mean the historical events that took place, which can be verified in several independent sources. This is not Russian propaganda, where the main thing is lies and relying on not very smart people who believe any nonsense.So:1. Finns, Tatars, Ugrians, Mordovians, Samoyeds, Moksha - the largest component of the peoples of Russia - were renamed \"Russian Slavs\" only at the end of the 18th - beginning of the 19th centuries.QUESTIONS: What language was spoken in the 14th-18th centuries in the Finno-Ugric-Tatar Muscovy, which was at war with Russia, Lithuania and Poland? When did the RUSSIAN LANGUAGE, called \"Russian\" today, appear?Until the 18th century, the language of Muscovy (the foremother of Russia) was specifically called the language of Muscovites, Muscovite and was not recognized by European linguists, including Slavic countries. Muscovite language - belonged to the Finnish dialects !!!2. Let's remember once again how many times the enemies of Ukraine and Ukrainians have tried to limit the use of the Ukrainian language over the past 400 years. The Ukrainian language was forbidden to us 134 times, not America and not Europe, but Muscovy-Russia!Poorly educated and mentally narrow-minded Russians shout at the top of their lungs \"Ukraine never existed!\" The Ukrainian language has been restricted, banned and abolished for the past four centuries. Officially - by circulars, decrees, laws, anathemas, etc.The ban on the Ukrainian language was imposed by all branches of the Muscovite-Russian government: the Senate, the Duma, and even the Holy Synod. From 1700 to 1908, 12 (TWELVE) Muscovite-Russian Decrees and Government Decrees were issued, restricting and prohibiting Ukrainian culture and language.3. Having occupied the Ukrainian Don Lands at the beginning of the 18th century, Muscovy began to spread its rules and categorically forbade the Ukrainian language in these territories.In 1918, Ukraine also included the Ukrainian Free Cossacks of the Kuban - where the Cossacks mainly spoke Ukrainian ... Again, having acquired the territory of the Kuban, Muscovy-Russia categorically forbade the Ukrainian language.4. Chronology of the attempt to destroy the Ukrainian language by the Moscow ulus (aka Russia, aka the USSR, aka the Russian Federation)XVII CENTURY:    1626 - Metropolitan Joseph of Krakovsky of Kyiv compiled an akathist to St. Barbara. Moscow allowed, but on the condition of its translation into Russian. The synod ordered the Metropolitan of Kyiv to collect books from the old Ukrainian press from all the churches of Ukraine, and instead of     them to start Moscow publications.    1627 - By decree of Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov, and the Patriarch of Moscow Filaret, who was his father and co-ruler, books of the Ukrainian press were ordered to be collected and burned.    1662 - By decree of Tsar Alexei, on the proposal of the Patriarch of Moscow, it was ordered to burn in the state all copies of the Teaching Gospel of K. Stavrovetsky printed in Ukraine.    1667 - Andrusov agreement. Concluding agreements with the Poles, Tsar Alexei made the following demands regarding Ukrainian books, their authors and publishers: the order was dishonest thieves' (this is the name given to Ukrainian books) books, no one from our royal majesty's subjects     should be printed anywhere under pain of death.    1669 - After the Union of Lublin, the persecution of Ukrainian books printed on the territory subject to the Kingdom of Poland began.    1672 - Decree on the prohibition to keep openly or secretly Ukrainian books at home in Poland.    1677 - Order of Patriarch Joachim to tear out from Ukrainian books sheets not similar to Moscow books.    1689 - It is forbidden for the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra to print books without patriarchal permission:    ...

It was officially declared that the policy of indigenization threatened the existence of a united USSR. In 1934, under pressure from the Stalinist elite, Ukrainization began to be seen as a manifestation of nationalism, and a struggle was launched against it.

Muscovite Russians forbade Ukrainians from their native language. During this time, the Ukrainian language has hardened in such a way that it is unlikely to pay attention to any deputies. On July 3, 2012, the Party of Regions faction in the Verkhovna Rada deceived its opponents by adopting in the second reading a scandalous law that makes Russian the official language.And now, lovers of fairy tales that in Ukraine \"the Russian language is banned\", who really forbade and DESTROYED and whose language?Sources of systematic information:https://argumentua.com/stati/kak-unichtozhali-ukrainskii-yazyk-khronika-zapretov-za-400-lethttp://historyukrainian.blogspot.com/2015/03/400.html",

Not as much capturing the Ukrainian resources (mineral, oil, gas, food, water,... ) but rather about not allowing those resources to actually being put to use by Europe in collaboration with Ukraine. But there is a lot more about the war:As i said, can't agree with such point of view. russia has surplus of resources: oil, gas, gold, most of Rare earth metals, food, animals, wood and a lot of other valuable things. So i doubt it would need another bunch of resources in Ukraine. And Russia (at least didn't) consider Europe as enemy, so again, I don't see any reason to start this war to not allow Europe to get some ukrainian resources. It's pure ideological crusade against \"corrupted russians\" (ukrainians). Here interesting moment: \"Бaнкиp Пyгaчёв нe paз гoвopил в интepвью, чтo eщё 10 лeт нaзaд Пyтинa интepecoвaли тoлькo 2 тeмы – Укpaинa и Гaзпpoм. Bcё ocтaльнoe былo eмy нeинтepecнo.\" https://t.me/tolk_tolk/12823Translation: Banker Pugachev told in interview that 10 years ago Putin was interested into two things - Ukraine and Gasprom. Everything else were ignored. ...I think that the geostrategic implications of having Ukraine between your main export resources (Siberia) and your main client to date (Germany / EU) are well above any cultural consideration on this war. To be honest, I do not believe that any single war in history was based merely on \"cultural differences\", but all of them can be explained in terms of resources and geostrategic interests.As said, Putin does not want the EU to be an strategic ally of Ukraine, because in his mind it is his backyard to use at his will, and to the greater profit of \"Russia Inc\" (yes, mainly Gazprom).Now, RF does not need further resources, just as Elon Musk does not need more money. But it is there and they are ok taking it. And that is not even accounting for the control of food supplies. The RF as of now exports 18% of the world wheat. Ukraine 9% of wheat and quite a chunk of other food staples. If RF would fully control Ukraine, they would be nearly in control of the world food prices other than in America.And yes, with EU money and Ukrainian resources, the RF is still a big exports player, but less than without it.However, I do think that the cultural aspects play a role on HOW the war is waged. Terror tactics, the use of minorities, disregard for soldiers and corruption are quite a trademark of the red RF army.",

Ofc, with 0 proofs, later one \"voencor\" Evgeny Poddubny told that this was  his psyop idea, but as you can understand russian didn't believe that all this shit was just a imagination of one \"voencor\". So they think that ukrainians doing this, but putin and russian govenrment trying to cover this facts. And as we see, they started to do it by themselves. So what in return? We have proof that russian doing such things (at least once), but zero proofs about ukrainians.Of course, they're projecting their own crimes on Ukrainians. Just like with attacks on civilian objects, looting, etc. It's easier to \"report\" it when you don't have to make it up, just blame it on the other side.This is more interesting pattern, which often happens only to russians: Government propaganda or some initiative russian blogger creating some BS narrative, like \"ukrainians cutting testicles to our pows\" and some time later russians start doing this things by themselves. Because in their reality it's just \"an answer\" to what enemies have done to them (russians). And EVEN creator of such BS (in case with testicles - russian propagandists Evgeny Poddubny) told everyone that this is fake, noone will believe him. Typical answer is conspiracy theories that \"Government covers cases where our soldiers were cut, because government is an ally to ukrainians/westerners/reptilians\"Look at this take, from a russian: \"Я зaкoлeбaлcя cлyшaть paccкaзы o poccийcкиx coлдaтax, лишившиxcя тecтикyл в плeнy. Ha мoй peзoнный вoпpoc «нy и гдe xoть oдин?» мнe oбычнo oтвeчaют в дyxe «дa Mинoбopoны cкpывaeт, чтoб жecти нe былo». Ha мoё peзoннoe зaмeчaниe, чтo вooбщe-тo c тaкoй иcтopиeй мoжнo былo бы пoлyчить xoтя бы мeждyнapoдный нeйтpaлитeт в кoнфликтe, coбeceдники oбычнo зaвиcaют. Hy вoт итoг тoгo, чтo никaкиx oпpoвepжeний или пoдтвepждeний диким иcтopиям тaк и нe дaли. Mы oпять пo yши в гoвнe и c дoкyмeнтaльнoй фикcaциeй\" https://t.me/RottenKepkenChannel/18729In short: The guy asks \"If it was so, where all proofs?\" and often answer is \"Ministry of Defense hide such cases!\"Main examples: - Shelling Donbass by ukrainians (Despite we know about some cases, the main thesis is BS\" - now russians shelling ukrainians- cutting testicles off (again, fake story) - now we have proofs that russians REALLY do such thingsSo you can with ease predict what russian soldiers will do, just watching main propaganda and nationalists takes.",
