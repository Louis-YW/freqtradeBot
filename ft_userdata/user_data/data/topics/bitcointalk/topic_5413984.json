  "content": "Okay. So today I was checking my email spam folder and got this email from scammers.QuoteGreetings!I have to share bad news with you. Approximately a few months ago, I gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing. After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.Here is the sequence of events:Some time ago, I purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to buy it online). I have easily managed to log in to your email account ***.One week later, I have already installed the Cobalt Strike \"Beacon\" on the Operating Systems of all the devices you use to access your email. It was not hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails). All ingenious is simple. .This software provides me with access to all your devices controllers (e.g., your microphone, video camera, and keyboard).I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, videos, documents, files, web browsing history to my servers. I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history, and contacts list.My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based) and hence remains invisible for antivirus software. Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter.While gathering information about you, i have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites. You love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure. Well, i have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show how you masturbate and reach orgasms.If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse, and all your videos will be shared with your friends, colleagues, and relatives. Considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch (you perfectly know what I mean), it will cause a real catastrophe for you.I also have no issue at all with making them available for public access (leaked and exposed all data).General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Under the rules of the law, you face a heavy fine or arrest.I guess you don't want that to happen.Let's settle it this way:You transfer 1.8 Bitcoin to me and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away. After that, we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me. I keep my word.That is a fair deal, and the price is relatively low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now. If you don't know how to purchase and transfer Bitcoin - you can use any modern search engine.You need to send that amount here Bitcoin wallet:bc1quedrl599a5un37l507azmynwm24p2ngwaxl4qz(The price is not negotiable).You have 5 days in order to make the payment from the moment you opened this email.Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data is already uploaded to a remote server).Do not try to contact me. Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server.This is an APT Hacking Group. Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work.I will monitor your every move until I get paid.If you keep your end of the agreement, you won't hear from me ever again.Everything will be done fairly!One more thing. Don't get caught in similar kinds of situations anymore in the future!My advice: keep changing all your passwords frequently.Now, You may say \"That could be a real hacker\". Well, No. Because I know what I am doing and what I have on my all devices. First of all, They mentioned I love visiting Porn websites and do masturbate   and they recorded videos and collected some personal data from my devices. LOL. I know what I do man. I do not watch porn and don't masturbate. I do not have any serious personal documents such as Personal nude photos or whatever they mean. All I have is some saved password in my browser which they could access to my exchange money. but sadly they don't even know I am a Bitcoiner. They assume I don't know what Bitcoin is;QuoteIf you don't know how to purchase and transfer Bitcoin - you can use any modern search engine.Well, I am not here to prove that they are not a real hacker. They are 100% fake hackers and trying to scam by scaring people. Porn is the most common thing that people watch and they use this to trick people. I saw the same email posted by a victim on a Facebook group and asked everyone what he can do. So, Thought I should share it here.",

They usually send this kind of emails to hundred of thousands of people hoping some of them will be stupid enough to buy it.Even if they were real hackers and have access to your devices, you should not feel intimidated and don't send them any money.

      "body": "It is a pretty common scam tactic. Some of my clients have received similar emails. Some of the emails were even created as if they came from the FBI or local law enforcement to try to intimidate you. It is all bullshit. Sometimes the scams are sophisticated and sometimes they are just stupid. If hackers really had full access to your devices, they would already use it in the worst possible way. They would probably be posting naked selfies of you all over the Internet already, or selling your passwords to the highest bidder on The Dark Web.   The bottom line is that if someone has access to your sensitive information, you have to assume that they will use it. But, you should not panic. Just change your passwords and keep looking over your shoulder for the next few months. So yeah. Never get intimidated by threats like this. I doubt it will work on a lot of people, but still, it is probably more effective than the old Nigerian prince scam.",

No legit company will ask your money to be sent to them (I mean there might be some, but you got the point ).My old email (the one I used here in my Bitcointalk account before it was hacked) was receiving many emails coming from random people every day and I'm just ignoring. I don't want to stress myself because I know that they are just trying to scam me. Poor scammers.",

No matter how smart hackers are or tend to become, one good thing is that they will always need your concent to be able to scam you. They can't do it if you don't help them.",
