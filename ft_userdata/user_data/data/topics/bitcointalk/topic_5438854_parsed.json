  "content": "There's been a recent surge in cases of Covid-19, influenza such as H1N1 and its similar mutations, and simple infectious viruses. The cause of this is most likely the lack of protection measures we used to take the previous two years, in which the flu was almost eradicated due to mask usage. Nowadays, most, if not all, countries have removed the mandatory mask requirement, and at least here, hospitals are filled with cases of infectious viruses.A few days ago, I was infected with the flu (type A), and I'm yet to recover, while it caused the highest fever I've ever had (40.8 C). It was far worse than Covid-19. The truth is that Covid-19 seems to have died down, but the abandonment of its protective measures has resulted in a huge rise in infectious diseases. I always got through minor infections and colds easily, but the flu this time was something else, which led me to the conclusion that vaccination could possibly be beneficial in order to get through the disease quicker and easier.What are your thoughts or experiences with the flu virus?",

As I've already mentioned, I got sick on Wednesday with the flu, and I've yet to recover. Honestly, I doubt that I'm even halfway towards my recovery. This is the first time I've been sick with the flu, and it has been terrible, a lot worse than COVID-19. I know that you're against vaccines, so there's no point, but I am wondering if I had received the annual dose, would I have suffered so much? Covid was nothing compared to it.",

Your statement doesn't have too much value since the 10 results of random websites can't outnumber the thousands of scientific articles proving the opposite.The reason the flu disappeared during COVID was not because masks did anything. It's because every flu case was treated as a coronavirus case.There never was any evidence that surgical masks prevented COVID-19 infection or spread. It was all a lie. There hasn't been a single scientific study that has taken a large population's COVID case rate and showed a causal association in the reduction of cases after mask use within the same population. The studies supporting mask use would always take two different populations, one masked and the other unmasked, and conclusions. Of course a study can't make conclusions using two different samples.Masking was only part of the theatrics to make people feel safer.",

Standard PCR tests are lies. They are not designed to prove that there is any Covid attack in anybody. Peruse articles here: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=PCR+test+inventor&t=lm&ia=news.- People get sick with all kinds of things that look a little like Covid. Take two aspirin and get some rest.- Evidence exists all over the place that Covid is a media gimmick, promoted by people who want to change the system of trust we have in the medical. To see that this is true, check out the interviews that Del Bigtree does with loads of medical experts who don't want to go along with the Covid lie - https://www.bitchute.com/channel/okiFK5CwQrZS/.- There is not even accurate evidence that viruses exist in the way that the medical wants you to believe. To see this, peruse info by Dr. Andrew Kaufman at https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=andrew%20kaufman&kind=video. Note that if you do research on the info Dr. Kaufman provides, that you will find a whole host of people who understand what is really going on.Wake up!",
