A wise people isn't a billionaire or millionaire, but middle or even low class can buy Bitcoin in cheap price. A billionaire or millionaire can be said as stupid if he's panic about the market and sold early. Then the question is are you a wise person who buy every dip and will hold or dumb person who panic?",

It might also be a lesson in diversification for some to work out how much extra they could've bought if they didn't invest everything at once (even though crashes like these don't come very often - so it's not a good idea to sell and pin your hopes on buying lower).",

They will continue to say that it is the end of bitcoin and dare not enter. On the other hand, when the price starts to rise and continues to rise, buying is an option, even though the price has been affected by FOMO and is too high.The OP may incur losses in some ltcoins or in bitcoins. But I don't know, the important thing is to know how the market moves. Whales can manipulate but not completely. Learn to think like a whale, don't fight it.",

They have become whales because they used opportunities like the current one to their best.They kept doing it and that has what made them the whales.

And if you can't keep up with the whales, you shouldn't go into the market for a while because that could cost you money. Maybe we can't rely on price movements but we should learn to follow price movements while looking for gaps to enter the market. In that way, we can still benefit from price movements for us.",

Maybe you are just seeing it as their playing ground because on a sort of manipulation happened but everyone can actually ride with it and the only thing we need is not to get panic on what people doing on every market movements.

Amidst the crash, the whales are also waiting for the price to also dip to the bottom while time and economic downturn makes everyone sell. You're only screwed when you sell at loss. Its a bit late to say but I think selling decision should have bee decided when a holders sees the bull run made the price peak to its NEW ATH. Get out far from being screwed.",
