  "content": "Hi There, I have gained a lot of Experience over the Years regarding Online Casinos, and the System in wich Casinos are working by. Sometimes you win really big and everything is perfect, but sometimes you lose and all of a sudden you feel treated unfairly. I had Similar Situations back in the Days, my account as Stake with Diamond Rank was closed just because i was discussing with a Live support worker. The thing wich had me really dissapointed wasnt even though that the account got closed, it was more the Lack of respect i received by the Casino in this matter. I feel like Casinos are forgetting to treat players with respect in some points, a lot of people might just talk to Live support or send a mail in to comprehend their feelings of loss at a live casino but sometimes people just want to be treated fairly, players have certain interests wich are not always unjustified. But Casinos tend to ignore these kind of problems and just give you Copy & Paste answers. I feel like Casinos held each player for replaceable at some point. But Thats not right, thats not in accordance with Responsible Gambling in my opinion. There is so much space, so much can be done individually and from casinos to make it user friendlier. Not beeing scared to ask something to live support, not beeing scared that your account might get closed becaused you just discuss with people, the fact that so many gamblers feel not heard because cs is answering to wrong questions, casinos tend to answer with weeks of delay. I really believe that Gamblers wich come together and justify on certain aspects have more weight and get heard to a larger audience to make these issues known and visible, without visibility there is no way of change. a Gamblers Union who represents the rights of Gamblers in general would really change a lot of things wich are wrong these days. I am 100% that there are a lot of things missing in this first Post, but i am also 100% sure that atleast 1 person in the gambling space has felt at some point unfairly treated. If you agree share this message, I am planning to make a Website, Socials and a lot more, people who arent getting heard will get heard, the different stories will get heard and hopefully a lot of cases will be solved by presenting this to the brighter audience. I thank everyone who read this so far, i am really excited to see where this discussion will lead into. best regards Moonzulu",

      "body": "Hi There, First of all Thanks for your Comment, I can understand the fact regarding that. The Thing with Stake was that i was mentioning suicidal thoughts in one of our accidents because i was emotional since i had lost quite a bit. Afterwards the CS has provided me \"help\" banning me so i am not able to play anymore because of the Suicidal Thoughts i mentioned. I have posted it more detailled in the forum of stake but nobody really cared, so the account was closed, my Diamond rank and 30 million wager was basically deleted in one click and it stayed this way. All i am trying to do with this post is to find people who are maybe feeling the same way regarding certain casinos etc. The idea came into my mind really sporadically, so it needs interactions and development, i dont have the answer to filtering out legit vs fake cases but these kind of things can be figured out. I really believe that strong communities nowadays can do a lot of good things, the Play responsible slogan is not something that is restricted to users, there is a difference on casinos wich are just praising it and casinos wich really implement it in a way that a user doesnt feel extra punished. If you look in my case you will find that i was basically banned from my community, wich i have given everything to. So its really something wich we need to evolve i think. And wich we need to talk about and share the message so maybe casinos implement it more.",

Its just Talking about this subject for example is making it a lot easier to process it you know, you dont feel like a banned member all of a sudden. You can talk to figure out things in that space. Also it is a Idea wich needs to be implemented the right way because nobody has made something like that. I agree that it will cause headache and a lot of other things but this can really provide value to the word responsible gambling, also to Casinos to not make things and stand by it just because they were done, A lot of casinos in my experience are not accepting it if they made mistakes for example. Because they are also scared that if they agree to one mistake they need to agree to all other mistakes. But that doesnt wash the fact away that its still a mistake you know. There could be a system of judging the Claim someone has in order to atleast make as less mistakes as possible. There is a lot of room for improvement.",

We already have casinoguru and askgambler but more website offer this kind of service that deals with casino misconduct is always welcome here in the forum.Buy copper membership once you are ready to announce your service to have a proper presentation of your service. Good luck! I’m looking forward to this as I personally experience some misconduct of casino.",

I also don't think customer service will allow your enquiry for weeks if not the hanging of KYC.

I really want to do this service for free. anyone has some right if they are treated unfairly. i mean like i said before there are a lot of things wich can be developed. I also would love to list different subjects in that space and give you a place where you guys can list your ideas so we can like start surveys and see what users really want in that regard",

When a gambler is losing, you want someone to be on the line, like the customer service representatives, and be there to \"comfort\" you during the time of loss. Is that right?Your intentions are not bad but it doesn't make sense either because customer service representatives are there to help you support with the overall casino experience and not be a therapist.I agree that having that would help gamblers with their feelings but I don't think the effect would be so big that it could affect the impact.

Well here is my case regarding Stake https://stakecommunity.com/topic/55928-refund-for-deposited-funds/#comment-1160397 you are completely free to make your own choice if it justified or not, truth is it wont change nothing. In my point of view i was banned for a lifetime just for reacting emotionally. For being treated unfair. I dont say that my behavior was right here but i was a certified member at stake and Diamond Rank is not easy to reach. I think banning me for a lifetime and banishing me from my community where i wagered over 30 million is a really hard choice. I appreciate everyone who does not share my thoughts here. Thats my aim, to receive honest reviews to force development in this idea, i think it could be cool to push this idea to see what it brings to people, maybe we can change something.",

      "body": "Hey There, crwth Thanks for your replyWell it is not easy as that, and its not always issues wich are money based, i mean someone can lose ofcourse and then its lost, but losing money arent the only issues on casinos in my opinion. There are Issues regarding Withdraws, regarding KYC, regarding Bonuses, regarding Wager Accomplishments and everyone has their different side, i can understand it if a user gets pissed for example because they havent heard something for days in and out from their casino regarding a withdraw or some verification eventhough the website states something else, the main issues will have money included and we cannot change that but its our duty as gamblers to provide a space where users and casino do not to fear to say something wrong for example. Thats why ending disputes in this way seems better, and faster, easier for users and casino. It doesnt matter if the guilty one is the casino or the gambler but having a space to find the truth doesnt seem to be something with a bad purpose, it can only develop the system in my view. Besides of that i can understand your point that CS is a service wich is intended to do that, but its not about the feelings only. Its about mental health specially when a casino like stake or bc.game etc. is constantly explaining us how important that is, and specially to find the best solutions for the best situations. Maybe you have heard the Term of a CS wich states \"I cant do that, i cant make that because my level is not high enough or i cant do that because i have no authority in this case etc.\" it happens a lot of times where CS is not the best partner to talk about certain issues. But im not saying that its useless, its more some more popular station if someone has a problem and wants that solved.",

      "body": "It is not an easy task to create a review site, create a site where it is possible to resolve disputes and, above all, create a site where people can post their good and bad experiences about casinos. Why isn't it easy to create something that would help a lot of people? The answer is because when you created the website, you would have to spend a lot of money on advertising and the people who entered your website and expressed what they feel and saw that your website does not have any great power of influence in the gambling market, so those people Those who exposed their problem on your site will stop using your site. and this happens frequentlyPeople always want to win something, in the case of your website they will at least want their problem to be solved, so that's why some people realized this and created sites like casino.guro and askegambler. This is because on the website there are casino links where when people create an account with that link then the casinos already know that a good part of their customers come from casino.guro and askgambler and when the casino guro and askgambler notify the casino to This resolves a problem of a customer who complained to the Guro or Askgambler casino. The casino is afraid of losing reputation and responds to the customer. so this is the only way to be able to be important to the point of being a mediatorand people complain or casinos see people's dissatisfaction. But for you to have a website and add many casinos and have a big influence like casino guro and askgambler, you will have to spend money on advertising and a lot of time. If you create a simple website or forum, it will be a failure. I'm sorry to have to say this, people won't go to your website or forum to post until they earn anything. Even on forums that are intended for addicted people to tell their stories, there haven't been many comments.",
