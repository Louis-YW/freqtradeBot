  "content": "Justin Bons tweeted that he had bitcoin node before and that he was once supporting bitcoin in the past. According to how I understood it, he started not to support bitcoin again because the block size was not increased, which lead to Bitcoin Cash. From what I see, he wished bitcoin to be centralized like altcoins, he wants bitcoin to have smart contract and continue to be modified in a way bitcoin would not be regarded as a commodity but a security. He do not like how bitcoin is decentralized according to all what I read from his tweets. You can read his whole tweet: https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1563912991015305216?s=20&t=CCW_pcC7QwXNogJDeKX1MgIs what he is tweeting worth it? No. Absolutely not worth it. Full of misleading informationLet me quote some of what he tweeted and see how he is wrong.QuoteBTC is unique in that it is technically one of the worst cryptocurrenciesFalseQuoteIt has a broken long-term security modelFalseQuoteIt lacks capacity, programmability & composabilityFalseQuoteWith comparatively weak economic qualitiesFalseQuoteBTC is, in fact, a purely speculative asset without utilityIn short period of time? YesIn long period of time? WrongIf you hold bitcoin for a long time like 4 years, it is a store of value and a hedge against inflation. In short time period, it is a speculative asset. Does that makes bitcoin bad? No.QuoteNot increasing the blocksize limit represented a major departure from the original vision & purpose of BitcoinLeading us down this pathLeading us to where please? But Bitcoin Cash forked from bitcoin, where is Bitcoin Cash today.QuoteWhere BTCs value proposition is no longer based on utility due to the limits on capacityFalseI am expecting any country that adopt bitcoin as a legal tender not to accept centralized coins, which is what is happening. El Salvador, CAR and an island in Honduras all accepted bitcoin as legal tender, why not your altcoins? Is there any platforms that cyyptocurrencies are accepted that bitcoin is not the first among them? Yet bitcoin remain number 1. There is more to this, definitely all the quotes are wrong, he just want to mislead people. QuoteBTCs security now also requires TX fees to grow exponentially larger or network security will failThis is rubbish, no sense in this.QuoteThe most realistic way to avoid such a catastrophic failure is to increase inflationIf bitcoin fails, all (centralized) coins and tokens would fail, which means all would fail, and bitcoin would be the last to fail. One of the purposes of bitcoin is to be a hedge against inflation and as an investment.QuoteThe world has also moved on & progressedI remember it used to be said that BTC would just adopt the best technologiesThis thesis has obviously completely failedAs BTC has no smart contracts, privacy tech, or scaling breakthroughsTo just mention a few shortcomingsYet bitcoin remain the number one in market capitalization with 40% dominance.QuoteBTCs economic qualities are also incredibly weakWith an uncertain limited supplyBTC is competing with cryptocurrencies that can achieve negative inflationDue to fee burning, high capacity & high utilitySuch as ETH post-merge & alternatives such as AVAX, NEAR & EGLDYet bitcoin supply remain 21 million, no pre-mined coins like the centralized altcoins. People had proposed burning of bitcoin supply, but not welcomed and won't be welcomed by the bitcoin community. Because some bitcoin is not burned does not make bitcoin not to be deflationary, bitcoin is deflationary.QuoteBTC has become a purely speculative assetPeople, for the most part, only invest in BTC because they believe the price will go upOperating on the same modus operandi as a Ponzi scheme investorAll contrary to fundamental reasons of revenue, utility & use case analysisAll I felt is emotional baseless critism, bitcoin is not ponzi is what that fit the reply here. Is there any cryptocurrency that is not highly volatile than bitcoin? Altcoins are more and most volatile. All the cryptocurrencies move in the same direction which is the direction that bitcoin is moving to.QuoteMy original 2013 thesis for investing in BTC was destroyed by the very people we trusted to maintain itThere also laid the problemI believe in the end, what we witnessed was a failure of governanceYou only want your wish, not the wish of the community, I have mentioned that already, you unconsciously want centralization, but what bitcoin community did not give.",

And that is just bad. My old money still spends, the bank will still take old checks and so on.Yes it's software so it's a bit different, but keeping compatibility and not just doing stuff to do it is important.-Dave",

      "body": "Bitcoin being a security will eventually make itunder controlled by SEC, that is not what decentralization will be. You dont want what BTC to be how Eth is after its merge. Since he support so much of blocksize issue then he can suggest to Ver for BTC cash to be security. I actually have not heard of Justin Bons before today. But its not surprising to see someone from known Institutions to wish to acquire control over an asset.",

Wasn't social media fighting (or pretending to do so) against fake news?Perhaps it's not controversial enough to merit some recognition from those 'fighting' from misinformation. It not affects a lot of people, therefore the misinformation can continue unless the issue is made big I don't understand why a lot of these people pushing for their own agenda on bitcoin create a coin wherein they can put all their ideas and prove to other people that their ideas are indeed better. If they believe that their advocacies and their possible additions to bitcoin is good, why not fork bitcoin and start putting in some actual work? Bitcoin's code has been politicized to death, and those who continue to shove their great ideas on other people doesn't even seem to do anything on their own at all.",

So a middle ground is a dedicated thread, such news gets reported there and can be countered or reported and does not give much publicity.Quote from: NdaMk on August 29, 2022, 02:49:03 PMBut since Elon Musk acquisition of twitter there have been few changes I don't know maybe this procedure still works though AFAIK, Elon Musk has not acquired Twitter yet.Last I heard, there was the argument about audits on how many percentage of users are bots and that seemed to be the deal breaker, for now.",

Well if he has change his mind against bitcoin then so be it. And the more he open his mouth, the more obvious that he really didn't know what bitcoin is, and you can just shake your head with his arguments.",
