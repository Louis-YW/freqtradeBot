  "content": "I have too much to do in my life I do not want to be bother to set up an LN node or a new wallet.First off if you mine you can do this for free on the correct mining services.I am going to create a thread that shows what places will offer you LNI will only show a service I used with success.MIND YOU ANY SERVICE CAN CLAIM WE GOT HACKED AND FUCK YOU HARDSo far as a miner on more than 1 pool or service only nicehash is offering free easy peasy LNTHE catch is simple they can go bust and screw you.SO using nicehash is for small amounts of btc do not think  you are going to carry $1000's in your nicehash wallet.other catch  KYCBut here goes today I did my first ever LN send using my nicehash wallet which I fill via mining.BTW you can fill your nicehash wallet by mining by an LN deposit or by a standard but costly deposit on regular block chain.I don't want this to seem like a nicehash ad as I am trying to list three or four ways to access changing this a bit = non-custodial LN sending methods.the accounts are not self custody (you do not have the keys)this to me means the accounts are non-custodial (meaning you do not have the keys)all this means is what you keep on nicehash  can be stolen as nicehash hold the keys.",

You have funds there.  I quoted your post and then deleted the original. As I simply do not understand your point.I will say to all again do not keep a lot of funds in any of my suggestions. my suggestions are all non- custody. ie you can lose everything that is in them.these are a small change purse for people.In my case on nicehash I mine 1000-2000 worth of kawpow monthly  which auto verts to BTCI empty the wallet once a month and distribute the coins to 4 people.So my balance goes from 0 to 2000 $ of BTC monthly.I fully recognize NICE hash can say we are hacked and I lose 0-2000 usd worth of BTC. as this is a non custody account. edit (I have no custody as I have no keys thus non-custody)the 0-2000 a month is a small part of the funds I handle I do not advise anyone to put more than 10% of funds in nice hash.But if you need heat and want to do kyc with nice hash the added bonus is you can use it LN wallet easy peasy.the s19 makes  like $10.00 a day and it costs 75 watts a day so. at 12 cent power it is break even but if you send it to a nice hash account all of a sudden you have money to send at low cost.the send I did above was. 0.00000014 btc that is cheap.",

Anyway, maybe it's my lack of knowledge on the subject that I'm still talking about.I will pay attention to your comments on this topic.I recently set up a Bitcoin node again, with the aim of trying to set up an LN channel. But, as long as there isn't a minimally viable solution in Windows, I shouldn't set up this channel. Therefore, an analysis of the various options at this point will be very interesting to observe.",

So send 0.00000200 btc with a 3 sat fee true cost zero and the mempool stays fully clogged at the 1 to 3 sat level.2) major btc miner /pool foundry which is a hidden pool as you need over 20ph to join it. make 48 blocks a day.  So down clock from 48 to 40 for 5 days at beginning of a 14 day diff period.    you lose 5 x 8 = 40 blocks right now that is 40 x 6.25 = 250 coins but in 4 months that is 125 coinsso pay 250 coins for 5 days. fees go to 3btc due to less blocks  getting made up 2 coins a block next 9 days overclock and make 50 blocks a  day so 2 x 50 x 9 = 900 extra fees in coins.  if you pay 250 coins to make 900 seems good but the risk is you do not raise fees enough with the 5 days of under clocking.but when the ½ ing happens you pay 125 coins to raise the fees 900 coins same profit ½ the risk.your way to combat it is LN or LTC+ DOGE sends for small amounts.Look If I send 1 btc to Tesla to buy a truck I do not care if I pay 100 dollars in fees. so big sends are okayNow all of the above post is off topic.  It is the under lying set of reasons to push people into LN and or LTC/DOGEmy thread here is for miners and traders and spenders of BTC.if you buy and hodl it is also good for you.here is why.take kraken for a DCA GUY  that wants to get coins off and into a wallet.Send cash to kraken buy BTC and send it whenever you want to your own wallet that does LN like electrum.  That will be covered in another post when I show what wallets will give you LN without a ton of insane work.So for me having nicehash and kraken has a money value but causes risk for that value.I can mine all the gear to nicehash send it to kraken often at next to no cost then send it to myself and partners electrum ln wallets.It is work to do it daily or even weekly but it is too much mining earnings too do it monthly.I do it every 10 days. which is still a lot of work.I do see a side effect here for a guy that wants to mine and is willing to do KYC he can mine to nicehash and have a working LN service. which if fees are high and he does a lot of sends has quite a value.  So an s19 is earning about 130% of a block that is a reflection of the high fees.",

SO I went nicehash I realize I had to ask kraken what I wanted.went to nicehash wallet picked deposit picked LN and generated a long code so step 9 below not done.step 10 approve  an email from your kraken account \"Confirm your new withdrawal address  A new withdrawal address was just added to your account. Check the details below and confirm it within the next 60 minutes only if you recognize it. LocationUnited StatesIP Address**.***.***.*** Keep in mind that approving withdrawal addresses you don't recognize can put your funds at risk. Confirm address Didn't add this new address? In this case, your account might be at high risk and you should Contact our Support team immediately.\"step 11 for a first time only (I think) step 12",

For me personally having the two is enough.But I have an electrum I can show that here. Even if it is ten or more steps. It is self custody.once I do the electrum. I will look into munn and robosats.This thread will likely have legs as I do not see us under 50 sats a byte for a long time.the transaction count for 100 sats is over 40000 so another day of high fees is on us.",
