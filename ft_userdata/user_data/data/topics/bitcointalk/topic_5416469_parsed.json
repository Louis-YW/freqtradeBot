  "content": "The carbon footprint poses a serious threat to the world right now.  We need to reduce the carbon footprint rate to 2 tons globally by 2050.  The world average is currently 4. However, if we are not careful, it may increase day by day. So how can we, as humans, reduce our carbon footprint? Each Country's Share of CO2 EmissionsEven if we can't do all of these, if we try to do a few of them, our efforts will be rewarded.  Let's not forget that we only have one world.  We must work together to leave a healthy future for our children.  I hope countries show enough importance to this.Sources :1) https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/carbon-footprint-calculator/2) https://www.texascoastalexchange.org/reducing-your-carbon-footprint.html3) https://co2living.com/what-is-a-carbon-footprint-updated-2021/4) https://co2living.com/reduce-your-carbon-footprint-7-instant-ways/5) https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions",

      "body": "Bitcoin miners should collaborate with farmers to capture methane which is worse than carbon in some ways. Maybe the farmers could pool together their resources into small groups depending on the location. So four to ten nearby farms build one community owned BTC mine together and split the costs and profits. Waste would be stored adjacent/other side of wall, to the miners this would supply heat to the bioreactors to create a closed loop cycle. After the methane is captured the bio waste will go through another process to extract ethanol and finally the rest can be used as fertilizer. I've heard of a few farmers already using this method to generate electricity but are missing the mining aspect to it, which should create even greater efficiencies. Also S.N. already invented a diesel fuel saving device that you can build yourself. I found it and started using it. Page 10 of this section if your are interested? I think he is on to something! The more people learn about it, the better.",
