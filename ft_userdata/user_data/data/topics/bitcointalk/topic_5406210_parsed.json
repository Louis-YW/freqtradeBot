BTC is still the non-stablecoin coin that has the least risk, hence why it's mostly down less compared to other alts when in bear markets.Quote from: Eternad on July 14, 2022, 06:36:58 AMBecause of exchange bot trader. The bot determines if the sentiment of the market and reduce the order that they set in accordance to the sentiment. That’s why most of coins move on the same direction except for those token that has an active trading activities against the trend like when the project has big announcements or exchange listing which gives the sentiment signal to the bot.Market makers on exchange is made bot and only few of them is from traders.Sorry but, wtf is this??",

The price is mostly controlled by bitcoin price, do not get me wrong, I mean when people are buying bitcoin, they are buying altcoins too, when they are selling bitcoin, they are selling altcoins too. That is crypto market and that is the reason.Quote from: mk4 on July 14, 2022, 06:53:21 AMMostly because bitcoin (BTC) still acts as sort of the \"index\" of the cryptocurrency space (just like the SPY with stocks), and that BTC trading pairs have the most trading volume and market liquidity.This is how it will always be, that is how cryptocurrencies are, following the same trends, but percentage rise or fall always differs.",

How can the prices of 100s of cryptos all move in the same direction at the same time?The simple term is pairs or pairing in trades. Just like what we see in the foreign exchanges, many of them have the USD in the majority and the same goes for most countries' economies. If USD moves higher this time, you see that other countries' exchange rate for their USD is also increasing but their local currency is getting weaker.The same goes for the crypto, the bitcoin, and the altcoin market. Most of the time it is correlated but there are times that it is indirectly related. The majority of the exchanges have the pair for bitcoin and Ethereum and that's why they're moving altogether.",

Have in mind that nobody has ever taken control of the market which is why you can't and never say they all go in the same direction at the same time. If that will happens, we are going to say that the market lies on one hand, in fact, traders and whales could somehow affect the market trend and change its direction.I would agree to have the same direction and that is because of the influence of Bitcoin on the market, however, this will never connect to see them it drops at the same - that kinda be a big coincidence.",

If the liquidity is higher against btc the coin/token has a chance to follow it better (arbitrage bots are likely to trade these to keep the prices close if it's profitible to do so - exchanges may do arbitrage themselves too but it's unlikely). This also probably stays true for eth too as lots of people that buy bitcoin might buy eth so if the bitcoin market starts to drop then the eth market can follow just because people have invested in both and sold both at close enough intervals.",

These market makers provides most of the liquidity on CEX and it's not all from retail traders that's why you can see that order books price keeps updating every seconds. This is same with altcoin sentiment, The orderbook adjust based on the current sentiment which creates a fake volume of buying and selling when there's a trend. Just like what you explain, BTC serves as an Index while market maker use that as reference for the movement.",

And the answer is yes, which explains why most coins move in the same direction bitcoin moves most of the time.",

They decide when the market pumps or dump due to the large funds available to them and their stakes in the large exchanges that dominate the volume in the exchange business. There has been a theory that this Whales, VCs etc has a hand in every coins that get to be ranked high in the industry as such profit massively and if you dig deeper, the evidence are there. That been said, the industry is heavily correlation and moves in similar directions. Bitcoin is the standard unit of measurement in the industry as whatever direction it goes altcoins naturally follow, altcoins are heavily been paired with Bitcoin for trading and Bitcoin currently controls over 40% dominance of the market. That means the Whales, exchanges just have to paint a scenario then the whole market follows, exchanges also has the bots trades helping them in painting this scenario of market been bought up or sell pressure incoming which trigger days traders to make similar trades and puts  the whole market in one direction.",

Plus most coins are tied to bitcoin pairs, which means that when bitcoin goes up, and the pair stays the same, then the price of it stays the same. Think about it this way, if one bitcoin is 20k dollars, and there is a pair like btc-xyz and that xyz equals to one bitcoin, then one xyz is also 20k dollars as well.When one bitcoin becomes 50k but xyz is still one bitcoin, then xyz will become 50k as well. This is how the market goes up and down all together, the altcoins that are tied to bitcoin will go up and down when bitcoin price goes up and down.",

It doesn't really matter which exchange you look at because they are all connected, there can't be two different prices for one crypto coin on different exchanges. If that was the case traders could just buy the coin on one exchange and sell it on other to make a free profit. The market risk is also what makes most stock prices move. Stocks are highly correlated to each other, like crypto currencies. If blue chip stocks drop, so will also the small cap companies.
