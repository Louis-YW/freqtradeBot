So, I could be sure that something had been wrongCan someone try to guess an explanation of something like this?It wasn't necessary to create a topic in the gambling board for this issue. You could simply post this in the ANN thread of Freebitco. @TheQuin is the only person who can give a real solution for your issue. You have to send him a PM by including your Freebitco user id.As a user of Freebitco, I have never faced such issues there. It may happen for a DDoS attack, but I'm not sure about it.",

I have no issue with responding here but if I don't get told the thread exists I'm unlikely to see it.It's a difficult thing for me to check, all I can really see is what is on your roll history. On the 28th it looks like you've been saving up your WoF spins and took 674 at the same time. I've asked wetsuit (the site admin) to take a look and I'll update you when I get any more information.",

Curiosities:Outcome from my 1,945 (*) WOF recently saved mostly from exchanging RP by WOFSat 43,604RP  47,828LT  55,806 (zero Sat in two Weekly Draws)GT       4 (Draw to come in October 2023)(*) To calculate the outcome per WOF, consider 2,145 WOF, because there was a rare bug on redeeming RP for WOF.My conclusion: It was very worth the fun although not every RP that I have redeemed. Questions? Inputs?My input would be that results are entirely dependent on luck. I'm not convinced there is any bug that only affected one person. There haven't been any changes and the systems have all been in place for years without any problems.",
