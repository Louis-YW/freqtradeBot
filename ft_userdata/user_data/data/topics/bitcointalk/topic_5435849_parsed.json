It's tough to tell if you'll actually get your money back. It's vital to do your homework before depositing any money at an online casino, as not all of them can be trusted.

It’s just 1xbit is blatant scammer and the chance for your money to get back is very slim. Their customer support is obviously just giving reason to declined your request for your money to stuck in there. By simply checking their Tron address balance on the tronscan clearly they received the money. I’m just surprised now that they not even allowed you to play before they pull there scam scheme.Only local authorities can help you to recover your money. Bitcointalk forum can’t do any further besides the negative trust feedback they got on there profile here. Don’t waste time complaining because there’s a lot of unsolved cases about them. Sorry for your losses.",

It has made people aware since long ago. Why did you use this platform anyway? The campaign they are running on the forum is also inundated with scams. They don't pay people for their campaigns. They send their accounts there themselves and take their weekly dollars. Everyone is aware of this scam platform. No one should fall into the trap of deception. You can't do anything by complaining here. Big members have been revealing about the scam for a long time.",
