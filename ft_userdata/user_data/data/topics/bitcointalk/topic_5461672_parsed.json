  "content": "Website | Presale | Twitter | Telegram | WhitepaperUnlike other cryptocurrencies, the Satoshi Coin would implement novel consensus mechanisms, designed to be more energy-efficient and eco-friendly, while maintaining the core principles of decentralization and security.üåêWebsite: https://satoshicoin.co.uk (Our main website is the .pro / We also bought the .co.uk domain and redirected it to .pro, because BitcoinTalk flags the .pro domains as suspicious)üí¨Telegram: https://t.me/SatoshiCoinSATüê¶Twitter: https://twitter.com/SatoshiCoinSATPoCP Is A New ProtocolProof of Computing Power (PoCP) is an innovative and eco-friendly coin mining algorithm that sets a new standard in the world of cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithms, PoCP harnesses the existing computational power of users' computers without consuming any additional resources to produce new coins.The core concept of PoCP revolves around reading the computer's specifications, such as CPU, GPU, and RAM, to determine the power it contributes to the network. Based on this analysis, the algorithm then calculates the rewards that the user is entitled to, making it a fair and transparent system for distributing coins.Both mining and staking will use the PoCP protocol and rewards will last until 2050, to ensure all SAT is rewarded during our lifetime.Mining, Staking With PoCP And The Halving Events- Run the app and mine SAT, no SAT required, this ensures adoption of new participants in the ecosystem- Stake and mine SAT, stakers get a much higher reward rate than Non-SAT holders- Using PoCP, your system and holdings determines your reward rate- Mining and staking lasts until 2050, so this is a long term rewards system like Bitcoin mining- Satoshi Coin will have a halving event each year, this event will half rewards each year until 2050- Due to yearly halving, rewards start off being larger and as the years go by the reward rate reduces making the token scarcer which should drive price as users will need to stake more to earn the same rewards as the previous year- Available on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android and iOSTax is 5% and is used to fundmarketing and development as well as buy WBTC on the Ethereum network. The contract has a safeguard in place where the taxes cannot be increased past 10%. This gives added peace of mind to investors.THE MECHANICS1. Environmentally Friendly: PoCP doesn't require energy - intensive mining operations, making it an eco-conscious alternative to traditional algorithms. 2. Accessibility: The application is easy to set up and use, allowing a broader user base to participate in the coin mining process. 3. Fair Rewards: The reward distribution system is based on the actual computational power contributed by each user's computer. This ensures that rewards are allocated fairly, encouraging participation and fostering a stronger and more inclusive community. PRESALE - ‚è∞ Presale Start Time Is 17:22 UTC On 2nd August 2023. This Was The Time Satoshi Was Last Heard From In 2010!A presale consisting of three phases.Each phase has its benefits and we encourage investors to enter early in order to get the best price per $SAT. The presale is fully automated. Investors are able to invest in ETH, BNB or USDT on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Claiming tokens will be available at the end of the sale via the website.PHASE ONE1 SAT = $0.23PHASE TWO1 SAT = $0.50PHASE THREE1 SAT = $1The presale has three phases, the earlier you buy the more SAT you get in the early phases.SAT TOKENOMICS21M Total Supply - Just like Bitcoin, a 21M fixed supply5% Tax - Small tax to ensure full growth of the project1% WBTC - Just like Bitcoin, a 21M fixed supply2% Marketing - Marketing will be extensive and as well as the presale funds, this part of the tax will be used to grow the visibility of the project2% Development - This aspect of the tax is used to develop the platform further and add to the presale funds to ensure longevity of the projectJeet Protection - $SAT is protected by a brand new unique jeet protection system, which ensures panic sellers can not harm the chartREWARDS & HALVINGRewards are earned via mining and staking and rewards will last until 2050 and Satoshi Coin will have a halving event each year, this event will half rewards each year until 2050. This means rewards start off being larger and as the years go by the reward rate reduces making the token scarcer which should drive price as users will need to stake more to earn the same rewards as the previous year.Rewards can be earned in a variety of ways in Satoshi Coin. ‚Ä¢ PoCPStaking‚Ä¢ WBTC Loyalty RewardsPoCPStaking rewards are rewards earned via our PoCP app on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. These are based on your computational power (CPU,GPU and RAM) and your holdings. A more powerful computational profile will yield higher rewards.Rewards will last until 2050.REWARDSThe Satoshi Coin apps will provide a full dashboard for mining, staking, deposits, withdrawals, claiming and many other stats and historical data about rewards as well as PoCPstats. Rewards are calculated using our own scoring algorithm which is based on the hardware of a users system, the better the score, the better your earning rate when it comes to mining and staking SAT tokens.Rate = Daily Reward Rate / Total Network PoCP Power * My PoCP PowerThis will give users their own reward rate per day, improving hardware can improve your daily reward rate.ROADMAPHeavy MarketingThis includes reaching top influencers, callers as well as lsiting on the top crypto sites such as CoinMarketCao, CoinGecko, Dextools. Dextools trending and Dextools ads too as well and much more.PoCP StakingPoCP(Proof of Computing Power) is staking based on system specifications. Anyone can run a PoCPnode but holders will get a better earnings boost than non-holders.Proof Of Stake AppAn app which will allow you to manage your PoCPnodes and boost your earnings rate.Bitcoin Rewards App1% of all taxes go towards BTC rewards as a loyalty program for the most loyal holders. This app will allow you to manage your rewards such as claim them or re-invest them.Tier One CEX ListingsTier One CEX listings are all we will focus on, we will not waste time on sub standard CEX listings.Bitcoin ForkSatoshi Coin will create a new fork of BTC once adoption is achieved on our PoCP protocol.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, Proof of Computing Power (PoCP) introduces an innovative and eco-friendly approach to coin mining, revolutionizing the cryptocurrency landscape. With its focus on environmental sustainability, accessibility, and fairness. PoCP has the potential to attract a wide range of users and establish itself as a leading algorithm in the world of cryptocurrencies. By continuously seeking improvement and engaging the community, PoCPcan pave the way for a more inclusive and sustainable digital currency future. Satoshi Coin is here to change the landscape and provide investors a safe and unique way to earn rewards in many ways whilst been involved in the protocol.",
