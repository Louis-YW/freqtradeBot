  "content": "They're those whose responses about bitcoin are always positive and others who were skeptical about bitcoin that are now full-time bitcoiners. It's clear that such people and responses still exist in recent times, and many users of bitcoin fall prey to the negative predictors. This thread is about two significant people in cryptocurrency; Hal Finney and Michael Saylor who predicted the future of bitcoin, one was positive, the other negative. The false prediction failed and the predictor, Michael Saylor, is now big and deep into bitcoin to an extent of dropping his position as the CEO of Micro strategy to invest completely into bitcoin. Sometimes, those who have negative thoughts about bitcoin end up becoming full-time bitcoiners in the future and that's a good reason bitcoin users should stay strong in this journey. In the year 2010 Hal Finney's predictions about bitcoinThis is a bullish prediction and if the banks should adopt bitcoin that means they'll be a spike in bitcoin price. Though it looks uncertain, if Michael Saylor after making such a tweet about bitcoin is, today, a big investor of bitcoin then the banks despite the rivalry could change their minds about bitcoin. As I pointed out in my intro, most people must have changed their minds against bitcoin after reading this tweet. How will they feel to see that Michael Saylor is now for bitcoin? They'll feel disappointed and regret listening to him at first. In summary, stay strong with this journey as those whose perspectives are against bitcoin will definitely, one day, adopt the currency, even the banks. Photo Credit; https://twitter.com/pete_rizzo_",

If you count as Michael Saylor bitcoin predictor to predict about bitcin prices and how bitcoin is gonnabe ifthe future he's laywas positive and always wants people to stay strong even during the bear market and don't sell anything.Also he biliaves in bitcoin and that'swhy he had bought amounts of bitcoins recently, even if the market price is falling he is possitiv and don't see any new about him selling anything during these days that's why I call him a bitcoin maximalist.",

The likes of Michael Saylor always draw conclusions to stuff they do not have knowledge about just to gain social media fame. Sadly the Gen Z are quick to believe almost everything on social media and that's why we see shit coins use the so call social media celebrities to advertise there projects.Bitcoin is already proving its doubters wrong and just like Saylor many will definitely eat their words and come back to it. Nonetheless no predictions or predictors should be trusted to the core, your personal research is always save.",

Good thing that Michael Saylor did not let pride to get in his way and was still able to make public his decision that he finally has nothing against bitcoins after his former stance about it. It also shows that most persons with negative ideas about bitcoins actually are in need for someone to come convince them, that is they need convincing. Do not give up on people who are still skeptical, maybe talking to them can change their minds.",

This will make governments know what they're doing and know what they're want, let's say you're really need new device, then a random sales can knock your door and offer the device you want with a discount, of course they will make easy profit by this!Banks and governments are really dangerous entity, everyone need to be worried when the governments are using technology to track everyone else.",

In most cases these inventor are seen as lunatics by most persons and there would always be doomsday prediction about such invention or innovative product. Some persons due to pride would keep holding their negative views about a product even after they have known the truth about such invention. I really appreciate Micheal Saylar for swallowing his pride and retracing his path.     QuotePeople should not change their minds about anything because of what someone else tweeted, they should research and find out information by themselves. Even if there are people who listened to him then, there is still room to accommodate them all right now .I also was a critic of Bitcoin. But my own attack was born out of ignorance and lack of education. I viewed Bitcoin like other shitcoins that were mainly developed to defraud and scam people. I had this perception because of the high rate ponzi schemes that disguised themselves as crypto investments. But with the growth of Bitcoin awareness in my location, I was introduced and exposed to the right Bitcoin education that led to the opening of my mind. And it led to my total deliverance from ignorance and conversion to the Bitcoin world of unending opportunities.",

I am not saying I am a good investor in this industry but rather, to simply point out that in any category of investor you'd fall, it is either loss or profit you'd meet simply because there are no consistencies in this industry.",
