I do not always tell people about Cloudbet because they do not have active official account on this forum. Keep messaging their customers care.I have seen issues like this before that were later solved. You can send PM to their account on this forum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=154563Official thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=333552.msg3578010#msg3578010People always have similar complaint: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=154563",

Keep bugging the hell out of them in their customer support emails with followups, and hopefully they return your request or even update you with what's happening. They've not scammed people before albeit the neutral feedback on their profile, though if I were you, I would really feel worried about that funds stuck on a platform that is not visible nor active here in this forum.",

      "body": "First off, let me just start this with an \"I told you so\". It's been established since time immemorial that you shouldn't use gambling site accounts as a repository for your funds, even if you're a high roller. Secondly, why would you not read the instructions/terms before logging in? It's been established that you'd have to undergo some form of KYC first and foremost before you deposit anything just to make sure that your funds won't get locked out. Best thing to do right now is to actually just wait for them to resolve your issue, not sure if they have a dedicated thread in this forum that you can go to to make them aware of your issue, but for now, remember the above pointers and never gamble belligerently again.",

If you see them actively answering your inquiries regarding on your case then maybe all is fine. But if you see them ignoring you and 2 weeks it already take 2 weeks or more maybe its best to post a scam accusation thread and call them out about your issue.",

I think they're taking the security of users account seriously as a precautionary measure against fraud. But don't worry once they verified it they will expedite your withdrawal process.They should at least inform the reason for blocking the players so they can defend it and provide necessary documents to prove it.Still the best solution here is to communicate with Cloudbet, if they still have no update then try to escalate this on their social media platform. Too sad to experience this where you gamble on a KYC free site and yet, they will still ask you with this one if you are already winning and wants to get your money.",

You should be a bit patient with them as the customer care said and I think that after the verification is done,you will have your account unlock. Next time don't rush into depositing into any platform if you haven't complete their verification to avoid this same scenario. It is not to deposit that gives you access to the gambling site but your verification will give you full access to enjoy the platform.",

Or has it been a long time but you have never used it for gambling and there has never been any deposit in your gambling account?If that's all true, then it's only natural that the casino will ask you to verify everything before giving you that verification. Usually, the verification varies from one casino to another. It depends on the number of queues at the verification section so the team needs to ensure by checking in more detail. And if your account is new and you deposit $10k, it will ring the alarm from the casino so they ask you to do KYC. So be patient first, waiting for the check to finish.",

When that happens, you will be really stressed, especially since you expect a large amount of funds to be released from their platform.But maybe the only thing you can do right now is to wait and be mean in sending a message to their customer suppport because if you stop you will still lose in the end",

Many people have this issue of verification after they deposit money. I agree on this especially if you have high amount of balance to be deposit because casino frequently ask for KYC on high volume accounts. I remember that Cloudbet has a very bad reputation on verifying user account because there’s a case here before that Cloudbet ask a very peculiar way to verify account to the point that is very hard to follow like taking picture outside holding newspaper or something. Doing KYC before will save time and hassle when withdrawing the balance since casino usually don’t have any reason to withhold the account unless it has some violation.",
