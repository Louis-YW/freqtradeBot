The forum is a place to learn.Â  If you have a white-collar job, you have to an extent a level and measure of job security from your appointment letter unlike the forum where there is no appointment letter. Also maybe the value of what you earn here in the forum is very high in your local currency, maybe that is why you are thinking like this, If what you earn here is not big in your local currency, you will know that the forum is not a job, it gives you an opportunity to get and gather bitcoins while learning more about bitcoin.",

Guys, what did you think?Member will always advise that you shouldn't see the forum as a full-time job because the jobs here are not permanent. Your signature campaign can end and you might not immediately get another one which will affect your finance. Seeing the forum as a full-time job might also make one deviate from the main purpose of the forum which is learning. I don't know your location but some jobs pay better than what one can earn from the forum. This forum indeed offers few opportunities to earn but many members earn more from other areas because most of them are professionals in different fields. And I think you should be engaged in other viable sectors of the economy of your country.I am not a fan of relying totally on government jobs because they pay peanuts in my country. Every civil servant that doesn't want to suffer from lack and want should ensure they save and invest in a business. Owning your house could be a good investment option in my country becauase of high cost of rent. Buying and hodling bitcoin might not also be a bad investment platform. I am not thrilled by pension and gratuity because they don't guarantee a good standard of living.",

Guys, what did you think?I am not sure what kind of white-collar jobs are you talking about if you think bitcointalk would pay more or would be more secure? I have a paying job and this is a hobby to me. If i would rely purely on the bounties, i would be soon homeless. If you want to trade or hold cryptos then by all means do, we all do. But relying 100% something so volatile as crypto is just irresponsible. I am hoping if you do that, then you are only responsive of yourself, because if you are relying in crypto with your money that you need every day, and you need to provide for your family. Then as a someone who has seen few huge bear runs, some point you are going to be in trouble. Because you can't calculate volatility as huge as this for your budjet",

See the forum as an alternative place to make profit and not a first choice of employment, so that you don't ruin your future incase things turn out the other way round.

And a little brainstorming brought me to the only understanding that, the company we advertise are the source of the income we gain no matter how little it is since signature payments were just incentives for being active in the forum. So if I am a physical brand ambassador of a gambling company it then means the source of my income is from the casino until my contract expires with them, I may be wrong though. Looking forward to reading more from you, am curious to know more about the legitimacy of our payments from the signature. Thanks, the boss in anticipation!",

In addition, managers require a certain quality of posting, and a certain minimum frequency of activity.This is globally beneficial for the forum, it guarantees that at least a part of the regular active users post consistently, and with good quality posts. But in my opinion, you will only reach the necessary rank by acting as a normal member of the forum, and settling in, making quality posts. If the only motivation of a member is to farm an account to access the campaigns, it shows, and in general this member will not reach the necessary rank to participate in the said campaigns.In my country, the signing campaigns offer almost the equivalent of a local minimum wage. However, I prefer to keep my job (I'm lucky enough to earn much more than the legal minimum) and tell myself that I'll leave this second salary in BTC, for the future. If I had to rely solely on forum wages for my daily life, it could be stressful. And I remain convinced that doing it out of need, and not out of desire, would influence the quality of the posts.

Guys, what did you think?Your argument with your friends is unarguable, but you became overly reliant on this forum, which is not supposed to be the case. Working as a forum member in a signature paid campaign or as a bounty hunter on occasion does not guarantee you long-term employment. If the signature or bounty campaign ends, it means your work has come to an end as well. It is not advisable to rely on the forum as your primary source of income, but rather as a side hustle to supplement your other earnings. One thing you'll take away from this forum is the knowledge you've gained about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.The white collar job can be relied on, as you are confident that it will last you for the number of years specified in the country's constitution. The issue with white collar jobs is that they do not pay on time, do not cover all of your needs, and so on. whether bitcointalk forum or white collar job, it's advisable you hold on to both as both has their advantages and value it'll add to one's life.",

I thought we are here to learn one or more things about Bitcoin, crypto at large and other aspects of human dealings. For the clarity sake, OP should understands that this forum was/is not a working place initially. The paid signature campaign and bounty campaigns is the reason some users are misled hence, thinking here is a working place. Note that, the forum shall remain with or without running signature campaigns and bounties.There are high chances you might not get selected for a campaign for several weeks or months or even get removed in a campaign due to some reasons. White collar jobs are mostly permanent and pensionable. That means when you are retired, you're eligible for pension and gratuities. Here, once you're out of campaign that is all.In essence and conclusion, never you assume Forum as working place but a learning place and if you are lucky to be earning then it will be a bonus to your real life earning. The fact is get something doing out of forum.",
