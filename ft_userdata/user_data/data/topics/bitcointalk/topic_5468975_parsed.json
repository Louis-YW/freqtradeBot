I find this impressive because all of his wins did not go to the judges' scorecards, meaning this boxer has power, which I think would really match Ryan Garcia. Judging by his record and Ryan's, I expect that this fight is going to be a war, a toe-to-toe battle where only one man is left standing in the end. A KO is likely to happen, and as for who would win, I don't know, but most likely it's Ryan (hopefully).",

Maybe he had as good record of sort and climbing in the ranks. But I guess this is just a tune up for Ryan, just to get his mind going and forget about his lost to Tank Davis.Just remember though that he is under Derrick James and he has back to back loses from big fights, Spence and Charlo.Perhaps this could be redemption time for Ryan and for his trainer/coach as well.",

      "body": "Another tough fight for Ryan Garcia. Oscar Duarte is a power puncher too. His last 11 fights are either KO or TKO. I think Ryan will need a big preparation before he battles this man. 34 years old against 25 years old, a large gap in age but I don't think it will matter for the older boxer because he had been putting his opponents down in the mat. But if Ryan Garcia can win this, he will get his name back on track. It's true, I think this is the weight that he is more confident in and the perfect one for him. 140 lbs. Defeating Duarte might shoot his rank up and give him a chance for a title match in his next few fights. But he needs to win again.",

Romero and Lopez are fighters who can give a good fight he needs to win this before he can dare these fighters to face him, of course, you need something to brag about before challenging champions.",

Ryan Garcia is the A-side here, if there is one that will put this kind of ridiculous clause it will be him. But I doubt that he will do that because he doesn't want the boxing community that he won because of this rehydration clause.So it's a straight up 140 lbs limit and then they can rehydrate both to maybe as high as 150 lbs during the fight night and nothing will change. But I do agree that it's a tough fight for him. But Ryan should take care of Duarte here, and hopefully the experience he got from the Davis fight is good enough for him to overcome adversaries if there will be one in this fight.",

With his opponent Oscar Duarte, I think he'll be able to match up well, and most likely, he will dominate again. I hope to see him bounce back, as it was reported before his fight with Tank Davis that he had faced a mental problem. Maybe that problem came back when he was defeated via KO by Tank Davis. So, this upcoming fight of his is really interesting, as we will find out if he is still the same guy.",

He is coming off a knockout loss so I don't consider this a cherry pick. They could have chosen someone with more losses and less power. This is the kind of test that Ryan Garcia needs before he can fight another champion. There's no doubt Garcia will be the favorite but if the odds are too lopsided that it isn't very profitable to bet on him then it becomes really tempting to pick the underdog.",

His fights are mostly in Mexico, and most of his opponents have worst win-lost records. So obviously what he face in Mexico is what other boxing pundits call \"cab drivers\". They are pitted against Duarte to pad his record and to look like he is really have that kind of power. So for me, this is win-win situation for Ryan, in paper his opponents looks like a knockout artist, but I'm seeing that Ryan will win here by an impressive knockout and bring back his confidence again in the ring. This seems to be just a tune up and cherry pick fight, obviously, after that devastating lost to Tank Davis, he will have to start from scratch and restore his self-esteem again to be called \"King\" Ry.",

That is true, although the pressure if not that high if he is facing a fighter like the caliber of Oscar Duarte. No offense to Oscar, his record is very impressive at 26-1-1 with 21 coming via knockout. But I do agree with the observation of others, this is a cherry pick fight and hopefully it will not turn bad to Ryan Garcia otherwise it might take years to recover if he losses to someone like a B-fighter in Duarte. And who knows, maybe if he losses here then he could go on another depression and mental struggles and perhaps this time it will be hard for him to overcome it. I'm seeing another Campbell fight for Ryan, he might struggle a bit but once he found his range he could score a lightning fast knockout, maybe rounds 5-8. And I'm seeing here Ryan to be the outstanding favorite regardless of what record Oscar Duarte has.",

He may have been marketed as the next big thing but most fans are well aware of his limitations. The hype surrounding him is based more on his popularity than his talent. Golden Boy is going to match him carefully until they can cash out on him right before his contract expires. It'll be interesting to see if he can win impressively and remain a PPV attraction or if he will get exposed by one of these fringe contenders like Duarte before he is even able to challenge another champion.",
