Bitcoin_Arena Already explained about the ad slot which you thought was a signature. I would like to add more about this. This user is On Newbie rank on this forum so far. You should be aware; Newbies can use 40 characters on their signature space. Also, I don't think I have seen animated Signature ever or at least animate on Hover. BTW, Quoted a post for a better understanding of Signature space.Quote from: theymos on February 26, 2014, 09:15:18 PM- Newbie: No styling (including links) allowed.

That's why he was able to post an image.@tyzen, Project looks good. I haven't tried it yet. Since this is a wallet, You should add the 2FA feature.",
