This types of project cant be nothing but turning into a scam project, I think.I appreciate your thoughts. I am also adding my own time in developing the project however I am not a super skilled web developer. If need be I'll pay for the development directly.I appreciate there would have to be a level of trust here, but I am not asking for anyone to pay anything as I have already paid for the VPS to be used for the hosting. There won't be a pre-sale, post sale or any other sort of sale. The project is not designed to raise money or profit anyone.It is also not endless hours of work, I only need a simple static template for the site.",
