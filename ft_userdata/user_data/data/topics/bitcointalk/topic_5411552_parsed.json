With the exception that Cardano is capped at 45 billion coins, wouldn't the two be the exact same. Thus by looking at Cardano progress since its creation, can't we extrapolate that Ethereum price will follow a similar downward trend particularly since Etherem is not capped and can basically be printed infinitely to some degree?",
