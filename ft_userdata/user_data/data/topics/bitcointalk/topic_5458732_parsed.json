  "content": "Hi.I want to use USDT wallet. I found \"trust wallet\" service. However I have one concern. If trust wallet goes out of service, I guess I will lose my USDT address? Is there any way to recover that?I want to use a TRC20 wallet. How can I open a TRC20 wallet without third party service? Direct from center of USDT - not a third party service?Thank you.",

Those posts above mine have already suggested a good non-custodial wallet for you, I'd prefer you get a mobile phone to allow you use Ustoppable wallet instead of using Trust Wallet since it's an open source, unlike Trust Wallet that's closed.The only thing that's required of you now is to keep our secret phrases safe.",

Web or desktop software?Unfortunately, there are currently no desktop/web versions for it. See the developer's response from 2020[1].Trustwallet, SafePal, Exodus all either have a desktop wallet or a browser extension but as mentioned above, these are closed-source wallets. So if you don't want to go with that either, you have a couple of solutions:- Install Bluestacks (an android emulator) on your desktop and then use Unstoppable on it.- Or, if you're only interested in using USDT, you can use Tronlink extension.[1] https://github.com/horizontalsystems/unstoppable-wallet-android/issues/2463",
