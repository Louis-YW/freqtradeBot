The reason why Satoshi create Bitcoin is to avoid anything that can be controlled and manipulated by centralized entity. If you're choose a centralized project, I don't see any reason why you need to use crypto since banks and fiat are similar, the only difference is the price only.Don't forget many CEO abandon their project and run with investor money, that's the worst case why many people avoid centralized project.",

Are you talking about the custodial solutions used to store and stake your money or coins/tokens projects? If the latter, then I'm not familiar with the second project, but for projects using Cronos, or Binance's chain for example, then the danger here is mainly linked to the exchange's platform. All it would take for all the projects to die is for their exchanges to collapse. So if something like what happened to FTX, happens to either of Crypto.com or Binance.com, you can be certain that any project in either chain will die with them.",

Centralized project controls the decision and can any minute unload or unlock your funds in a system. This is alarming if ever there is something happened on their platform. It doesnt mean they are gonna do it but there are historical events where this happened in the past.Maybe the one you are using has strong ties or good reputation. If its centralized then good for them if they keep their clients well satisfied.",

They have a good reason why investors are afraid of keeping their coins in exchange it's not a false dilemma, there are present and clear dangers in storing your coins on exchanges after what happened to FTX, people should always be aware of the danger of custodial wallet and not owning your private keys means not owning your coins.QuoteI have Cronos and Sologenic in my wallet and I believe even with the going FUD they will bring me good profits or is there more that I should know? It's your choice and decision if you did your research and you believe that these two coins will yield you profit then it's good for you just protect your coins by doing the right thing and that is using a noncustodial wallet to store your coins of choice.",

Quote from: Lontor on December 19, 2022, 05:59:44 AMI thought keeping money in exchanges is the danger?The danger lies on the type of exchange you're using, we have a centralized exchange that has the custody of your wallet keys in their possession and such examples are the likes of hot wallet, mobile wallet etc. The second type is the decentralized exchange, which gives you access to your keys.",

Other than exchanges, danger of keeping shitcoins in any wallets, custodial or non-custodial, is even worse because it gives you false sense of securityShitcoins are like rotten bananas, they are worthless, and you know they will die sooner or later, so better exchange them for Bitcoin as soon as possible and keep this BTC in some cold wallet.Use exchanges only when you need to exchange coins with other coins or fiat, and choose decentralized exchanges like Bisq or other p2p alternatives.",
