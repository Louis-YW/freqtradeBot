      "body": "According to Reuters (I read the article a few hours ago): ftx us is financially unaffected by the investments. If there's enough funds to cover withdrawals in the Bahamas, there's a chance nothing will happen to him (arrest or prosecution wise) - the article I'd want to reference has since been shortened, it was very long and the parts of where ftx still has liquidity and where it doesn't don't seem to be mentioned. I kinda think he offered for the company to take on those risky holdings to bolster cryptos position and help keep them liquid, if so then it might be considered philanthropic and become hard for a judge to actually prosecute - especially if there was a strategy behind taking those holdings and selling them on fairly quickly which might be something that gets done or would've been soon on the original trajectory (in only a year or two).",

But then even today, there are still no clear regulations in crypto, not any finance regulating body willing to regulate crypto seeing the market as a hot potato due to this kind of systematic problem where every bear market there are companies that suddenly declare bankruptcy. I think he scammed big renowned people like Scaramucci. Using the funds of these people seriously gonna get him in trouble. Probably, thru this incident also a group will step up to bail out and act to regulate the crypto market thru FTX leadership.",

FTX extended loans to Alameda using money that customers had deposited on the exchange for trading purposes, a decision that Mr. Bankman-Fried described as a poor judgment call, according to the person.So, some guys gives an interview and you think is a base for an arrest!Let's wait and see if it's even like that, I'm starting to change my opinion on SBF, unlike Alex Mashinsky, which by the way is still free also, he seems more and more like a guy that actually believed in the nonsense he was saying, not that he is not guilty of all this mess but I don't think he did it just for financial gains.",

In this regard I think what we are seeing this year is going to lead to strict regulations, which in principle I don't think is bad if they take care of shitcoins and all these people who have dedicated themselves to create a shitcoin/token out of nothing, sell it to each other to raise the price and the market cap in an artificial way, and to end up setting up a racket like FTX.What worries me more is regarding Bitcoin, because there is already a European Parliament legislation underway to basically force KYC on all transactions with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, of any amount. Can you imagine this type of legislation spreading to the USA and other countries? Or for example, banning hardware wallets. There will always be a space for freedom and privacy in Bitcoin, but the question is how big. Very negative regulations can stifle the space.....",

To me they would be more likely to ban cryptocurrencies than to ban institutions from investing in them. And anyway, this cycle that was known as the one of institutional adoption, I would rather call it the one of \"institutional disappointment\", because in the cycle in which more institutions have invested than ever before, we are having the worst return of all cycles by far. Leverage, championed by the greatest institutional investor and the most media-acclaimed: Michael Saylor, is largely to blame for this. So I'm not so much concerned about institutions investing as I am about what regulations the public authorities are going to come up with now that CBDCs are in the pipeline.",
