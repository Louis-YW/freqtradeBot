And they did not respond anythingAny service asking you to make a deposit to be able to make a withdrawal is a scam. With asking them to allow you to deposit smaller amount, you are actually trying to decrease the amount of the money they will steal from you. Whatever amount you deposit, you will lose all that.",

Now I think they're scammers.I can share more about my story later after I process my feelings.What is their URL? We need to know that. Before sites that lists coins and exchanges like Coingecko and Coinmarketcap can list this exchange, it may be possible that they have headquarter and possible that they are traceable. What scammers use to do is that they find a domain name similar to a legit exchange domain name and use it to be scamming people, that is the reason I said you should let us know the correct URL for us to know if you are talking about the legit site or a fake one.",

They are creating a platform that takes the same name as a popular exchange platform, its template, or a domain close to the original domain, so we must not deposit our funds and deal on these scam platforms, no matter what promotions or advantages they offer, we have thousands of reliable exchange platforms in the crypto arena that make us not think in dealing with other exchange platforms, I will now report this scam platform that impersonates the official BaseFEX.com platform through the Namecheap registrar website.",
