      "body": "Quote from: SeeBiscuit on September 08, 2022, 01:26:30 PMFirst suggestion that caught my eye is that the \"Faucets\" section has no links yet. I suggest you link Freebitco.in as its unilaterally the most praised, most trusted to payout, and has quite a long history. You will surely reap good commissions from having your ref link there on your directory site.That may look profitable and we'll discuss it but we don't want any referral link or tracking link in our listing to avoid our directory from being abused we want the listing to be only links QuoteSecond suggestion is having a .onion copy of your site that is accessible through tor. Much of the Bitcoin community (more than a lot of people think), use tor on a daily basis. Any ref links that you add to the directory will surely see good traffic on tor, especially if you do the work to buy the super cheap ad space that's found on tor link index sites, scam/trusted sites, and tor search engines.Maybe we will include this in the future, I'll take note of this and maybe come out one in the futureQuoteI really don't have any other suggestions other than that. My knowledge of most things crypto is still rather new so those are the two things I can confidently say will help ya out. Cheers and good luck!That gives us an idea to include free courses on Cryptocurrency and blockchain for beginners.",
