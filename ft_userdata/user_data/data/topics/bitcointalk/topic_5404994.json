Is there any truth to this?Taproot can help to make multisig transactions to remain indistinguishable, this happen with the help of Schnorr signature in a way keys are aggregated into a single key which is require for spending. This will make multisig transactions to be very cheaper in transaction fee as even 15-of-15 multisig transactions will be like a single pubkey transaction.Taproot can also have benefit in lightning network in a way if two people that open a channel wants to closer the channel that was opened, they can both join their signature to produce just one which can be used to close the channel with also cheaper fee and indistinguishably, closing of the channel will also look like a single pubkey payment.Taproot makes atomic swap possible, possible with the help of Adaptive signature.But as for smart contract like that used for ERC20 and others like TRC20 and Solana, that is not included in Taproot. franky1 is right.",

So far they have not been able to attract many projects developers to use the network. If this is the same thing you hoping to happen with Taro why do you think they will be successful? Right, so technically, Bitcoin already can use smart contracts, and RSK yes, I mean I've even used Bitcoin-based/secured DEX like Counterparty (even got some satoshi dust on various Counterparty wallets still).But RSK really disappointed me -- in 2016/17 already I remember Bitcoin escrows being talked about (seriously, that's still the one big use case I  think should really be available today) and no workable consumer buwaytress-friendly version ever arrived (show me if I'm wrong, happy to be proven wrong!).",

Ever since the first bitcoin transaction in 2009 we have been using \"smart contracts\" in each and every one of our transactions. But bitcoin is a currency or a payment network so all its smart contracts aim to solve what a payment network needs.On the other hand shitcoins like ethereum are created to provide a very easy way to create useless shitcoins (aka tokens) in the shortest time which is why their implementation of smart contract is a copy of bitcoin's with additional stuff enabling the scammers to create thousands of useless shittokens.This will never happen in bitcoin. Others will continue creating sidechains and other projects on top of bitcoin though, to mimic useless platforms like ethereum. In fact this uselessness is the reason why old projects like RSK haven't gained any popularity whatsoever.",
