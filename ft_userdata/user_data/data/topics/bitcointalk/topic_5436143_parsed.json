  "content": "Vast.ai recently add the option to top up your account credit using crypto. Which is great, except... it's done using Crypto.com pay, a backwards payment processor that first of all requires you to pay from the app - which I don't have and can't run anyway, and in case I was willing to juggle around funds, I'd have to pay a premium in transaction fees making 2 transfers.So what I need is this:If you have the crypto.com app, I will send you some BTC (like around $100) , which you should receive in your crypto.com, and I'll also give you the login details to my Vast account so you can do the top up manually, after which I change the password for my account. I will cover the fees.Due to the high potential of fraud, I will only consider offers from established members.",
