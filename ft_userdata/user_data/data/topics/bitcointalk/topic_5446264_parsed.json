Another big reason is that this is a huge forum with complex dynamics, and even small policy changes can have big effects which need to be thought through very carefully.",

Too many changes were made in this forum software which maybe we did not notice. But, Upgrading to a new software would require modifying those features again, which is too time-consuming and theymos doesn't have it. Of course, he will be familiar with new codes as well once he starts to play with the new software. But, once again, He doesn't have this time.

If he doesn't have access, that could be a significant pain. Do you believe global moderators have access to the server? If I am not wrong, is Bitcointalk using a private server that could be located in one of the Admin's houses or offices, which is somehow protected? I could be wrong because it is a potential threat to them. They don't want to get traced by the hosting server on their place. It seems we are going off-topic. I will try to find out similar thread where it was discussed.",
