The best that will happen is a platform with such influence that any negative trust will push everyone to ignore your service, and thus the service provider will try to return the money to you, or at least scam will be severely reduced.There are actually services like ScamAdviser.com, but they do not provide much information, and some of them are wrong about the service not being a scam because it relies mainly on reports after scam happen.",

I feel that you are a bit too vague about what you do, I am a bit slow on the understanding of stuff so explain it like I am still in highschool.I cannot publish the names of the current cases. Probably the most important reason for this is the fact that I could jeopardize any investigations by the authorities that might be taking place or warn the perpetrators in advance. And of course it is also a security risk on our part.But on https://www.cryptorensics.com there are two case studies (Insider Hack and Ponzi scheme) which describe cases that have already been closed or that happened a long time ago. However, both case descriptions, which have so far been anonymized, are not up to date and will soon be completely revised. The company names and websites will then also be mentioned. I will publish these exclusively here in advance.The insider hack refers to the NiceHash hack of 2017 (which was not a hack).The Ponzi scheme describes the case of HashFlare.For tactical reasons, I cannot describe exactly how we work here.However, since it is mentioned below, here is a note on our approach and the description under \"how we work\" on our website.The description on the website describes the procedure when we carry out investigations on behalf of clients. We also carry out investigations on our own initiative, for which we use the \"report scam\" function, which is of course completely free of charge.",
