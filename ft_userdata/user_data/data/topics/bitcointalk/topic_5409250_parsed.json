I can tell you in all honesty that none of them have made loads of money by gambling. Yes, they win some small Jackpots now and again, but they go back and play ...and lose most of those profits. There are some of them that reached high VIP levels and they get some FREE perks, that help them to continue gambling. Some use very little of their own money, because they get bonuses from the casinos. (but they still fork out most of the money from their own pocket)",

In general, the human mind is created to desire money, and if you believe gambling is the quickest method to raise yourself from financial difficulties, you will become addicted to gambling at any cost.Fact 3 also seems strange to my gambling understanding, your losses do not rely on how long you have been playing; some people lose most of the time, while others win more and lose a few.",

Likewise considering that online gambling just became a thing which has giving access to people to gamble at their privacy from home without exposure to the public has made it possible for younger people to gamble without knowledge of the public, if gambling has still remained completely offline where people still need to visit gambling houses to place bets and gamble, I am certain that even teens that consider to try out gambling will be afraid and discouraged to do so considering that they know they are young and may be scolded if they are found in the gambling houses by the elderly.",

Therefore, I propose to look at the article from the first message more carefully:QuoteBoth the single-line slots (the traditional slots) and the more modern multi-line slots are programmed to give LDW “wins” in a specific payback percentage, but it is always less than 100% and certainly not above 100%, meaning that the house always wins. There are no “hot” slot machines, only “cold” ones.The point is this. The slot machine is obliged to give part of the money back and this percentage is very high: 94-95% - therefore, if some slot machine \"won\" a lot of money from the player without a return, then soon it will give a win because it is obliged to do so. Such slots used to be called hot slots. Now the algorithms are more advanced, so watching the slot machine will not help you in any way to determine the \"state\" of its algorithm.",

If someone is in a strong financial position and fully aware of the substantial odds against them, they are less likely to get hooked than someone who is a bit worse at math or in an unstable environment with low earnings. I think one prominent myth that is missing is the rather dangerous so-called strategies that people come up with, namely Martingdale, which only works if you have unlimited money (much higher than the casino) to keep doubling up until infinity when you statistically will be bound to win eventually - in reality you'll go bust long before the house ever does which is the inherent flaw in something that sounds so quaint.",

If someone gambles responsibly, he will be able to manage his finances carefully and appropriately, but some people that were lucky and had one chance of success, if they gamble and become addicted until all the money they had got lost to gambling, they can become helpless, not hopeful again and involve themselves in criminal activities. But home criminality is common, like stealing from one's father, which might not have been like that. Also it can lead to other ones like robbery, but I have only read about one of this type on news.",
