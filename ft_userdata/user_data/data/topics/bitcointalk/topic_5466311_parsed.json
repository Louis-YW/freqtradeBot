Avast/AVGToday, with almost everyone using Windows 10/11, one of these free antivirus programs is entirely sufficient for your everyday PC activities.Also, add an AdGuard or uBlock Origin extension to your browser and configure them with the filters. Don't forget to adjust your browser's security settings and block third-party cookies while checking the \"Do Not Track\" option!But, no antivirus program will fully protect you if you are a risk-taker, downloading various things from torrents, visiting suspicious or adult websites, etc. In such cases, use your common sense, regular backups are highly recommended, and do not keep important things on the same computer. Also, avoid clicking on links in emails from unknown senders as that's how most people get infected.",
