  "content": "Many experts believe Bitcoin's surge to over $72,000 is just the beginning of its potential growth. Investors may also see this surge as a validation of Bitcoin's potential as a long-term store of value. It is important you do not brag about success. Don’t share how much you have with others. This should be obvious, but there are people that may not be so excited for you. They may tell their friends, and sooner or later someone who you don’t know, who may have the capacity for violence, may decide you are an appetizing target. This is yet another reason to use a multi-sig setup. Even if someone obtained 1 of 3 keys, they cannot steal your Bitcoin. Concurrently, your Bitcoin can be backed up. If you lose your Bitcoin you can literally just magically get it back if you have back up, that's because your Bitcoin is stored on the blockchain. If you have a copy of your \"seed phrase\" you can regain access to all your Bitcoin no matter which wallet you use. Don't go blabbing your mouth to everyone about your Bitcoin stack.",

Then have a matching amount of Bitcoins in a dedicated wallet and the other 90 % in other wallets.Advantage:1) You can publicly brag as much as you want, maybe to attract some female company  2) If bad things happen you lose only 10% of your holdings and can easily give it up when needed...",

And I never told them how much I bought but the problem was when the bull market of 2017 came, everyone assumed I was some crypto king. And they wanted money. Or they wanted me to take their money and basically 10x it. Some guy needed like $50 K and he wanted to give me $5K so I can turn it into $50K by crypto trading. I obviously refused.Hence don’t tell anyone about any crypto you own.",

I agree that the best thing to do is to keep secret how much bitcoin you have and if you have a lot it is even more important. As for you can enter your home and threaten your physical integrity, if I had a lot of money in millions I would have HW in several places so that if they enter your home and you can kill you transfer them what you have there but that is only a part of your total bitcoin holdings. For modest amounts, being discreet is enough.",

[...]We are less than a month away from the halving, so these tips came at an appropriate time, and although many topics refer to these tips, investors must be reminded again of the safety of their Bitcoin holdings. Truly, anyone bragging about the amount of Bitcoin can bring dire consequences. It may put him under legal scrutiny if he is in a country that prohibits crypto, and if someone with malicious intentions is listening, he might find a way to steal him. Therefore, I strongly agree with minimizing chatter in front of others regarding personal investments. Also, multisig is a wonderful feature that I prefer to use through hardware wallets instead of desktop wallets. It perfectly protects the investor’s Bitcoin, as the percentage of his assets being compromised is very low. Still, the person must not lose the backups containing all the seed phrases of the wallets supporting multisignatures. These must be kept in very safe places and not be lost over time.",

Here most of the persons suggested spreading your BTC into multiple wallets so if such a situation can ever happen then you can just give one of them and the rest will be secure. If you can give at least one BTC it is also very workable but yeah the life of a person is much more important than a single BTC. So when all is talking about multiple wallets why someone is not focused to tell him that do not talk about your Bitcoin even to your loving ones if you want to secure your life as well as your BTC. I saw some people continue making the same mistake when they talk to their friends in a public place and talk about their assets like I don't know what the aim of this is. Are their asset increases by mentioning it to your friend or other people in the public place?",

Most of these social media crypto stars lack a good understanding of how security truly works. They might know the basics, but unfortunately, a significant percentage of people who lose their funds are usually such individuals who lack proper knowledge on how to store their funds securely.In some countries, they might be exposed to potential risks such as kidnapping and much more. It's crucial that as a Bitcoiner, you maintain your privacy and anonymity to avoid becoming a target. Additionally, I recently learned about passphrase security, where an extra word is added to your original seed phrase, creating hidden wallets for you. You can use different words with the same seed phrase, so if an attacker tries to obtain your seed phrase, you can provide them with a decoy seed while still being able to recover your real funds using the seed phrase plus passphrase. It's a really cool technique, but we shouldn't make our holdings known to everyone to avoid such risks.",
