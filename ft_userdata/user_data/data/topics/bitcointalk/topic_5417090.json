But this Package was opened at customs. We had sent even more coins to other people e.g. 10 coins in one package, etc. but never before coins were stolen. We will keep this post updated with more info.Please check if someone tries to sell you coin #121. It looks like the Silver coin in the poster  above.Thank youTeam Rc",
