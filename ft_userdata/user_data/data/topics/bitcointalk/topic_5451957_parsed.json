Even assuming trustwallet is a open source wallet (not close source), it will still be one of the worst bitcoin wallet because it is not supporting RBF and CPFP. No coin control. You can not connect it to a hardware wallet.While close source wallets are not recommended, there are still more features that are not on Trustwallet.",

Trust Wallet is a wallet that falls into the category of wallets that should be avoided in my opinion because it is closed source.Using a wallet with closed source does not guarantee the security of the assets we store.Trust Wallet is indeed a wallet that can store several types of crypto, but it is very risky because it is not open source.If you want a wallet that can store several crypto assets, there is the Unstoppable Wallet which I recommend for you to use.Download: https://unstoppable.money/",
