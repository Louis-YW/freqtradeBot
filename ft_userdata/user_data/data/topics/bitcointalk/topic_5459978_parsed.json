      "body": "See, waiting to hear back from the SEC on the BlackRock Spot ETF is like sitting through a suspenseful movie. I understand how anxious you must be. It's frustrating to have to play \"will they, won't they\" with the SEC over Bitcoin's future and large sums of money.Don't get ahead of ourselves, though. When paranoia sets in, it's easy to envision conspiracies when there are none. In this regard, keep in mind that rules and laws can cut both ways. While they prevent fraud, they may hamper creative thinking. Like an unpalatable medicine, it may ultimately prove beneficial to our health.The timing may very well cause problems. True, but consider the flip side. The approval of the ETF might provide the impetus we need. As if you hit a home run with no time left in the game. The halving impact is simply Bitcoin operating normally. It continues unabated like a metronome notwithstanding the SEC's or anybody else's efforts to stop it.We must continue to have faith in Bitcoin, bro. A currency with revolutionary potential. Let's not lose sight of the end goal, whatever that may be, and just roll with the punches.",

Nevertheless the journey will still continue despite what is going on the background.And for good measures, we shouldn't be bother by it, we are still months for the block halving. So while waiting for the approval or rejection, we might as well continue what we are best at doing at, accumulating from behind. And if by chance it is approved, then we can taste institutional money flowing at our backyard. If no approval, then it couldn't stop the eventual bull run in 2024-2025.

They always try to create excited NEWs to attract the attention of people so that they could get attention or traffic to their website. Well, i have the list of all the companies which have applied for ETFs and their dates of results and today isn't the date of result. So, i think you should work on you title and the first statement. Additionally, i totally agree with you that, once the ETFs got approved, the market will be in great up-trend and we might see market to cross $40k or maybe more.",

Not because that the review will take time, but rather because the SEC and the corporations involved will need to build the infrastructure that will not only support the ETF trading, but also so that regulations are followed in an autonomous way. I do hope the process takes some time, so that we get another buying opportunity.

I share that an unforeseen attack is the downside risk toward a confident BTC investment over the next 1-2 years.",

Now, with the kind of uncooperative and antagonistic stance of the current SEC, people are really wondering whether it would be fair enough in its evaluation. Or could it just be a big trap for the whole industry - timing the rejection just before the schedule halving in 2024?

Shows you how irrelevant these types of news reports are now. I also think that ARK ETF will be the first one to be either rejected or approved or delayed. Sometime in august is the deadline for that ARK ETF.I think they had the BTC application already on review but they modified it, to make it a trust instead of an ETF when Blackrock first applied and they will be first in line. What will be interesting is if they reject ARK, will they reject Blackrock also and all the other etfs? Because I don't think they can reject ARK ETF but approve Blackrock unless there was something wrong with their application.Either way, markets will be very shaky until the end of summer.

Additionally, the recent win in the Ripple case has pushed Bitcoin even further towards the light of positive factors which holds strong up until this moment but, there is a huge possibility for SEC appealing the decision very soon. If this happens, it could possibly create a minor dent in the price for short term and the forthcoming Aug 13 decision on ARK's filing might be a popcorn chewing event for price action as well.All in all, the price of Bitcoin taking an uptrend or downtrend in the near future strongly lies in the hands of SEC's approvals towards various decisions and until then, we don't have any strong news which can push the price on either ways. Short trading at this moment, when the price action lies in the hands of SEC is a risky move which can have either a strong positive or negative effect on our investments.",
