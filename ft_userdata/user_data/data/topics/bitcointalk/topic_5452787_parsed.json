  "content": "QuoteHILDA BACI HAS OFFICIALLY BROKEN THE WORLD RECORD OF THE LONGEST COOKING INITIALLY HELD BY LATA TONDONShe started on the 11th of May, last week Thursday.She was determined to break the former record of 87hours 45 minutes set by an Indian Lady, Lata.She began cooking, cooking and cooking. People cheered, people came to support and of course you will also see negative people who condemned the act and questioned why she was doing it. This act of hers, brought individuals from different tribes all over the nation together in one place, to join hands and support her. https://www.facebook.com/100004305377448/posts/pfbid0vuQ8ss5RF6k829C7qh1nDfdU4J1p5exHxe19YN1NLeYRygKicGpFxKdX56EkCvYal/The four days success story of Hilda Baci a Nigerian like us is one that has been trending all over the internet for the past days. She took a step to do what others initially thought was kind of impossible or a waste of time but as she gave deaf ears to all the negatives and discouraging voices around her and pushed on with her determination she refused to deter. And when even her critics saw she was still pushing on day after day they had no other option but to surrender their support and applaud her in addition to those few that had been giving her support from day one of her quest. Today she now holds the record for the longest cooking in the world.And that is why in this life we shouldn't give attention to discouraging voices and opinions of people around us when we've taken upon ourselves to embark on a journey. It could be a journey of going to school to study a particular course that a few persons hardly make it out successfully or learning a trade, a particular skill or generally anything that your mind has picked interest and passion into. Never back down on pursuing your dream wether you got the support of your friends and family or not, it should be a reason for excuse cause as you keep pushing on and when they see your determination and steps of success you start covering they would cow out of their disbelieve in you and be forced to have no option but give you overwhelming support as we saw with the case of HILDA BACI.One secret I uncover that was part of the continuous motivation that Hilda had even when she was tired and weak which she would have felt like giving up was the unalloyed support she later got from friends and family, down to all over Nigeria and parts of the world. And so, it's expedient of us to learn how to give support to people's dream, passion for anything legitimate they put their mind into to achieve. Our little support can always go a long way to giving them the strength they need even when they feeling like giving up on themself. Like the popular saying goes \"if you can't help them, then at least don't be a barrier to them\".",

      "body": "Firstly I would like to send out my congrats to her Hilda for achieving this difficult task of braking the record of the longest cooking time.I was very impressed for the love she got from millions of millions of people in and out of Nigeria and I can say that support went a long way for her to achieve the task.I don't know about other but this story is actually inspirational to everyone especially those who don't believe in themselves. Hilda actually believed she could do it and even if there were challenges to achieving the task she still stood strong and completed the task, it's just so so amazing. It's a big win for her and Nigeria at large.",

One thing about Nigerians which I’m very proud of us is the maximum support we show our people when they’re ready to face the challenges in order to achieve their goal in life. Even those that always look down on you, will join others to support and make you achieve that dream of yours. Her story is an inspiration to all Nigerians and following in her footsteps will be great for the youths that have been procrastinating long enough to achieve their set out dreams.",

Like the popular saying goes \"if you can't help them, then at least don't be a barrier to them\".It takes only a brave person to have done what \"Hilda Bacci\" just did cooking for over 90hrs straight non stop, because at first when I starting seeing the viral pictures and videos on social media, I thought it was likely an impossible task, not until she entered the third day and yet still continuing her cooking, did I realized she actually meant breaking the previous record beyond all doubt. So the story of \"Hilda Bacci\" teaches us that in life nothing is impossible not to achieve, only if we can dream about it, plan for it and work towards making our plan to fruition, anything is possible. And likewise that applicable to this forum, because only if you could work hard, make more research and be active on this forum reading valuable contents, you too can achieve the rank of other existing member of this forum.",

      "body": "What I learned: - there is no self-made person or nobody is an island of their own: She had and still has a great team that help made it all a success. PR team, doctors, psychologist, kitchen assistants, sponsors.- Success is preparation meets opportunity: She has been honing her skills for many years now. She has a restaurant. In the past, she already won a jollof cooking competition in Ghana. - Money is important: We cannot underplay the role money played in her success story. Without money, she would have the great team she has. And even though she had sponsors, I am sure the sponsors didn't sponsor everything.- Her Odds of success increase because she is physically fit: I heard she had to go on a diet and she got on a fitness plan for 2 years.Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on May 16, 2023, 11:15:36 PMWetin been wan make me vex na when Guinness World Record people been dey talk say dem still need to verify wetin everybody been dey see as e dey happen.

In two weeks or there about the result go show. I think say e get how them take run am ...GWR nor need dey there physically. Dem submit video evidence and other things too. Even when Kaffy dance for 2 days that year na the same 2 weeks e bin take before them call final result and give her the award.",
