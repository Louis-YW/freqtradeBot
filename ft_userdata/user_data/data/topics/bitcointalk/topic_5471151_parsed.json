Yeah, you just might not have enough to take up an investment and still live your normal life, especially when your struggling with finance and instability but, it becomes a real issue where you let it.What you would need is a reorientation on your reasons to have taken up Bitcoin investments.If your reasons is to take out the profit at once or at regular intervals to settle pressing needs, you might find yourself always hitting the withdrawal over everything and anything.First thing, get some regular source of income and I don't mean Bitcoin at this point, redefine your ideas to Bitcoin investment to be more of futuristic thing that would read in years and then, invest using DCA.",

If you start off on the wrong foot you will most likely lose out and then learn from the mistakes you made earlier on, but it's much better to learn from the mistakes of others.Quote from: Pablo-wood on October 21, 2023, 05:41:12 PMStarting Bitcoin investment with little capital will be very challenging mostly if that happens to be the major survival option of the investor. Do not see investment as a survival option, it's a way to secure your income and prepare for the future but it will not dramatically change your financial situation. Your major survival option is growing your income and dropping your liabilities, unlock this and then you have some spare cash lying around that you can lock up in assets like Bitcoin.There is no magical approach to wealth you just have to be patient and work up your income.Learn a skill that is in demand and offer freelancing roles that clients will pay you for, this helps you to settle emergency needs that you may have. ONLY invest amounts you can afford to lose in Bitcoin.A bonus point is to see investments as a long term approach, especially if you do not have tons of cash to invest at a particular time. If you DCA over several years to a decade, you can build a solid retirement plan.",

But you have to think about yourself whether you should use the funds to invest in BTC which is so important to you and your life will be affected if that money is gone. Further, for the problem of low capital, but if you have consistent earnings then you don't have to worry about it, all you can do is DCA. I can write a hell lot of about DCA here, but recently many topics were made by many users, but the ones with some details are made by snowpega (our local community member) you might want to look at them. \"Lump sum Vs DCA\" for Bitcoin AccumulationA Complete Guide for Cryptocurrency Newbies \"The Best Way Of DCA\"How big whale play game of sentiments with short investors and put them in FOMO--> as a newbie with less capital, you don't want to be loss money due to the dirty games of big players so you have to learn about FOMO.A Guide for Cryptocurrency Newbies for Overcoming FOMO--> another FOMO articleAnd if you want to accumulate BTC for a longer period of time and want to know some good practices that you should follow then go through the following article, Really Amazing, by Hamza2424 (also a local community member).

Your formula might be a saving approach.If your money is used for your survival, don't think about investing first. Most of the time you will sell those investment when the time that you need the money and probably you will be on a loss. Increase your income first before investing even if it's not bitcoin. Use an allocated investment money that you will not use to other things, just dedicated to investing. If you have the money to invest, accumulate some knowledge about bitcoin and you are the one who will decide if you will invest or not. The common knowledge is enough, no need to learn the technical side of it. Just remember to not invest the money that is not allocated in investing, you will just end up losing or will not maximize the possible profit.",

I'm tired of people saying that bitcoin is too expensive to invest. $100 invested in bitcoin is nothing more and nothing less than a $100. You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin and you don't need to own a whole bitcoin.A person who has the whole bitcoin, say @30k, and that bitcoin goes up 10%, gains 10%. A person who has %10k in bitcoin also gains 10%. This is simple math. Bitcoin goes up, you gain, it goes down, you lose, the more you own, the more you gain or lose.  QuoteAnd in cases where the investor plans on using the proceed to solve their needs they might end up selling when the price have dropped just to settle the pressing need of that time.If the investor sells when the price drops it means the investor had too much to lose and the market forced his hand. Invest what you feel comfortable with. An amount that if reduced by 10%, won't mean anything to you. For each of us it's a different sum.",

Don't expect you get all the money you want from bitcoin investment, it doesn't happen that way otherwise you might get disappointed and frustrated. Although the expectation is for bitcoin bull next year but nothing is automatic about the rise. So don't expect too much, work with patience while DCA if you want to hodl btc. To gain in btc you have to invest for a long time but if you cut short your investment plan because of whatever emergency then you are good as not invested.",

Your formula might be a saving approach.You have made a vital point with your first paragraph which is to invest just what you can afford to lose and not a survival funds. As someone that wants to invest my formula is set aside at most 20% of your funds to invest in bitcoin but before then you should have at least more than that save on other assets for emergency funds. We all will continue to say that fiat are not suitable to hold because of its devaluation characteristics due to inflation and others, but when investing you need to hold some funds in fiat as emergency funds at least you will turn to it when it arises. Also when you hold your bitcoin and you see profits it is sometimes good to take some profit and hold then in another asset for emergency",

Then that small amount of yours, when the time comes, can have a high value, and the type of your capital can double or more eventually.This means that Bitcoin does not choose an investor, whether you are rich or poor; as long as you have the ability to buy within your pocket, you can really have it.

Due to their many responsibilities, some people also find it difficult to invest in Bitcoin and hold it for a longer time. If you are not able to invest and hold onto your bitcoin, the problem is you. First, before investing in Bitcoin, you should be able to know how much you are willing to allocate at that moment on your investment, and you should also be able to decide how long you can hold onto your asset. If you can't hold your asset for a long time, you should either make the decision to sell at a loss because that's what you have agreed to.Some Bitcoin investors are able to hold their Bitcoin for a long time because they always have their emergency funds sorted out before they allocate some money to their investment. For example, if you are earning $100 as a salary, you can decide to keep $20 as emergency funds, and you can invest $20 in Bitcoin. Then you can use the rest for your bills. If you always allocate some funds for emergencies, then you would not have to always sell your bitcoin during emergencies.",
