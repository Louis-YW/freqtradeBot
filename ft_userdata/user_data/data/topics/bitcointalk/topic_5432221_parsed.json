      "body": "My advice would be to install an own non-custodial wallet, even if it's for a casino withdrawal. This is because if anything goes wrong with the withdrawal, you will know that the casino is the culprit, and can fix the issue with their support. If you withdraw to a centralized service or exchange directly, in the case something happens, you won't know which of the two services is to blame.Bitcoin.org is a good source of information for that: https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-walletI like to have the wallets on a PC / notebook type device, so my recommendation is Electrum. Install it and let it sync a couple of minutes (it will not download the whole blockchain, only a couple of blocks) and then withdraw the coins. If you like a mobile wallet more you'll find a lot of good options on the bitcoin.org site.Then you need an exchange to exchange your coins to fiat. This depends on your country. Binance is the biggest one and supports lots of countries, but it had some issues lately, so I wouldn't use it for big amounts. If your country is supported then Kraken is a good choice.Another recommendation: Don't use PayPal to withdraw Bitcoin. They support it but sometimes there have been issues with payments from other persons/services.",

      "body": "I agree that don't use PayPal in withdrawing bitcoin, you may have some problems dealing with it. Aside from using Electrum, I can recommend Wasabi Wallet. It's also recommended or part of the list from the website of bitcoin.org.You don't have to rush upon knowing about bitcoin, take each step at a one time and you'll enjoy the process of having your own bitcoin wallet, from downloading it and receiving that withdrawal of yours from that casino.Tip: Don't withdraw directly that bitcoin of yours from casino > any exchange (ex. Binance, Coinbase).",

Nothing wrong with that, but note that you'll feel like going from a landline all the way to a smartphone. So, first things first, you can be charged a withdrawal fee by your casino and then, if you decide to sell bitcoin at an exchange, you'll again be charged a fee. Think of it like the spread between buying and selling foreign currency. They also charge fees. If you know someone who's tech savvy, they could help you install a bitcoin wallet. Just make sure that you trust them because you'll essentially be setting up an electronic wallet to keep your money in, that requires you to set up recovery phrases and passwords. You could also go the more dangerous route, but fine if you only want this to be a one time deal. You can set up an account at an exchange like Coinbase and send the coins directly to the deposit address on your account and that account will allow you to sell and withdraw USD to your bank account.",

I can certainly understand how all this may be confusing to someone new to cryptocurrencies. We have all been there at some point! Take your time and get things right. If you have any concerns along the way, ask for clarification before proceeding further.As others have already said, you will need a Bitcoin wallet to get started. A Bitcoin wallet is a software program that allows you to send and receive Bitcoin. There are many different types of wallets available, ranging from mobile wallets that can be installed on your smartphone, to desktop wallets that can be installed on your computer. There are also hardware wallets that can be plugged into your computer and act as another layer of security for your Bitcoin. To get a Bitcoin wallet, you can visit bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet and select the type of wallet that you want to install. The website will show you a list of wallets that are compatible with your operating system, and you can then download one of them onto your computer or mobile device. Once you have installed the software and created a Bitcoin wallet (by following instructions carefully step-by-step) and familiarized yourself with the basic functions of the software, you will need to provide your Bitcoin address to the person or entity that wants to send you a payment. Your Bitcoin address is a long string of letters and numbers that acts as a unique identifier for your wallet. You can find your Bitcoin address by going to the \"Receive\" section of your wallet.To receive a Bitcoin payment, the sender will need to send the payment to your Bitcoin address. You can then check your wallet to see the incoming payment and confirm that it has been received.",

Thanks for any advice given.It depends on what you're planning to do with your coins. If you're planning to HODL and keep it for at least several years - go the software wallet way (described above, Electrum is a solid wallet). If you'd like to spend it on Xmas presents (haha) you could just create an account on any reputable crypto exchange (like kh... kh... Binance kh.. I know I will receive a bashing for this from other posters) then order their debit card or just sell and withdraw to your account/card.",

This is quite common, so nothing to worry about, but should not be more than ~0.0001 BTC / around US$1-2.- Wallets do normally not charge a fee for its usage. You can be 100% sure if you use a non-custodial one like Electrum as it's free open source software.- To transfer the coins to the exchange, you will have to pay a transaction fee, which is currently mostly under $0.10$ if you are not in a hurry; if you need the money fast you may currently sometimes (if you have really bad luck) pay up to $5. This amount will however be deducted from your bitcoin balance so you won't be charged \"money you don't have\". This is a fee charged by the Bitcoin network, so it's nothing \"hidden\".- As others have written, the exchange will charge a fee to exchange the coins to dollars/euros/other fiat currency. The \"normal\" price is 0,2 to 0,5% of the amount of the transaction. Most exchanges (like Binance and Kraken) do not charge maintenance fees. You probably will have to do KYC/AML however, i.e. most likely a video verification. An alternative is a P2P exchange like HodlHodl, Robosats or Bisq; there you won't have to do KYC/AML but they are more difficult to use, and I recommend reading a bit about possible risks (mainly chargebacks) if you chose that option.- To withdraw the money to your bank account, most exchanges also charge a fee. You can see Binance's fees here.QuoteDo all banks accept it anyway...all legit ( assuming Casino does pay in properly ).Normally yes, if the amount is not too large. Most people having problems with banks are those who regularly withdraw amounts of over ~1000 $ from exchanges, i.e. from trading, DeFi or gambling profits; or those wanting to withdraw tens of thousands at once.",

If I were a little paranoid, I would say that in this way they want to make it difficult for their clients to withdraw money and lose it instead, or they will try to deceive them in the withdrawal process by claiming that they sent BTC, and blame all the problems on the clients.My recommendation is that you take a sample screen of each step that you will do when it comes to sending a transaction from their site, and that you once again try to request that your winnings be paid out in the same way as the deposit was made.",
