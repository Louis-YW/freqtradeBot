Look at the cards, they're beautiful, don't you think so? And you're wrong about the casino, dah. Yes, there is an element of randomness in the game, but where is it not? Even walking through the forest, you can stumble upon an elf. Only in our case, you can influence on random and increase your chances of success because of elixirs, for example. So, there is no need to compare us with someone, longdude.",

Well, in the glorious kingdom of Eridan, everyone can replenish their pocket in different ways. Someone will mine gold in the deep mine, which can be sold profitably. Someone will try their luck in the Chasm, funded outlandish gizmos, gold and who knows what else can be found there. Someone will  crafting potions and other items useful in the campaign, which are so necessary for adventurers. Well, don't forget about the state funds, of which even the most inveterate idler will get his piece of pie, and the more merit he has, the bigger the piece'll be. So stop staring at my beard, think better about becoming one of the inhabitants of our kingdom!",

There are different opinions about this.Why do you think my life is nonsense? Or do you have any prejudices against dwarves? Why are we still discussing this?NFT is part of the gameplay, part of the game economy. They'll help you get more wealth inside the game, which you'll be able to replenish your wallet in your pocket in result. But the NFT itself also has its own cost. Even more, they have value as a work of art. For some reason, no one argues about the value of candy wrappers, which deteriorate over time, just lie in the table and bring nothing.",

Our king is so generous that every inhabitant of Eridan can get a piece of the pie. Thanks to this, even you will be able to buy potions for yourself, and who knows, maybe you'll save up for the alchemy laboratory and brew up some poitions yourself.

Grows right into his brain, kind of I heard that dwarfs use beards to replace their wives. Sounds creepy. But has anyone seen their wives?They say dwarves are very progressive in this regard and asking their gender is intolerant. So we can only assume...At least you're right about something. But still... Why are you so interested in my beard? Maybe she attracts you? Maybe you want to try something new? Maybe I want to, but I think my bald armpits won't be your type",
