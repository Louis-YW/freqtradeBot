If you want something reliable that has been around for many years, and you know that developers won't abandon, then I would stick to MetaMask. An (open source) alternative with BTC support and a better UI: Unstoppable wallet.Now, if you want something more innovative with Erc4337 support, multi-sig, etc. then you should probably into some of these options[2]. Just keep in mind that most of these services are new, and not open source.[1] https://www.erc4337.io/[2] https://www.alchemy.com/best/smart-contract-wallets",

      "body": "What I found about BitKeep is that is more user friendly than Metamask wallet as I believe operating Metamask is not that easy if you are a newbie to cryptocurrency. The red flag for me is that BitKeep is a closed source wallet wherein it can cause issues in the long run. dApps integration is not that good if you compare it with Metamask wallet. Another red flag for me is that BitKeep is a custodial wallet whereas Metamask is not. I would still prefer Metamask over BitKeep due to these factors and I do not feel uncomfortable in using Metamask as I have been using it for a long time now. I would always recommend others to use Metamask than BitKeep.",

A centralized exchange making their wallet open source? I highly doubt that. They would've probably closed-sourced it, even if it was open before. And looking at their GitHub repository: https://github.com/BitgetLimited/It doesn't look like they are a fan of \"open source\" projects, they just have their SDK there.",

I know I'm going to get crucified by crypto lords if they find out that I actually do leave my asset on the exchange I use.

I have enjoyed the use of MetaMask and trustwallet over the years, for storing tokens and I am still using them when I have to. Recently, I started exploring Bitkeep wallet functionalities now Bitget wallet and the experience have been cool for a mobile wallet. The Implementation of biometric verification to keep funds safe is aÂ  plus. Also, the fact that, one can stake and do margin trading still within same app is well thought out integration. But at different points, one may have personal preference for using which wallet and at a time.",

The two most secure options, according to my experience, are MetaMask and Trust Wallet: the first is MetaMask, which is open source and works efficiently since its launch, and there are no complaints about it, in addition to the fact that most service sites support it, which means it is enough to use this wallet to be able to benefit from many other services without the need to register account or identification. The second is Trust Wallet, which is the wallet of Binance, which supports its security.

We recently saw how Atomic Wallet got compromised and how wallets users suffered. It is better to follow the ground rules of choosing a wallet which has been advocated numerous times on this forum.The problem with wallets such as MetaMask is that they cannot support all networks and therefore cannot contain all currencies. On this basis, exchange operations are also carried out on limited networks and with specific currency pairs. Trust wallet can provide good services compared to Metamask wallet, including its tolerance for many networks, and therefore many cryptocurrencies that can easily be exchanged between them.As for the element of protection, each system has its loopholes. Therefore, the necessary precautions must be taken while dealing with any of the types of wallets. One of the best solutions, in my opinion, is to use the Ledger wallet because it is safe and can hold cryptocurrencies on almost all networks, and then use decentralized trading platforms to do the exchange. This is the safest solution, despite its slightly complexities.",

Make sure you do not try to contact anyone who says they are from Team Metamask. No one will ever contact you from their team and it's a most likely a scammer. Good Luck!",
