Although, I must say that you have tried your best to create that bot and added support for Bitcoin and some other alternative coins, but I'm still sure that no body is going to trust a bot from someone they don't really know.Even if you make the bot fee-less I still doubt that anyone would ever use such bot due to trust issues. On this forum there are many reputed members who work as escrow for transactions and people would also prefer those reputed members instead of trusting a bot that came from nowhere, and they aren't even sure that who's the creator behind the bot.If you really want to promote your bot on this forum then you must have to built up trust first which isn't as easy as it sounds like. You may also try to offer this bot to some reputed escrow providers of the forum and if they agree to buy this bot from you then that would be a really good thing for you. Otherwise, I don't think that such bot would ever get any users from this forum due to trust issues.",

Trust is the most important part of your business and even lowering the fee will not help you if you can’t to your customers that your bot is safe to use.Some user here in the forum paid a sufficient amount of money to trusted escrow just to secure their deal. This show how trust is important over the fee. Low fee will only matter if you already established your bot reputation.",

You say, you only expect smaller amounts, it looks like you are not sure about the functionality of your system or you expect less responsibility if the amount is small. In a way, you are protecting yourself here in case someone loses money \"Hey, I said if you don't have much money don't use this bot\". I would warn everyone not to use this service, regardless of the amount involved.",

I would warn everyone not to use this service, regardless of the amount involved.No, that's not what I meant, what I was saying is that for the moment I only advise on small sums, simply because I'm aware that people don't trust me. If someone decides to make a trade with a large amount I don't care and I know that the bot has no security problems, I first tested it on the testnet network and tried several cases where someone would like to scam the other person and he can't get the funds back because they'll be blocked in the bot because it requires confirmation from the person who sent the money.",

Since my last follow-up 4 months ago, our server hasn't been re-banned and we've now held over $50k in volume, so that's nearly doubled in 2x less time! There have been a total of 926 completed transactions. Since then, I've added the Ethereum blockchain with the ETH, USDT ERC-20 and USDC ERC-20 coins, I've also added USDC SOL and removed Dogecoin due to its low number of uses but I'm thinking of adding it again when I think it'll be worth it. These stats aren't huge, I suppose there are middleman holding more than $50k every day, but it shows that people are starting to embrace the project and that there is growth. I'm still hopeful and I don't intend to stop here.For people who said \"how can we make sure that it's real\", as i said before, all our transactions with their transaction id are public in the Discord server, but i forgot to mention that all transactions are paying the fee address and that so, by checking all utxo of the address you can check everytime the bot has sent money since there are a OP_RETURN including the website url. Here is the fee address on the Litecoin network: ltc1qes0du76fxgfpk59yls4gajrwffa8j3z3kpfees and Solana Network: FeesjkgM85w3z32hhFqGCAQDxNuL1uUEZHgFnNEEmBXh",
