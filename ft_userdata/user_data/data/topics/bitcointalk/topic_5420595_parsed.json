They have always been pioneers, first Safu and now a new term they created to represent transparency for investor peace of mind, proof-of-reserve.I believe other exchanges will soon have to follow them, if an exchange can't make their assets public then they have a problem. Investing in cryptocurrencies is always risky and if someone can't take the risk, they should leave the market.",

And IMO, this is going to be a new trend for these companies, they'll be obliged to show their proof of reserve.Proof of reserve does not mean the reserve has intrinsic value, but it's like some entity out there decides what has value at a certain time and what doesn't. Again showing proof of what is being done with customer funds is a standardized part of the finance world for a long time now, it's in the same vein as a refrigerator turning on as a basic requirement. It's like when a game takes your USD via micro transaction and splits it into 15 different currencies to obfuscate the player into making poor allocations in resources. It's fucking intentional shit and it's the same thing FTX did to it's investors when dealing with 15 different garbage coins.I do not intend to defend or blame anyone here, I am simply stating the fact that the crypto market is an extremely risky market and that our money can disappear at any moment. So we should be responsible for our actions, don't blame someone when they let us down. Neither Binance nor FTX force us to deposit funds in their exchange, all decisions are up to us. If we want to get x100 or x1000 profit, we should also be ready to lose everything.In fact, binance also does not need to explain or disclose its assets to us, if you believe it, use it, if you don't believe it, protect your assets by yourself.",

This is why everyone must need to avoid any shitcoins and just invest in Bitcoin, this can prevent your money will disappear since Bitcoin price wouldn't become a dead coin. Also use exchange as a marketplace, if you want to hold your coins, just use hardware wallet.If you did both this, you will prevent your money disappear at any moment.",

But I agree, all these centralized platforms and centralized shitcoins they keep creating has been harming the whole cryptocurrency world more than it helps it. Binance and their centralized shitcoin called BNB will eventually have the same fate as its predecessors. The good news is that all these events are making bitcoin battle hardened. A couple of years ago such a scam would have caused at least a 40% dump. Today it only caused about 16% dump and we have been in an accumulation more which many people think is a bear market so the effects should have been a lot bigger.",

It's not to us, or you, or me, it's to the general public.From the fact of what is happening, the mainstream will become aware of the risk of keeping a coin on an exchange or they might simply just generalise that cryptocurrency is shit due to the recent fall down. On another hand, Binance itself will surely learn from its competitor's mistakes and so does for others.It's part of cryptocurrencies reaching its maturity whether we like it or not. IMO, The general public should really direct their concern into knowing what they are actually doing, like what it's like behind the scenes. Indeed the regulation will become enforced tightly in the future, especially on CEX, and we can't do anything about it, it's for the sake of the general public. The essential thing is, let keep centralized things centralized, while decentralized currency like Bitcoin will stay the way it is. People actually have choices, and each chooses their own. Yet we cannot blame others if it is interrelated.",

There is to be a company or wealthy individual at least that will act as the market maker for Binance. So far there isn't. We know for a fact that Alameda Research had pumped the FTT which is on the leaked data, most of the Alameda assets are FTT.  CZ is smart enough to only have Binance pumping the BNB which also makes sense after all its thier token.  FTX pumps every token they list such as tokens on top of Solana through Alameda's funds, retail investors were fooled into thinking they were really valuable. SBF was hailed a Hero for saving Blockfi and all other lending platforms that goes down. So there goes the hero.",

Do you mean that there are mostly shitcoins launched on the Binance Smart Chain? If that is the case then i probably agree with you. The reason for that are also quite simple. The BSC chain is the second most adopted blockchain after Ethereum but has way lower fees than it, which means it is way cheaper for creators of scam projects or stupid meme-coins to create and launch their project there.That does not mean though that there are no good projects running on the BSC chain.",

If you are one of the victims due to their low security atleast you can sti get your money from binance. I also don't think most of the crypto there are backed by air dust magic and dreams.",

Who says the human beings at Binance aren’t plagued by the same things that drive greed and risk driven behaviors?Binance has already established themselves as the top dog of the crypto exchange industry. Pretty sure they already had bought actual assets and are not inflating BNB in order to gain more $$$ for themselves. They had been through a lot of breaches, hacks, and CZ has been in a lot of controversies but it seems that people no longer care because they know that Binance can easily just sweep these things aside and push forward with just being an exchange that delivers. Sam Friedman did a lot of miscalculations that caused the exchange to fail, and honestly it's not Binance's fault that an opportunity is presented in front of them. I know that Binance and CZ also plays dirty, but at least they know how to play it safe—so far.",
