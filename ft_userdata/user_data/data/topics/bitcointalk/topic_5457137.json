  "content": "I run a small business and I receive payments for my goods in fiat currency. So joining this bitcointalk forum has really enlightened me about the advantages and gains of trading and investing with bitcoin. So going a step further, I decided that I want to place adverts that customers can have the option of making payments when they buy goods in my shop with bitcoin. But I decided to first seek the opinions of experienced people who are into bitcoin, they encouraged me to go ahead, also to be cautious of bitcoin high transaction fees. I did a little research on it and found out the inevitability of the high fees. https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-bitcoin-transaction-fees/  My problem with these high transaction fees, is that customers naturally wants to minimize expenses, so if they choose to make payments with bitcoin, then they will want to exchange it at the exact rate of USD. So the seller bears the cost of the high fees alone, which may lead to selling at a loss. Although I'm guessing that the high fees might not affect big business owners, who receive payments in bitcoin, because they sell with higher profits, and when they minus the cost of the high transaction fees, it still won't affect their overall profits.I feel that this is a big edge that fiat currencies have over bitcoin, because you don't have to pay extra to buy goods or services, even when you make fiat payments through banks, they only charge a token as transfer fees. So this high fees is a disadvantage to small business owners like me who has the intention of receiving payments in bitcoin.",

Indeed, it is a big problem for small businesses to accept payments in small amounts for everyday products. But there really is a solution to that that you may not have come across. The solution is to use the Lightning Network, which enables you to make transfers in small amounts on channels parallel to the Bitcoin network, and then send all the amounts in one transfer on the main network.

I know many BTC user prefer to store there assets on non custodial or hardware wallets but still they will have some BTC in there exchanges too.So you could ask them to pay you through your pay id, or you could make a QR code for yourself, i do not know if other exchanges also provide the same feature because it also has its limitations for example if a customer do not have account on Binanace exchange then you will have no other choice, so you have to find which exchanges provide this feature on your own.No wonder, the transaction fee is so much for small business, but if you trust your customer so much, you should ask them to pay at the end of month, this the amount will be huge and your customer has to pay few dollars only. But it has its own limitation like customer could scam you.Another way is. You only allow customers to buy things via BTC when they need to buy in bulk, in this way the amount will be huge and the customer will not feel the fee difference  snd they could happily pay the fee",

Even if the coin is later released, it would have been a difficult time and it is going to stress you out to get your coins.

Even PayPal will do so.I think this will depend from country to country. Like in my country, local bank transactions are of very low fee, most do not require fee, but with little monthly charge. There are online microfinance banks and fintech with zero transaction fees, or zero transaction fee for certain number of transactions in a month, with not monthly charge.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on June 21, 2023, 10:19:11 PMI was thrilled 3 weeks ago when I wanted to fund a newly opened trading account with an Australian broker.

In turn merchants have to rise the prices.Which system is more expensive depends on a typical transaction size. Bitcoin fees don't care about the monetary value of transaction, so when the fees are high, small transactions become unviable. But for large transactions Bitcoin can be cheaper, because 1% from $5,000 would be higher than a typical Bitcoin fee.But without Lightning Network Bitcoin is not viable for commerce, simply because it's limited to ~300k transactions per day, while there are 8 billion people on Earth.",

For example, anyone who is buying goods below a hundred dollars should make use of another payment method unless they will agree to pay the fee and not deduct it from the price of the goods. That way, you could possibly not incur any losses.Or you can just suspend your Bitcoin payment option for the time being since the fee is still kind of high until it normalizes back to the lowest level where it was before.

Your problem is the fluctuation of exchange rates, as there are several price levels, and it is difficult to calculate the profits and losses due to the fluctuation of the exchange rate.This problem can be solved by accepting stablecoins or using bitcoin payment processing services that transfer users' deposits directly to US dollars in your account.Here is a list of Bitcoin Payment processors: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5444578.0 from that list you can use CoinGate which support LN and Fiat conversion with 1% fees.",

Since Bitcoin's transaction fee value is evaluated based on the size of the transaction, larger transactions will have higher fees. This can especially affect small business owners, where transactions are smaller in value and therefore have higher transaction fees, than larger business owners.It should be recognized that accepting Bitcoin as a payment method can provide many other benefits to small business owners, such as access to international markets, and avoidance of transaction costs. through traditional payment gateways. Besides, other alternative payment methods such as Lightning Network have also been developed to minimize the transaction costs of Bitcoin. Moreover, encouraging the use of bitcoin is not necessarily tied to the problem OP mentioned, I think there are many other crypto payment options to optimize fees, through the use of crypto will also help people know to bitcoin.",
