It uses Bitcoin as the sequencer and data availability layer for transactions and executes these transactions on an off-chain EVM indexer. It connects to Bitcoin through a PSBT-based decentralized trading pair between its native token and BTC. The entire protocol is trustless and has the same security level as Bitcoin. It's the first project that inscribes and executes Ethereum-formatted blocks on Bitcoin.Testnet 1 has been launched. Checkouthttps://docs.bitboost.org/testnet/testnet-1for more details, and checkouthttps://mirror.xyz/0x41AC99C64cB94ab7264ca8F558514512aD0EE8FB/u4z17LHv0E1mM5lXIVKVL1vcCqoDX_GlPPp5OlAJLggfor the incentivized program.",

Since the storage of transactions is secured by Bitcoin and the execution is secured by indexers (client-side validation), the security level is equivalent to Bitcoin, the same as other Bitcoin on-chain asset protocols such as Ordinals.",
