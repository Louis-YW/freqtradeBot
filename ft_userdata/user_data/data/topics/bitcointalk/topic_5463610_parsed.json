QuoteBelow are statements that i think are true about Testnet events and AirdropsAirdrop events are free gifts from different projects to perform simple tasks (it surely variesThe rewards from an airdrop event in most cases are speculative (there's no guarantee if it will be worth 1$ or 1000$ or worth 0)Test-net events does not PAY; either it is an incentivized participation or promised rewards; payment is not guaranteed.Test-net reward is not promised either.Influence-rs make promising test-net threads for engagement.It is good to follow influence-rs who make promising threads about airdrop events; but be mindful that nothing is promised.Nobody forces you to do an airdrop; Nobody forces you to perform testnet tasks; they are not an INVESTMENT; and you are not owned any explanationsMy conclusion; i think it is fine to be disappointed if your efforts is not recognized or rewarded; but i also believe that it is not enough to push slur narratives on social media (it has no effects anyways.) Also stop blaming influence-rs; if they make researches before making threads for readers; then as individuals, you should also make researches before joining any event (test-net or airdrop); while Remembering that nobody promised you millions for participating in their events. I am open to differing opinions on this issue; what do you think ?",

Was there a specific amount set for the testnet or was there any particular amount that is being assigned for the event and even as that, they may give rewards according to their future price and dishes out token to their participants which in turns might Worth anything but maybe according to their roadmap and future plans it could worth something very good. At the end or alongline the participants might see it as something not being sincere with them, and of course where you forced to join the event or take part in the airdrops?No because they wanted cheap money and how do they think a newly start up project will risk such amount for airdrop without any reserved fund for the event, even if there are reserved fund it would be from their native tokens which doesn't have future of the price at the moment.",

Well its not that they not share what they did plan to do. Its just that too many have participated and you just dissapointed with the value of someone amount did.Thats life just move on and get shots on other. Its not like every airdrop should be worth $1k above always. Airdrop hunters are frustrated but they also consider that event like this is likely to occur too.",

You can truly earn good money from airdrops way way back.I remember the days when the tokens you can get from these airdrops can easily be raded in etherdelta. And now, even ED is dead already.Instead of chasing these free coins or tokens, better yet, improve your trading skills, look for actual job, or invest in top alts. Most of the time, you will just be wasting time looking for these airdrops. If such time will be used for other valuable activities, you may get something positive out of it.",

I am one of the early participants in the Sei tesnet network. I have done many previous transactions on their network, testing and experimenting with many different applications and projects on Sei Ecosystems, joining their telegram and discord, getting many roles, and constantly interacting with their posts on social media and the events they promote, and finally, after a long wait, After I connected my wallet to claim the airdrop, it appeared that my wallet address and Discord account were not eligible to receive the Sei airdrop. Unfortunately, I am disappointed, and there may be many like me in the same situation.Quote from: Lorokan on August 17, 2023, 05:01:53 PMThe rewards from an airdrop event in most cases are speculative (there's no guarantee if it will be worth 1$ or 1000$ or worth 0)..ectI agree with you on all of these points that you mentioned. For example, the Sui project did not do an airdrop for the early participants in their testnet network, as they listed their currency in Binance Launchpool only. So yes, there are no guarantees that the airdrop hunters in the testnet network can get an airdrop in the end, It is a matter of luck, and there is no guarantee that the value of the airdrop coins will be of great value or not worth anything in the end. Projects owners this year have become very greedy",

I wasn’t expecting much because I have missed the most of their previous events like the Act 1 to 4 and Atlantic-1 testnet. I was just in the Atlantic-2 and my efforts are not complete until that snapshot. It’s still free money for me though. A gift perhaps and I am just grateful. I still continue to doing L1, L2 and L3 airdrops in both testnet and mainnet. Like what Arbitrum, Optimism, Blur, Aptos and Arkham did in the past that gave insane rewards, I believe there will be some “aces” out there.

My friend has been spending almost 1 year in this shit and he got nothing as he was not being eligible even to receive some token that is worth penny.  The bad habit of hunters. They were thinking their effort will always be rewarded while airdrop still pure speculation. If the dev would be honest and the participant will be reward but if it goes in the different way and it will be another sei.

I don't think blaming those influencers is something wrong. Those influencers were always tweeting about the project by saying \"blablabla never miss A airdrop that potentially give you xxxx USD\". I do agree if DYOR is a must but hunters lost nothing. They were only wasting their free time to speculating airdrop.

It is reported that the sei team had at about 3% of their tokens for testnet events and airdrop; with such public data can we say that participants are entitled? since the team themselves offered \"hope\" to some extents.I think one way to tackle this and solve it is by ensuring transparency; for example the layer zero platform amonsgt others (including Scroll) have been skeptical about an airdrop event. So far this year; Only SUI has handled expectations of followers exceptionally; do you think it is a good template for others to utilize?",
