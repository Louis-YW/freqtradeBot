If people would take idle coins away from exchanges, it won't affect them at all. If people moved all coins out of exchanges, then Bitcoin liquidity would immensely suffer, because every trade on exchange would require two on-chain transactions. That would be a disaster.",

Because I believe the opposite is what's happening. Centralized exchanges are growing fastly and more and more customers are using their services. I agree with you that storing bitcoin in your own non-custodial wallet is safer than keeping them on an exchange and it's the right thing to do but good luck convincing newbies with that. QuoteYou only send real Bitcoin when you do it on a p2p level and you don't own Bitcoin when your coins are stored on an exchange all you have is just promises and not Bitcoin if your Bitcoin is on the third party exchange.Centralized exchanges keep most of the coins on their cold wallets and all the exchanges/trades you make aren't on-chain transactions. They just update the numbers of coins you are supposed to own on their databases. And you are right, there is no guarantee that they actually have those coins until you withdraw them to an external wallet.",

Do you mean that you send fake Bitcoins when you move your BTC from a crypto exchange or when you use a Lightning Network wallet? I'm not a fan of crypto exchanges, but I don't think that they are \"the root of all evil\" so there's no need to criticize them for everything bad in the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto exchanges have helped a lot for the adoption of cryptocurrencies.I'm not saying that they are good, they are just \"necessary evil\". Moving from crypto exchanges to private wallets might make the governments want to regulate private wallets and impose ridiculous rules that are attacking our privacy. You might be forced by the law to disclose all your coins held in cold wallets, otherwise you will be facing a penalty.",

Their only difference is that in the cold wallet you have the 100% full control to your Bitcoin, unlike in the exchange where it is centralized is not 100% due to there is a KYC needed just so that the assets you have in their platform. But you should always find out and thoroughly investigate the exchange you are going to put your money into and one of the best and safest is the Binance exchange, this platform has been tested and is one of the biggest exchanges in the world in this industry of cryptocurrency.",

So obviously, if you are not trading and holding your bitcoin you won't keep it with them. But they can still perform as design, it can be used to buy/sell by other crypto traders, and the market is open 24x7, so somewhere in parts of the world, there will be buyers and sellers and so the CEX will continue to exists even though the numbers of bitcoin in an exchange is going down. And on the contrary, others may say that it is a bullish sign that bitcoiners are holding it on their wallet.",
