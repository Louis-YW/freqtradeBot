  "content": "Dugin's daughter: 'Ukrainians are not humans. They all deserve to die.'https://twitter.com/WarAgainstPutin/status/1561131023168987136As some of you may know, there has been an attack in Moscow that seems to have been aimed at the philosopher Aleksandr Duguin, whom some describe as Putin's ideologue.Since I don't know Russian, I can't verify what the tweet says, but curious if she actually said that, that she is a supporter of \"denazifying\" when few statements can be made that are more Nazi than that. Mass murder has always started from a dehumanization of the other, be it Hitler versus the Jews, the Hutus versus the Tutsis or other cases. If you see the other as a cockroach, you can crush it without worrying about its feelings and even feeling disgusted when you kill it. Apart from the affirmation, what do you think? Did they kill her from the inside? Was it the USA? Will there be repercussions?",

Maybe that's what the killer wants us to think.When someone incites violence, it does not give the green light to kill them. This young lady was supposed to be sued for her racist remarks on the media. And since this could not have happened, this is certainly the official position of the state.Of course, there is a front against the Russian invasion of Ukraine inside Russia, and it is not surprising that it is supportive of Ukraine or that it is run by hidden powers. And here the United States can be easily inserted through its proxies in almost every country. But I think the United States has no direct benefit for this to happen because such statements made by the dead woman are in its interest to distort Russia's image and inflame public opinion against it.",

I think I missed the most important question in your thread.We need members of Russia to verify these statements. Anyway, I searched the internet using these keywords: \"Dugin's daughter:Ukrainians are not humans\" and didn't find any result. I don't think the media will miss an important point like this to analyze the circumstances of her death.Quote from: af_newbie on August 21, 2022, 04:40:31 PMQuote from: Kavelj22 on August 21, 2022, 04:35:30 PMcutIt could also be Putin himself, you know, to transform the 'special operation' into 'war', nukes, full mobilization, etc.He did a similar provocation to justify the Chechen war.I do not think that Putin is still looking for an excuse to complete the invasion or to reinforce it for such reasons. Unless he ordered her assassination for other reasons not related to the Ukrainian war.",

Will there be repercussions?Already Denis Pushilin, the \"head\" of the self-declared pro-Russian \"Donetsk People's Republic\", has already laid the blame on Ukraine. The truth is that it is difficult to separate the relationship between Russia and Ukraine. A report stated that 17.3% of the population of Ukraine are of Russian descent and about 11 million Russians people have relatives in Ukraine. It would be very difficult to ascertain where the killings was planned and carried out. Maybe some Russians have become tired of the war and wants to instill fear on the ruling class to make them stop the war. The result of this war might be guerrilla warfare in Russian soil. Kremlin have promised to carryout proper investigation and that culprit would be dealt with. Russia never forgives, there would be reprisal attacks. If it is the US, Ukraine would pay the price and if Ukraine is the culprit, they would also bear the consequences. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62621509.https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/20/russia-ukraine-relatives-conversations-propaganda/",

Probably they think this is a retaliation for the seizure of gas plant in Ukraine by the Russians.  It has been alleged that the suspect is a woman who was contracted to kill the 29 yr old journalist by renting an apartment close to her and had her monitored before her death.In my opinion, this is quite unfortunate as it may spark more reactions from Putin as the deceased seems to be the daughter of one of his valued think tanks.",

Both she and her father. And that doesn't mean she deserves to die. I'm taken back by how casually the loss of life is accepted because Russia might be the initial aggressors. The only ones worthy of death are the initial aggressors of the deadly force encounter. Mere words without intent should not be the basis for murder. I'm not sure how much the Putin thought leader bares responsibility unless they are directly involved in war efforts. The daughter bares zero responsibility. Guilt by association should not be the standard for the death penalty, even if she's a fascist.",

No relation to the truth is needed here.So let's say if this was work of Russian resistance, or a non-political crime - maybe Dugina was a drug dealer or something - this might make it look like there is resistance, or there is a serious organized crime issue - bad image for the government. The official story (allowing foreign agents to murder a high-profile person) is not good image either but can be spun into more hate against Ukraine so here it goes.Note how quickly this case was \"resolved\" when normally it would take weeks or months or never (like many journalists killed in Russia). Gotta feed the propaganda while it's hot.Oh yes, they can dress it as a murder of a \"journalist\", bonus here too.",

Believing in  a Nazi or a Russian Supremacist doctrine is not a crime in itself, but it has been historically proven that most nationalisms end up promoting the killing of others and the right of a certain nationality to enslave and destroy in the name of said supremacy.This lady and his dad were educated people, they knew that these ideas end up causing deaths and justify inhumanity by classing humans as \"animals\", \"nazis\", \"sub-humans\". That is calling for extermination. From this psychological bombing to the real bombing only takes an oversized army that has too much of a hold on Putin. As the relevance for the war... probably nil.",
