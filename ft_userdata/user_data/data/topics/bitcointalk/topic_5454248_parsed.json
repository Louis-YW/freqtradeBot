You mean 'send', not import. You can not import coins to an address. I guess it is a mistake. You can import seed phrase or private key. Or you can sweep the coins into another wallet instead which is what is similar to what you meant.

If your wallet has no passphrase and is protected by only seed words then in that case the malicious actor who knows your seed words can easily transfer the bitcoins from your wallet to another wallet.It's always better to have a strong passphrase, and you should also remember to not share your seed words and passphrase with anyone. Save those in a secure offline laptop or write them on a paper, make sure to have extra copies of the seed words and passphrase.

In general, both a 24-word passphrase and a 24-word seed phrase of a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet can provide an extremely high level of security. If they are carefully selected and prepared, it becomes practically impossible to brute force them. However, since the words in the 24-word seed phrase are randomly selected from a 2048-word dictionary, the number of possible combinations can be easily calculated: that's 24! When considering a 24-word passphrase, things get a lot more complicated. Unlike a seed phrase for a HD wallet, a passphrase can be constructed using any words, including made-up words, derivatives, and abbreviations. For example, according to some research from Harvard University and Google, the English language alone has more than a million words, and the average native English speaker can use between 20,000 and 30,000 words on average. Additionally, unlike a seed phrase, a passphrase can contain the same word an unlimited number of times. Due to the virtually limitless word choices and the potential for creating complex phrases, calculating the exact number of possible combinations becomes nearly impossible. So to conclude, the number of combinations for a 24-word passphrase constructed from such a vast word pool would far exceed the already astronomically large number of combinations for a 24-word seed phrase from a fixed 2048-word dictionary.",

      "body": "Let's assume that in OP's example both 24 word seed phrases and the additional 24 word passphrase were all generated in the usual manner when generating BIP39 seed phrases and all provide 256 bits of entropy.In such a case, then the two wallets will be exactly as difficult to brute force. When a BIP39 wallet is generated from a seed phrase, your seed phrase and a salt compromised of the word \"mnemonic\" concatenated with your passphrase are fed in to 2048 rounds of HMAC-SHA512. If you do not use a passphrase, your salt is simply the word \"mnemonic\" on its own. Either way, the process leads to the same 2048 rounds of HMAC-SHA512, and so there is no discernible difference in the time it takes to generate a wallet from a seed phrase with no passphrase when compared to a seed phrase with a passphrase.So in OP's example, either I am brute forcing a 24 word seed phrase on its own, or I know the seed phrase and I am brute forcing a 24 word seed phrase being used as a passphrase. Either way, the difficulty is the same.The difference would come when considering the checksum. Seed phrases have checksums. A 24 word seed phrase has an 8 bit checksum, meaning that on average only 1 out of every 256 random selection of 24 words will result in a valid seed phrase. This means that when brute forcing a 24 word seed phrase from scratch, 255 out of every 256 combinations can be discarded by checking the checksum and without having to run through the computationally expensive hashing and key derivation functions. With passphrases there is no such checksum, and so for every passphrase an attacker would need to run through these functions to derive the wallet.If the attacker knew your passphrase was a valid 24 word seed phrase on its own, then nothing changes. They can still discard 255 out of every 256 possibilities based on an invalid checksum. If, however, your passphrase was simply 24 entirely random words from the BIP39 list which paid no attention to checksums, then brute forcing this would be 256 times more difficult than brute forcing a valid seed phrase. (Not quite exactly 256 times more difficult since calculating the checksum isn't instantaneous, but very close.)It's worth pointing out that this is entirely academical and both scenarios are completely impossible before the death of the sun.",
