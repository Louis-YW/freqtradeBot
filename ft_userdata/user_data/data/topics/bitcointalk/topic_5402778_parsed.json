It’s embarrassing. I don’t like that people know.” Another biggest loser in gambling is on the list adding to the competitive personalities they have in sports. He had been gaming since 2010-2014. Five years of gambling, yet he didn't realized he is not that good like his prime, he must be chasing his loss like everyone who in the process resulted to more loss. Mickelson suffer over $56 million in gambling loss and also spend hours for his therapy. When a guy already enroll himself in a therapy, you can tell its already bad. When you are the ones playing your sports, you'll trust on your skills which is why he bet so much too. I guess this is also what happened to the NBA stars who fell in same loss. It must be hard to cure such gambling addiction since he make a living out of golf sport, he is expose to this sport all his life. The only way I guess is to retire and if he still gambles after that, its really getting worse.",

I think that type of personality is hooked on the adrenaline rush that sport gives him, and finds something similar in gambling.The only good thing is that it seems that the therapy worked for him and he quit gambling, otherwise he would probably be bankrupt today despite having earned so much money.",

He can be the best therapy of himself, he should just quit for like a year or two or even more and never gamble. If he wants to still gamble and see it as fun,  he can later gamble with the money he can afford to lose, dividing it into the amounts that will be suitable for him and to the periods of time he wants to use it for gambling. I am always not happy to see some people getting addicted when it supposed not to be, gambling nis not and has never been a means of earning, but should just be taken as fun and nothing more.",

I suffer too a massive loss in the past and I’m still remembering it until now. I don't watch the full video of his statement but I’m sure he is ok now since he is sharing now his depressing life experiences.Losing 100$ is already painful so I really feel the pain on this kind of video.",

It is even good that he did not lie to himself about needing help and mustered the courage to go for it. He is not the biggest loser and there are definitely other people in same situation as his or even worse, but are being reluctant to even admit it to themselves that they need therapy. People who are less likely to talk to someone, most preferably a professional about their situation, end up getting depressed by the thought of it making suicide an option for them.People should see Phil's story as a motivation to get help and speak up about those losses and gambling problems that are weighing them down. If we have more persons with gambling problems in therapy, suicidal rate for gamblers will drastically reduce.",

Because before it develop such ideas that means someone else has survived in such format or has made it through subsequent gambling whenever it loses. Because from local kind of gamble which we throw a dice I have seen someone who spent up $2000 in gamble and all his hope was lost, and he went home empty handed and return with $500 to restart the dice gamble but at the ends he went home with $10,000. The scenario is that gambling is a game of luck and chance. Maybe the continues gambling will make him to recover all in one hit. Except it dont play with strategies.",

Now that they realized their mistakes in the past, some of them are late to fix everything back but the rest of the athletes that are still in the league, need to consider pondering upon these stories to save themselves and do the right thing when they are no longer getting money from sports industries.",

Dude's probably knew almost everything about golf; knows the ins and outs of most courses, knows the strengths and weaknesses of players in the tournament, among other things that normal bettors and watchers don't. If we are to ask for advice on golf, he'll be the guy we'd go to because he knows more than us, but yet he ends up losing huge amounts on gambling even on his own sport. If you are that deep into the rabbit hole, there's no going back. Perhaps on his case though he can still stomach the $56 million of losses in gambling, but for most of us here, it's game over and a point of no return.",
