Most the time is scam and ponzi, in investment is always have some risk.NO RISK = PONZI. Always think from your logic, If some company offering an investment without zero risk \"why they need to ask or open an-investment?\" why they not just invest their own money.Simple right.",

It has very high APY and im feeling doubt if the price of token can sustain even though if it will have small supply but i think that we must have learned from another project like lanuna. Some project may able to sustain but the dump can't be avoided. The inflation rate is too big. people are only receiving their reward to dump and then going out from the market but mostly of these people may not see any profit as well. I doubt if such mechanism is still working. Im feeling doubt if that will be working for sure.",

It is better to be wise when choosing a project and never got fooled by that attractive APY as I could assume that this is probably another scam project. ^ I am thinking if OP will push so hard and attracted with the high APY, it seems you are gambling on it and making a plan for how to exit when there is your profit before turning into scams. We know a project like this will not hold long enough to survive and that is the reason why it will always end up as a scam. It could be profitable for me but it is very risky, it seems you are gambling but if you are not sure about this, better to stay away and find an investment that is really safe. HYIP usually end up scam.",

How can they provide us returns (APY per 15 minutes) if their project is not gaining or working yet? Ponzi schemes and or any scam tricks aren't new to us OP, and this project seems to be like them.

I'd like to make the OP aware that he shouldn't invest money in new projects and it's clear this is high APY with a Ponzi scheme, no big profits have been set but rather a Ponzi scheme and this is too far from reality to be true.It should be a little reasonable if APY is a bright future then, of course, investors will invest there not in top altcoins, because this is with fraud that often happens, avoid the APY project and think logically that this will not come true.",

They said their fund raising is happening on pinksale, what do you think about the project? They have high APY, https://Tridentprotocol.comThe question is, do we still see the future of projects that offer very high APY? Like Helena Financial for example, even now they don't have proper liquidity on Pancakeswap. I don't know for sure if this is due to lack of public interest in this token or it is because they are doing development for Helena V2 so they and people are pulling liquidity from Pancakeswap. From the Trident Protocol website itself, I don't see anything else that would attract people to this project other than high APY. There is no information regarding the team and also no information regarding their backers to add consistency from potential investors.Instead of investing in this project, it's better for you to buy coins/tokens that are in the top 100 CMC, it's better and safer.Reference:1. https://helena.financial/2. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/helena-financial/3. https://tridentprotocol.com/",

I agree on that investing a small amount of your money is not an issue, big risk comes with a big profit, if we want big profit then we have to do a big risky discission we have so many good project but it still turns into almost zero value, look at what happen to tera luna i still have so many question on my mind why do they failed, i just considered crypto as gambling and everything is possible.",
