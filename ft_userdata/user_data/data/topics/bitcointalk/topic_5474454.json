  "content": "Welcome to our official Bitwala Bitcointalk ThreadWe're excited to announce our comeback. At Bitwala, our commitment to making the world of cryptocurrencies more accessible and user-friendly has persisted. With the launch of our new app, we're continuing our mission.Starting a new chapter, we reintroduce Bitwala’s most valued features from the past—simple custody, self-custody, trading, a euro account, and a debit card—in the face of extraordinary macroeconomic challenges in the world.Our partnership with Striga enables the efficient management of regulatory obligations through specialised APIs, allowing us to focus on delivering an enhanced, user-centric crypto-banking experience.Bitwala’s Key Products and ServicesMobile App: You can manage your Bitwala account and transactions on the go, using our mobile app for both Android and iOS.Bitcoin and Ethereum Wallets: You can store, send and receive bitcoin and ether using self-custody wallets called Vaults and custody wallets.Euro Account: You receive an individual virtual IBAN that welcomes SEPA deposits from and withdrawals to a bank account that is registered in your name.Crypto Trading: You can buy and sell bitcoin and ether 24/7 with instant settlements on your wallets and your euro account.Visa Debit Card: You can order a debit card enabling you to spend your bitcoin, ether, and euro balances and withdraw cash from an ATM.SecurityWe prioritise security and recommend using our self-custody wallets for long-term storage. The Bitcoin Vaults are safeguarded by a 2-out-of-3-multi-signature setup, and the Ethereum Vaults are safeguarded by a seed phrase. In both cases, the seed phrases are shown to the user ONLY ONCE during the setup of the Vault. At no point does Bitwala have access to or knowledge of the seed phrases. Ensuring the secure storage of the seed phrases (private keys) by the user is paramount.Compliance & AvailabilityRegulated in Europe, Bitwala is available for residents of the countries within the European Economic Area, with one exception—Germany. We are actively working to extend our services to Germany as soon as possible.LegalTerms & Conditions and Privacy PolicyOur LegacyFounded in 2014, Bitwala is based in Berlin, Germany. Our journey began with the aim of simplifying the use of crypto in everyday life. We set out to create a platform bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies, making digital assets accessible to a wider audience.

This is a new company. With a former investor, we took over the intellectual property, including the app, the technology behind the self-custodial wallets, and the brand, including the trademark and name.Quote from: NotATether on November 17, 2023, 02:46:37 PMPlease do clarify - what exactly happened during the bankruptcy proceedings?After filing for insolvency, we didn’t find an acquirer, so ultimately the company had to be liquidated. The liquidation proceedings are still managed by the insolvency administrator.The assets in the bank account, as well as in the custodial wallet, can be requested back from Solarisbank until today. The assets in the self-custodial wallet (Vaults) can be restored externally by means of the seeds or transferred into the new Bitwala app. All services were discontinued on the 19th of December 2022.Unlike other crypto neobanks, we have not speculated with customer funds, and with the exception of our tragic partnership with Celsius, all funds can be restored or requested back from Solarisbank.",

Our former banking partner Solaris is obliged to provide access to the funds in the bank account for at least three years. However, users have to actively request there funds back, in case they have forgotten to withdraw their funds before the announced closure. The funds can be requested back by getting in touch with their customer support: https://www.solarisgroup.com/en/support/nuri/transfer/",
