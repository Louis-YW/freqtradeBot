Teaching them how to invest in bitcoin will be a good help to them, since inflation is eaten up the value of our currency. The illetrates do have savings, some illetrates are rich and well to do, especially the ones in business. Investing in a long term investment on bitcoin will help them make profit from bitcoin. Storing their coins in a self custody wallet and keeping their seed phrase safe. Buying bitcoin and transferring it to their wallet is the basic thing that they need to learn, so that they can start saving in bitcoin for the future. They don't need to know any other cryptocurrency apart from bitcoin to safe them from the risk of pump and dump. When they invest in bitcoin and hodli for long, the risk will be limited.",

Perhaps you are preferring those who are ignorant or uninitiated about cryptocurrency?First off, since cryptocurrency is new to them, some people might not believe it at first, especially those who do not know about it. However, if they are aware of what it is and how it can impact and transform their lives, perhaps they will be interested in finding out more information about these cryptocurrencies. If there are people eager to tell you how the crypto world is going, I believe it will enable them to sharpen their understanding even more. Perhaps they won't be left behind, given that we are dealing with concepts from the human race, both present and future. I think it takes a while for people to come to terms with the fact that cryptos exist and that we can comprehend them.",

What is your definition of illiteracy, it can be seen from a different perspective. Is it the inability to read or write or the lack of some basic skills? People who don't know how to read or write might not be able to benefit from cryptocurrency because they need these abilities to be able to navigate through the cryptosystem. Reading and writing are important skills for crypto users, without them the person will have to look for assistance. Anyway, the crypto industry has contributed to the reduction of poverty in some countries. Most crypto service providers pay taxes to the government and these funds are used to build schools and other educational facilities that help to educate people. Some of these firms also engage in social corporate responsibilities like building schools and other educational facilities like libraries to foster literacy.",

There is no segregation because literates and illiterates can all buy and hold bitcoin. So if we have to talk about the benefits of bitcoin to the illiterates, that means you are also talking about its benefits to people that are literates as well. And the benefits are to hedge against inflation and to be used as an investment. If the price goes up, people that hold it will make more money and also helping the economy.",

Literate person usually explore more in crypto that always result to confusion and multiple bad decisions.Most of the successful person that invested on Bitcoin are those who hold the most since its value is increasing long term consistently. Illiterate person can definitely hold Bitcoin longer if there will be someone to guide them on how to purchase it. The important question is how can you convince them to invest while they don’t know how to read and write?",

However if you're talking about illiteracy of the person not knowing about cryptocurrency, that person is just like every other person that doesn't have an idea of cryptocurrency and can learn about it haven been taught about it. Everybody that knows about cryptocurrency today at one point in time never knew a thing or two about it, they later learn about it and improved on it. So the benefit of cryptocurrency to an illiterate person is for that person to learn about cryptocurrency and get the knowledge of it and start investing based on the knowledge he has gotten.",

Perhaps yes, by farming or something similar. But I haven't met such people. In my opinion, people capable of organizing their businesses are talented and have skills that appear after education. But I won’t argue; perhaps you’ve met such people.But how can these people, without literacy, understand where and how to enter at least the seed phrase from the wallet?If a person is illiterate, Bitcoin will not improve his life until he matures. Usually, such people have a low level of mental development, so Bitcoin is useless for them.",

However, everything can be learned in crypto but it takes time to make them able to read and write, and understand every thought or idea that talks about cryptocurrency so patience and perseverance are a must.In addition, cryptocurrency can help them escape from the traditional payment system and use cryptocurrency instead most particularly bitcoin, but in order for them to learn how to use crypto as a mode of payment, then they should acquire necessary knowledge that will make them understand the benefit of crypto as a currency.",

Definitely will and it does not require literacy in the first place. They COULD benefit from this industry and as you said they just need to learn things first. But there are ways and that is if there's someone to guide them with things. Risk is understandable by all people by the concept of 'gambling'wherein everyone is aware of. Athough things are different between investment and gambling, the thought is simply how risk is manageable.",

But still let’s say hypothetically this is created, how does an illiterate person still communicate with the device, remember this are people that can hardly read instructions or even write out anything. First of all they need to able to actually even use the internet which most are definitely finding hard to do, and we all know bitcoin is more complex than that. Have you thought about how they will handle cases like bitcoin transaction needing RBF or them signing from a cold wallet to broadcasting on a watch only wallet. This are cases that hinders an illiterate person venturing into bitcoin. Worst his they trust a friend or family member to do most of this things for them before they get acquainted with it, which is a very big red flag",

Meaning, BTCs can be exchanged for something like goods, services, etc. due to its significant value on the market. Additionally, you can also explain it to them that BTC works something as an investment- meaning you can store it for a relatively long time and it will incur value at the end (e.g. likening it to precious metals such as gold, etc.).Even if there are illiterate people, this does not hinder them from learning about BTCs. More importantly, if they have the capacity to understand a complex currency such as BTC, then this can be their first step of learning how to read and write- thereby making them literate in the process.In conclusion, teaching them about BTC can kill two birds in one stone- they learned about BTC; and they also have the opportunity to be literate at the same time.",
