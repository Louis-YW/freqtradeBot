  "content": "I was a very satisfied customer of DuckDice and found the live support but also the playing conditions, the payout speed and everything else extremely likeable.I don't know what happened, but last week everything changed.Since I don't want to make any claims, I'll write the chronology as I take it from my emails:20.03.2023: I write to support to have my 2FA reset, as I kept having problems with Google's Authentificator app on my smartphone at the time. My username was Firstsamurai.08.04.2023: Same problem. I had sent the smartphone in because of the ongoing problems. Get it back, but it's reset to factory settings. Live support recommend that I set up a new account in live support and have the old one closed.11.07.2023: Another problem with 2FA, in the meantime my username is magix, because I was asked to \"just make a new one\".15.08.2023: I am asked to do KYC Level 1 again. Duckdice has apparently outsourced this process to Sumsub. I upload the same documents again, take a selfie and get the message: \"We rejected you application because you have submitted your documents on another profile. If you have any queries, please contact the Company where you try to verify your profile\". I contact the support team and explain the situation. A few days later, the payment is approved and I assume that Duckdice has manually \"reassigned\" KYC Level 1 because I had already successfully passed this level with the user name magix.04.10.2023: I change my smartphone because the problems don't stop, ask again about 2FA reset and decide to stop using this form because I have to write to support every time and don't hear anything for days. Duckdice's live support is great, immediately available, but seems very limited in its powers. At KYC, there are only a few people available and that's why it takes longer.08.10.2023: The live support recommends that I create a new account again, as this time the support does not answer me within a reasonable period of time. Since it is not allowed to have several accounts and I don't want to do anything wrong, I write to the support: \"I have allowed myself to create a new account with the username kbopunter and the email address kbopunter@XXX. There I have now selected the 2-factor authentication email. I always had problems with the Google authenticator in the past. Please close the account magix so that I am not registered twice with you. I would like a brief confirmation that this is all correct.\" and that's where the problems start.09.10.2023: Support replies to my first email of 04.10.2023 and I reply: \"Hello. The issue of resetting the two-factor authentication has been resolved. Please confirm that the account is closed and that I will not have any problems using the new user name \"kbopunter\" with the e-mail address kbopunter@XXX. with you. Thank you!\"16.10.2023: I am being asked to complete KYC Level 1 due to a withdrawal request. Since I knew from the last time that this probably won't work, I write to the support team beforehand this time: \"Hello support team. I have a question about the level 1 self-verification problem. I was asked to complete this. The last time I did this on the account with the username \"magix\", I got the message: \"We have rejected your application because you submitted your documents on a different profile. If you have any questions, please contact the company you are trying to verify your profile with.\" Since my current account with the username \"kbopunter\" was also only opened because I couldn't log in for days (problems with 2FA), I assume the problem will arise again. Question: Should I start the process anyway or can you take the documents from my first account with the user name \"firstsamurai\"? I have, of course, closed the \"magix\" account so that I do not have several accounts with Duckdice (see below). Best.\"19.10.2023:I do not receive an answer to this mail. The live support refers to the core team. They recommend uploading the documents anyway and writing to support at the same time, so I do that again. I write that my current username is kbopunter and that the documents can be found under my first account \"firstsamurai\".20.10.2023: The account is still accessible, but I am deprived of the possibility to place bets. I ask live support, but they can't help and put me off until Monday.23.10.2023: The account was blocked, the current account balance was paid out to me. In the live chat they tell me that they will not give any information. I write that I will publish this case here and then they come out with the accusation that I have opened several accounts and have thus violated the regulations. Moreover, even with my first account, I never completed KYC Lvel 1 properly.You can think what you like about it, but I always try to act correctly. I always try to remain calm and decent. Hopefully the live support staff can confirm that. You just get totally unsettled when your account is suddenly blocked and the account balance is not paid out. Fortunately, that was taken care of this morning. Of course, I could now live with the fact that DuckDice no longer wants me as a customer. I already noticed that last week with the customer-unfriendly actions. But what I find really alarming is that they don't answer emails and arbitrarily block accounts, even though I believe I have always followed the advice they gave me.Perhaps the live support team should consult better with the core team about what is recommended to the customers.So if you are a DuckDice customer or want to become one, wait until the support team responds by email. It can take days, but opening a second account, as they recommend, like it's no big deal, is something I would never do again.",

Get it back, but it's reset to factory settings. Live support recommend that I set up a new account in live support and have the old one closed.Edit: You were not informed to self-ban and open a new account due to the 2FA, judging from the live support conversation, you banned the account on your own, and returned a while after asking if you we can un-ban it, and as per Duckdice policy, we do not unban self-banned accounts.Quote from: firstsamura on October 23, 2023, 08:03:07 AMsnipHello,Please give me a while to check into your case, but first I'd like to confirm a few things:1.  Your balance has been completely paid out, and there's no active balance on your account correct?2.  You claim to be having issues with your 2FA, thus the reason behind creating new accounts? ( To be fair I find this a bit off as Google 2FA, even though it might malfunction at some points, it's an easy fix and it's easier than creating a new duckdice account).3.  The title seems a bit \"vindictive\" lets say , while currently you have no access to your account anymore, all balances have been paid off.The standard procedure was followed in this case, failing to pass the KYC procedure ensures no further access to gamble on Duckdice.Regardless, I will look into this whole situation, and come back with further information on this case.Kirito89,Duckdice Support.",

Thank you for giving more depth to this story.OP, can you confirm if it's true? That your accounts was not just having a difficulties with 2FA, the older one of them was also self-excluded. If it's true, I think it's safe to say you're the one trying to cheat duckdice, and they made a good gesture by returning your deposit, not the other way around.Quote from: acroman08 on October 23, 2023, 06:57:21 PMif it's possible, would you mind posting your support's conversation with the OP? because, from the OP's post, it seems like the only issue he had with the accounts was because of the 2FA and it was also the reason why he had to create other accounts. but from your post, it looks like the OP asked for a self-ban twice.I don't think that is doable, not without OP's consent for duckdice to share such a private matters.

Can you please do something about this?Theoretically there's nothing we can do about OP opening further accounts, as long as the system doesn't flag him as a clone account (multiple detection factors involved). But in reality there's a pretty good multiple account detection system set in place that should detect any future accounts OP creates.Now regarding the re-oppening of his account, I just checked the system logs and it does seem his account was re-oppened for around 1.5 hours, which I highly believe should not have happened. I'll get more information on the how and why it happened and will update the thread here.Kirito89,Duckdice Support.",

I take the cigarette myself and light it myself. I'm just saying you could make it harder for gambling addicts.I still think I'm being treated like a felon. What else do you call it when you are blocked without any communication? Today, everything has been cleared up because of this entry. It's tragic that I had to resort to such means.That it would actually have been better for me not to have the account reopened is part of the contradictory behaviour of this disease.I’m skeptical on what your goal to this thread. You already admit that you are addicted gambler here and in the support of the casino that triggers your self ban request on your first account.All I can say here is they are trying to protect you instead of scamming you or being rude because this will not happened if you didn’t disclose that you have gambling addiction problem. There’s a chance that you can use this as an excuse to refund your funds later on once you lose.You didn’t lose anything on their casino. Just move on and try different casino if you really want to gamble. Casino has a responsibility to limit user that has an addiction problem or else they might have a legal problem in the future by allowing to play problematic player like you.",
