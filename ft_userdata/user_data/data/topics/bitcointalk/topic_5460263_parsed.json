The so-called yahoo of a thing had made young guys and vibrant youth to earn at a tender age, that is why it's obvious people see any young guy working online as a yahoo guy. Even my parents look at me suspiciously, well am really glad i chose my path as a crypto enthusiast. Most of my friends still look at me and be like guy give me update, even if i tell them i don't do yahoo they will always doubt, and think am lying. Cryptocurrency is a game changer and i see a brighter future for us here.",

The people’s mind have been painted negative about what bitcoin is. Even those engage in yahoo work use bitcoin as an escape route when asked by operatives what they’re into. So operatives that lacks knowledge and understanding of how bitcoin works now term bitcoin and yahoo same and call them illegal. The young youth will now be deceived into not believing that bitcoin is legal and has no relation with yahoo.QuoteComing back to police, people are always scared of them, because one of the marjor things they do now is to search phone and Apps, if eventually they sees anything money even if is legit or not they don't care, they will tag you Yahoo guy and make sure they extort the money from you. The yahoo boys made it to look so to the police, but I also blame those policemen for not wanting to do proper investigation before tagging someone a criminal. Yahoo boys made bitcoin more popular to the police and since it’s legal and not a criminal offence to trade bitcoin, they use that to cover up their crimes. When police found out that method, they began to tag anyone into bitcoin a yahoo person which is very bad and not encouraging.",

They have no idea what a remote job is all about, they have no idea what it means to have digital skills  and  what they just think is yahoo yahoo which is their perception but we on our own need to apply wisdom on how we do things sometimes.

That is the misconception most people have in the country and they have believed that once you are involved in crypto currency then they belive you are into fraud and that's why one day I decided to start a section in the radio station where I work to clarify a few things. I love the section, and as a result, some people started showing interest in cryptocurrency. However, it's always a good idea to do so before you get blamed for losing money. Furthermore, the police issue has somewhat been resolved since the IG issued a directive to refrain from checking phones; I can only imagine the young people's faces when that happens.",

Their words are never pure and genuine.  Was it not the same IGP that said they have given all officers on high way to instructions to remove road block and stop collecting money from commuters but what is it we see on the highway today everyday. Almost 10 check point back to back on highways all collecting #100 from commuters even at the front of their police post they do it without any form of remorse. What a shame.There is never a time I take their words serious because they are all the same from top to bottom all wolf in sheep's clothing.",

These day a lot happens and one need to be extremely careful with how dey relate with people as regards their work if it be Crypto related or online activities such as this we do here. Humans reason differently  coupled with the mindset and mentality about guys that mostly spend time online with their computer. Most times most of these house or home invasion by security operatives are based on reports and those reports are from closed pals you never thought could do that to you.
