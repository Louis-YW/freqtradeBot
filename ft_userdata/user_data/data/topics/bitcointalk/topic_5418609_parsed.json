This initiative is introducing different streams of education that focus on fundamental topic areas, including Web3, Blockchain, and the Metaverse.Each stream will consist of a variety of content formats including audio and video sessions and written articles produced by Unstoppable WoW3 and its partners.In addition to learning about Web3 theory, participants will be introduced to real-world examples to understand how these theories are applied to live use cases.
