  "content": "Hi, Maybe you can understand after seeing the title. Yes, Mods can you please make us clear about it? For a casino, is game credit counting as an altcoin in this forum? Yesterday Owl.games ran a giveaway in the games and round section. They wanted to giveaway 100$ USDO/user which is game credit and will be transferred to BTC after meeting the wagering requirements. USDO is just the name of the credits. It could be BTCO too. No difference here. In the campaign thread, they asked username or wallet address to just only identify the user's account. They will send the game credit directly user's wallet. Because this USDO is just a name they used for BONUS/GAME credit. Don't have any chain or it's not building under any chain like BSC , ETH etc. Today, Owl.games told that they are banned for running the giveaway. So what's the solution? They were not run an altcoin giveaway. Mods can you please explain the reason of the banned?Note: I am a Campaign Manager of owl.games Signature campaign.",

      "body": "I bet this is misunderstanding on the side of mods the USDO is known as US Dollar Owl and as game credits in the owl.games platform and not an altcoin. It can be converted to bitcoin in the platform too.The reason of the ban is because of misunderstanding of it being an altcoin. Altcoin giveaways in games and rounds is not allowed[1]. So it was moved to bounties altcoins, and there is a rule[2] there that making giveaways is prohibited and will cause a ban which came to an end to the owlgames account. I guess mods should withdraw the ban and recover the giveaway thread to games and rounds.Here's the thread[3] in subject btw.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5341846.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2103687.0[3] https://ninjastic.space/topic/5411778",

It is not transferable even not exchangeable, on this contest 100 users will have the chance to participate and try to complete the wagering requirements of 50x, once completed these users can withdraw a max cashout of $100 in Bitcoin.Can you please explain what specific terms of this contest are in conflict and if there is any need to reframe the contest in order to post it here? This will help a lot.",

If the game credit is recorded on a centralized database, then it's allowed if users can without exchanging to other altcoins, exchange them to BTC. I could argue that ethereum and most other blockahins with their tokens are already centralized-ish, some of their tokens and stable coins can be frozen at any time.It's more or less centralized database theater.Quote from: sujonali1819 on August 31, 2022, 04:20:27 PMAs I know from the team USDO is a game credit that is Credited on a centralized database, not a blockchain.

While you could claim USDO is a token (I'd still need some technical details to confirm or deny that), it doesn't seem to resemble a cryptocurrency (or a currency in general) in function.I've also messaged theymos for a clarification and if he gives the go ahead, I'll restore the thread as well. If not, I'll post here about it as well.EDIT: I've received a response from theymos. He did not give the go ahead for the giveaway and as such the thread will remain trashed (although the ban will not be reinstated due to this being a borderline case). If they want to give away USDO, they should do so without requiring users to post to claim it (e.g. accepting entries via PM) and post it Bounties (Altcoins).",

If owlgames can prove that their multi-chain casino records USDO balances and other data on a centralized database (and said centralized database doesn't interface with any smart contract) as opposed to on a blockchain, they're free to post the thread in Games and Rounds provided that they don't require users to post altcoin addresses (so just usernames or emails) and that they refer to the thing being given away as game credit as opposed to USDO.",
