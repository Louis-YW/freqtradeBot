  "content": "Hi all,I am trying to learn more about the best practices and tools to backup the Bitcoin Secure Multisig Setup (BSMS).When you create a multisig wallet, the coordinator app usually creates a .bsms file with all the descriptors to recreate the wallet. This is described on BIP129: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawikiBut having access to that file reveals the funds of the multisig wallet, so I think is not a good idea to store it in plain text. It should at least be encrypted so you can decide who can access it. Splitting the BSMS content into multiple QRs shares would be ideal, so you can distribute each share in different locations. SeedHammer offer in my opinion one of the best approaches. They split the BSMS file content into 3 QRs and you need to scan 2 of them in order to recover your wallet. This is called \"BCR-2020-010 encoding for Output Descriptors QRs\". They show how to do that here: https://twitter.com/SeedHammer/status/1666875008105295873Nunchuk supports importing a wallet using those QRs, but not exporting a wallet in that format. So, if you don't have a SeedHammer, you can't use this approach. I created an issue so they implement that on their Nunchuk app: https://github.com/nunchuk-io/nunchuk-android/issues/21Not sure if there is another tool/app that can export a BSMS file in \"BCR-2020-010\" format.Any ideas or opinions?Thanks",

Please don't create your own custom splitting solutions for anything.This is a sure recipe for disaster and can result in losing of all your coins (not saying you are doing this).I think that overcomplicating things can often create more problems if you don't know exactly what you are doing, and if you are not aware of all the risks.Quote from: maxirosson on June 27, 2023, 06:13:17 PMNot sure if there is another tool/app that can export a BSMS file in \"BCR-2020-010\" format.Any ideas or opinions?QR codes can be tricky and often times they are not supported with all apps.I will have to check SeedHammer and say my opinion about it tomorrow, but simple alternative is to save this data in offline password manager like KeePass (if you have strong password protection).KeePass is already encrypted and it have decent protection, but you will again have to backup and/or remmebmer password for that.This is not pefrect solution but it's much better than saving data in plain text.",

And also, what to store exactly? Wallet files? Not recommended.I think that the best approach to setup a secure N-of-M multi-sig wallet, is to write down the N seed phrases along with the M-1 master public keys (excluding the one that can be retrieved by using the given seed phrase). If you don't feel confident with writing down lots of xpubs, then maybe print them (but don't print the seed phrase).",

There is a BIP (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki) Â that standardizes the wallet configuration in BSMS format. The most important wallets are supporting it. It should be the way to backup a multisig config, instead of backing up each xpub. You need more info, not just the xpubs.",

Using as guest gives you almost all you need: coin control, multisig support, integration with lots of wallets, etc.",
