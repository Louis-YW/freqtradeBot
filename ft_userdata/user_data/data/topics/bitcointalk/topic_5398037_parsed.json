Don't put your hope for now that bull has come because there may be correction looking for you as bull but for market that is a sentiment trying to correction or balance movement. Buying may be good now but referring to be bullish may set others mind for it. I'm yet to see such as bull for this time.",

Im not even sure about this the market is still unstable. just because bitcoin is doing a small recovery from 30k to the 32k doesn't mean market has been getting a signal if crypto will be bullish again but i will give my vote and i will try to pick option 4 to get better profit once recovery will happen but im sure that if we are still in the bearish market and you are too early to say that if we have been entering into the bullish market. It's not yet coming",

You have to say something about this question because there is still uncertainty in the market.  You don't wanna risk you cash today while the price of all the tokens in any option above could dip again. There were serious threads telling the market is going to dip further. Today is a just a little hiccup for the  bear, its kind of a bulltrap in the short time frame and if you take a bit of that bait, you may lose more of your money instead. The better way is to wait for the real trend going up which from there you can do the DCA.",

Just watch the market and bitcoin is still consistently to be dumped. Im not even watching the market caused by it was hurting my eyes, ehwne you are thinking if that's deeper enough and the price goes even deeper. The last option was good but it's also very risky at this moment. I just wanna try to remind you to avoid the market temporary",

If i had to choose, it could bounce up soon but after that everything goes down even more. So honestly i would wait and choose none of your options. This could last for a one more year for all we know. Recovery from something like this won't happen quickly and i think earliest in autumn we could see signs of recovery. If the war ends sooner we might bounce back sooner.",

A portfolio containing 2 or 4 tokens is too risky, you might not be able to guess the trend or growth of that group of projects and be a so-called perpetual investor. People who find themselves in this situation find nothing better than to sell at a loss their unsuccessful acquisitions in an attempt to buy something else that might make a profit. They buy 2-3 projects into their portfolio again and thereby expose themselves to the same risk.I have over 30 different altcoins in my portfolio, I advise you to create such a portfolio in the future. Its advantage is that you can always transfer liquidity from already profitable altcoins to other, more promising or new projects, and if an altcoin has not grown, you can wait it out instead of selling at a loss, because you have diversity in your portfolio and some altcoins will definitely grow, when others are still at a loss.",

Do you have your own technical analysis for us to prove your claims that this is the end of the bear market? I wanna hear an accurate answer from you OP.I guess he just feels it... it's funny how he says \"after first bullish day\"! If it's the first bullish day why not wait a bit more and buy some dip? Isn't that logical? I think that bad days are yet to come, this drop now it's almost nothing compared with some previous years when we saw BTC dropping a lot more than now, in percent of course! So I think that we will see BTC at lower levels at some point, just my opinion... history can repeat itself, or not!Anyway, if OP plans to invest for the long run it's good to buy now, not with his entire capital, he should save a bit if the prices go down more! And I would go with the first option, looks like the safest one! But if he likes to risk and higher possible gains he should go for option 4 or 5!",

Yes, that might do but you're going to have the most unstable portfolio if that's your choice because just look whenever bitcoin is crashing.All major altcoins are affected and if you're just having two of the best then you'll suffer not that much compared to that option that you have more, the more you have, the more losses you'll have.",
