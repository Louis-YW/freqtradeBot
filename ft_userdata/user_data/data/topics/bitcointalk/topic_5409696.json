Let me put it this way: if you know your tx came from a certain website, you know something about a few other addresses too. And if you know that, someone else can know something about your address.QuoteWhat's the point of a mixer if you don't get a fresh entirely new bitcoin address with no connections to any other bitcoin that could be \"tainted\"I like what ChipMixer has to say on this:Quote from: http://chipmixorflykuxu56uxy7gf5o6ggig7xru7dnihc4fm4cxqsc63e6id.onion/articles/basic-theory-2Second - newly minted coins. You deposit some funds and you receive \"clean, newly minted coins fresh from miners genesis block\". Good part is newly minted coins out of coinbase (not this one) should have no history and should be accepted by anyone accepting Bitcoins. Bad part is that none of services that advertises by that does that. If you can use blockchain explorers and try their service you can prove it.Quote from: Anonohmon on August 13, 2022, 04:10:36 AMSpeaking of tainted bitcoins.

Because in my opinion best practice for a currency is no taint, no matter what. It’s always brought up what criminals are using(who are a minority), so let’s ban mixers, shun everyone who uses it and not accept their coins anymore, then what? Criminals just use another platform and we just lost a piece of freedom again and are forced to be controlled harder again. In our fight in \"saving the world\", we should maybe once think about how these measures actually affect us. It’s weird that the proposed solution to every problem is always the same, less privacy, less freedom, more controls. We’re becoming completely transparent and have to justify every single step we’re making, are forced to share sensitive data to companies, to just use the simplest services. The only barrier they still have are some data protection policies, but if you’ve ever looked behind the curtain and seen how employees/ companies actually handle it, i wouldn’t put too much weight on it. So stop acting like regulation equals real practice, execution is a whole other topic. If mixers put people on watchlists this easily, then people should be warned beforehand and then they can still decide for themselves. But let’s not act like we’re not already, just because a spaghetti law promises so.",

It’s also not that interesting, except for advertisers. The threat is about the state knowing individuals complete financial flows and preventing certain demographics from having their money accepted on services/ making it easier to unjustly seize things when this information is completely transparent. The actual problem is linking sensitive data to it, making it mandatory on most services and the introduction of blacklists. Its not Bitcoins fault, but if no one pushes against it, then how will we know it won’t happen? It’s a social issue, not a technical one.

You are already being surveilled by at least a dozen different blockchain analysis companies who sell their data and technology to governments and three letter agencies around the world. All your transactions are already being tracked, analyzed, deanonymized, and linked to all the other data you have shared and left behind every time you do anything online.

It definitely isn't BitPay which demands KYC from all merchants and all buyers, and passes that information to the government.

Don't do anything to have any sort of privacy whatsoever because otherwise you will end up on a watchlist. Far better to simply let the government keep a close eye on every transaction you make, everything you buy, every satoshi you purchase or earn, every website you visit, every email you send, every phone call you make, everywhere you go, everything you do, everything you say, everything you think.

Did you miss everything since Snowden?NSA. OMG you really are sounding like badecker. you do know that exchanges send files to the SEC not the NSAif the SEC then want to pass info to the NSA thats another task after the SEC gets info.. you know logic of how time moves in one direction where the sec has to receive info to then pass it on..so if the SEC only receives 0.1% then they only have 0.1% to then pass on.. you probably are well experienced of things like the 'chainletter' scam where people receive a letter and told to pass it onto 5 people and receive $x for doing so..if people simple dont send the letter then other people dont receive it.. meaning if SEC dont get a SAR then they cant send what they dont have to the NSAits called physics. logic. realityyou forget how the real world works. governments dont have the labour/resources to actively watch everyone. they are only interested in the suspicious events. because if they spend their limited resources on the suspicious events instead of the 1000x of data of everyone. they save themselves 1000x of timeagain common sense and logicQuote from: o_e_l_e_o on August 13, 2022, 07:20:21 PMQuote from: franky1 on August 13, 2022, 03:55:11 PMinstead coinbase only looks at the customers they get red flaggedAnd in your fantasy land, how exactly do customers get singled out for a \"red flag\" if they are not surveilling everyone by default? Maybe the customers email Coinbase and tell them they are going to mix their coins? Or maybe Coinbase just magically know? coinbase do not watch everything. they get data from chainanalysischain analysis watch all the mixer know transactions and report that to coinbasei know you have a wall of text phobia.. maybe thats why you never read things beyond the tweets and DM's of social mediabut please do try to do the researchthen sit back have some time to let actual research soak into your brain and then use reality, common sense, logic .. and not your conspiracy fantasy you read from someone else in your social group.smart people probably can think of a solution/loop hole to regulationEG if regulations dont like mixers. the certain services can easily stop describing themselves as a mixer and instead change just a few minimal user experiences while they wait between the deposit and withdrawal to feel like the service is something else.. but the end result is.. the coins at withdrawal is different then what were depositedEGknowing mixers waste peoples time for about an hour of waiting.. they could stop being a \"mixer\"and instead be a \"game\"where people deposit funds. and a webgame appears on their screen that by doing a deposit allows them to play a game for an hour. and at the end they get their value back out. where it just happens that the value out is from a different taint(much like how custodian wallets like exchanges do things)ofcourse not be classed as a custodian/exchange as other rules apply. but if your smart enough to read the regulations. you can then think of the loop holes of a different category of service thats not a red flag. and not advertised as a service thats on the red flag list. but just happens to give a similar result as what people are looking for.EG by giving out same value as what went in, its not 'gambling' thus doesnt fit gambling restrictionsnow go do some research, then step away from the computer and let the information soak in and use some logic and common sense, rather than conspiracy fear and defending services that are red flagsand if still unhappy and want to cry about red flags.. go complain to the idols you love so much at DCG who own exchanges and coinanalysis companies and tell them how they are ruining your experience",

If the government doesn't like it, it must be shady, right? You are absolutely sure your government would never look down on something you support? They are on the right side of history 100% of the time? You said you live in the UK, right? So the same UK government that is trying to abolish the Human Rights Act? Or like the Canadian government which froze the bank accounts of people donating to a political cause they didn't like? Or like all the innocent Russian citizens with frozen assets because their government are warmongers? Or the US Supreme Court which is stripping away woman's rights?Nothing to fear, nothing to hide is your motto. So you decry privacy and open yourself up to complete surveillance in the hope they the government won't bother you too much. You'll end up leading a life so meek that you'll never dare to step out of line from what your almighty and benevolent government have deemed acceptable behavior.

SERVICES DOso think long and hard about what services you should and should not use.think about what services you idolise which are going against your wishes.. and blame thembut please do show me any transaction that tells me what product someone bought. go on. show me some transactions from 2009-2012 where pizza's, alpaca socks, bitcoin cupcakes were bought as back then thats all that could be bought mainly. where it specifically says those products in the transaction dataits the SERVICES you use that you have to be careful withsticking head in the sand thinking that you can pretend that services dont or shouldnt do stuff magically makes them stop.. sorry real life doesnt work via ignoranceyou cant just sign up to coinbase and blow out a candle at same time wishing they wont flag you when you use a mixer.. .. they still will because they are obligated to. and no wishful ignorance will stop thatoh and read the final section of my last post.. it might actually give you a lightbulb momentfind the loop hole to the regulations. a service not defined in their rules as a red flag.. think about itdont cry about how you want to pretend the rules dont apply to your favourite service simply because you told yourself not to read their policies, to pretend they have no policy.. instead read the policies and learn how to find the loophole to work around themdont cry (that your idols are the government snoops) by trying to say franky must be a snoop jsut to live in fantasy land that you can pretend your idols are not the snoops because the magic of your cries has made franky the scapegoat.. sorry. but the truth is i am not a agent but your idols are.. come to that realisation.. wake up and understand real life. wake up and realise its your idols that are the government snoops. accept the reality and if still angry go complain to them.take your anger at those that work for DCGthen think about the loop hole service that offers the end result you want but is not described as a 'mixer' even if the result is the same..",
