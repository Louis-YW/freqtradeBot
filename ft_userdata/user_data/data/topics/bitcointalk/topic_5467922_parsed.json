  "content": "Untill Nigeria builds a solid wall of valuable relevances they would always be tolerated around the world.A lot of countries admires & envys Nigeria while some treats with fear & conciousness of the influence it could posses around the world if politically fair and economically balanced.There is google eye and a robotic system roaming a variety in the national systems capitalizing to doom the arising of the promised nation Nigeria for its potentials & possessions leaves influential threats to other countries.The Nigeria government is ignorantly running an adamant and Uncompetitive ¬†growth of economy.Until the nation foresees creativities as powerful tool (skill), only then it would be liberated with an influence of it's own authority.There are creative people of business ideas, Agriculturists and technologists that is termed to hiking the valuate the nation against others but regional differences, religious differences and political interests has been its forward biased hindering the possessions of some individuals despites it's potentials to proffers a hike in to the national valuation.The nation(govt) has focused its source of economy booster on the oil sector instead of craving for creativities and other relevances.This is a story for the gods... How oil price rises or falls it becomes threats and hard living to the masses. üòèWhen would there ever be a turn out stabilize living in the country?Why does the govt not adopt to copy with would bring a national glory instead they base of feeding-fats to their pockets?Why the unfairness in politics & the deprivations of exhibitions to potentials that craves to proffer national growth?Loyalty & Flexibility of our leaders to people they are supposed to debate & argue with for our betterment is fast and faster depreciating our personal values including the economy values.Imagine where the US govt waning its citizens against traveling to Nigeria due to its insecurities and criminal activities. https://l.kphx.net/s?d=7462287010553530010&extra=&g=56f2378cb897d447e33ad09744d806d3At a point like this, does it encourage or discourages investors supposing to boost our economy?",

      "body": "During the last presidential election, if you have followed Peter Obi sequently, he talked more about, from consumption to production.The reason why he was emphasizing on that is that, local production of goods, gives value to your currency and it helps to boost the GDP of your country.Another thing way dey kill us as a people na politics, because politics brings insincerity, ethnicity and high level of greed.So until we begin to conscientize our people about growing a strong economic capital base locally, we won't get that recognition and respect that we deserve.Normally when oil price fall for international market, e no suppose to be a threat to us, because we for don get other sources of revenue way dey generate money for us, like agriculture and other industrial and business hubs way dey bring money come. Just look at the landmark of Niger state, just imagine if that large extent of land, can be used for agricultural purpose, by now the story line would have been different.",
