Here is something heavier for your stomach if you're into that kind of stuff:Mysterious Bitcoiner spends $64K to inscribe 9MB of data on BitcoinBut if you think this is something new, here are some pretty interesting things:https://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.htmland yeah, you got the date right it's from 2014. We had stuff like this back then:https://mempool.space/tx/1e444e0f7b127fa8b61104c0694d9bb809847909d00644e1777c782faf047a84Moral of the story? Find it yourself!",

It's better to start looking for alternative options now or just start accepting the fact that things might even get pretty bad anytime soon, as there are dudes out there who are willing to do some crazy stuff to get their invention into the bitcoin network.",

How so, they did not really describe too well, other than hinting that breaking this code would enable someone to find out intel about Satoshi.Maybe, it is a seed for the future for once this encryption can be broken, containing information about the identity of Satoshi? I can't say that I'm not curious about the contents myself, and it will be interesting to watch if anyone manages to crack it.",

Ordinals only the latest reimagination of spam. Personally against, but not enough to be outraged. When, not if, it goes out of fashion, thete will be plenyy of parents grimacing at their inscriptions.",

Probably there are also a few who truly believe they have  future, for sure some that have done it just for fun, and so on but I really think the majority knows how this things end.I remember a time in the HYIP schemes when everyone that participated in them knew they would flop, but the thing was that the first ones would get their profits, so they participated in a clear ponzi scheme but treated it as a betting game, trying to make sure that they get more than they lose, so my guess is that most involved with ordinals do the same, mint before it's too late, buy and try to sell for a small profit, all before it goes down. One has to remember that despite being somewhat foolish these guys are still one tech level above the average Joe that was purchasing ICOs shares with ETH.I might of course be completely wrong but I would say less than 5% of the buyers actually believe in holding those for years as an investment!",

So yes to your HYIP mirroring (those guys are still around, they pre-date crypto so I saw them even in the late 90s). It's just dressed up more attractively, with public devs who're happy to pretend they're doing it for the greater good/spirit of crypto but who must surely know they're just starting up yet another train ride on well-beaten tracks.I've known myself to buy into the odd vanity item -- things I know will never really have the value I fantasise about but still an inconspicuous piece of history I'd like to know I at least did. I've got stamp NFTs from Austrian post to prove I'm not immune to silliness but yeah, I know how it ends.",
