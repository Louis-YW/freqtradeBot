I propose as a security precaution that the option of logging out previous sessions and devices be added. I think if there is a way all existing sessions can be invalidated upon a login on a new device. It will be a good option to have on the profile/password change page.

I don't with Bitcointalk account only but also all access website do you think important like Mobile Banking, Exchange account market until your social media account never save password in your device.The OP probably felt that saving the password in his browser would make it easier to login to his account any time, but sadly he lost his device. This method may be more familiar to those who have multiple accounts and each has a different password. Keeping it on your device makes it easier to login, but there are always dangers especially if you lose your device.QuoteWe can't predicting with our device keep safety in our hands, but if bad thing happen later not worry with Bitcointalk account have because some one don't know about password with our account.Back up passwords and other important things and don't keep your devices online. This method will be very effective for your security in the long term, but you may need to remember the password every time you want to login.Another best suggestion is, sign message to prove your account ownership. Even if the OP lost access to his account due to the loss of his device, maybe he would have gotten his account more secure if he had signed message. But on condition that he still has access to the wallet that was used to sign messages he backup earlier.",

      "body": "You never specified if you lost a phone or a laptop/computer. I am just going to assume you lost a phone since the latter is harder to misplace and lose.You are already aware of how bad it is to save passwords in browsers. Not just because they are accessible to anyone who has the phone, but also because password-stealing malware has been known to have the ability to access those directories and extract the passwords. How much time has passed since your phone got stolen? More importantly, did it have any unlock security? PIN, biometrics, swipe pattern, faceID, password? Having none at all, gives the person who has your phone access to all your online accounts unless you changed their passwords. Email apps, social media, work-related stuff, Bitcointalk. Did you notice anything unusual lately?If the phone can't be unlocked, I am sure the person only reset it to factory settings and then kept it for himself or sold it. Unless you have been targeted by a hardware hacker who knows what they are doing with the phone, I wouldn't worry much. But stop saving your passwords in browsers. It was unsafe 10 years ago, and is even more unsafe today.",

With password on your device, it will be difficult for anyone to have unhindered access to your data without first flashing it. Again, for whatsoever reason, desist from the habit of storing passwords and login details on your devices. Write them out offline. Finally, stake your wallet address on the forum.
