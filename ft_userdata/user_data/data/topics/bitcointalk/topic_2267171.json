      "body": "Quote from: #BitcoinVegan on October 13, 2017, 04:54:56 PMWhat difficulty are they referring to?\"Difficulty\" is a measure of the average amount of work that must be expended in order to publish a valid block.Quote from: #BitcoinVegan on October 13, 2017, 04:54:56 PMMy first question is what do companies mean when they say this \"we will follow the chain with the most accumulated difficulty \"\"Accumulated difficulty\" roughly means the total amount of work expended to produce all the blocks in a chain. This is a basic mechanism of Bitcoin that is used to ensure the integrity of the block chain. One of the rules of consensus is choose the chain with the most work behind it as long as it is valid. Since the validity of competing chains in this fork is an issue, assuming that both are valid and choosing the one with the most work is a reasonable thing to do if you want to avoid the politics and taking a side, though it could cause confusion.Quote from: #BitcoinVegan on October 13, 2017, 04:54:56 PMAnd I need to know what does no replay protection mean?In a fork with no replay protection, a single transaction is valid in both branches, so if you spend the coins in one branch, then you also spend coins in the other branch. Replay protection prevents a lot of confusion, but more importantly (to some) it helps to keep the chain with the lower value coins alive.Quote from: #BitcoinVegan on October 13, 2017, 04:54:56 PMWHY IS THIS FORK NECESSARY?Whether or not this (or any) fork is necessary is a matter of opinion.Quote from: #BitcoinVegan on October 13, 2017, 05:05:47 PMHow can it be manipulated ...\"Manipulated\" is an exaggeration. It implies that some person or group can control where hash power is directed. As we see with the recent BCH fork, miners tend to mine on the most profitable chain and that has resulted in huge movements of hash power between the two chains.Quote from: #BitcoinVegan on October 13, 2017, 05:05:47 PM... why do ppl think that the hash determined a consensus?Hash power is an integral part of consensus because of the rule of choosing the \"longest\" (a.k.a most accumulated difficulty) valid chain.",

They pay you $5000 for your 2X_BTC.  You create a 2X_BTC transaction and send them the 2X_BTC.  After you leave with your $5000, they copy the 2X_BTC transaction and re-broadcast it on the 1X_BTC network.  You get home and open your 1X_BTC wallet and discover that your 1X_BTC are all gone!  They got $61,000 worth of coins (1X_BTC + 2X_BTC) and you got $5000.Quote from: #BitcoinVegan on October 13, 2017, 05:42:13 PMAfter difficulty being defined wouldn't it be more work for transaction to go through a 1MB block as opposed to a 2 MB?If I'm wrong please let me know. No.Difficulty is determined by the amount of hash power, not by the size of the block.The Bitcoin style of crypto-currency adjusts difficulty once every 2,016 blocks.If it takes longer than 20,160 minutes to complete those 2,016 blocks, then it took too long and the difficulty is reduced proportionally so that the next 2,016 blocks will take closer to an average of 10 minutes per block.If it takes shorter than 20,160 minutes to complete those 2,016 block, then it didn't take long enough and the difficulty is increased proportionally so that the next 2,016 blocks will take closer to an average of 10 minutes per block.Therefore, the chain that has the most hash power working on the blocks will have the \"most accumulated difficulty\" regardless of the size of the blocks.",

As more and more mining power joins the race to mine bitcoins, these proofs become increasingly difficult to solve. Hence the cumulative \"difficulty\" increases. What they are saying is this: Regardless of Bitcoin's consensus rules, they will follow whichever chain the majority of the hashrate builds. This means they might start following an altcoin chain and calling it \"Bitcoin.\" Mass confusion and lost funds could easily ensue.Quote from: #BitcoinVegan on October 13, 2017, 04:54:56 PMAnd I need to know what does no replay protection mean?It means you shouldn't transact for a while after the fork, unless you have no intention of trying to access your Segwit2x altcoins. If you try to transact on either chain after the fork without taking care to split your coins first, you could lose funds on the other chain.",
