  "content": "We all know about hacks, scams, password leaks and all the shit that's happening in the crypto world and we also see lots of scammers using mixers to eradicate the possibility of them being caught at all (though there are traces, but using mixer saves these scammers at the least, not intentionally).Now, let's say that a hack happened some day at some exchange for about $300 million (or even $3 million, just e.g.), and the exchange immediately opens up about the hack. For a second, just think that the scammer keeps the coins in his wallet and doesn't move them for some time, however FBI and other major authorities are aware of this hack and they give orders to mixers that if a specific address is provided to the mixers (if they know exactly on which address the hacker has kept the coins), and they ask them to immediately report them about the same, then let me ask some questions:1. Do mixers know where they're getting a deposit from?2. If yes, will they co-operate here with the officials and let them know about the deposit?3. If they do, how will they stop the scammer from moving his funds out of their mixer?",

And even ask the mixer to block that very address?Then even if the hacker moves coins to various sources, it'll still be known because they're not getting mixed.PS.

If you operate in the USA or any EU country, or any other, you are subject to the laws and authorities of those countries. It is another thing if those authorities try to send you a request and all they find is an email. But what you say is like saying that an illegal immigrant is not going to answer to the authorities of the country where he is because he is not from there.Furthermore, little by little, as regulations advance, mixers will be required to have a licence, which will make them lose much of their meaning, or they will be declared illegal, so they will not be in the legal limbo they are in now, and for example, advertising them here will be illegal advertising, which will not be allowed. But hopefully that's still a few years away.So, with respect to the OP's point, mixers can either cooperate, potentially losing customers (albeit for the right ethical reason), or not cooperate and potentially end up as a Chip Mixer.",

Tomorrow, it could be because the owner is black, white, Jewish, Muslim, in the opposite party, anti government, too liberal, fascist, pro gay, young, old, American, Russian, Iranian... No censorship at all. A little bit of censorship opens the door to keep raising that bar in the future little by little.  Quote from: JeromeTash on April 28, 2023, 09:17:43 PMQuote1. Do mixers know where they're getting a deposit from?They don't need to, except possibly with the controversial wasabi wallet. I understand they can block certain inputs from \"blacklisted sources. Wasabi's coordinator zkSNACKs works with an unnamed blockchain analysis company to surveil and identity UTXOs they consider \"unwanted\", \"dangerous\" or simply \"tainted\" in their own definition of those words. If the company tags certain UTXOs as such, they will be banned from coinjoining. Quote from: Stedsm on April 28, 2023, 09:22:15 PMPS.

If they do, how will they stop the scammer from moving his funds out of their mixer?Since the mixers are operating in the gray area - let's be honest, at least in theory they protect privacy of both honest users and possibly money launderers too - they may simply not care where the money comes from. Of course, this is probably the official reason some mixers are targeted by law enforcement too (and it's better to honestly say \"I didn't care, so I didn't know\").On the other hand, a mixer is just a private business as any. The mixer owner may take certain steps without announcing that (from locking and returning the stolen funds to keeping track of the transactions), but, since such things can hurt the image of a mixer, we will never know a mixer's real stance on that.So I think that you're expecting too much.",

And If they are not co-operating with authorities then they could block it because why would they need problems. Honesty is the best policy.",

Both offers a completely different service as well. you can't go on CEXs and expect to have the same level of privacy mixers offer.One great thing about keeping up with the community is, if mixers did something unlike the nature of their service, the stories will likely spread out and they would eventually lose users who research.",

There are few institutions pressuring many centralized exchanges to delist privacy coins including Monero. What come to my mind is, when you're use Monero, you will be suspected for illegal use. But if you use Bitcoin with high privacy level, you will not be suspected for illegal use since Bitcoin is accepted in most of countries by follow their regulations.Talking about privacy leaks of the user's ignorance e.g. honey pot explorer, VPN, no privacy web browser etc aren't related to usage of mixer.",
