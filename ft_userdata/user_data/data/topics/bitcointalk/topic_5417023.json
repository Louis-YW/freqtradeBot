Translation, design, customer service, etc are usually open for remote positions (I work with some companies like this in the past). Check out the service board too, while the companies might not be as big as what you listed, some of them do hire people there.",

Other than that, checking the service announcement section on the forum would give you a good idea who would be interested in paying their employees in Bitcoin. I wouldn't limit yourself to Bitcoin only paying companies though. You can always just receive the fiat, and purchase the Bitcoin amount that you want for that payment period. Yeah, you'll be dealing with fees, but at least you'll be able to decide how much you want to invest, instead of being fully invested.",
