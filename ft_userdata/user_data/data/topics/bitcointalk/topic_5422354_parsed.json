It's all too convenient to point at a failed exchange and say, look they're the bad guys of the crypto world, they are the reason I lost all my money. However in reality I can bet large chunks of what is being attributed as \"lost\" money was in actual fact the value of crypto falling which was further accelerated after the announcement that FTX was in trouble. They did not help the situation, but the media sometimes misrepresent or simply do not understand some of the facts of the case.",

History most times is forgotten until it has again and some will regret, others will be glad they are lucky. The crash of FTZ is definitely going to change the dynamics of old users from leaving their coins in exchange to transfering to open source wallet.",

I know it's quite common that people end up with a lot of loss personally and that individual loss feeling makes you wonder how any more people are impacted, but it's not about the size, but more about the number of people. Nations such as South Korea deal in hundreds of billions of dollars every year even more if you calculate the size of both imports and export and also what's going on inside daily, so just a few billion dollars here wouldn't really change much for the country.",

An open source wallet is much preferable and using DCA technique for investing large sums is much more advisable.No need for panic. Just be wise during investments, mostly over long term.",

It's a crime in my country as in most countries. When someone gives you custody of something, it doesn't belong to you, and it's your responsibility to take care of it, otherwise you have to repair it or to pay damages. You should remember that Bernard Madoff has been sentenced to 150 years in prison and he died in jail.",

Another fact in South Korea, every resident who is born gets various kinds of life insurance.

OK, I did not know that..... so a LOT of the money that was going through this exchange ..might have been \"dirty\"    The thing is... no matter where the money traded on this exchange came from, it still hurt Bitcoin's progress and adoption.  I compare this \"event\" with the impact that the Mt Gox hack had on Bitcoin's progress, because loads of people got burnt and some even turned and attacked the technology.... and not themselves ..for trusting centralized exchanges.",

As far as I know it was founded in 2012 and still exists to this day. I do not encourage people to store assets on centralized exchanges but not all centralized exchanges will go bankrupt. FTX bankruptcy does not mean binance will go bankrupt too, don't try to make such baseless inferences, they are not exactly the same. In terms of age, FTX is very young compared to binance and FTX compared to binance as well as a child a few years old compared to an adult.",

What happened to the FTX platform teaches us not to put our money On any central exchange platform for a long time, it will not be the first or last platform. Only what we have to do is to transfer our currencies to the exchange platform at the time of selling or dealing on P2P. I hope in the future to regulate the crypto sector and put stricter restrictions on the exchange platforms that will protect consumers.",

And funny enough, superficially, without knowing the facts, Binance was the one that seemed very shady from the start with flashy ads handing lambos for an users tho make most volume in there, while FTX seemed like a professionally handled. FTX might have even survived if CZ hasn't said anything, because without bank run, they could have made their money back in next bull run. But it's better this way, exchanges need to be better then banks and actually have full reserves, that's how we win.",
