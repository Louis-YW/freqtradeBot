You will make like 12% each year, so, not the best investment at all.",

However, it's essential to carefully consider the high upfront costs, ongoing expenses, and market volatility before making a decisionBitcoin mining operation is more complicated than your thinking. You will need initial cost to buy Bitcoin miners (ASICs) and other costs to set it up and also resources for operation, maintenance and more. If it is easy in operation and it's easy to get profit, you will not see Bitcoin Mining Capitulation which happens many times in Bitcoin history.These Bitcoin miners capitulated because they're weak miners, have small budgets or bad capital management and they're vulnerable to Bitcoin market shocks like corrections, especially more seriously with Bitcoin bear market that lasts many months.https://charts.bitbo.io/miner-capitulation/",

One reason why electricity is running high if your equipment is old and not functioning as efficiently. Modern equipment can produce high hash rates for every watt of energy which can maximize work and minimize electricity costs. If you are still worried then you can check out other energy sources such as renewable ones. Solar panels have been very popular recently and many more people are starting to use it. Wind turbines are also used for renewable energy taking. There are many options if you are very keen on making profit out of mining.",
