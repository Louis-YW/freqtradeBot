Men are meant to be providers for themselves first, siblings, parents, friends and others as it is believed in the community, so when a man cannot provide even for himself first the basic needs, it puts a lot of pressure on him, when he then has a lot of people who look up to him, the pressure doubles. Men are not easily giving money freely by people because they are not women who people can assist. A man is expected to be tough and have all the solutions to his problem. Men should also learn to help their fellow men as much as they help women.",

In my country there are also many teenagers who have finished school and are determined to steal car and motorbike mirrors, etc., to fulfill their stomach needs. I understand what they feel but this is not good, if you are caught by the police at a young age you will be wasted in prison. It's better to avoid things like this, do work that doesn't involve a criminal act, for example picking up plastic bottles or cardboard and then reselling them, or working as a market worker, for example carrying fruit or vegetables and rice at the market, this job is much better. Don't pay attention to what other people say, just ignore them, after all they can't help our lives, do whatever you can to earn money in your country, even though the work is dirty, but the results you get are clean and blessed.",

It was the punishment that God gave to the male through Adam for allowing Eve to deceive him. If you read the bible from genesis then you can trace some other punishment according to bible account, both the serpent, the woman and man. Looking at KJV, Genesis 3:14/15, God caused serpent for deceiving Eve \" And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel.The woman through Eve was given the punishment of child bearing in Genesis 3:16 \" Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception: in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. Genesis 3:17, And unto Adam he said, ...... cursed is the ground for thy sake: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.So the government only intensified the punishment of a male child by not creating enabling environment for survival and taking care of the family as the head. It is unfortunate indeed.",

That is not how it ought to have been but the older generations have set this limitation,  but now is left for us the new generation to change the societal norms that give and train the male child to bear all the loads of the family by providing the basic needs of every other member of the family. Now the training in the home has shifted to both genders,  now you see a boy child doing so well in the kitchen while handling other tasks allocated to them by the parent, The same goes for the female child whose father gives her all the training needed to survive life pressure where she need to play the role of a man because we have some single mothers who are 100% responsible for the kids so the financial burden falls on the woman who is a girl child,  so society is changing and the world is beginning to view things in a different dimension.",

Most unemployed family members depend on employed male relatives. They don't want to know what such an individual is going through as they put him under unnecessary pressure. It is common to see relatives forcing employed members of the family to give them money to meet their basic needs. I have faced such kind of pressure that nearly resulted in depression but I have also learned some good lessons. Nobody in this world can make me engage in any kind of criminal activity because I want to assist or render help. I have seen criminals claim that the reason they engage in crime is because of pressure from the family. I see it as a high level of stupidity. If they go to jail or get killed the same family members will be okay. They will look for other means to solve their problems.The government is to blame for not providing jobs and enabling an environment for businesses to strive this should not deter citizens from putting effort to survive. You can only do your best and won't kill yourself because of people's bills. If you think I am useless because I don't have money to waste or spend on you, that's your own business because I don't need anybody's approval to be content, proud and enjoy what I am privileged to earn.",

It's like part of being in a sandwich generation and just as what your society tells you there, this should end from us.

Whether it's as a family leader or a leader in another field. Therefore, boys will experience a more stressful life journey than girls. Because one day they will become family leaders and must be able to support their children and wives well. So like it or not, they (men) have to fight extra hard to become truly great adult men.But if I look at the story you describe. All these problems exist in the government sector. Because it is certain and clear that the reason many young people in a country commit crimes is because of poverty. Meanwhile, what regulates and can alleviate poverty in a country is a good government system. Because the government's task is to regulate and manage society and the country, so that it becomes a prosperous and developed country. Including making the young generation in their country have good morals and morals.However, in reality, there are quite a few governments in a country that are more selfish and only enrich themselves. They also forget their obligations and they also close their eyes and close their ears to the suffering experienced by their people. So many people are destitute and do not have a good future.Although not everyone who works in government is like that, but I'm sure many people in government are like that.",

The point of forcing a responsibility on the male child all in the name of just being the male without adequate provisions of support line is what we call abuse on the male child,  and that is the situation in most third world countries.",
