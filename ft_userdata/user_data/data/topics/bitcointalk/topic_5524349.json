Also some faucets will only lead you to gambling sites. Others that you mentioned are means but not free means to earn bitcoin because you have time and energy to sacrifice.

There is no \"free way\" to make Bitcoins/Ethereum or money, unless if you want to tell me that you want to be a scammer. Even scammers spend some time to develop their scam. Anything you invest your time into is not free because unlike the money you are trying to make, you can not replace the time you have lost. Once it's gone, it's gone forever.Even those so-called faucets require your time resource, internet connection, device etc.Use the time you have to learn something that can later help you earn",

Free ways are faucets but faucets nowadays are not generous like years ago.You can claim cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins from faucets, but it is wasteful and you can use your time to learn, find jobs, work, and get money. When you have good income, you can use it for investment.Free lunches usually are not too much.Cryptocurrency Job List",

There is no maximum way to get free bitcoins now and even if there is such as a faucet will not give you any profit because it is not worth it. It is better for you to allocate a sufficient budget to buy and use the DCA method as a step because even though the availability of money you have is small, this pattern is much better than expecting something free now. Bitcoin is already so valuable that something that is obtained for free will certainly not provide an amount that is commensurate with what we expect.",

The only reason people should use them is to trade and nothing should be more than that. There are hacks and money misappropriation that lead to people losing money in the past as they have money on exchanges. Examples are Mt. Gox, Cryptopia and FTX.

The days where the faucets were viable are gone, basically - it's better to find a target for OP and strike at it, become better at it, and be rewarded for it with Bitcoin (ideally).",

Their is no free bitcoin and if you have this understanding to know about no free bitcoin it will really help you not to fall into the hands of scammers. Many newbies have been deceived they could get free money and bitcoin and this has always been used as a strategy by scammers to get people who have this mindset. Anything that is valuable you work for it for you to gain access to it. For you to possess some bitcoin it is either you buy with your own money or you earn bitcoin by working for a service. During the time bitcoin was created then you could get bitcoin by mining on your computer device but right now you an get it for free. No free bitcoin,  you can buy and go into a longterm investment which you will make good profit from it.",
