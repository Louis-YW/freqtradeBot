Most of these chaps will lie to you how big the project will be evenm before it hit the market and unfortunately, so many noobs fall for their liesQuote from: Edcrypto91 on February 18, 2023, 08:46:25 AMI strongly believe that core was not much of a success because their mining duration was too long therefore causing excess supply of the coin during the mining period.Take it to the graveyard already",

Don’t focused on the hype, try also to analyze if they are telling the truth or just a pure speculation. I still see ETH as a the top altcoins and it will be hard for other project to dethrone ETH because its also growing. Didn’t know much about the update of CORE but if many still hyping this and claiming to pump like a Bitcoin, then its too risky to depend on that.",

Why in the million years you would believe that some never heard altcoin would touch even the top 10 marketcap? What was so spectacular in it that made the influencers speculate that it would be so high? Wait, don't tell me. They got big bags of it by promoting it? That's really not the question because i am 99% sure that happened. Because that has happened so many times it's insane how people aren't aware of this scam.Even if they would manipulate the marketcap high which is super easy to do, it wouldn't be worth anything without liquidity and active users . That's why places like coinmarketcap wouldn't list it.",

They would shill hard for this when this comes out. Also there are too many airdropper of this coin so expect a lot of dump from it. When my friend show me its value, of course with that kind of supply Ive already knew it would not be the real valuation since more of its circulated supply came from free mining on their app. Thats a far competition versus eth.",

So yeah, you shouldn't listen to then as obviously they have their own narrative from behind.The thing is with ETH though is that it is still the second best coin, so with that it is still one of the best investment that you are going to make regardless of what you are going to hear.",

Maybe i am not a crypto expert but i do spend some time almost every day reading stuff about cryptos in telegram, on twitter or elsewhere. So if Core would have really been the next big thing that is even bigger and more important than Ethereum, then i think i definitely would have heard of it before. I just checked the project on coinmarketcap and it seems to have a total market cap of around 6 billion $ which is quite a lot for a very new project in my opinion.Of course it is still miles away from being half as big as Bitcoin. It would need to do a x50 or so to be there.",

This coin is as bad as pi coin. It's only owned by stupid people. What you were saying above all didn't evne make sense. This scam coin will be dead with the goes of time. There's no need to compare it with ethereum.

People were only minting it to be dumped and no more. Core was also claimed to be made by satoshi which was fake.",

You do the math and the highest was when it was launched @$5+. What's half of bitcoin's price? $10k, well, if you do believe that it will be there then it's going to be a lot of work but to cut the fun. It's unlikely to take place.",
