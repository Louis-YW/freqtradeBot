It seems impossible if you want to send to a same address, but you ask for multiple outputs in one transaction.Based on my research you can only transfer to different addresses using GUI wallet or CLI wallet, which is come from official Monero website [1]. This one is the guide if you use GUI wallet [2] and this one is the guide if you use CLI wallet [3].[1] https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/[2] https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/issues/740[3] https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/4021/how-do-i-send-xmr-to-multiple-different-addresses",

Do you mean that these 5 outputs belong to the same wallet, if that is, you are re-sent to your wallet, and here all Monero wallets support this, or are they for new outputs or different addresses.If the addresses are different, you have some options. Use the CLI wallet[1], where using the commands you can create a transaction and specify the number of output pairs, or use the Feather wallet[2].[1] https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/[2] https://featherwallet.org/",

Not sure that in right way but worked.You mean, you entered the same destination address as five different outputs so that the wallet can make a transaction with 5 output to the same address irrespective of the transacted amount to each address.I find its little odd, cause it's not possible with other wallets if I am not wrong cause once you enter an address and try to enter the same address it will just select the previously entered one instead of creating new one everytime.",

In the pay to field you would enter the destination address and payment amount separated by a comma. Then repeat this 4 more times on separate lines.",
