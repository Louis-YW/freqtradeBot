  "content": "HI guys and ladies..,So yesterday, I was having a chat with some friends who are far away from my current city, something lead to something and we started discussing Bitcoin, though they are active members of the cryptocurrency community but they are not members of this forum, neither have they ever heard of it...At a point, they asked if there was a place where they can have a general chat or discussions about cryptocurrencies with other members of the community globally, where they could share their knowledge as well as learn from others as well,Bitcointalk came to my mind immediately, so I introduced the forum to them, they signed up but unfortunately, they both encountered this ProxyBan thing and were asked to pay a fee to be whitelisted.Long story short, they actually accused me of introducing a scam forum to them  , saying I want to scam them directly or indirectly, to end the argument, i told them to be calm, that i would find a way around the ProxyBan thing.So I am making this post believing that there are some users whom I believe have the power or authority to whitelist newbies registrants, to enable them start posting without paying the evil fees, at least, my aim is to prove to this two that the forum is not a scam and I didn't intend scamming them in any way.So any help or suggestions on what to do would be greatly appreciated.",

IIRC staff members can also whitelist your friends, but as the message you posted states, probably paying the fees is faster. If your friend clicks where it says \"here\", probably he'll be directed to a list of members that is also able to whitelist users.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5350260[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5350381.0",

I think he did the best thing by seeking solutions here instead of leaving them halfway since their aim is to become members of a forum where things about cryptocurrency are discussed and their refusal to pay the fees does not mean they aren't serious about what they intend to know being cryptocurrency, so I think the op did the right thing and the problem has been solved.",
