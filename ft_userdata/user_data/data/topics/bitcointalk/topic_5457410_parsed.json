You can ask people to just send DM and you trust the suggestion of a total stranger which may turn out to be a scammer. I am sure that anyone that would be sending you PM would mostly be someone that would want to promote there shitcoins. If seriously you’re actually in for investing and then you would need to go through everything yourself and the only cryptocurrency that fits your criteria for retirement investment is bitcoin. But even that needs some knowledge on Its security and the rest. If you are truly interested in investing in them which I doubt from your post then read through the pin charts on the forum or other articles. If you need help ask it by creating a thread and stop asking for people to PM you to avoid something that I am sure would lead to you been scammed",

Scammers are easy to call an amount of money. A serious investor shouldn't be mentioning an amount of money to entice an adviser.Quote from: stevenjohnstone on June 24, 2023, 12:42:23 PM I'm 64 years old and don't have the time to learn the ins and outs of this crypto stuff so if anyone can give me advice I would appreciate it.You are not 64. A 64 yrs old person should have the time to study. Atleast to know a bit of what they will invest into. That is how anyone above 50 behavesQuote from: stevenjohnstone on June 24, 2023, 12:42:23 PMYou can contact me through the forum or via email I appreciate the helpSomeone looking for advice contacts his adviser and not the other way round. Let me give you a benefit of doubt that you want to invest, choose bitcoin, buy and hold in a non custodial wallet. By the q1 of 2024 check your investment.",

If our ancestors can live well and even were rich with fiat currencies, we can be the same. You are right to find alternative assets to invest and run away from fiat currency inflation but your choice on what asset to spend capital for it is important. If you choose wrong, you lose money and surely will have worse finance than if simply hold your fiat.QuoteI'm 64 years old and don't have the time to learn the ins and outs of this crypto stuff so if anyone can give me advice I would appreciate it.If you don't want to learn, even basics of what you will invest money in, just don't invest.

I'm 64 years old and don't have the time to learn the ins and outs of this crypto stuff so if anyone can give me advice I would appreciate it.You can contact me through the forum or via email I appreciate the helpJust as Z-tight said; In your previous thread, in which you asked about learning about Bitcoin and how to use it, you also dropped your email over there for messages to come in from those who were willing to lend you their helping hands. If you are the type to revisit threads, I doubt you are since you might not have the time to do that considering your age, and you might not even see the need to do that. But it's actually risky for you to openly request a DM from people and want them to advise you on how to go about an investment. Half of the mail you might get will definitely be from scammers trying to scam you out of that money.You can possibly get everything you need in an open thread here; there is no need for DM.About looking for the best place for you to invest your $20,000, here is a Bitcoin forum, and 50% of the advice might actually be that you invest a high percentage of those funds into Bitcoin, which I will also say.But since you are already afraid of inflation, We know crypto has a strong resistance to inflation. But it's not immune to price dumps, so while considering investment choices by just calculating inflation risk, also take the volatility of the currency into consideration.To me, Bitcoin has a better voting point, considering that you already have a huge amount budgeted for the investment and that you are also in for a long-term investment. To me, since you don't have time to actually learn more about the currency, just use the money to buy Bitcoin, which it will be worth, then get yourself an open-source hardware wallet and store from a trusted seller and securely save your bitcoins in there. You can just check the price and worth of your investment from time to time until you finally want to sell it.",

Meanwhile, if you want to invest in altcoins, you have to search one by one, which doesn't guarantee you can get the right one.If you invest in Bitcoin, you don't need to look like altcoins. You just need to determine when to enter the market and start investing. And when you have succeeded in getting Bitcoin, you only need to hold it until the next ATH to enjoy the benefits.But be careful with the frequently changing conditions of the Bitcoin price and don't panic if you see it happening.

Open a non custodian wallet and keep your Bitcoin inside. And make sure that $20,000 you want to invest with Bitcoin is the spare funds in your hand because you are not going to spend or touch them for about 5+ years.

It's either you end up being taken advantage by ither users or end up in huge loss if you won't be able to manage the risk, in particular with market price volatility. No investment would generate instant and assured profit. So if you are planning to use your retirement money, which we could refer as your last salary, engage it to something which would give you higher chances of earning profit such as starting a small food business and such.

This is important when it comes to risk taking and not making a mistake of sending your crypto coins to the wrong Blockchain. The market is not that bullish now so it's going to be a big advantage for you when you buy now and and hold for as long as you like. The buy of Bitcoin will soon go up more so I will advise you to go for Bitcoin because it is the number one crypto coin in the market based on market cap, numbers of holders and liquidity. Bitcoin is one of the most reliable reputable coin in the market and you will not have a problem when you buy it. Make sure you also stay away from scammers because they will dm you and tell you they can help you purchase any coin that you want, remember scammers are everywhere so be careful.",

I can easily suggest Bitcoin, or even Ethereum, but it seems like you don't know anything about the 2 of them thus, I don't want you to put your money into something that you don't even know. If you really want to invest into cryptocurrency then at least spend some time learning it please because you might see your portfolio losing double digits in span of a few days, and you might feel panicked because of that. Anyway, whether what you're saying is true or not, I wouldn't suggest any coin for you because it seems like you don't know anything about crypto like what you said already. Just focus that money in different asset class.",

When you are educated and knowledgeable, it will be simple for you to conduct your own study and identify the best coins for potential investment.
