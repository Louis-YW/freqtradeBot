  "content": "luty.io is a fiat to Bitcoin on-ramp with low fees, frictionless purchasing experience and no KYC for transactions below 1000EUR*Why Use luty.io ?High KYC Thresholds – Buy upto 1000EUR per day without KYC*Very Low Fees – 3.5%We Use Stripe As A Merchant Account Provider – PCI compliant - we never store your card details.Withdraw To “Hosted” and “Non-Hosted” Wallets Strong Customer Service - Telegram chat agents available 24/7 No-Sign UpAll customer login records, name and addresses are destroyed after 120 days. Although card details may be held for longer by StripeBitcoin Only – Forever! *see below for more details on this policy How Can You Offer Fiat to BTC On-Ramps With No KYC? For transactions above 1000EUR we will ask for the full gambit of KYC documentation. However, for transactions below 1000EUR, our default position is that KYC is unnecessary if your transaction has not been flagged. Current merchant accounts and third-party apps are so successful in identifying carding fraud that KYC and AML procedures are no longer needed to stop fraudulent transactions. On a practical basis,  KYC/AML checks are more or less an extra layer of paternalistic gatekeeping.  Plus, the refund liability has shifted from the merchant to the bank with the advent of 3D Secure Version 1. However, we are currently building out an AI application that will additionally screen all transactions for fraud. With a particular emphasis on cases of “friendly fraud”, which the merchant account fraud engines can struggle to identify. This is still in development; as such, all transactions will be manually reviewed during ( Berlin CEST ) office hours. I know that this can sometimes be a pain, but we are working 24/7 to build this AI application. Once completed, all transactions will be instantly settled with minimal human interaction. We are keen on keeping our merchant account and reducing chargeback fraud instances to near zero. As a non-KYC on-ramp for amounts below 1000EUR, our service is highly attractive to carders wishing to cash out stolen EUR BIN’s. We know that we will be a target for carders and as such need to progress slowly, keeping our merchant account relationships intact.These points mentioned above only apply to card issuers and merchants in the EU and UK. During our Beta trial we will only be processing card payments from EU card issuers, from customers based in the EU and only in EUR currency.Minimum EUR Amount?If you want to test our service you can use smaller amounts. The minimum transactional amount is 1 EURWhen Are You Implementing Lightning?Very soon - after we finish our internal AI fraud appHow Is The Bitcoin Price Calculated?The Bitcoin rate is calculated dynamically using publicly available market data, primarily from the crypto compare ( www.cryptocompare.com ) pricing API - it should be a very tight spread. But I love stringent KYC policies and making funny/cutie videos during the onboarding process Cool – then our service is not for you. We have been involved in Bitcoin for so long and have developed a very thick skin so please hit us up with any questions, concerns, or criticisms.  We will try to provide as much information as possible. Our team works within the card processing industry, and many have been around Bitcoin since 2013. We are not planning to become overnight millionaires from luty.io but rather try to give something back and offer a service to Bitcoiners sick of KYC/AML www.luty.ioLuty.io is in BETA[/list]",

Obviously we are not strictly partners of these organisations rather we use their services. This small piece of content was overlooked and should not have been added to the site. It has been changed to \"We Use\"QuoteWhat about license question?To be clear we do not, nor will ever, have a \"Licence\" to operate a wholly ethical and moral service based on Natural Law. We don't seek out approval from centralized and bureaucratic organizations who are the total antithesis of Bitcoin and what it stands for. I'd love to go on a massive AnCap rant, but I think you get the point.QuoteYour site asks for the the card holder's name and address. Unless you use a stolen card, that's pretty much the same as KYC.This is an interesting point, obviously there is a conflict in that we would rather not require any card holder information, other than card number and expiry date. However, we are also very aware that our site is very attractive to carders looking to cash-out stolen BIN's. We have to record the card holders name and address in order to fight any cases of fraud, through chargeback appeals and internal fraud measures. To address your second point directly - I don't think recording the card holders name and address is in any way in the same league as typical KYC practices, which includes taking copies of passports, proof of address, and selfie pictures/videos. This information is a honeypot for malevolent centralised organisations and outright criminals. For exmaple, with this information I can very trivially setup bank accounts and request other financial services in your name. Hope that all makes sense  - and we welcome more questions, please !",

This is an interesting line of thought, which I would love to explore and ask more questions, specifically, why do you think giving name and address details, which will be securely destroyed from our servers is the same as handing over passport, proof of address, selfies etc?The utility value of a name and address compared to full KYC documents is night and day.

Or are we missing something ?  - serious question.QuoteAgree, what's the reason?The reason why we ask for names and addresses are: 1. In order to purchase anything, and I mean anything ( bitcoin or a toothbrush ) using Visa or Mastercard you need the names and addresses of the card holder. This is not our internal policy, nor Stripes, but rather the card schemes - Visa and Mastercard. This is how the card payment systems work - if no name or addresses are recorded it is impossible for the transaction to be settlement through these card schemes. Thus impossible for payments to be made and merchants to receive funds.2. To combat card fraud  - addresses are checked by the merchant against the address and name linked to the card number ( BIN's )Its great engaging with the community and please ask more questions/criticisms.",

Maybe we have a different idea of what KYC means: to me, it's being forced to share any real information about myself. Stuff like my name and address.

There are various levels of KYC if you want to call them that. Even Binance in the past when they had that no KYC rule allowed people to freely withdraw up to 2 BTC a day. If you wanted more, you needed to go through a basic KYC verification. If you wanted no limits at all, you had to provide them with much more information. About the data being destroyed from your servers. That's a matter of trust. I don't know if you do that. You say you do, but I can't verify that myself. I have to trust that you will do that, and that you won't leak, sell, or have my data stolen by/to one of those darknet forums you mentioned below or some other 3rd party.

My question is, why does someone who wants to store and handle personal details of crypto traders know how much they can be sold for? Having certain knowledge isn't equal to being untrustworthy, but money makes people do nasty stuff. Or they could consider doing it in times of need.",
