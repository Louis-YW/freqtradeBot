Could you do well to give us link to the site let us have a good look at his skill and possibly make some recommendation because the speed at which the website was designed is very fascinating  and it shows how good he is at his work.

No escrow, no payment terms and conditions, no amount, no proof. I thought on the normal, doing business here with someone you know nothing about would require you to be extremely cautious and careful so as not to be scammed. Looking at the nature of the job I think it should be above a hundred dollar buck for a start but I was also thinking as well how come it could take up to them 2hours to round up. Well I do not doubt his capacity but I am only curious about the whole thing or would he not want to promote his works here for us to see so we could applaud him and make recommendations for him.",

Yeah, I agree basic WordPress website can be set up even in a matter of minutes if the domain is not new and is already propagated I always do this on my own sites I just fix the permalink and just come back later to see what plugins to be added based on the theme of the site.But it's different when you're offering a set-up business, there should be an agreed turnaround time even if it's the simplest and basic usually 24 hours even if the set up took a couple of hours, is there a discussion about the time frame or you sent the site when set up is already done.I hope your client agreed to post the site you've set up for us to see this will become a reference on how good and how fast you are.",
