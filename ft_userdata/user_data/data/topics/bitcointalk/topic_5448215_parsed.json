Economically, there is no way such magnitude of sanctions would be meted on an economy that it will not affect it. Many countries of the world cut ties with Russia, so it's affecting their Employment, Trade balance, GDP and many more. The economy of Russia is contrasting at a slow pace and economists around the world fear more over time.According to IMF, Russia's export dropped by 15.98% in 2022 and expect imports to increase by 5.6% and export by 3% in 2023. This equation is simply not in favour of Russia.Also, Russia's GDP dropped an average of 3.05% in 2022 when the best and worse scenarios are averaged, and the economy expects worsen in 2023. The graph below is from europa.eu, it should tell you something.It shows that the GDP has broken down from its ranged level since 2018, which might be a sign of more stress to the economy over time.However, unemployment has not been noticeable much in the country, thanks to government efforts and measures to counter it. But for how long?",

So far, Putin's economists have been able to minimize the effects of those sanctions hence, the rise of the Rouble.In fact, the Russian ruble is currently depreciating against the US dollar.  At the same time, the depreciation of the national currency is very significant.  Some economists predict the exchange rate - 1 US dollar = 100 Russian rubles as early as this 2023.  Yes, there is a gradual replacement of foreign brands with Russian (Turkish, Chinese brands) in stores.  At the same time, a paradox arises - European brands are actively leaving Russia, while American brands remain.  At the same time, all McDonald's restaurants in Russia were closed.  Instead, they are now restaurants of the Vkusno i Tochka brand.  At the same time, food and household goods are becoming more expensive in Russia, and tariffs for utilities and electricity are rising.  But the most important thing is not in the state of the economy.  The most important thing for people is the general mood of the nation for a progressive positive future.  If there is no such attitude, then this is a disaster.",

Is it false that a lot of money is going every day from Russia to other countries?By the way, do you only talk about Moscow or about the whole Russia? If Moscow gets affected, I don't think Putin will end up well. Think about what's happening outside of Moscow because all the resources from other cities/towns is always spent on Moscow.Definitely no one wants to see people feeling and living bad but the aim of economic sanctions is to push Russians to change Putin but that's not gonna happen, I believe. But long-term, the situation will go worse for Russia, that's for sure. One year and two years don't radically change the fate of such a big country.Quote from: Pierre 2 on April 10, 2023, 08:36:00 AMHe said that even if economy is damaged, a lot, I mean in long range, Putin's approval rate increased (he said he disliked it and voted different party etc). He said he feels like Putin will keep winning as economical effects are under control, for now at least.Does anyone really think that Russian elections are purely dependent on proportion of votes? I remember Putin briefly said that his government won't let other powers to come in government because it may be dangerous for Russia. I remember he said it when one journalist asked him a question about Navalny.I hope that no one believes that Russian statistics regarding the popularity of Putin is true. Well, if you go out and your friends who were Anti-Putin turned into Pro-Putin, then that's a very sad news.",

Although most of them did not return, I read a few days ago that some of them survived and committed a new crime immediately after returning home, and were again sent to prison. Will the main orchestrator give them another chance? You know what they say, statistics are important, and it doesn't matter how you reduced unemployment - 10 years ago my country had about 500 000 unemployed, last year we issued over 120 000 work permits to foreigners, and for the government that is a success.

Therefore, the state of affairs in these two cities does not reflect an objective picture throughout Russia. In addition, Russia, of course, has a large margin of safety, which is now rapidly decreasing. Therefore, for the time being, the appearance of relative prosperity remains. The National Wealth Fund of Russia is catastrophically decreasing, the budget deficit has been growing rapidly in recent months, and the gold reserves are starting to run out. If Putin's life lasts another year and, accordingly, the war in Ukraine continues, all this will be clearly seen by the Russians by the end of this year.",

I will not totally agree that the war did not affect Russians negatively. But I will believe that this invasion have both affected the economy of Russia positively and negatively. Russians are now buying locally made products which is a good thing to the Russian economy. Local industries now have less competition from foreign product which will make them make profit and increase employment opportunities. Russians have been forced to negotiate trade using the Russian Ruble which help to reduce their overreliance on the US dollars. The negative implication is that there are lesser foreign direct investment, limited product substitute, unemployment and reduced transfer of technology. But I will also accept that the US and NATO underestimated the Russian economy. They thought their multiple sanctions will cripple the invader's economy, but they were surprise that their predictions failed. It is clear that Russia have prepared for this war and the resultant sanctions. The economy seems to be sanction proof.",

Moreover, in such a network it is extremely easy to identify LINKS between \"financial partners\".2. Any of your cents will be blocked as soon as you become a \"suspicious person\".

People will no longer own their money.But someone sees a fabulous dream \"there will be no hegemony of the dollar\", not realizing that when such a solution is launched in the country where the \"rejoicing\" person lives, he will not have any money at some point And for Russia - yes, it is also the raising of the \"financial iron curtain\" from within the country, so that no one can withdraw a penny anywhere, bypassing state control.

Of course not.",

      "body": "Quote from: buwaytress on April 12, 2023, 03:54:09 PMDo you know if people outside are less open to doing business with you? I know I worked with several freelancers before who had to close their accounts on several platforms. Crypto-accepting people are probably less affected, they still have the means to transact, but I'm understanding from anecdotal evidence that clients are less willing to work with them (without actually saying it's because they're Russian).If there is an effect, there is an impact on revenue coming from outside.A familiar lady made beautiful handmade dolls, which were willingly bought by collectors from France, it seems that now she has stopped doing this. Now she is engaged in interior design, she is doing well.Several familiar programmers working remotely for Western companies were forced to relocate with their families after the start of a special operation in Ukraine - to Georgia, Turkey, Italy and Canada. Hope they are doing well too.Freelancers and small businesses, of course, were hit harder than others by the sanctions, just as a year earlier they also suffered from the lockdown and the pandemic. I think this is normal, even without sanctions and a pandemic, they usually suffer the most, this is the way.Quote from: darkangel11 on April 12, 2023, 07:11:02 PMHow do you feel about recruiters walking around town handing out conscription notes? Not long ago there was an article that they're planning to send summons through email and mobile phones and if you ignore them you'll get your driving license suspended and won't be able to get a loan. On one hand Russians are doing fine because they're alive, have a place to live, food in stores, Internet, but on the other a lot of products disappeared from stores, they don't have enough paper to print labels and car parts for EU and US made cars. Russians seem to be fine because they used to drive Ladas and will probably drive them 10 years from now, but all is not as good as they're painting it. 1. I don't care, I haven't seen any of them. I heard something similar happened last fall in big cities, in my city there was nothing like that. Summons to the military commissariat were mainly sent through the personnel departments of large enterprises.2. Nothing is missing, there is no shortage of goods in any direction. It’s just that some goods have become more expensive and you have to wait a bit, but in general, the system of parallel imports works well, through Turkey or the UAE.",
