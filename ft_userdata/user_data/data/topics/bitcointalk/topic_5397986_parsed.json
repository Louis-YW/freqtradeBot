If that's the case, better make a cold storage first, like bitcoin paper wallet or use old laptop as wallet and wait until your funds grow enough to have it stored in a hardware wallet. Investing in altcoins is always risky, buy now seems to be a good time to buy.",

Nano x is 150$ I guess, does it make sense to buy Nano x now or buy altcoins now and Nano x later.Ask yourself these fundamental questions like, the $300 is it for investment purposes if yes then I will advise you to put it into some potential coins that will yield you profits in the long run because my idea of a nano wallet is for storage of assets that are solely for future use and not for investment so taking $150 out of the $300 you have is going to limit your purchasing power and you know how the cryptocurrency market work you can't get the bear market for so long. My conclusion is to invest all the funds and when things get better then you can get a nano wallet for yourself.",

Nano x is 150$ I guess, does it make sense to buy Nano x now or buy altcoins now and Nano x later.There is no single answer...Do you believe the bear market will be over soon? In that case, it might be a better idear to buy crypto with your $300 and keep it on a decent desktop wallet (or, even better, cold storage)... Wait untill the price rises, sell $150 worth of crypto and buy a hardware wallet then.Do you believe the bear market will not be over? In that case, i guess paying $150 for a wallet to keep $150 in crypto would not be ideal either, but in this case you might consider wether or not you eventually want to buy a hardware wallet anyway... So you could just bite the bullet right now.",

Altcoins are more unsafe investments than bitcoin, hence buying the HW may be better investment. 2. Nano X is imho too expensive for what it does, you can find cheaper HW. Even more, if you are knowledgeable enough you can setup cold storage(s) for a fraction of that money (on USB). Or paper wallet(s).All in all, there's no easy answer for your problem.",

Also its to expensive which is not ideal for now so best thing to do is to buy top altcoins which suffering heavy bleeding then hold it since for this your $300 will multiply and then just think about buying the wallet you wanted if you already hold a huge volume of alts.",

Nano x is 150$ I guess, does it make sense to buy Nano x now or buy altcoins now and Nano x later.I would say if you have invested some amounts in bitcoin and have spare one's to invest in altcoins the drop this thought and go all in for bitcoin as my personal experience.See the thing is most of the altcoins are shitcoins at this time or other intended as scam people.If you are planning with the ETH then you can't afford gas as it has gone too above in prices that you would end up giving too much for even small transactions also so it's not good choice for you.The other in top-10 on CMC have always fluctuated except the king bitcoin so just a suggestion to invest in it.Moreover you are in the bearish market and you could get more bitcoin at discounted rates and hold them long term.And then you could probably buy HW with the remaining amount and Ledger is good option and keep your funds safe but if you wish to keep them then non custodial wallets are also good but with proper backup of your seeds and passphrases on offline backups at various safe locations.",

Nano x is 150$ I guess, does it make sense to buy Nano x now or buy altcoins now and Nano x later.Do you want to hold? Not only hardware wallet can be used for holding because it is not the only cold storage wallet. You can generate a paper wallet or use a wallet on airgapped device if you have a device like phone or laptop (computer is a perfectly airgapped option) to spare for it. If I am you, I can still go for online wallet, follow a precautions to avoid malware, like not clicking on ads, making use of ads blockers and only accessing the correct URL and my coins should be safe. But this idea is only good for low amount of money. For large amount, like $1000 and upward, I will consider to use a wallet on airgapped device or better still use a paper wallet (which can be (HD). Also, the cold wallet setup can be for most my coins while small amount of the coins which I need for frequent transaction can be on hot wallet like Electrum online wallet for bitcoin.",

I have had it personally since 2019 and I can say that the design is very good and that it really looks like a premium device compared to the S model.I wouldn't buy it today because I think it's too expensive (I paid about $90), it still has battery issues, and Ledger is no longer a company I trust. However, everyone should make a decision for themselves when buying such things, although it is logical to put security and trust before the physical appearance of such a device, which we will certainly not wear as a fashion accessory.",
