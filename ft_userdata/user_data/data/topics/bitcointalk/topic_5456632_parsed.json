  "content": "Assume all guys here are gamblers. So, no people can have moral advantage than others. No Judge. No matter what the reason is, you plan to gamble as a major income or only income source. This is super super hard. Sorry for you. But I have three personal opinions.Opinion One, a few people called Professional Gambler take gambling as a job for a living. These people have the skills to make that happen. My scheme is working on that. But it looks like so scam to many dudes, so you judge it on your own risk.Opinion Two, there is no sure win methods or 100% profit strategy in gambling. If someone claim that, I will just go away because I won't definitely buy that. You believe you pay. I don't believe, just leave. Keep life simple. No judge to the buyer or seller. We are not the World Cop like Uncle Sam.Opinion Three, this is the most important one. YOU. No one put a gun on your head to push you to gamble. You can do anything if you can control yourself by supreme rules. Like the stop-loss, stop-win, gamble hours per day......The key is self-control. Comparing the power of self-control, others are unimportant. Some people success, then they can be called professional gambler. After gambling soooo many years, sky city Auckland, the star Sydney, crown Melbourne, nationalcasino.com, stake.com platinum5 (sylviegreta), wolfbet.com......still struggle hard to become a professional gambler......This is the inmost thing on yourself......Others are the camouflage of the essence of gambling. If these opinions make you find the right direction, I will be super happy.Thanks for reading. Scammers are everywhere, please think deep and seriously before doing anything.- -It is a terrible terrible terrible decision to take gambling as income. Boys, never do such stupid things like me. I will take gambling for entertainment only from today which is 3rd July 2023. Maybe I can stream playing dice for a major income. FuckDice is the name on kick.com. All casinos are scammer. Never trust them.- -Update One at 18 June 2023 > People are nice and kind when they find out I am not the fucking scammer. Love you guys. Four pages of discussion, people supply different angles on gambling, and very happy to see most of you take gambling as entertainment only. Beautiful. Let's continue tomorrow. See ya brothers.- -Update Two at 18 June 2023 > 70-80% people clarify do gambling as entertainment. This is really good for you and family and should be sticky on this track. But in my case, there is no choice for entertaining anymore and past this ‘entertainment’ edge so long ago. In simple words, gamble for living is my solo fighting in rest of life. Here is the plan, digging out any game has low house edge (maybe Live Baccarat current), 100$ balance, use $2 chip, win 2chips or lose 5chips in one shoe. Stop-win at 10-40 chips for the day. Stop-loss is 15 chips for the day. When profit goes to 3-4 times of the balance, double the value of chip once. There are good strategies book in Amazon, they can teach the skills you need. But only for skills. This is a super rough plan just for an example. My core point is still self-control. No matter what words you say or actions you do, gamblers will continue to gamble. This is the fate. Lose control in one second, back to 0 and restart for everything. This is another dead vortex to fight. - -Update Three at 18 June 2023 > It is funny and interesting when figure out the relations between win and lose a little deeper. More than 90% of people will happy when win the cash in the pocket. Will be mad when looking at an empty wallet. Cash in and out is the kernel for them under this situation. If 'the cash' no matter belong to win or lose, you will be super emotional if 'the cash' is all you have in life. This is what casino plan to. Supply you suprising and exciting, then scam/steal/rob all your money. Please keep self-control in mind. This is the core value of professionals. If we cut the gambling fund into 1000 pieces, and set the stop-loss up to 2 pieces per day, you will have the opportunity to be one of them finally. The stop-win is also as importent as stop-loss. This is another major job for professinals. Let me explain more. When you know the exactly amount on win or lose before you gamble, you will get the feeling of everything under control. For most of people, this is the source of confidence. This is why self-control is the core. In simple words, we should fucus on win or lose itself instead of the details of cash. We practice the kills and learn the strategies, just for winning not cash. Cash is meaningless here. No Pressure Gambling is the second important key for professionals. Friends call me Bob. Am a gambler not a writer. English is not my native language. But will trying the best to show everything I know in gambling.- -Update 4 at 19 June 2023 > 8 pages discussing and arguing on this topic in two days is truly impressive for newbie. I decide to end the discussion good or bad or entertaining or income at here and will respond the real gambling experience sharing only. Practice makes perfect. If people take gambling as entertainment, congrats to you. This is the best way to treat gambling like that. As a gambler for more than 15 years, I will keep gamble until to be the professional ones. If not success, it is just the fate for another ordinary guy. Just a pure amateur. I will pay what I do.- -Update 5 at 20 June 2023 > Boys. Foucs on the games and move to the next stage. If you have an online casino account, why not post your daily win or lose here? If you win, you will get congrats and be admired. If you lose, you will be mocked. BTW, all the posts in front 10 pages which have clarified the truth of gambling for different groups. And hounds of casino will mess up the discussion and make some of you confused for sure. Judge it by your own risk. All information about 'discussion' on gambling will be ignored. I will talk what I 'do' about gambling everyday. The 'do' will be posted three times in a week. The date is Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. The details of 'do' may will start at Page 10/11 depends on the new posts by others. This will be my text stream in future. For now, key numbers are $30 and $100. I will show the details of win or lose as many as possible. And please don't share fake numbers or your imagines here. Let's put it real and simple.- -Update 6 at 22 June 2023 > All of us should agree and respect the fact which 95% of gamblers will lose. Except scammers and boss of casinos, no matter you play for fun or income, this is the one we should keep in mind. If you want to make gambling for a living, learn and train yourself to be the 5% of top gamblers is necessary. Changing the mind and improving the skills are a big challenge for any people want to build something here.- -Update 7 at 22 June 2023 > Just one week posted on this community, I got the idea to name my whole project “GRINDER”. Stop-loss and stop-win are still $30/100 for the day. Half the base bet from $1 to $0.5. Don’t care how long will it last but preparing a whole day to fight. Boys, take it as a war if you want to survive here.- - Update 8 at 23 June 2023 > New announcement on #220 of Page 11.- - Update 9 at 23 June 2023 > Most of people are ordinary which is just natural rule. Few of them are the elites depends on few channels. First of all, blood. This is no meaning for most of us because we can’t do anything on that but only accept. Second, miracles. Hit the lottery and such things. Again, we can’t make it happen through efforts. Third, solid circle. this is the one for original ordinary people. You want money, he/she wants money, all of us want money. Even fucking Eddie wants money for his third mansion in Melbourne and this young man has bought two mansions worth $35 and $80 million dollars each in last two years. Okay, now we gamblers always lose. The most solid circle to win is just one word, quit. Stop losing is another win. Don’t believe that entertainment bullshit. You plan to entertain, but the reality will slap your face hard. Just quit and avoid any information from gambling. No see, no listen, no talk. For rest of us don’t plan to quit, no matter for entertainment or income, gamble is gamble. No excuses. I don’t know any of your personal information for creating the personal circle. At the moment, my circle is pretty simple and easy. Stop-win for $30, stop-lose for $100, $0.5 base bet by using grinder betting strategy. For example, in the scamming originals, playing mines for 24% profit per round, 0.5 base bet for selecting 5 diamonds among 24 diamonds and 1 mine. Success will generate 12cents profit. If lose, try other scamming originals carefully and grind that 50 cents back slowly, and stay patient from begin to the end. It’s the most simple and easy circle for making profits in long term. Only one key factor to decide good or bad result is self-control. Btw, Eddie is a good lad. Congrats to him to have more mansions in future.- -Update 10 at 23 June 2023 > Talk too much about gambling in past one week. I would like to share one another real and funny story about Mount Everest which can make us think it deeper. The data was updated to the end of 2021. In human history, there are 6098 person climbed 10656 times to the top in total. This is super hard already but nothing interest me. My point is at only 216 person climbed to the top without oxygen equipment. It occupies 2% of all the successful climbers. Btw, death rate can explain more if you are interested on that. So, when an adult decides to do anything except illegal stuff, nobody can stop you even the Death. This gambling topic makes me feel more interesting now because the pyramid structure of human beings can never be changed even a little. 2% people maybe occupy 50% - 70% resources in some countries. So, if you know this forum, you are 20% of your group. Easy calculation. 100 person have read this post, I will be happy if there are 2 dudes will believe me. Funny shit.- - Update 11 at 24 June 2023 > Some dudes said gaining profit easily in one or two days but no way to win consistent. This comment can help to explain more clearly and deeper why I believe professionals can gamble for a living. Usually, win or lose is just depends on luck purely. Can’t deny this. In the mean time, can’t agree with neither. Gamblers can gain the profit through different ways. First, you need to analyze carefully the way you profit. In short, real skill, fake skill which is actually luck or just pure luck. For example, one of the important indexes is win chance. It can stand for your risk type in gambling. At the same time, adjusting the value of base bet is necessary and full of skills. Of course, to learn these two tools is not enough to be professionals. In my point, there are 5 necessary fields at least. You have to make sure the rate of ‘skill part’ as high as possible. No professionals rely on ‘luck’ to gamble for a living. After you finish this stage, practice the ‘self-control’ ability by any means. Exercise in gym, dining control…This is the basic preparation before you gain $30 daily from any casino. Before you fight for real profit or lose, mentality adjustment is necessary every time. Second, focus on all the truly details of gaining $30 profit. The next is to cut down all accidents including all unnecessary factors to help you achieve the target daily. If you cannot do the exactly same as your ‘profit example’ before, you need to readjust the everything. For example, pick up a phone call can make you lose immediately while your gambling fund undergoing up and down period. - - Update 12 at 26 June 2023 > New announcement on #258 of Page 13.- -Update 13 at 26 June 2023 > This topic is still on the front of first page. Really impressive and thank you all. For now, it's time to progress and make some benefits for the gamblers who are still interested. First, I need to narrow the scope of readers here. This is very important and necessary for letting you decide to spend your valuable time on this topic or not. Not suitable for readers as the following list: - Gambling for entertainment. (This is still the best decision for anyone anytime anywhere!) - Randomly bet gamblers.- Non gamblers.If you belong to one of them, the content from Page 14 is not suitable for you. I suggest you leave this topic or read from page 1 to page 13. Time is valuable.The welcoming list of readers and posters starting at Page 14 is:Incoming bankruptcy gamblers.Bankrupt gamblers.Homeless gamblers.Gamblers who have to gamble for a living.No matter what the reason is, no one can judge. Next, I will assume all my readers having empty pocket and want to make some dollars from any casino with 0 balance.Here is the plan. One, I build 10-15 testing groups which has 2-4 people each.Two, I supply the gambling account and deposit some dollars.Three, you do exactly what I am telling you.Four, each people play 20 mins then change.Five, one guy play, the others watch and remind any out of line behavior which is not following my rules.Six, people not following the rules will leave the game immediately and expelled from the team and name on the blacklist forever. Seven, this is not a job and never calculate hourly or daily income. It is a terrible trap for anyone to do that. When shit happens, we may have no income or lose the balance for the day.Eight, we only calculate how much we can get weekly or monthly.",

You only need to trade a few times a month to get profit which is your income.Investment will require a longer waiting time to harvest but if you can pick good assets, you will harvest good results.Gambling is very different than trading and investment. It's a most risky because it's game of probability and it is controlled by gambling sites, game providers. Gambling responsibly is hard to do and I don't believe many people can make gambling as a source of income.

One worries me: Professional Gambler? isn't that like being a Professional Singer? if you don't have a manager, sponsorship, different ways of income like channels in social media... I don't think many people is able to beat the system long term without such a help, so I would focus my efforts elsewhere if that's not your plan.In addition, it somehow seems incompatible with Opinion (Option?) Two: if there is no sure win methods (apart from what I said before), how could one make a living as a professional on his own?",

The fact that it is \"you\" who is gambling, pertaining to your 3rd opinion, makes it seem like you are trying to steer away from the truth and accepting that it could be attributed to other than yourself. What the heck is the connection of scammers here? Can you clarify that OP?",

Like those people who are paid to play gambling tournaments like poker? Or maybe what you mean about being a professional gambler is having the ability to generate profit daily and it's considered your primary source of income? Please correct me if I'm wrong, because if that's what you mean, I'm quite sure it's not gonna work. Being a professional gambler, means you're paid to gamble and you're not solely depending on the winning profit, win or lose you've got guaranteed income. Brother, I don’t want to convince you or sell my ideas to you. If you are the boss running a casino, you will know there is at least 2-3% people winning money from casino in long run by the means we don’t know. Does not matter you believe it or not, this is true fact in our world. The hired streamers equal scammer to me. They lie to poor gamblers everyday and supply them a fake hope. They are just pets of casinos. My interest is the method how the 2-3% people can do that in the long term. Not easy, but am trying to figure out. If you travel or read a lot, you will find out we live in a super diverse world. Some people tough and smart like god, some are just pigs, maybe pig are more clever than some of.",

Gambling is not a do-or-die thing, and as such, one should know the limit to which he or she will gamble. If you are gambling from your own pocket and earning, then you should not pay more attention to what people say in general; it's actually not their business; it's your life you are living to the fullest and not theirs.The best advice is the one an individual gives to itself. Even with the above-listed opinions, some people still have their own personal ways of doing things. Some odds, which most people sell online, most times already look too good to be true, but people still buy their games and stake them high; if they win, they will; if they lose, they lose. Most gamblers like higher-risk gambling because it's part of their fun type of taking risks, and if they win, they win big.",

      "body": "Quote from: hd49728 on June 17, 2023, 10:23:06 AMTrading and investment can be your major income but gambling is not, never.It's hard to beat the market with trading but if you are disciplined enough, experienced enough and only open your trading position when it is safe with less risk to get loss, big chance to get profit, you can make trading as your source of income. You only need to trade a few times a month to get profit which is your income.Investment will require a longer waiting time to harvest but if you can pick good assets, you will harvest good results.Gambling is very different than trading and investment. It's a most risky because it's game of probability and it is controlled by gambling sites, game providers. Gambling responsibly is hard to do and I don't believe many people can make gambling as a source of income. Such people succeed in gambling would be less than people succeed in trading or investment.Of course brother. Trading and investing are also gambling for financial conservatives. It’s all just games for people. You like high profit or becoming  millionaires over the night, that’s your choice. Or find a 50k 9-5 job. It’s still the choice for people. We pay what we believe. Simple question. To be honest, I hate scammers and will fuck them back when I have chance. But, if some adults give money to scammers, that’s their choice. We cannot judge. People make fault everyday, and it will last whole life.

After reading your so-called \"opinions,\" or should I say \"options\" (assuming that was your intention), it appears as though you're attempting to promote your very own grand gambling scheme. Is that correct?Brother, if this post can not make you happy, truly sorry for that. All my purpose is about self-control business including not to judge others randomly or be childish here and there especially not innocence in gambling. No one can win money in long run easily. If scammer hurt you bad, I will fuck them back with you if you ask. I hate scammers too. They scam me thousands of dollars for 100% profit win strategy, huge profit dice strategy something like that.Wow  I think that FatFork went too far with his deductions here  I will not be the one to cast the first stone, because I also tend to think beyond sometimes and imagine ulterior motives behind the words, but in this case I don't think there was sufficient reason to suspect.Or maybe you've already seen everything, and although it may not seem like it to the neophyte, this is the way to start said schemes?About the OP, Opinion (Option?) One worries me: Professional Gambler? isn't that like being a Professional Singer? if you don't have a manager, sponsorship, different ways of income like channels in social media... I don't think many people is able to beat the system long term without such a help, so I would focus my efforts elsewhere if that's not your plan.In addition, it somehow seems incompatible with Opinion (Option?) Two: if there is no sure win methods (apart from what I said before), how could one make a living as a professional on his own?Very glad to discuss gambling in this way. First of all, scheme is just an idea from my gambling experience these years. As an adult, I respect you choose any side of this. Right or wrong, trust or scam, black or red……you make your own choice at your risk just like gambling. All my major points  has been clarified in the content. Am just trying to supply my angle to gambling. This is fully personal advice sharing. You believe it, why not join me. Friends could help a lot sometimes. If you don’t, walk away since we are strangers anyway.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

If these opinions make you find the right direction, I will be super happy.And I assume also that for that long of been in gambling, you find yourselves as a loser. It means that it is hard to rely on ourselves into gambling and consider this as a source of income. If we are going to gamble, we are aware that this $1,000 in our pocket has no assurance to multiply but possibly it becomes $0. We better expect to lose rather than to win but of course, it is much better to think that we gamble because we want to, not because we chase to win big otherwise, we got only disappointed.",
