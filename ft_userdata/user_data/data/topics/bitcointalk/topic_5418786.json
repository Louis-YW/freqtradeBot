  "content": "image from Pete RizzoIn 2014 two students of MIT Dan Elitzer the founder of MIT bitcoin club and Jeremy Rubin a computer science student launched a project aimed at making bitcoin a case study by students and professors to birth an ecosystem for digital currency in MIT. To begin the project the founder of MIT bitcoin club coupled with Jeremy Rubin was curious to know how students will spend bitcoin if given the chance to hold bitcoin. So they raised more than 500k with the assistance of the bitcoin community and MIT alumni which was enough to distribute 100 dollar worth of bitcoin (0.290272 BTC) each to 4,528 enrolled in the institution. This free bitcoin distribution made MIT campus the first place in the world to have widespread access to bitcoin. On the 29th of October 2014, a survey that lasted for 5 days was hosted by the MIT Bitcoin club to enable students to claim their bitcoins. Students who received the free bitcoin had the option to spend it on books at the school library where bitcoin was accepted. And on Fireflies a program that enabled MIT students to crowdsource products and services for bitcoin. A link below shows how students spent their money and the few who held the free bitcoin. https://news.bitcoin.com/thousands-mit-students-free-bitcoin-2014-6-year-holders-13000-gains/Giving-away free bitcoin to thousands of people is the best vehicle to Mass adoption. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/29/mit-undergrads-can-now-claim-their-free-100-in-bitcoin/",

And its possible that those who held bought more bitcoin making it impossible to see an address with the exact balance.

But on the other article it was stated that some stores in the school stopped accepting bitcoin. However, as at 2014 bitcoin was getting more adoptions unlike the 2010 - 2011 era. I think for the school library to accept bitcoin then they'll be other means of spending bitcoin in the campus as bitcoin won't be a new term to them. Remember, MIT is a tech school and their students are IT geeks. They all spent their bitcoin, only few held even the fireflies programmer stated that he got his degree that's what matters when he was asked why he didn't hodl.",

In conclusion, the transaction does not occur on-chain because it is not intended for the technical development of bitcoin. cmiiw",

We can't say that any of those students are more or less smart because they spent Bitcoin or kept it, because as one of the students who is from the whole story says :QuoteA robotics engineer at Pendar Technologies, Selam Gano, said she sold her BTC for $300 worth of food when it increased 3x in value. “It was free money, I don’t have any regrets,” Gano said during her interview. “I got an MIT degree, which is the most important thing to me,” Gano added.The most important thing is that Bitcoin has helped some in their studies, and it has obviously interested some to be active in Bitcoin today.

Free distribution of BTC was great for the network many years ago, and still is, it helped more people to have and use BTC and is a contributing factor to the growth in BTC you see today. Here is one event of BTC being given out in the past, which was of great help to the network. People who give out BTC are not concerned about what will happen to centralized exchanges (which in itself wasn't originally part of the network), but for more people to get to use BTC and take the network closer to mass adoption.",

But it could be that people who gave out free BTC to a large number of people in this way were miners back in the days and they didn't have to raise the huge sum of money in fiat first, but had easily mined the BTC themselves a lot earlier and gave them out to people when the chance came to do so. It isn't even only about the current price, people now see BTC as having a lot of potential to rise to unthikable prices, so surely it is harder to give out free BTC today than before.",

From what I understood, according to the article, another experiment was conducted two years later in order to see how many students who took part in the bitcoin give away were still using bitcoin. Unfortunately, only 14% claimed to actively use Bitcoin. Isn't that a tiny percentage for students studying in such an advanced technological institute?You obviously didn't read all the posts (and there aren't many of them), so you would have seen that I mentioned exactly that part that talks about 14% active after 2 years. But what did you expect in the period 2014-2016 when Bitcoin was still quite uninteresting for the majority? Students do not necessarily have to be people who can be expected to have a high level of understanding of some new technologies such as Bitcoin...Corrected it, I suspect that my grammar corrector (Quillbot) opted it out in the process of simplifying the sentence without noticing. Apart from your reply, I didn't notice anyone else claiming it. Anyway, the truth is that you're right, 2014-2016 was a pretty uninteresting era for Bitcoin, and it's quite ironic because I signed up here in 2014, but I was nowhere to be seen in less than a year. Thus, it's hypocritical for me to call these students out, because I myself have lost interest in Bitcoin. I wasn't given a free airdrop, though, but chances are that I'd do the same.",
