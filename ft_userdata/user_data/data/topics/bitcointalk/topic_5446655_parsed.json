What do you believe?",

Right now technology is improving very fast, just like how you can create a long text by just tell the context or ask it on ChatGPT, do you think someone create a bunch of bots to make a long or one liner comment to support the women? bots have been existed before ChatGPT was discovered, you're also someone who get tricked by bots creating fake comments. Trust the women have a relation with God is really a big joke.",

Retail investors will always become victims. I guess if that woman was not even using their sense. What crypto project is? if she has not even told about the clue and she was a liar. Quote from: S3300 on March 28, 2023, 03:08:30 PMShiba inu was predicted to reach 50$ per token, this woman said God revealed this price to her, another channel which is also a lady claimed that God said Shiba inu will be the new wealth transfer for people in few years to this time.Did you think a meme token project will be worth more tha microsoft or even starlink? that women was actually losing her sense for sure. She shall take holidays to get back her sense. Quote from: S3300 on March 28, 2023, 03:08:30 PMI read some comments and I saw how many people belief in this prophecy, has anyone seen something like this before. What do you believe? I will never ever believe with youtubers. Almost all of youtubers related with crypto were shit. They were a bunch of liars. If you keep believe it and that's your choice but what you have explained above was actually non sense thing.",

I don't know why those people would do it since the subject they are shilling is a popular crypto, not specifically the one they made. Nevertheless, such similar scenarios are known way long ago, it is a scam or shill method. It is just the contents itself that are differ, but the main point are alike.",

Even if the dev burn 50% of shiba inu max supply the value can never reach 1$ talk less of 50$, this is the most hilarious thing I've read about today.",

It's worth noting that financial markets are unpredictable and subject to a wide range of factors, including economic, political, and technological developments, as well as market sentiment and speculation. It's always advisable to do thorough research and seek advice from reputable sources before making any investment decisions.",

Don't be easily carried away by sweet talk by promotions because sometimes they don't match the facts. it is only to attract novice investors",

If their entire point is to make shiba better, they are not helping it become better but more like causing it to be worse.If I see someone that says god told them it will go up, I would sell instead of buy more because I wouldn't want to be part of a community that has these type of crazy people. But on the other hand I am heavily invested into bitcoin and if she said bitcoin will be a million dollars, god told her, then I wouldn't sell my bitcoin, so I think it is understandable for people to keep holding it.",

When hyperinflation in crypto happens I think Shiba Inu will reach that valuation but all of that are just pure imagination or the worst was a prediction from a fool. Of course that's not true, don't believe what you see in the internet, everyone has their own opinion on something but that doesn't mean it's true. I believe that's a prophecy of an investor who buy at the top and want others to buy Shiba too and those who comment there was just purely bots.",

No matter what her beliefs are, I personally don't want to follow what that woman said.And what if one day there are people who claim they've spoken to God and Tuan says it's Doge who's going to go up to $50? Or other people say that God revealed the Shiba Inu will be destroyed? Then which one will we believe?Yes, of course, it's not one of them, in my opinion, we are realistic and logical about what we are going to invest.

But then, it's their belief and only they can verify if it actually happened or not.Always try to check both sides of telling the truth and if it's sort of a lie. Don't be too gullible with ways of advertising and shilling the projects and make sure that you're DYOR before following someone's opinion about the project that they're talking.

What do you believe? Yeah, sure, what else did God tell her? Anyone that makes investment based on those \"divine\" predictions (or falls for those scams) deserves to lose their money. Investment decisions should be based on research, analysis, and a good understanding of the market. Using on such \"prophecies\" for investment will only cause one to suffer. Haven't seen anything like this before in the crypto community, but there are lots of similar scams out there and the worst part is people still keeps on falling for those scams.",
