BTCHonestly speaking I did not know that there was a self-serve of Bitcoin and when I went to for search it, I wondered there is a separate satellite named Blockstream. There is a station for the satellite on the ground that supports it.  I did not know for what purpose it was made but up to some extent, I came to know that this satellite was made for connection issues.  Sometimes the connection is interrupted and the the satellite will provide the connection for the running of Blockchain.  I Did not know how it works because it was so complex there so am simply giving the link to that website where everything is there that you need and I hope it will help you a lot. website link",

If the forum as a community is set at a benchmark of asking questions and getting answers does not mean an individual should not make research. Some things can be studied/or learnt by self education but where one can't do some simple task makes it annoying to me. Anyways your correction has been counted. For Blockstream satellite even if it's not a native satellite but at least it was launched for the aid of Bitcoin network hence it answers OP's question that's the aim.",
