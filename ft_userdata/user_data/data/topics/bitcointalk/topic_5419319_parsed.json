      "body": "It's not a shocking news for me and i will be supporting CZ's decision to buy the bank and here's my main concernThe problem related to the bank has been exist since a long time ago when the bank was doing very strict control to the any bank accounts that connected with the crypto. In my opinion if CZ was putting this as his main concern why he wants to buy bank. CZ will try to create a friendly environtment for the crypto users where they can use it to connect with their crypto account without any worry for their accounts to be blocked by the bank. This is a really good idea since i have seen in so many cases the banks were putting restriction even blockchain any accounts that already proven connect with the cryptocurrency. This is a wise decision for CZ to be tried. This will also push domination of crypto.",

I have not heard about that news before and to be honest my first thought was that this is definitely false news but i just googled and i found multiple reports that are confirming this rumor. According to a article i found, CZ wants to buy banks with 1 Billion $ in order to gap the bridge between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrency. I am not really sure what i am supposed to think about that. I always thought that cryptocurrency was invented as a rival or a substitute for the traditional financial markets and not to be integrated with \"normal\" banks. In the end CZ does what makes him even richer and not what is the best for the space i guess.",

There is noting to fear as a crypto user about this news. We should be glad instead. This approach to take over banks will prove to be a very positive factor for crypto and also it's users. CZ will bring the freedom to use crypto in banks too. You can enjoy every facility provided by the bank and also use crypto as an asset to store your money in bank. Will it be like Binance exchange platform, that's need to be checked. anyways, Let's just see what CZ has stored for us in the future.",

It's not something to be shocked by. Buying a bank is not stopping him from being the CEO of Binance. He's expanding his crypto business to banksThis is Binance CEO's recent plans with Twitter.  QuoteTwitter could in future be more integrated into the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, billionaire Twitter investor Changpeng Zhao said on Wednesday.Zhao, who runs Binance, one of the world’s biggest crypto companies, had been keen to stress in earlier interviews that he was happy to let Tesla boss Elon Musk do what he wanted with the social media platform.But on Wednesday Zhao, who backed Musk to the tune of $500 million, told a news conference at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon that he may after all be keen to play a part in Twitter’s future.",

Not long ago Elon finally took over Twitter, what do you think CZ is planning to do here? Why would he go after banks? To have a physical crypto bank or something? The main advantage of this is that, since the bank will be run by a cryptocurrency expect like CZ, the adoption rate of crypto to bank will be high and the possibility of dopting blockchain technology in the banking system will become a paramount project.And also blockchain technology will help to solve some of the many problems faced by the bank, if CZ should go ahead with this move it will be a great advantage to crypto adoption but also the disadvantages is that, there will be more centralizationBut centralization is something we should be used to by now since even Binance is a centralized platform.",

Why would it be shocking in the first place?Yes, we know that CZ is pro-crypto, but business wise he will be expanding as well. I suspect that maybe he will want to established a crypto bank as well. Or something like allowing people to physically deposit some of their hardware wallet in a bank.Or maybe he is just trying to proved some point against these bankers?There are a lot of things that CZ can make and of course, make money as well, just scary though how powerful CZ has become in the last 5 years or so.",

So CZ is venturing into everything he can get his hands into, trying to monopolize the cryptocurrency market and now planning to invest in other sectors as well. Binance also invested $500 million in the Twitter purchase by Elon Musk. Having his cryptocurrency exchange and then having his own bank, it would be easier for anyone to make transactions from fiat to crypto and wise versa rather than looking for a third party if he is able to purchase one.",

How can we do that when we live in a world where the government controls everything? Don't think so simply because cryptocurrency is profitable and convenient for you means the government will want it too. To me, cryptocurrency is a vehicle that will be used alongside the banking system, it is not created against the government.CZ is a human being just like us and he is still under the control of the government, if he tries to create something against the government he will not get better in the end.",

If this is true, then it is not surprising that the rich always want to build their own empires. What CZ is doing is conceivable that he is trying to dominate the crypto market. I think he's trying to create the biggest ecosystem in the crypto world.or just put it simply, he has the means to diversify his investments. banking system is close to his agenda as maybe he can also direct some of the fiat financial services that will offer crypto services also if in case he will acquire a bank. it is not a surprise in my opinion as they have similar services being offered to the public. why not capture the fiat users as well as crypto users?",
