      "body": "Yesterday someone created a topic reporting he was scammed $450 in BTC by a newbie here in bitcointalk. And today, here comes another report being scammed $85 by another newbie again. Tagging these newbies will not stop them from scamming again because they can easily create another accounts. Do not trust anyone in the marketplace, mainly the newbies. If you explore the marketplace, there exist high-ranked profiles that are selling goods and supplied services for a length of time already. But typical trades here involve the use of escrow services.

      "body": "Can you please provide the whole conversation including the part after he offer the refund? He confirmed already that he received the money base on the screenshot and also the email address that he used on his sales thread match on the screenshot that you provided that means he is the person that you are dealing. He is  not honoring your transaction to him based on his last post which means you are already scammed.You should use escrow if you want to deal with newbie here especially purchasing digital items. 99.99% of the newbie seller without a legit vouch from trusted higher rank is scam. The only thing we can do for now is red tag the user and flag for a confirmed scam. Consider your money as loss already.Edit:I already create an active flag for this issue https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3061",

Finally, $ 30 more for taxes. I didn't want to pay that. No account. No refund. My money is gone, probably my mistake.@Mods, email traffic is available as evidence.You did not buy anything from me and i do not know youi have my vouches and feedbacks here also i provide proof before payment so dont lie sorry you have been scammed.  unfortunately you should never trust a newbie account for transactions where there is no history of transactions or he Is trusted here.another negative signal in this sales topic is given by all vouch left by newbies with very few messages on the forum. It Is a clear sign of a user trying to credit himself as legit…",

If you are not careful and don't try to read too much in the crypto market, you will fall into the trap of many scammers. This is common sense, you have sent funds to an unknown newbie member without any security and you may have realized how bad the results can be. Because they make many promises before taking the money but when they get the money their true colors can be seen.",

      "body": "I know hindsight is one thing (people can learn from events after they took place) but the last time I looked there were many newbies offering to sell various things. I have no doubt a large number of those threads were designed scam newbies and those members not familiar with escrows or those members new to trading.As horrible the experience has been for you, please do not let this instance detract you from posting in the forum. We have a wonderful ecosystem here, there are many different boards you can post in related to all sorts of things. I hope you put this incident down to lack of experience and you decide to stay around and become an active member in the community.Quote from: Cronn on December 01, 2022, 06:19:02 PMQuote from: ScamViruS on December 01, 2022, 05:53:00 PMI wonder why you don't want to use an escrow service before making any transactions.

There's something not adding up as I discovered that OP was registered in this forum in 2018 and has just 3 posts to their name. It's absurd. There must be something also fishing with OP. They aren't without experience. We can't say lack of experience caused an account as old as OP that, can we?",
