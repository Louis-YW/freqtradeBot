  "content": "Hello to everyone I‚Äôm in a likely situation so I wanted to ask some questions. First of all, I never opened another sportsbet account. I opened just one account on sportsbet and I don‚Äôt have any else. My nickname is ‚Äòdoktor17‚Äô.On 1st of January, I win a bet and won 6472 usdt totally. I tried to withdraw 6000 but couldn‚Äôt. There was a notification that tells me I must contact with safety team of SB by email. I tried to connect live and ask about the withdrawal problem that I had but there was no live support button. So I mailed to safety and assurance team and they wanted me to verificate identity. I did the verification successfully and told them. They mailed me that my verification is successfully completed, they‚Äôre making an investigation about multi accounting on me and they also said that if I have any other accounts, it would be nice to tell them. I told I never had any other then they sent me 3 account nicknames that I don‚Äôt know and never get in touch with. They also told me that I successfully got over second level investigation (I dont know what it is). That was the last mail I had. During this proccess, I tried to withdraw my money and get a notification that tells me ‚ÄòI cannot withdraw money in 48 hours since I deposited money for security reasons‚Äô but I had not deposited any money for security reasons. After all of these, I deposited some more USDT in my account because of that ‚Äòsecurity reasons‚Äô notification. It‚Äôs been 1 day after my deposit. I cannot get any answer from safety team, my budget is still same in SB. I cannot take bets on the site. I want to ask that how long does it take to investigate an account? My bets were clean, I‚Äôm just a person who likes betting and 6400 bucks is a big money for me.

      "body": "Hello,I am in more or less the same situation as the starter of this topic \"Doktore1907\" (who I don't know, by the way). Since 2 days I also have this message \"you cannot withdraw funds within 48 hours from depositing\" in my cashier. But my last deposit was already 4 days ago.I signed up on December 30th and placed 11 bets. I made 3 succesful deposits and 1 succesful withdrawal. And now when I want to to my 2nd withdrawal the system won't let me. Just like Doktore1907 for me also the livechat has vanished from the website so I sent a message via the contact form. But I have received zero answer in 48 hours.And when I try to place a bet the system says \"insufficient funds\" when I even have 288mbtc balance!Steve can you please help me with this? Because I have no other person to turn to anymore since livechat is not available and your support team does not answer.I have sent you a PM.",

      "body": "Okay, so it appears they are accusing me of this same thing too!!As I said, I cannot place a bet anymore and cannot withdraw. So I sent in my documents and submitted both steps of the verification process, which was completed succesfully.Then I received an email asking if I had more than one account, to which I said I absolutely do not.And then this email just arrived:QuoteHello AmanDemi,We have previously asked if you have any other accounts created with Sportsbet.io, to which you have replied that you do not. Coming from our second level investigation there were multiple accounts flagged that you are connected to.With that in mind, we would ask what is your connection to the following usernames: PupolZemlyane23, EasyGameUIdsf21, FenderoCali, GokkArtem, Uareright123.We hope for your honest response regarding this situation for us to proceed.Thank you once again for your time and understanding.Best Regards,Player Safety and Assurance TeamI have absolutely no idea what those accounts are and it feels very weird having to defend myself against something I have no clue about what it even is. So I answered this:QuoteHelloI absolutely do not know these account names. They all sound like they are from a totally different country than mine. I really just have only my own account. Never even have anybody log in to my account but myself.I am really surprised that I have to defend myself against something that I have no clue about.I understand you have to care about account security but this makes no sense at all.Please double check further in your systems and I am 100% sure you will find there is no connection between my account and those. I can even do video verification if it is really neccessary, or talk to you on skype/zoom.So I hope my account will be enabled soon again.Hoping to hear from you soon.So I will await their answer but what the heck??? How can I be connected with those accounts? Did those accounts place some of the same bets as me? I doubt it because I placed all kinds of different bets on different leagues.....Premier League, Serie A, Spanish Primera and then some NBA too. This HAS to be a coincidence.Steve, please investigate this with your team and you will see I have nothing in common with those accounts. And then I expect justice and my account to be opened really soon again. I joined Sportsbet at the end of December and I actually liked it a lot but these last couple days are really spoiling it for me now!Thanks, AmanDemi",

Unfortunately @Doktore1907 did not comeback to tell us how his case ended for reference but from the look of the positive feedback from the Sportsbet team I believe this case was closed and handled in his favor. Best bet here is comply with the teams needs it should be well, hope no VPN is connecting you to the said accounts...

And if you don't mind you are better off starting a new thread to get the right representatives look into your case as this one is a solved case, Goodluck.",

What I suggest is that you wait for a response from them after your last email. If they take too long, you can contact Steve through PM to look into it.All this if really your concern is genuine, we can never know since we are just ordinary users here.Good luck!",
