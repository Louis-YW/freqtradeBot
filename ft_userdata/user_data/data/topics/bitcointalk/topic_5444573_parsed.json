Your long-term investment should include money that you won't need in the near future. Have it in mind, Bitcoin doesn't always go down forever, it always passes the test of time. Instead of worrying about this issue, we should keep the bigger picture in mind. Bitcoin is here to stay because it serves as an alternative to current forms of payment and investment options. And most important thing is that it is far superior than previous forms because it is built on blockchain.Events like SVB have happened in the past also but it could not end bitcoin or crypto. Crypto is growing at a phenomenal rate which no other medium has demonstrated in past.",

But when Bitcoin managed to recover, even though it took a while, I think many became convinced that a bear market is just a temporary thing and Bitcoin doesn't die even if many altcoins do.All crypto investments are risky, but investing in Bitcoin is safer than investing into altcoins or projects that haven't even made it to major exchanges yet. That being said, people who invest these days shouldn't expect unrealistic profits, remembering how high Bitcoin went in the past in terms of percentage. Bitcoin has been slowing down for a while, so expectations should be adjusted accordingly.",

We must to be able to comprehend the market's fundamental principles and workings completely. Instead of missing out on market entry that would lead to profit ends, we should be motivated to invest only what we can afford to lose. Due to its high trading volume and ranking as the top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is extremely popular in the market. Its owners should be encouraged because they persevered to reach a stable point in the market.",

This is the main thing that Bitcoin's price reduction occurs but it does not persist longer and it never destroy as a whole but as crypto is volatile so ups and downs are normal part of it. If just rise happens then how users will put money so for users success these two situation plays important role.As previous year like 2020 was not a good year for holder and the price was not much higher as we hope but now its high and provide higher return so people did not get rid of it but instead of this they wait further for beneficial action in price. News can change its price and alteration can occur but we should always think about future that it will bring numerous benefit for us.",

I would say that looking at what is going on with the banking world right now and how the government is trying to save their ass again, I would say that it is actually pretty smart to invest into crypto right now, bitcoin is by far better than any fiat currency in the world and not investing into it is not just a choice, but also a very silly move.I am not saying put 100% into bitcoin but by looking at what is going on with silicon valley bank, second biggest bank in the nation, you could see that fiat is fragile and even though bitcoin does go down, it never crashes to zero and takes your money with it, at least you know that it will go down but then go up.",

Hurtful but nothing else I could did, and some important lessons taken.

We can see from the SS above that since the news came out On March 10, Silicon Valley Bank, one of the most prominent lenders in the start-up ecosystem, collapsed. the market hasn't really been affected that much as Bitcoin has quickly renounced back to $26k+ before dropping a bit.
