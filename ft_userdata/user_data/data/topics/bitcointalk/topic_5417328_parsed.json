  "content": "Hi everyone,I'm selling 3 mechanical keyboards, a Pine Phone, and a Kegol foot switch (keyboard accessory).I'm asking 0.00026132 BTC for each item.  I'm practically giving them away at that price.  I simply don't use them, need the extra space in my living area, and want to support the bitcoin economy.if you're interested, check out my Bitify account to see the listings.https://bitify.com/user/bonegulo/also let me know if you have any tips on how I can effectively sell these types of things,thank you fellow bitcoiners!!-Bonegulo",
