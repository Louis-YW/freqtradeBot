I had no idea what it was and didn’t bother to look it up; I completely ignored it.Here’s what the novel said: “I have six hundred Bitcoins, a house, no wife or kids, and if I run out of money for food, I can just sell some Bitcoins.”“Here’s a Bitcoin mining machine for you, equipped with the highest configuration graphics card array. Each one costs 1.2 million. If you’re willing to join, I’ll lend you six to use in the company’s server room. The company will cover the electricity costs, and you can keep whatever coins you mine.”I realized that when you have no understanding of something at all, even if someone tells you about it, you’ll still ignore it.",
