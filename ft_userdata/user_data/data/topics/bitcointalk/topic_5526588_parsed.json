  "content": "So after missing out a huge profit before, the government of Germany has plans to reinvest again,Germany to Reinvest in Bitcoin After $3.1 Billion Loss in Previous Sale.QuoteBerlin, Jan 5 (Reuters) – The German government announced on Friday its plans to reinvest in Bitcoin following a $3.1 billion loss from selling its holdings during a market downturn in late 2022. At the time, the government had liquidated its Bitcoin reserves, citing heightened market volatility and growing regulatory uncertainties. The sale occurred as Bitcoin’s value plunged to multi-year lows, a decision that now appears premature given the cryptocurrency’s subsequent rebound. Bitcoin prices more than doubled in 2024, fueled by increased institutional adoption and renewed investor confidence in decentralized finance. The German Finance Ministry described the decision to reinvest as a strategic recalibration aimed at capitalizing on the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in the global financial system.So obviously, they've missed out, but then again, it's not too late as every countries is talking about investing into Bitcoin and making it their national reserves. And with the incoming President of the US talking about it, definitely it has a ripple effects on most countries around the world.You can follow it here if they made the purchase or not: https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/germany",

Just like in the US, their holdings came from confiscations tied to illegal activities. Sure, we can call it their reserve, but technically, there was never a loss because they didn’t have any capital invested.My guess is they’re just trying to set the books straight. The accounting for those confiscations likely can’t be considered as cleanly acquired assets, so selling them was probably the right move. If they decide to invest now, it wouldn’t be called reinvestment since they never actually invested in the first place.",

Loss could be understood broadly. Missed opportunity could be considered as a loss. If the state liquidated its Bitcoin holdings and got $1 billion, but it could have sold it a few months later and would have raised $3 billion instead, there was indeed a loss.",

So selling seized bitcoin from criminal activities, at any price is not a loss for German government.Germany’s $1.7B Bitcoin loss: Selling BTC at $54K was a huge mistake.You can call it as a loss or not as a loss, but my opinion is it's not a loss. You can say it is a loss if you bought it with your money, and sold it at lost price.And if you sell your bitcoin with profit, for example bought it at $50,000 and sold it at $80,000, 1 year or several years later, Bitcoin will have its price at $500,000, your profit in 2025 is still profit, it is never a loss.",

If they wanted to report it accurately and avoid misleading readers, they could have simply framed it as a \"missed opportunity\" instead of implying a direct financial loss. I wonder if there will be a similar article if Bitcoin dumps, seems like it’s all about making headlines to pull readers in.",

It didn't invest, in the first place. This article just made it appear as if Germany committed a mistake, regretted about it, and is now trying to make up for it. That's oversimplification. That's not what happened. This article is a garbage. It appears written by a work-from-home poorly-paid content creator from a faraway country. There was indeed some resistance coming from the German parliament at that time. A member even wrote to the chancellor himself that the decision to sell those coins was \"not sensible\" and \"counterproductive\". They should have been kept.",

Obviously, there are more benefits to buying bitcoin now even if these benefits will be evident only in the long term but if they are expecting to see huge profits in the short term I must say that they are definitely doing this backwards. They should have trusted bitcoin back then and they could have massively reaped rewards now but what is done is done and at least they have realized what they have done and now are taking to at least remedy that mistake of not owning bitcoin.",

The order doesn’t have to be from the court because ideally it’s not right to keep the funds or property seized as reserve or anything. It’s just similar to impounded property which are later auctioned off. People actually relate this to the German government and many articles have actually debunked it a lot of time. As for maybe the Berlin state are FOMOing by buying at the current price because of the move I would say no, the reason is they have the capacity to actually hold it for long and also are buying in large quantity. FOMo is when actually do not have the capacity to hold for long and you’re having smaller funds too. Moreover bitcoin isn’t like other cryptocurrencies that loses value easily and buying at a price like it is now will not cause much of a problem because there is high possibility of it Moving up from here",

After reading the thread subject, I was wondering, when did Germany invest in Bitcoin? Indeed, no profit was lost. It's just that they could have made a higher profit but they had decided to sell off early. That's fine! Confiscated Bitcoins are not considered as an investment in any way. So whatever they have sold, it's pure profit for them - all 100%!But honestly, I really do not want to see another big economy investing in Bitcoin and take out a huge amount of it out of the circulation for an indefinite period. Bitcoin is people's currency. It will thrive if it remains so!",
