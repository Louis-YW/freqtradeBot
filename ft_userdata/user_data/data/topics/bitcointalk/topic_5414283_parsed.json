  "content": "Strange sequence of things that happened.Last week I looked into tickets for tennis games at the Laver Cup in London next weekend. Roger Federer is retiring from tennis there.I have a fake account on Facebook, so I can talk in all anonymity.I commented on a facebook article about Federer in London.Shortly after that I get a reply from an Indian username, with a link to purchase tickets for that event.I did NOT click on that link. I did not even reply.A few hours later, I got a phonecall from the UK. Which is not the country where i am residing.It was a registered phone number. I did not answer.An hour later I got a different phonecall from a different number. Also a different area, but still from England.I have never shared my phone nr with anyone.What could possibly have happened? I have not purchased any cryptos yet, but if people already have access to my phone nr (malware?) I don't feel safe.",

Is it possible that this action put you on a list that was sold to ticket sellers?",

Is it possible that this action put you on a list that was sold to ticket sellers?At first I looked for tickets online, but did not make a purchase.Shortly after that there was a facebook article saying that some tickets were resold for 25 000 euros and more.I commented on it and got a quick reply from an Indian guy. I never clicked on his link but I think this was some scammer who got to my personal details anyway.I entered my email address in a database (www.haveibeenpwned.com) and found out today that there were 10 breaches between 2016 and 2020. Probably email, address and phone nr.If I want to get serious about crypto, I'll have to protect myself better. I just don't know how to be 100% safe.One of the measures is that I will never, EVER, enter my seed phrase on my laptops keyboard.If an Indian scammer hits me with a key logger, I'm done. I'll only enter my seed phrase on the Ledger device itself.I've made a new email address for crypto stuff via protonmail. And I consider buying a separate phone for crypto dealings. But that comes at a price.",
