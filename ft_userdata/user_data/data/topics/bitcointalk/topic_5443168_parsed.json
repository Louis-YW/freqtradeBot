Advising people to go for high leverage is wrong because the liquidation risk is high. The last time I use 10x for bitcoin which I was even afraid of was when bitcoin decreased to $15500, when it increased to $16000 and seeing strong support at $15500, I opened 10x leverage at $16000. But right now when I do not know what would happen, going for 3x or less leverage is better. For scalpers and day trading, I will not also advice anyone to go more than 5x which is even too much for me, I always prefer 3x or less for bitcoin while 2x or no leverage for altcoins.",

This is why it's good to think beyond having a good strategy as a trader, the management and good plans are the main preserver of any trader's account. One should know the limit and strength of their trading system to be able to do this, and such would be used to plan the management to use.This should be done to the point that the success would be foolproof.",

There is a third option. The market will go in one direction, and a margin call will close your long position. Then the market will reverse and close your short position. You will end up with both at a loss, which is a very possible scenario with high leverage.2. If you open a long and short position, your net position is 0. That means it's like you did not open a position at all. So why pay fees for doing so? You can reduce costs by simply opening long where short would be closed and opening short where long would be closed, which is the classic buy when support or resistance breaks.",

Also the resistance and support levels are crucial to execute trades but the problem is some times we don't follow these steps because of our personal speculation and judgement of the market, we trade wrongly and also get punished for it",

Let’s say you have open long position then placing a short position will just close your long position or part of it whichever has the higher margin. I doubt that this double position is working like you are saying because Bitcoin has high price swing which means it can reach your upper and lower SL at the same time on both of your position on a volatile market. Opening a single position with stop loss is still the best rather than doing your method because it’s risky to get a double stop loss. When you hit stop loss then re-evaluate for the next position.",

Let’s say you have open long position then placing a short position will just close your long position or part of it whichever has the higher margin. I think one of the reasons that you could have two positions not running is the margin level remaining at the time the second order was triggered. You need to have an adequate liquidity for you to sustain simultaneous trades but if you have enough liquidity I think the trade will go on. The system however is programmed to take off a trade or close it automatically when the account has no corresponding liquidity for the additional trade.",

Managing risk, and several strategies must be implemented so that trading can be successful and make a profit.

It is basic science and must be learned, do not expect other people's strategies, some of them will only mislead.",

So in the end, I may lose money. It is better if we have risk management when we are trading some assets for us to not be in pain if our trade did not go as we planned.",

I am already doing DCA because that's what keeping my BEP to the lowest possible. Having the average below market price is best way to tackle any sort of inflation or bearish trend that hits the market over and over again. In fact I started my DCAing since more than year now and I am doing just well. Only sometimes I am selling my chunks for emergency cases but making sure that I again bring down the prices in my portfolio whenever I see an opportunity out in the bitcoin market.",

As a newbie, its better to do DCA as your temporary strategy while you are still learning, but let’s not discourage them from doing trade, because in time they have to experience it before they become a successful trader, losses are normal all they have to do is to do their own research and learn from every trade. Following others might be ideal for short term, though its not applicable to everyone. If you want to take trading seriously, then start doing this the proper way and learn every aspect and process of trading.",

Blindly following someone's trading predictions or relying solely on someone else's trading expertise is never a good idea. Even the most successful traders can be wrong at times, and it's important to have your own strategy, risk management plan, and decision-making process in place.Over-trading is also a common mistake that new traders make. It's essential to gather enough information and calculate the probabilities before making any trade. By doing so, you increase the chances of making profitable trades and avoid losing money.Using support, middle, and resistance levels as entry points in cryptocurrency trading is a sound strategy. Still, it's essential to do your own research, analyze market trends, and use technical analysis tools to make informed decisions.Finally, if you're a beginner, it's advisable to start with a small percentage of your total capital and gradually increase your investment as you gain more experience and knowledge. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is a great way to mitigate risks and invest steadily in the long term.Blindly following someone is not a good idea but following an expert is a better idea to do if you don't have any good experience but we must not rely on them forever. We must study on our own too because we never know what happens later on. What if those professional traders quit or their performance deteriorates overtime?It's always better to have something in back up so that we can still continue earning and we won't go back to zero, finding good traders again as that can be a hard task and will take us some time hunt them. In your last sentence, you mentioned DCA there but I think this was only applied in investing not trading.",
