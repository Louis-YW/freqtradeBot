  "content": "Something occurred to me about the Trust system, I had to search the forum for an answer but I didn't get something straightforward, that is the reason for this thread. If such a thread that explains my confusion exists, feel free to let me know and I'll gladly lock this.I already thought and believed that including your alt in your Trust list is a crime just as sending merits to your alt is. I was trying to search if anyone had been tagged before because of including their alt in the Trust list, but the result of my search from LoyceV Trust list Guide confused me the more.As against my thought, see what LoyceV said;QuoteDo's and Don'tsIt's okay to include your alt-account on your own Trust list. This means you trust the feedback you left from that account. Example:Quotehilariousandco Trusts these users' judgement:7. hilariousetc (Trust:  +3 / =1 / -0) (1725 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)Don't include your main account from your alt account(s). This could influence DT1-voting, and although that's not part of this guide, it's bad.My questions now are; If it is right for me to include my alt in my Trust list because I Trust the feedback my alt gives to other users, why is it not right for my alt to add me in his Trust list also because he trusts the feedback I leave in others profile?Who has ever been punished because they included their alts and vice versa in the Trust list",

It doesn't cost anything even if you are not logged in, to do it in a moment and so I did it the other day. I stumbled upon a case that I understood that required feedback when I was logged in only with my alt account but to leave feedback I logged in and did it with this account.",

The requirement for DT eligibilty by theymos is as follows:Quote from: theymos on January 09, 2019, 06:03:26 PM[...]#3I will periodically (maybe every month) be reconstructing the default trust list to include everyone who matches these criteria: - If rank was determined solely using earned merit, then you must be of at least Member rank. - You must have been online sometime within the last 3 days. - Your trust list must include at least 10 users, not including ~distrust entries. - You must not be banned or manually blacklisted from selection. - You must have posted sometime within the last 30 days. - You must have at least 10 people directly trusting you each with an earned merit of at least 10, not including merit you yourself sent. These \"votes\" are limited. - You must have at least 2 people directly trusting you with an earned merit of at least 250, not including merit you yourself sent. These \"votes\" are limited.[...]I marked the relevant point in blue.The first part of your first question, \"If it is right for me to include my alt in my Trust list because I Trust the feedback my alt gives to other users,\" it is ok because it simply serve the purpose of being your backup account, or in a layman's term, your cloud. For instance, LoyceV uses LoyceMobile as his back-up when he's on mobile device and away from PC.In reality LV does not put LM on his trust list, but for the sake of illustration, let's suppose he does, it'll serve a purpose --at least one of the purpose-- where he needed to leave a feedback on someone while he goes mobile, this feedback will reflect and shown on his main account, disregarding LM's DT rank, as LM is part of LV trust list. However, LM should never add LV on his trust list as it'll --assuming the alt has at least 10 earned merit-- instantly give 1 vote to LV's eligibility for DT and this is wrong.Note that prominent members mostly also put a feedback on their alt, stating that the said account is their alt. For LM, it read \"LoyceMobile is my alt, don't deal with it, I use it on untrusted devices/locations. To reach me, talk to LoyceV only.\" Aside from serving a purpose said above --informing the forum that it is his alt-- it also can be used to inform people who wanted to put LM on their trust list that it's an alt, so the trust should be directed to the main one instead.[If my statements and explanation contains some or any wrong info, anyone is free to correct it]Quote from: rby on June 10, 2023, 06:33:16 PMWho has ever been punished because they included their alts and vice versa in the Trust list Not sure about this one, but I don't think there's any DT1 who ever made a mistake by electing themselves through alt.",

If that is to acknowledge that its belongs to you because you do certain service and want people to trust your other account then its fine.But if you do that to take advantage like giving a feedback to make your other alt look reputable and you use it for trading something without acknowledging that it belongs to someone then this is been discourage. Because this could be use for scamming and other illegal activity.",

I don't know which which user did it, but I believe if someone do it, they will get punishment by distrusted by many DT members and neutral feedback at least.

So, there will not be a better punishment than the one they gave themselves.

If there is any reason one should leave a feedback to their alt, it should be to notify the public that they are also the one behind the other account such as the case of Loycemobile.",

(AFAIK I have three or four sets of alts (exposed by others I hasten to add) who DT distrust me - there could be more - one of the murky sides to alts roaming the forum).",
