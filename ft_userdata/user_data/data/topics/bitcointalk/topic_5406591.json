They call me a scammer and trying to present in front of everyone a scammer by throwing red and yellow flags at me after I created a topic in the exchange thread. Here is a link to this topic - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406561.0In this thread, I, like many other users, create topics, they want to exchange their long-delisted tokens for any of the convenient coins. In my topic, I offered to exchange my UST tokens for USDT or other coins, just like other users do in their topics. I wonder why exchanging an unknown BTCX token is not a scam? - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406374.0It token costs next to nothing, and my UST token is still traded on many exchanges. Information about the price of the UST token is available. And where is the scam?I ask everyone who is not indifferent to the situation to press the button \"Oppose\" -https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3009",

Please don't write here on this topic, if someday the exchange removes the withdrawal fee, I will inform you - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406561.0",
