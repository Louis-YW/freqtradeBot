In some places it was celebrated more, less in some other places and not celebrated at all in some places all because of the level of importance that they have place on the celebration. Different celebrations have different importance and the importance can be determined by the persons location. For example, a Christmas holiday will be celebrated more in a Christian country as Eid would in an Islamic country. Arrange these celebrations in order of how celebrated and recognised they are in your country.Christmas day, Father's Day, Mother's Day, Eid holidays, Valentine's Day, Halloween, children's day, Thanksgiving, Independence dayetc What I have listed cannot be all the celebrations, you can add a celebration that you know which is not part of what I have listed.",

This is the day that is used to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ,because assuming Jesus Christ didn't resurrect from the dead,there will be no Christmas celebration.The resurrection of Jesus brought and strengthen our faith in God and also brought the name Christian i.e Christ like. Down here in my country we also have festival days. Boxing day is also another day to celebrate, when gifts are put in boxes and given to people.",

Like in my country there is no thanksgiving day and Halloween. But I know when I was growing up we only knew celebrations like Christmas and Eid holidays and the were very popular. Children's day was for children and they go to the stadium to do match-pass with the governor of the state in attendance. Currently There have been so much emphasis in so many celebrations. Now birthdays seems to be a must. People now see birthdays as an important occasion that they even borrow money just to celebrate it. It is now compulsory for some people to celebrate birthdays every year. But I have observed of the recent increase of the popularity of Valentines day in my country. It has become so important that religious organization have to organize religious events to celebrate the lovely day. For me, I don't have much interest in celebration of events. Sometimes I forget my birthdays and it will be people that will remind me. If you don't wish some people happy birthday they will become angry and I am not comfortable with such behavior. As a Christian I don't believe that Jesus was born in 25th December, so I don't recognize Christmas. Everyday is Christmas for me so I behave like Christ everyday. Valentines day has no meaning to me because I show love everyday. The most enjoying part of these celebration is just the public holidays.  Quote from: Doan9269 on June 19, 2023, 04:25:36 PMThere are many forms and means through which you find the people in a celebration mode and most of these are base under the category of culture and traditions that guides the people and then the religious believes, here are the common ones i see being celebrated from my country with the few list in summary below.* Burial ceremoniesI see burial celebrations as waste of resources. In my culture even the poor will be forced to organize big burial celebration. Sometime it was poverty, and hunger that killed the dead, yet the bereaved will have to feed the community because of culture and tradition. Some people will have to sell properties, take loans and credits because they want to celebrate burials. But I think that the only thing you owe the dead is to dig the ground and put him inside, other expenses doesn't concern the dead. It is not wrong for the rich to organize burials the way they want as much as they can afford it. But don't force the poor to organize elaborate burials, allow them to bury the dead based on their own budget. If I become the governor of my state, I would ban any tradition that impose burial arrangement on families.",

Some people will have to sell properties, take loans and credits because they want to celebrate burials. Funerals are expensive to organise in some regions true. A friend was recently soliciting for contributions so his late father could be buried according to their culture. The quota he was given to contribute is the equivalent of $2000 which he does not have as he just finished contributing as well for the burial of his father-in-law. Such a big burden to carry for someone who has died. In some other cultures, after the burial, members of the community gather and contribute money, clothing materials or cows/goats to the family, so they can recover somethings from the many expenses, that is good too.Quote from: Zlantann on June 19, 2023, 06:28:57 PMIf I become the governor of my state, I would ban any tradition that impose burial arrangement on families.      Your office may not be strong enough to change age long cultures and traditions.",

The highest type of power now is political power and not cultural or social power. When the legislature makes a law for a state it becomes binding to everyone including the highest traditional rulers. Currently, political leaders have the power to dethrone traditional rulers. I read of a powerful traditional ruler in the ancient city of Kano Nigeria that was deposed and sent into exile by the state governor. Tradition was powerful before colonialism but it became powerless during and after the colonial era. When a law is enacted any culture or tradition that contradicts such law is null and void. I will propose a bill to abolish forced burial celebrations on the people due to traditional practices. The bill will give every citizen the right and freedom to bury the dead based on their budget. The community won't force people to adopt a particular burial style or budget because of customs and traditions. Any customs that bring suffering and pain to the people deserve to be amended or abolished.",

To say the concluding aspect on this, we cannot deny that Christmas celebration is widely celebrated everywhere regardless of the countries or people and it's the most recognized celebration everyone is likely to be involved because it's been marked towards the end of the year in December and followed by the new year celebration with just a week intervals, this Yuletide season is very common and many people get aware.",
