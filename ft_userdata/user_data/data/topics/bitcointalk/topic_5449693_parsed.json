I understand what any project can become \"scammer\" how GDax, FTX and many ICO some time ago but people can take your money during five months( FIVE month Carl ) and the quotes from that exchange continue to entice new, new people and nobody cares. I, as a developer, know that need to tighten up some specialists for some days and the problem will be resolved, but they don't do it. Why ? Indeed is crypto-community still so wild ?",

How I write higher - if would be a desire,  and so - take money for access they can but delete quotes they can't.1) I'm going to guess that most people using their API services are not using the exchanges themselves but rather just the data for display and other things.And2) it's still valid for a competing exchange. $30000 (1000 x $30) to get have 1000 compalints against a competitor to have them pulled / de-listed from CMC is not a lot of money.They just list data, and will rarely post a warning. Personally I would not even do the warning. There are enough resoouces out there to figure out if something is a scam or not. If you choose not to look that's not on the places like CMC / Gecko or discussion boards like here. It's your money, you do the research. That's the point of crypto, having your money and doing your thing with it. But, you at that point loose the 'safety net' of having your mom hold your hand as you do it. If you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.-Dave",

Removing the content will open the door to giving them the power to manipulate the market.By removing a currency or threatening to do so, they can manipulate the price or get a commission from the developers, so it is not the best solution.Personally, I can say the least they can do is: - Red warning mode. - Stop all links and make the platform work without links, while showing links to scam cases. - Place warnings in front of the price that it may not be accurate. - Putting a red list of those platforms while not appearing when searching or reducing the possibility of their appearance.In the end, competition and the use of alternatives will force them to improve the quality of the content they offer.",

Each user must make sure to search for more information. We also cannot 100% trust the crypto community out there especially if we know the people who join it. So if we are a beginner, we should be able to get information from many sources, compare everything, and see what happened to know more about the actual situation.",

They do the domain registration, but they do not deal with the content of that domain and what is behind it. They are not responsible for determining whether something is a scam or not.Globally, it means that a person from Indiafor example, can register a domain using the Godaddy service.If you have irrefutable evidence against them, then it is best to contact the competent authorities to deal with it. Only they can request Godaddy to cancel or seize that domain.btw. when we talk about hosting, bibox.com is behind Cloudflare.",
