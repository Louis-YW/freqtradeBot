The same rules and guarantees as in a regular marketplace, but only for those who value freedom. Cryptor.store - Pay with CryptoWHO WE ARE?Cryptor.store is a team of professionals with over 25 years of experience in e-commerce and crypto. We know exactly what a client needs from a marketplace that cares about its reputation. The quality of goods, short delivery methods, and clear rules encourage loyalty.‚úÖ The product is already ready, so we see no point in the roadmap. We will announce our intentions in stages, based on growth.‚úÖ Our concept is the union of e-commerce and blockchain. We are less dependent on the state of the crypto market. We don't work as a pyramid scheme. The larger our audience, the more real sales will be. And there will always be a market!‚úÖ If you notice, we are just starting to grow. And the first ones who were lucky enough to catch us are in the right place.‚úÖ Find information about our NFT Airdrops on social media:WHITEPAPER | WEBSITE | TELEGRAM | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM",
