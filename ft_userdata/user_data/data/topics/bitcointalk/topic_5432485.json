As for money the best plan is slow and boring, little by little improve your financial situation, that's how I have done it and I have done very well, plus without realizing it comes a time that your wealth begins to compose and grow more than you expected, but the good thing about following a slow plan is that you are prepared to handle it, not like lottery winners or NBA players, which in a high percentage end up in ruin in a few years.",

It was hard but I did progress in it up to some extent. There was time when I was down financially and literally asked for help to few of the giant lenders in the forum. Though nobody helped me since the amount was big and also it’s unsecured loan so they were right at their spot and I was right at mine. However, I learnt important lesson regarding finances. You are on your own, when time comes you have to create your own assets. I am happy that I did not get the loan, I stood for myself and im proud of it. Thanks for 2022 and I am wishing to perform even better in the year 2023.",

Despite not eating for 4 days, I still did not feel hungry and had to force myself to eat. In some strange way, the 4 day fast reset my eating cycles to be healthier. It may also have given me a good detox. Trends which continue into 2022. While issues like COVID are making the world a more difficult and challenging place, there might also be a positive upside to it. (I wonder if I'm the only fool whose health improved from having COVID?)2023 could be more challenging than 2022 was. I am hopeful all of us can find a positive upside to growing hardships, which might allow us to progress and evolve with the increasing difficulty. Evolution. Adaptation. Transformation. Growth. Those types of themes could be worth embracing under projected future conditions. I would be curious to hear how others expect events to unfold.",

If you already understand that you spend a lot of time on games, as I understand you to be a gambler, then you are already on the right track. Sometimes people do not think about the fact that they are wasting their lives senselessly. They use alcohol and drugs and do not pay attention to their health, thinking that life is long and that it is too early for them to become wise. But once they wake up and look in the mirror, they suddenly realize that they are well over 60, and it’s too late to start something new.There is nothing wrong if you are into games, but you should always put a \"stop\" to it.Now is a good time to start a new life, leave everything in 2022, start 2023, and get out of your comfort zone. Moreover, as I understand it, you have a good advantage in the form of your youth.Happy New Year!",
