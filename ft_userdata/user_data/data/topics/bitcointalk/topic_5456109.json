This is actually not bad because it’s just like a keno with only 10 possible answer. I don’t mind placing a bet here if you will use escrow to your bankroll that will guarantee that you will not run in case our bet win. I remember playing this kind of game on EOS dapps casino so I’m open on joining this for fun.",

I guess you should have gathered your own funds and risked it if you had a lot of people to participate. If there are fewer people participating, you count it as your own loss.I actually don't know the real objective of your game because you are old enough here in this forum to know that trust is needed for this kind of gambling to happen. Even though you have had less activity, I believe you have been watching around in the background.",
