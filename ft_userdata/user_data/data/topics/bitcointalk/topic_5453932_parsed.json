  "content": "Hi everyone,A friend of mine needed to send me 500 USD (that I had lended to her a few years ago). However she now only uses cryptocurrency and I absolutely know nothing about it. I downloaded Abra and created an account.She sent me 500 USDT but the amount doesn't want to show up in my wallet. I noticed afterwards the following message: \"Minimum deposit 1000 USDT. Please top up deposits below the minimum amount to credit your USDT wallet\" Also, I intended to transfer that money to my US bank account and when i click on Withdraw > Bank wire transfer it says $ 5000 minimumI am a bit lost. How can i see this amount show in my wallet, and how can i transfer it to my bank account? Would you have any advice?Or is that possible for me to send the 500 back to her (even if they don't show) so that we can cancel the whole thing and dont lose these 500?Thank you sooooo much if you can help me in a way or another!",

I noticed afterwards the following message: \"Minimum deposit 1000 USDT. Please top up deposits below the minimum amount to credit your USDT wallet\" ...I don't know how Abra works but I find it strange what you say, as the limits are usually much lower. I have searched and I see this:Does Abra have a minimum transaction amount? QuoteDeposits: ACH: You can only deposit the equivalent of $5.00 USD or above via US or PH bank. You can deposit less than $5.00 USD via cryptocurrency. Wire: You can only deposit the equivalent of $5.00 USD or above via our wire program.Crypto: Some cryptocurrency deposits will require a minimum in order for those funds to reflect in your wallet, On another page I see that they also talk about limits as an example lower than $1K:QuoteMinimum Amount Issues:     For any ERC-20 deposits below the minimum amount, users will need to top up their deposits to the minimum amount before we credit the wallet. For example, if the minimum deposit amount for ETH is 0.1 ETH and a deposit of 0.085 ETH is made,So that would be $165 at current prices.Also:QuoteFor example, if the minimum deposit amount for BTC is 0.005 BTC and a deposit of 0.002 BTC is madeThat would be $120 at current prices.I'm not saying it's not as you say, the low limit of $1K for USD but you better double check it.In any case, if it is confirmed that it is as you say it is, it seems to me a shitty platform with those limits and you would have no other choice but to deposit another $500 in USDT, but I don't know if it would be of much use if you want to make a bank transfer. Maybe the solution in that case would be to transfer the total $1K to another site where you can convert to local currency and they have a lower limit for bank transfer that allows you to execute the operation.",

Sounds like a classic scam. Do not send any money to that address. Very suspicious that they want you to use this very specific wallet/service and add to the fact that you need to top up a very large amount just to withdraw is a very obvious way to try scam you out of your money. Also, why would she only use crypto? Is this something normal people do unless they have a very good reasons? If she had the money why wouldn't she just send you it the normal way most people do? Paypal, cashapp, bank transfer etc? Tell them to cash out their crypto and send them it to you in your preferred way. Jumping through hoops that require you to deposit more money just to get your money out should immediately set off alarm bells.",

      "body": "I was able to solve half of my problem today with Abra's customer service. For whoever finds this conversation later because they have the same issue here is the answer:According to the customer service support: USDT deposits require a minimum of 1000 USDT. A deposit of 1000 USDT or higher will reflect in the wallet but anything less will remain on the blockchain and will not reflect in the wallet until the minimum of 1000 USDT is reached.She also specified that the minimum for any supported crypto can change at any time. I guess I was unlucky this time with a minimum of 1000.She, though, was kind enough to offer to attempt a manual recovery of my amount of less than 1000, which I accepted, and the amount is now showing in my wallet! I am now working on the 2nd part of my problem: withdraw it to my bank account with no minimum amount. I think I can do it with an ACH transfer (not requiring a minimum amount), but this option is not showing in my app yet (only the wire transfer - involving a minimum of 5000 USDT - is offered) I believe this is because they require a verification by Prime Trust first. I contacted the customer service again so I can go through that verification process. Hopefully that is the solution.",

I'm really not sure why he would sign up here asking for advice then when everyone tells him it's almost certainly a scam he just goes ahead and does it anyway.
