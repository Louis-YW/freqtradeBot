It showed these coins have a higher value outside of our little community which gives me pleasure and hope for the future of our fun little hobby.",

If not, would love to hear how getting your item(s) listed with them worked for you.I sold a lot in the last auction. I think there has been some mixed feelings over the Stack's auctions here in the forum. On one hand I think everyone wants a general amount of growth in sales to the larger public. On the other hand, there seems to be some sentiment that the sales on Stack's are often ridiculous prices by rich dudes buying anything without intelligence of the market. Maybe the latter observation is incorrect on my part, but I think I recall a member or two saying they would never do something like sell out by selling on Stacks. I'll share a couple of comments on this latter point. I don't think this is actually true. If you put item into Stack's I think you should be hoping to come out with a conservative amount of what you would expect to get on the forum. Stack's is probably just a decent place to move valuables versus a windfall. I do think the initial introduction of new coins gets ridiculous attention and there is an obvious over paying for them. A Satori selling for $2000 is an example, but, the prices level out quickly in subsequent auctions as people get more exposure. In the last Stacks auction Satoris sold close to the amount that you might expect here on the forum in the last auction. My personal experience was doing a little better than breaking even with cons I sold. I bought a lot when BTC was much higher and I wanted to pair down a good portion of my collection and I also want public auction to sell these successfully to push the exposure. The process working with Stack's is pretty easy and they handle getting anything graded with PCGS. The hammer price is what the owner receives and the buyer pays all the fees to Stack's above the hammer price. James at Stacks is great and getting pretty knowledgeable. My advice right now is that loaded stuff will sell well. Stack's is probably the best way to sell high funded items right now. You give a loaded Cas to them and they handle all the tricky conveyance of delivering the item and these are selling at prices we all would accept. This beats flying somewhere and meeting a guy in police office, etc. Be careful with buyer funded or redeemed. I don't think the public has the insight yet of the scarcity value on items that are unfunded.Another note. If you want some cool coins, I would encourage people to watch the later rounds of the auction. They pack all the redeemed and unfunded and lesser loaded stuff at the end and they fly through the coins. There are some good deals. Buying is easy.",

I don't see it as a sin to sell collectibles outside the forum. Personally I avoid ebay like the plague and only do p2p or forum sales so far, but it's a free market and everone can do with their coins how they see fit. Always happy to see collectibles appreciated by a wider audience - doesn't matter if it's some spoiled rich-kids that buy randomly from a Stack's an Bowers auction or an old goldbug at a local coin store. Just my 2 sats.Ofc most interesting would be to see how these coins perform in the long run on stack's bowers and not only as \"novelties\".",
