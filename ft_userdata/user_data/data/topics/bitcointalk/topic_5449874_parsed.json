  "content": "In our modern day society, especially in relationships now, we see a lot of partners complaining about dissatisfaction from their partners due to them not meeting up to some expectations and the like.  I was reading an article on relationships and this question suddenly popped in my head. Now, it's not news that some peeps jump into relationships because of the benefits attached and not necessarily for love, although along the line, that could come in.  Now back to my question. Can good sex or the steady inflow of cash replace the role of love? I'd appreciate candid responses and views on this matter because it's quite funny how some mix these two for love.",
