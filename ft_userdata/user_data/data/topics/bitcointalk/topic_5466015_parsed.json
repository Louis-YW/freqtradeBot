  "content": "Explore the plenty options on the forum but be careful adjusting default settings that you do not understand especially as a newbie. I tampered with some setting on my account some time ago, my screen orientation started looking weird and different from the normal. The normal forum orientation is from Top first page (for the OP) and bottom (to see the latest post) for topics that have just one page, and from Top first page (for the OP), forward (or next page), and then bottom of the last page (to see the latest post).My orientation changed to Top first page (for the latest post) and bottom (to see the OP) for topics with one page, and to Top first page (for the latest post)  and forward (next page), and then bottom of the last page (to see the OP). I just could not get comfortable with it, and I have been looking for a way to get it back to looking normal. I would have asked for help, but I wanted to see if I can figure it out by myself, and YES! I FIGURED IT OUT! I know it is not such a big deal for some people, but because I knew how difficult and how long it took me to figure it out, I do not want some other newbies and people who do not know that they are not supposed to mess with some default settings on their account to be in the shoes I was, I just wanted to give an example by sharing my story, my problem, and how I fixed it. Someone will learn from it for sure. To solve this problem QuoteMy orientation changed to Top page (for the latest post) and bottom (to see the OP) for topics with one page, and to Top first page (for the latest post) and forward (next page), and then bottom of the last page (to see the OP). I went back to the \"look and layout preferences\" and unchecked the \"Show most recent posts at the top\" option and confirmed it by clicking \"change profile\".Very simple right? but that took me time to figure out and may take some newbies time to figure out too, just like other settings if they tamper with the default settings on their account.As a newbie, if you mess with the default settings and it makes your forum experience uncomfortable, you may be discouraged from coming back to the forum when you log out, and that will cost you the knowledge you are supposed to get from this forum.",

I tampered with some setting on my account some time ago, my screen orientation started looking weird and different from the normal. There's nothing bad in trying to explore the forum to know how the functions works on some particular commands but I will always say this that whenever you enter or press something, try to know how you enter into it so that you could also know the exit route out of it, when we press something and a specific function gets activated, we should be quite aware of what we press that led to the result of what we are seing, this will help us in getting out of it, but when we don't know how we gets into something, leaving it becomes inevitable for us.",

All those places you entered to temper with the default settings, I don’t think I have gone there before since I joined the forum. I only go to places where I need to change something that is required of me at that time. Making changes to the forum default settings can be very difficult to adapt to easily since you’re already used to the default settings. Although, if a newbie have made the changes in their early days in the forum, they might get use to it and the default settings won’t be suitable for them to use again. I just believe how the forum setting is designed should be suitable for everyone to use, it is easy to navigate and has a friendly interface.",

That's great but don't you think it's better for them (everyone of us, actually) to know where things are, than not know at all? I'm one of those who like to tweak things around to find out where they're so I don't get lost around them during an emergency. However, to do that successfully I first of all take note of where they're before tampering with them. Sometimes, I take pictures of them before venturing in. It helps that way in case I get confused way in.
