If you have any kind of online skills like graphics design, Article writing skill, Genuine translation work, moderator experience then I think you can get it easily just by posting your portfolio in Service section. If you have no skill then I will advise to go for Bounty section where you will promote new projects through social platform and you will be rewarded altcoins but problem in bounties is that many projects are not paying now a days. You should also be active here and try to rankup your account by posting quality post and something which is best for this forum. Then you can join signature and your wish will be fulfilled. Nothing is impossible but you have to work and your hardwork will be produce fruits for you",

THANKS FROM THE HEART TO EVERYONE WHO HAVE RESPONDED TO ME PREVIOUSLYIf your goal is to earn $2 per day then this forum will not help you. If you work on bounty campaign from this forum it will not guarantee you payment And there's no guarantee when you'll get paid for it. On the other hand, if you want to do a signature campaign, you will need a Full Member + Rank account. So you are not applicable for anything with your intention.  But if you want to earn $2 per day then you have to do trading which is not possible without investment. Again investing here and risky. trading will not give you profit guarantee too. so I am not able to suggest you anything",

A few dollars lower than our minimum salary, but the price of a dozen of eggs in your country - or I should say in your place is around 8-9$ you said. 4x higher than our price of a dozen eggs here.I mean you worked as a doctor you said. Why you didn't pursue your profession as a doctor? TBH, I'm a bit curious. I don't want to generalize all, but what I know is that, doctors always had a high salary. Anyway, are you an expert doctor? You have 2 choices. Continue your profession, and work in an hospital, or be an online doctor. You have license right? Use your profession to earn money, and don't expect too much on faucets. Find a way to use it. Maximize your time, and don't use it on faucets. I just hope that you will not do what most of the newbies are doing here - joining bounty campaigns. :X",

I once joined several freelancer sites but am now retired because I am busy working offline.Some people actually earn below that amount and they are surviving. It just depends on where you are living and the cost of things there. If you convert that $12 to some local currency, you'll discover that it's a reasonable amount to some extent. Talking about this signature campaigns is the reason why some people engage in account trading and it's not guaranteed. The number of users who wants to enroll in campaign is higher than the campaign available, it's a message that the signature campaign is not a reliable means. I will advice OP to get something doing offline or to enroll himself in any skill acquisition center in order to support himself financially. Earning money online is not as easy as some people think it is honestly. You need to have skills such as writing, editing, designing and good in content creation. If you have any of these skills then you can start from somewhere. And please be careful so you won't fall victim of scammers who might pretend to help you with legit online business that pays. I can see that the OP is desperate looking for means.",

THANKS FROM THE HEART TO EVERYONE WHO HAVE RESPONDED TO ME PREVIOUSLYFor sure this 2$ on the faucet is not true at all, even back when I was just starting on cryptocurrency i wasn't really able to accumulate that much, probably I earned around 30-50$ my whole life claiming faucet on freebitcoin website which is really popular as a faucet back in the day when the faucet was kinda thing, probably faucets grinders could earn more but today it wasn't possible to earn even lower than 1$ in faucet especially if it's going to be daily.I mean there was no other way the safest thing you could do was find a job since it would just require your skills if you only earning 12$ then you're gonna need to find another side hustle so that your gonna have other sources of income, some members are already recommended signature campaign here in the forum which I think is really a good side hustle especially if you are already established here in the forum, but your gonna need to rank up first and need quiet a few merits in order to even join one.One thing that you can do, is if you have skills or products you could also post here in the forum, you could offer your skills in exchange for Bitcoin as well as offer your products or something like that.",

THANKS FROM THE HEART TO EVERYONE WHO HAVE RESPONDED TO ME PREVIOUSLYWhen I saw your monthly salary scale, the first thing I did was to search for \"Cuba minimum wage\" and I was surprised there is no minimum wage for Cuba. The salary scale is base on what the employers deliberate and agreed on upon. Isn't that abuse of labour union or you guys don't have any union or organization that represents labour in your country? This is sad, like $12 is too small.You should listen to some advice that were share above, you can earn and make a living through them but you must be ready and don't over depends on them because anything can happen at anytime.",

If he wants to save, he needs income first.And the advice about trading is not any better: trading is straight gambling, and I don't think that he is in a position where gambling is a good idea (again, that's only an option when you have income and some spare money).CryptoDeivid, it is true that signature campaigns can give you as much as much as 12 dollars a day, bit it will take you several months or a few years to get there. You can try and join different altcoin campaigns in the meantime: expect zero payment in many cases, but I think that a few ones that pay will make worth the effort, especially when just a few bucks are so valuable in your situation.Y, por último, te informo que tenemos una sección local en español]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=27.0]sección local en español en este foro, donde te animo a participar: serás bien recibido, aprenderás algo y probablemente te ayudemos entre todos a subir de rango poco a poco. ¡Ánimo!",
