If you make money from the bullrun, you can invest in land or real estate in general. Buying like a plot of land at some locations is not that costly. But if you are going into something like this, make sure you have all the legal documents. If you can not do it yourself, get your lawyer to help you in the right way.If you invested in altcoins, it is advisable to convert the altcoins if you have made money very well from them. For bitcoin, you may not decided to convert all. Altcoins are very volatile and their fall can be very painful as they can make your money become worthless.",
