  "content": "I haven't used a bitcoin core wallet for a long time and whenever I have used it, have used it for some testing, and checking purposes only. I have a little free time and now I wanted to set up a bitcoin core wallet as a node on my old laptop. I have some other purposes in my mind; to test some options. Nevertheless, I was looking for an address and found out that it generates native segwit by default while I have the option to generate NON-native segwit addresses. When I tried that, I found it generates addresses starting with 3 but not the legacy addresses starting with 1. I tried to figure it out but had no luck, sadly.How can I generate that Legacy address? Does it sound way much noob? I should have used to use Bitcoin Core.",

You can now generate legacy addresses.I'm not sure I understand why you want to use them though, you should be able to use P2SH addresses (starting with 3) everywhere.",

Nevertheless, I guess there's nothing wrong to know how I can get Legacy addresses on Bitcoin Core as I couldn't figure it out myself. That's the purpose; nothing else, mate. I was wondering why the hell Legacy wasn't there. Hence I'm here with this noob question.Appreciate your help.",
