There is a catch everywhere. Even Bitcoin mining is not free. Someone must pay hard cash to purchase your thing in order for it to gain value.",

If you want free crypto coins, I advise you to work in bounties campaigns for one of the trusted managers in the forum, but you must have social media accounts that contain many real followers, and the work may continue for weeks. There are also freelancing sites for microservices that pay you in crypto by doing simple tasks that do not take much time, and within a week you can get between 5-10 dollars, You can do your research. And good luck",

There are still airdrops existing but worthy airdrops today do have requirements to do in order to be eligible to them. The easier you get is the worthless it could be. Don't expect that you will get rich in those free crypto. It would be better to offer your skills and try to work so that you can buy crypto and earn crypto from there. Chasing free money is a waste of time, You will end up losing your valuable time in exchange of some pennies.",

If you really want to know if it is possible then try going to freebitco.in to earn free crypto and withdraw the Crypto once you reach the minimum withdrawal amount. Anyway, that's just an example where you can get free crypto and there are others as well like airdrops which is trending before and many more. Most of it is that you have to work for it and that's why finding a free crypto is not what you should do as some people make a platform that says free crypto and get scammed in the end.",

You can't expect a free thing to be of great value, if it were you, would you be willing to give someone a large amount of money without thinking? I bet even you wouldn't want to do that. So stop thinking that the crypto market is a place to give free or make money very easily, there is no such thing as a free lunch. It's the same in life outside, if you want to earn money, you have to work, no one gives money without asking and in the internet world too, to make money, you need to work hard.",

It is better not to continue what you are planning now because you are just wasting your time, instead, look and find a way how to work with crypto and earn it. However, you can still earn but not decent if you are willing to exchange your time for a small amount of BTC that you will get. I rather work as a freelancer than do that, there are too many how to work and earn crypto via your skills and knowledge.",

With some luck you can earn 5$ daily or so, but that is working all day long in determined tasks like downloading games from Offer-Toro in offer-walls and completing the required goals. The best site where you can do this is through Cointiply, as far as I know.Besides that you will find the bounty campaigns, but in my opinion they are even worse, because you don't know how much you are being paid for completing tasks, since they pay you in unknown tokens that sometimes don't even have a price or an exchange where you can sell them.",
