That are 100% free for the customers that want to participate.I think something like this that they bet on three Football games. And its who gonna win, how the result will end, and when the first and last score will be.And the winner get's like 0.001. No ulterior motives or anything like that, no need to sign up at anything or post anything! Just something fun to get people come closer each other!Maybe it's totally illegal and can be read somewhere, but this forum is like IKEA. Impossible to find anything!¬† So maybe some kind soul could inform me fast how it works. I would really appreciate it.Thanks-BabyBandit-",

You can check different giveaway/competition thread available on the Game and Round board to get an idea. I believe prediction format is what suitable to use for your giveaway since you want to incorporate it on a football game.Sportsbet giveaways is the leading casino that use this kind of giveaway format. You can copy their format and modify it base on your preference. Just put a disclaimer for the source of original format if you don‚Äôt want to modify any of it. You can use this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466451.0 as reference. Looking forward to join your giveaway!",

I guess that what you really mean is that you won't be offering anything specially valuable to be considered \"reliable and trustworthy\", but in case you are considering not giving a little prize in sats to the winner, take into account that you won't be able to post your Lottery in the mentioned subsection of the forum.",

But still sign up???At the same time he found out the othe guy was a scammer... ¬†  - I can't find the topic of when he getting accused of being a multi-alt of another scammer, but for your pro's you can find it under \"Reputation\"Your nothing then a BIG BIG liar and scammer without an real income.

If you're trying to say that he has multiple accounts and he has been meriting himself from his other accounts then that's against the merit system and if you have proof then you should create a thread against in him in proper board. And, if we come back to the topic then yes it's possible to launch a lottery on this forum in games and rounds board. I think everyone would love to participate in such lottery thread and the lucky one will get the money. I recommend you to have 3 winners¬† as first, second, and third because that way more people get rewarded for testing their luck on your thread.",

I have noticed that OP is trying to run a lottery program which isn't wrong by any means and if someone merits him with their own consent then that's a deserving merit not anything else. The users who can't earn merits themselves often come up with thoughts similar to the ones of the MadHatters and in that sense I agree with OP and appreciate the good thinking of OP for offering that lottery program to the members of the forum. Let's see when the OP is going to post his lottery thread so that the members can take part and earn the reward.",

I firmly believe that these activities are not only legal within our Bitcoin ecosystem but also align perfectly with our principles of decentralization and self-sufficiency.Here's a brief overview of how it would work: Participants can purchase raffle tickets using Bitcoin, with no involvement of the traditional fiat system. For instance, there might be 50 tickets available at 10,000 sats each. Once all tickets are sold, I will select a winning ticket using a Bitcoin block number.This approach allows us to keep everything within the Bitcoin ecosystem, supporting our community's horizontal growth rather than relying on the traditional capitalist model. I have successfully organized similar lotteries in the past without any legal issues, and I believe this initiative can further strengthen our sense of community and mutual support.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5462232.0",
