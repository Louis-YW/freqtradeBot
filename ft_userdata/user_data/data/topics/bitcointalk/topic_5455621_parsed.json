Sorry, I don't see any of those rules, I'm afraid it violates the rulesAs far as I know, a newbie can comment and create topics, but there are some boards that they are restricted from and should not start topics in unless they are very knowledgeable. If you are a newbie and in a hurry to start a topic and it doesn't make sense, apart from being criticized, you might end up being ignored by host of members here. So if you don't have something to say as a newbie something reasonable you can stick to reading learning and making simple comments until you are strong enough to create a topic of your own.",

I'll try to read the thread of your recommendedYou are a new member, registered your account today and I see that as of the time of writing this comment, you have written 12 posts, including the creation of two new topics in two different boards. I think this is enough to answer your questions about the limits of what you can post per day (except for the limitation of the time between two posts, which was set to avoid spam from new accounts and will end once you rank-up to next Junior member after reaching 30 activities). All the topics suggested to you are good, and I advise you to take a long look at them all, since you are active as a blogger, as you indicated in one of your posts. The most important advice I can give you is to stay away from spreading spam by committing to publishing useful ideas and not being off topic.",

In this way you will feel more at home in this forum so that you are motivated to increase your account ranking. Since so many newbies don't last long in this forum I mean there is no motivation to grow to increase the account. I hope you are not like that. Cheers bro",

Remember this, if you're going to make new threads you have to make sure that there's no thread yet that's made or if there's ever made about certain topic that you're about to do then it should be old enough. Why I am saying this? Because there have been newbies that have been making new useless threads even if they're probably aware of those threads that they make. And that's leading to many of them into being banned and you don't want that to happen to you.So how to figure out if there's a thread that's make for the topic you're about to make or to ask, use the search box at the top right and use keywords for that topic you wanna make.",
