After all, this is part of the crypto space, there are supporters and opponents, and everyone is free and responsible in all their actions when participating in the market.",

But do you think exchange partnership is superior to individual partnership in crypto? In terms of marketing exchange will provide higher liquidity that individuals investors, this is because on the exchange , the coin will be exposed to a more high volume market and multiple cryptocurrency users getting access to them unlike the individual investors who have zero worries we, or have idea of what become the future The one's questions.",

When you see, the token is already skyrocketing and then it might be too late to join, just like the risks you take by entering in a late ponzi scheme.If it was easy to predict such events everyone would have invested in PEPE coin before the pump started.Quote from: Wenbing on June 03, 2023, 10:34:05 PMWell said. But do you think exchange partnership is superior to individual partnership in crypto? Individual partnership is always more rewarding if we are talking about the whales who puts large sums of money on such tokens to create the perfect climate which will lure naive investors to put their money on it as well. Once the whales see enough profit can be made, they cashout their part and dump the token to the bottom.",

Most of what you say is easy to see in all memecoins, looking at how they work, I think that fast transmission is one of the means by which they become popular. Even before negative or positive information, it has been and is spread to more people, creating a mentality of doubt and curiosity, when prices are continuously pumped, those who are being sucked by pitted bran profits will easily be trapped. Anyway, it is not overstated that the form of ponzi in this market is memecoin, they are meaningless but can generate profits and losses in the so-called investment process of many people.",

If it's a notable influencer like Elon Musk, it'll moon.Therefore in researching the next memecoin project to degen in, these factors should be your priority.What other factors do you think influence memecoin projects? To be fair, you actually don't. A lot of the boomed meme coins were artificially inflated, possibly together with some whales or a group taking action and trying to sway the market. At least, initially anyway. The wave that followed was simply because of people's FOMO and by then, the group that started it would basically profit no matter what. A community doesn't necessarily have one of those people, who bootstart the process. Having a big community (not too big) can help though in someone trying to identify if they should do something like that again or not. Though without any future telling abilities, if you were to decide to invest in a meme coin, look at it's popularity, simple as that. The amount of articles, clicks attention, and whatnot. A meme coin booming would naturally make the news across all platforms since, well, it's a memecoin. That boomed.",

I think the best one is the team is affiliated to a known marketing or influential. Pepe has got some OGs or CT that are known to space of degen and this move is quite better compared to other factors. We all know meme doesnt have to be has a utility or what since its meme coin and the only thing makes it move are the hype and trend and thats circulate to people knew how to market projects.",

Forget about it, meme coins for the most part are all the same, how are you supposed to tell them apart when there is no significant difference among them with the exception of their names?At least with other coins you can take a look at their fundamentals to try to foresee if they will make it far or not, but this is not possible with meme coins as they have no use case, so hype is the only thing that matters, and by the time you can see a coin is being hyped, a great deal of its positive growth has been exhausted already.",
