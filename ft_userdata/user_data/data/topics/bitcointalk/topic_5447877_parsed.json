  "content": "I am very sure someone spending 10 to 15 minutes will figure it out, prove me wrong. But you have 24 hours after I make the bounty live. I am working to review a mixer. As a part of the review process I would like to see with or without any tool can someone debunk the mixes. After all mixer should break every possible connection of the bitcoin that was sent and received.Mix one: Btc sent from bc1qusfk857fsgm24hj352ry32dd5l6pu6qtv7g2f0Mix two:Btc sent from bc1q2vjwyr4r8vvgdnv405xgsvkv29q449vdvydhujMix three:Btc sent from bc1q8x9fsnumety4s68jxy43gwzuty5rt3y4tfzprxYour job is to find the destination address(es).For solving each mix you will receive $5.Anyone who will be able to solve all three will receive additional $5.Whoever will solve it first will be the winner.Let's go. It's live now.",

I know you tested http://whirlwind.money, so it's obvious you are talking about them.2. I know what is their multisig (posted by them and I also tested the mixer): https://mempool.space/address/bc1qf8h5k6sash8007vpesymxkw2xsg5d0r3j4l5vmcrwpz2pqu66fjstzgd3r3. They are quite new, so volume is still catching up. Less noise.Then I just searched for the outgoing transactions from their multisig that were made after your txs and had a close (but lower) amount. Let's take the second tx as an example, you sent 0.01684363 BTC and received 0.01671138... a fee of ~0.78%. This was the most likely tx (both 0.016XX).To increase privacy you should probably:1. Use the \"Note\" feature (if you didn't).2. Send two or more transactions and combine them to a single Note (or 4 txs into 2, etc...), then spend the Note after some time.3. Send your transaction and NOT spend the Note all at once (i.e you spend 0.01 tomorrow and then 0.006 after 3 days).Of course as the mixer gets more popular, this gets harder and harder.",

      "body": "Very nice initiative! I'm glad someone came up with this idea, but I don't think it's a fair challenge in the current format since you basically deanonymized your transactions yourself before starting it (even in this case those outputs could have originated from any of the deposits, seeing a similar output doesen't really mean anything since I could deposit 0.5BTC, wait for some incoming transactions and withdraw the same amounts in order to confuse observers): Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on April 06, 2023, 11:13:35 PMQuote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on April 05, 2023, 11:35:38 PM[Review for FAST option]Sent: 0.01690363Received: 0.01671138Fees paid: 0.00019225[Review for NOTE option]First noteSent: 0.00660254Second noteSent: 0.00474263Status: Awaiting confirmation.Latest update[Review for NOTE option]Note 1 sent: 0.00660254 BTCNote 2 sent: 0.00474263 BTCTotal sent: 0.01134517 BTCNote 1 balance: 0.00658604 BTCNote 2 balance: 0.00473078 BTCCombined note balance: 0.01131682 BTCAwaiting withdrawal : 0.01121682 BTCPotential Fees paid : 0.00012835 BTCOnce received then I will take some time before leaving my review. Finally I am very close.If you're open to make it 100% fair reflecting real-world conditions I'll be happy to 10x the bounty if anyone is able to deanonymize the transactions.Whirlwind's power lies in the fact that you could never know which mode a user chooses, meaning that you can't ever be sure if a specific deposit has been withdrawn. Considering this we can do the challenge in 1 of 2 ways:1. Display the deposit transaction and ask users which ones the withdraws are, same as you did now. I don't think this would be fair though since there is no way for a user to know if you withdrew or not unless you say it yourself, and if you do that then anyone can narrow down the possible deposits and outputs very easily since the privacy-set is basically bypassed.2. Display the outgoing transaction and ask users to find the originating deposit. This would reflect a real-world situation better and it's a more realistic scenario since users would know for sure that the originating deposit has been made before that specific output transaction.I'm fine with either of the 2 options. I could send some txid's myself for you to analyze or you can make some more transactions yourself and restart the challenge, let me know!Also keep in mind that the reserve is only about 5BTC at the moment since we are adding our own coins slowly together with other users and we only started a few days ago, we still have a few tens of BTC to add .",

I could make it more complected if I was using more than one addresses to receive the coins.Mix two and three were sent using NOTE option. The both notes were combined before withdrawing. I combined the both notes more and less than 24 hours before withdrawing the balance to my address. Since none could figure out the destination address yet, I am leaving it open for others (Although with this message I left enough clue).Please give a BTC address.Quote from: whirlwindmoney on April 07, 2023, 03:09:40 AMIf you're open to make it 100% fair reflecting real-world conditions I'll be happy to 10x the bounty if anyone is able to deanonymize the transactions.I will go for the review today after few hours. Then in the next few days I am planning to create a thread where I will try to check all current mixers who are active in the forum. I will offer a similar bounty to deanonymize each of them. If you want then you can take your part in the bounty fund I will have for it. I am glad you liked the idea. I hope the other guys will like it too. Let's find out who has better mixing algorithm to serve an average bitcoin user. People like us who are in the system for years already know how to trick even in our own way without using a mixer but it's difficult for average bitcoin users.",

I could make it more complected if I was using more than one addresses to receive the coins.As expected, shows how superior is using Notes and combining/spliting them. Am I wrong if I assume that if TryNinja analyzed the transactions just a few hours later after the following transaction happened, his guess would be way harder if not impossible to make with certainty even if fast mode was used and he already had some information about your transactions? I agree that the privacy set could be a lot stronger, but a bit more time needs to pass before that happens.https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/f94c356adebe826c70b57267e9d31b754edf383305b5c43f85399c4a0679b479My only intention here is to understand user's perspectives and explain how whirlwind works as good as I can, thank you again for coming up with the initiative! I got a lot of insight and you gave me a good idea which I'm working on at the moment. We will display the privacy set for each one of your selected outputs (number of deposits it could have originated from), so users know exactly how anonymous their bitcoin really is after using our service.And I will also update the FAQ tomorrow with a lot more information and explanations.Looking forward to your review BitcoinGirl.Club!While I was writing this message I got another idea  I'm thinking about lowering the fees to 0 (0% - 5% defaulted to 0) so people have a bigger incentive to deposit Bitcoin through the service, and this would help us achieve a super strong privacy set in a very short amount of time. And it would be to the benefit of every future user too. Probably I'll need to add more to the escrow so users trust sending bigger amounts but that's not an issue at all.And after we have a strong enough privacy set and enough users we implement a minimum fee again (in case we don't earn enough from \"donations\" I guess I'll call them) and and that point it will without a doubt be the most secure service from a privacy standpoint.",
