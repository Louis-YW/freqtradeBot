  "content": "Dear BitcoinTalk Community,While Bitcoin was initially presented as a revolutionary technology aimed at empowering ordinary people with financial independence, today it seems more like a tool for financial magnates rather than an instrument for the people. It appears that Bitcoin is increasingly being used as a speculative asset rather than a genuine means of improving people’s lives.When Bitcoin was first created, its goal was clear: to build a decentralized, independent financial system accessible to everyone. Today, however, Bitcoin often seems to serve as a tool for large financial players, focused more on value appreciation than on the original goal of helping ordinary people.One striking example of Satoshi Nakamoto's commitment to the idea of Bitcoin as a non-profit creation is the burning of 1 million Bitcoins. This act, in my view, demonstrated that Bitcoin was not intended to be a commercial product but rather a tool for the people, regardless of whether it would generate profit. If Bitcoin were just a financial product, it would have been illogical to destroy such a significant amount of its supply.For a long time, Bitcoin has not had a proper crowdfunding platform, a place where anyone could fund Campaigns with small iniciatives directly in a decentralized way. CrowdfundBee is an example of what could bring Bitcoin’s true purpose back to life — enabling people to fund ideas and projects without intermediaries, while remaining true to Nakamoto’s vision. While such platforms may not generate profits for the creators, this approach aligns with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original goal: to serve the people, not the profit-driven motives.It is logical to assume that Satoshi Nakamoto did not create Bitcoin as a profit-driven product — rather, he sought to create a tool that would empower people. Bitcoin, like many decentralized projects, should be about fairness, opportunity, and openness to all, not just about financial gains.Can we return to these goals and build new platforms that genuinely help the people? This is likely the greatest challenge we face today.Respectfully,Myjota dev of CrowdfundBee.xyz MVP version build.",

I agree that everything is heading in the direction you say it is. And personally, I am sad about it. So I spent a lot of time trying to be a little more Heart. But it is not easy to break through the mainstream.",

It's a protocol; a technology in which products can be made of it. There are a host variety of services that are sold in the market, such as exchanges, that use bitcoin, just as there are a variety of services that sell Internet related products, while the Internet is not \"owned\" by anyone, it's just a protocol. In fact, it's so decentralized that it uncontrollably evolved from what the creator might intended it to be.",
