OP don't get it twisted, self custody means you're in possession of the keys to your wallet and not the exchange and this is commonly attributed to using a decentralized exchange in achieving this, while using a decentralized exchange has less risk compared to centralized exchanges because by now you've got your keys in your hands but how you handle the safety now depends on you for it safety.",

But it's true most of the self-custody wallets can connect to the dex or swap platforms.I think it's advisable for someone in crypto to learn to use the DEX so that they can still have custody of their coins while trading. So far the liquidity still is an issue on DEX while, the experience on CEX is much better. In the end, the user can chose which is what he likes.",

And you are right OP, lack of knowledge is one reason why people had lose their money. Therefore, it is an urge to have a huge understanding and invest time learning about the crypto market. Most people lack the capability to properly take care of their coins. Also they were taught by the banks for so many years to keep their money in others' hands, they can't think it can be done better (plus they don't understand that unlike in the case of EU banks, if a CEX falls nobody will reimburse them).And most people are too cheap to buy a hardware wallet.I will add that there are also probably a very big number of day traders that can have a chance to earn only if they do keep money there.While I do agree that people should get their money into their own custody, it's not an easy task and I don't expect it to happen fast, no matter how many MtGox and FTX happen.Quote from: Obari on December 20, 2022, 04:03:35 PM~Do you think it is advisable to use preach the use of decentralized exchanges despite all the risk involved? The risks are preached mostly by the people who didn't use DEX.I think that there's a learning curve, I think that people need to be taught, but if you start with \"despite the risks\" you've already lost them.Quote from: Obari on December 20, 2022, 04:03:35 PM~Do you think emphases should be more on teaching tye use of self custody?I think that the benefits of self custody need to be said a lot more, but also people should become aware that if they are not tech savvy, self custody probably means hardware wallet.On this topic I'd say that the hardware wallets getting cheaper would probably help.",

In fact it is one of the most important lesson that beginners must be exposed to because skipping it would definitely lead to loss of funds. After they have learnt how to create a self-custody wallet, the next important topic should be how to record the private keys and keep them safe. Nobody should be introduced to bitcoin without a comprehensive lesson on self-custody.     Quote~Do you think it is advisable to use preach the use of decentralized exchanges despite all the risk involved? There is no necessary risk involved in using decentralized exchanges, what one needs is just caution and basic security/privacy skills. The only challenge is your ability to keep your keys safe to avoid unauthorized access and loss. You cannot compare the risked involved in using centralized exchanges with that of decentralized platforms. Using centralized platforms can lead to loss of funds, stealing of identity, hacking, loss of privacy and even government control of ones finance.",

We do usually get our focused on using up decentralized platforms and services if the time comes where there are some huge centralized platform issues in regarding hacks and other negative events which it makespeople do being mindful about that decentralized aspect but on the time where the fire settles in or down then this is where people do forget about these things and would start on trusting centralizedservices once again.We cant just deny and avoid not to see on whats their main differences.We know that CEX could really be having that easy access in relation with fiat-crypto or crypto-fiat transactionswhich cant be possible on DEX and this is where people do really see it and this is why preference is really changed up.",
