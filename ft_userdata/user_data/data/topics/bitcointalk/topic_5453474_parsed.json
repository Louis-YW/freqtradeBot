  "content": "The thought of everyone having a stake in Bitcoin has made people that love it so much do things like host lectures or organize videos or talkshows just to bring in more believers.I have wondered, unlike mathematics as a subject in schools that most persons claim to detest, there are those who detest Bitcoin or crypto or the whole decentralized thought.There are also those who I know love everything crypto, have tried investing in it or traded and have failed woefully, have tried to understand it, but can't just grasp the concept.My question is this, does personality trait or gene sequence or any inherited disorder contribute to determine whether one can become financially successful with Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general?Does one being an introvert or extrovert or being a student of arts or student of science determine if one can be successful with Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency endeavour ?",

I don't think it's materially biological, or a matter of DNA, but rather a part of your culture, character and personality.The people who are likely to make a profit with Bitcoin are those who are willing to take risks, learn new things, and probably those who have an education/culture related to the basic economic system (I mean, at least the basics, inflation, supply and demand, the limits of the conventional monetary system etc.). Interest in cryptography and open source softwares could be a reason someone join the Bitcoin boat too.Some people jump into Bitcoin out of financial desperation, some for decentralisation, some to avoid their corrupt national fiat currency, there are plenty of reasons. Either way, place of birth, and parents can predefine this, but I don't think it comes down to DNA or gene sequence alone.",

In the end, it is a combination of factors.QuoteDoes one being an introvert or extrovert or being a student of arts or student of science determine if one can be successful with Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency endeavour ?Whether you are an introvert or extrovert, both personality types can bring unique strengths to the table. Introverts might excel in research, analysis, and risk management, while extroverts might thrive in networking, marketing, and building connections. Also, a scientific background may provide a solid foundation for understanding technical aspects, while an artistic background can foster creativity in marketing.",

It only contributes to how one perceives and views things differently from others or has a similar meaning and explanation to something from others.When it comes to being successful in investing in Bitcoin or any other currency, I believe the only role personality traits have to play is to determine how the actor (perceiver) understands the currency. What happens after that has nothing to do with perception. If you actually find it difficult to understand what Bitcoin is all about, that might be as a result of not showing full interest in the currency, or it could also be as a result of some kind of mental disorder, as you have suggested above. But for someone with this kind of issue who is persistent on investing in the currency, all that's required of him or her is to have someone who will actually take his or her time to either explain more for them or help them invest their desired funds into Bitcoin, and have a clearly defined target on which he or she will like to take profit and try to hold onto that decision.There are things for which I believe it is actually not possible for them to be generically transferred to the other person, and one of those things is poverty or wealth, so the level of one's success can't be linked to the genetic traits theory.",

      "body": "Unless luck plays a role (which always does), if we count that one out, personality traits help for sure. If you’re impulsive you’re going to take some very good investment opportunities but sometimes you’ll take some very awful ones as well. Now if we think about it, personality is given but can also be somewhat controlled if there’s will and exercise. But generally, it plays a pretty big role in determining success simply because different personalities will lead to different mindsets. By controlling your personality and not letting it control you, you’re gonna have a better outcome.Let’s say you are arrogant and impulsive. You won’t make the best choices unlike someone who thoroughly thinks about an investment. You might sell Bitcoin at lows due to fear and impulsiveness, while there’s somebody out there who controls just that one personality trait and decides it’s not a good time to sell.Intelligence is very helpful, obviously. You can’t be dumb and be as good at investing as somebody who’s very intelligent and has been doing this for decades, who’s been born in a family of magnates and investors and who’s had a very good financial education from the start. As the offspring of a family who’s been wealthy for many generations, chances are you’ll be just as successful as them once you grow up. Now I don’t know if an arts student vs a science student will matter, the only thing many of them are missing is courage and will. I reached the conclusion that most of these guys who hate Bitcoin either have a plan that seems under attack by the idea of decentralization (eg banks) or they just fear the unknown so they sit only on known territory instead.DNA is a different beast and I think with enough studies and research a link could be found. Otherwise, why are the Jews known to be very good businessmen worldwide?This is my opinion. Take it as you will.",

Obviously if you have the genetic tendencies to be more aggressive you will probably be more aggressive in your investing and possibly more successful with trading cryptocurrencies. However that is a tenuous link at best. Whitby an interesting bit of research to see whether or not people who are more \"scientific and math based\" would do better with crypto versus regular currency trading.I don't know if anybody has ever looked into it. The other problem would be as with many things with doing research like this, it's going to be a small group and tough to get reliable data from people.-Dave",

As an example, have you seen the American movie with Jack Nicholson, \"As Good as It Gets\"? The hero of this film also suffered from this disease and did not save himself for a second, but was extremely careful.But seriously, of course, the pedantry of a person in finance will certainly be a good quality. He is restrained in his emotions, which means he will not commit rash acts that can adversely affect his business and investments.",

DNA not only affects a person's physical traits but also their cognitive abilities and intellectual capacity. It is highly unlikely for someone with limited intelligence to excel in data analysis solely based on optimism. Even individuals with average intelligence require intelligence training to adapt to the business models in the crypto world.We all start from scratch when we are born, but the pace of individual development, skills, and intelligence differs greatly. All of these factors are influenced by DNA.IMO, DNA plays a significant role in a person's success in the crypto world.",

Those can deter someone's success in every aspect of their life, either with Bitcoin investment or other kinds of income-generating businesses.Mental ability: Normally, the level of productive thought, reasoning, actions we take, choices we make, decisions we make, etc. all come from how mentally fit the person is. Once one is not mentally OK, they can't make any reasonable decisions, and the person cannot perform so well in some aspect of life, just as @Despairo have mentioned the case of OCPD. And when one has those kinds of traits, either inherited or developed, there is the possibility that it can still affect their level of success in Bitcoin investment and every other kind of investment.",

Addiction is another thing that seems to have a genetic predisposition, and trading can be a very bad idea in that case. So there are things that can make it worse for a person than average people have it, but I don't think there are things that can truly help one out that are determined genetically or by personality traits.",
