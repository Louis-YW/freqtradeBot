  "content": "This is purely for newbies in crypto currency and those who does not understand how Bitcoin works, and are always quick to cry when Bitcoin price drop below the price they bought.Note: if you own 1 btc in your private wallet at a bought price of $40,000 and now the price is $20,000 per Bitcoin, economically you are at $20,000/lost at the moment if you have sold your Bitcoin but if you still hold you 1 Bitcoin the value still remains the same is just the price that have changed. So as long as you have your private keys to the wllet that holds the Bitcoin with the 1 bitcoin balance you have not lost a dime.My cancel is this Have a futuristic view and a long term perspective about Bitcoin, and don't sell out of panic of Bitcoin dollars value unless you are at gain.Some sold at 1:  $69,0002:  $50,0003:  $40,0004'. $30,0005:  $20,000All this people sold at different prices but their all sold only 1 Bitcoin.Hodle hodle hodle is my language.",

Bitcoin has gone through worse bear cycles. For as long as they don't believe that Bitcoin is now beginning to face its demise, they wouldn't mind HODLing through the worst crypto winter. They just have to overcome this fear and everything will be all right. After all, it's not the falling price that probably worries many; it's the fear that Bitcoin is about to die.",

When it is said that 1BTC= 1BTC I say to put things in perspective, because it is not remotely the same 1BTC in 2010 than in 2022.I understand the OP's perspective, that if we look long term and HODL the price will recover and surpass $69k. If you do not sell, you will not realize a loss. The one who HODLs will have a scarce and limited good whose purchasing power tends to grow, unlike fiat currencies, but the one who bought at $69k has lost 70% of the purchasing power he had.",

If a person buys bitcoin with the money that should be used for necessities or savings then he is likely to sell it at a loss. Most people's reason for buying bitcoin is its value keeps increasing over the years. They usually think that price will be double next year so they just buy at the top without thinking any risk like these market corrections.",
