Â DecisionQuote from: icopress on May 24, 2021, 12:45:34 AMJoshua is a great fighter ... but I'm afraid Usyk will ruin his career. in 2015 I watched Usyk's title defense live, and then he was no less a dangerous fighter than he is now. The only option in which Joshua can win is based on training the spirit .. no matter how strange it sounds, but probably his best solution would be to train and meditate in some kind of Tibetan monastery.",
