  "content": "How to reduce dopamine level?Due to years of extreme entertainment consumption come from internet notably youtube, my body has finally produce too much dopamine that my body can't feel the hurt until the body near the complete failure. I want to reduce the dopamine level to the normal so that I can feel the hurt even if it was just a very small amount of hurt.Don't get me wrong dopamine is very similiar to pain killer where it make the person happy and forget about the pain in their own body, but it is too dangerous when it is too much. My body has begin to break but due to high dopamine I can't feel any hurt coming from the breakage, idk it feel very abnormal I need my normal body function back, I need to feel the hurt no matter how delicate it is, I need them so I could live a normal life and body functioning at normal pace instead of forced leveraged mode.Suggest what should be done? Should I completely go back to jungle and live a life without modern gadget and entertainment.",

      "body": "Follow a dopamine-balancing diet. Focus on foods like complex carbs from oats or beans, proteins from poultry or fish, probiotic foods like yogurt, antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies, and healthy fats from olive oil and avocados. These provide key nutrients to optimize dopamine balance.",
