Right now I waiting for a campaign like gamdom  which is managed by Yahoo I will advice you to rank up to full member to be able to have more chance to join a signature campaign (if signature campaign is what you need), there is no much signature campaigns for member rank. The more you rank the more the chance to join signature campaign and the higher the pay rate.",

If you use a telegram, you may join a group where you will be notified in time. I think this is a proper link to the yahoo's group https://t.me/joinchat/V9HT2T6WSAz8JDW8",

For example, this is one of the most common reasons why managers only accept older members (Sr.+), who behave in accordance with the rules of forums and campaigns.a similar discussion that might interest you, and deals with the reasons for the rules of signature campaigns, you can follow here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5402118.0",

You should concentrate on the forum Contribution and this is the best way to draw the attention of the campaign managers. Besides that, you may earn some merits as well when you will contribute to the forum. Because often managers look for good contributors for their campaigns. Hope you understand what I mean.

Deciding to allow member ranks partake in your campaign will make you the first campaign manager of many new members. If here is where friends are made and relationships kept, you would be a friend of many. Not only that, it also distinguishes you in the managerial work, because you will ensure you scrutinise the post quality of the member ranks. It will surely be a tedious work to do, compare to the managers who hired already established quality posters.Keep up the good work since the companies also benefit from it. Kind regards!",

You'd never change, I remember before when I was a Jr. member rank joining your signature campaign.  I know how the feeling of earning a few bucks while pushing yourself to learn everything here in the forum. (sorry a little bit off-topic)OP, it seems a little bit more patient and you'll rank up into a full member, give a try to focus, and manage to become a full member which is all signature campaign managers considering this rank.  You'd managed to become a member and I saw your potential to rank up easily.For now, hit the button \"notify\" to the link given by yahoo62278 above, it will send a notification into your inbox so that you'll know when there's a new post, possible update of the thread or there's a new campaign.",
