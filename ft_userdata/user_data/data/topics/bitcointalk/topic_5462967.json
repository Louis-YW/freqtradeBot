Some auctions might end in the middle of the night or take much longer than expected etc.That said, cool artworks. Took me a little to probably fully get your comic sequence.Fight Day has a touch of Bitcoin soft-porn. Haven't seen too much in that regard so far, lol.So starting bid is just 1 sat? How much is EU shipping and how much for US (to MJ) shipping?Let's start this off:Pizza Day 2023 - Nr. 3/10 Â 0.00000255Fight Day - Nr. 2/10 Â  Â  Â  Â  0.00006969Oh and one last point, your photos look great but one just fully displaying the card without the need to turn your head 90 degrees to the screen would be cool.",
