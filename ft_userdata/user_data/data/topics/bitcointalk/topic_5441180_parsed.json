You didn't have the money to invest in the business and borrowing to invest is risky. If you borrowed and the place didn't appreciate this high, you would have been indebted which is burdensome. I started a telecommunication business a long time ago and I later abandoned the business because I secured admission to a college. The business collapsed because of my absence. But the ideal thing I would have done was to employ someone who would handle the business when I do the supervision. After a few years, a major telecommunication company partnered with people that were in the same line of business as me, and many of them are millionaires now because the partnership opened more opportunities for them. Although I graduated with good grades, it would have been better to have a good certificate and a flourishing business.",

And now the price has doubled from the price that was offered to me before because the location of the land is also not that far from the city that we often visit every day.But I don't really regret that, even though I'm still looking for other land to build a house on. Because I can still look for a better one even though the price is different and choose one that is closer to the city that I frequently visit every day. And if you created this topic because you only regretted something in the past, I don't think the discussion will be so extensive here",

Most people have made wrong financial decisions that has led to regrets, it is a common thing that happens because decision making is not always as straightforward as you think. The decision you take that looks right today may be turn out bad tomorrow. If you had heard a news that the apartment building you wanted to buy then was marked for demolition or seizure, I am very sure that you will be happy that you did not buy the property. Decision making is not easy that is why it is always encouraged that you seek advice from professionals before you make some financial decisions.",

It's less of a single moment or event and more of a - if I knew more about financial topics like stocks and credit cards earlier on there would have been potential to make so much more. One of the biggest things to avoid when you're younger is debt, as it has both a psychological impact but also prevents you making money, the only valid debt is a low rate mortgage. As for stocks, it sounds like a money making dream, you just buy these little chunks of a company and over time they either grow in value or pay you part of their profits every year, the hardest part is picking the right ones. But even index funds do the job and diversify your risk so much, just plow what you can into them.",

But if you think that it's not a regret then that's okay as that's your opinion but to me, that's one of the regrets that I've been dealing with and realization together with acceptance is what made it even lighter.
