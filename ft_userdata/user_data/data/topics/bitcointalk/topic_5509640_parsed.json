After all this drama, it will not be strange or surprising to see either of the candidates begin to change their opinions on bitcoins when they get the votes they need that secures them the presidential position.",

I wanted to watch but I don't have a big desire, especially when I saw the highlights. As far as I know, he did a bad job in this debate while Kamala did more research and was more ready but I don't like her. By the way, his excuse for a second debate was that what happens when fighter loses? The fighter wants a rematch, it's not the winner who wants the rematch. So, according to Trump's logic, he did well, Kamala Harris lost and now she wants a rematch and Trump and his team will think about it. Trump is very narcissist, it's too much for an old man.Quote from: pooya87 on September 19, 2024, 06:55:48 AMIn any case, this is a positive news for bitcoin even if it doesn't change anything for this silly candidate who doesn't even know how to use bitcoin and has to have someone handle the phone even...

They can do anything they want to get sympathy and support from the audience. Even they will do something that they deny before just to get benefit from what they do. The audience should be smart to act and can know what they should choose. If Trump want to get support, he needs to do a lot because making a first transaction in Bitcoin doesn't mean audience will really know what Trump did. Maybe that can affect to the market but we don't know for sure. But thanks to Trump because he know the \"name\" of Bitcoin because of that",

From your response, the president may just be doing all this because he wants the community to vote for him. I'm 90% sure he wouldn't do all that when he climbs to the throne as president of America. For now, he's like any other investor showing out his excitement for bitcoin, could it be that the memory he's creating with bitcoiners would make impact to his behavior as a leader of America, we may not have been hearing him talk repeatedly about weapons and security in America. Trump's Agenda is to make America great again, he rarely talks about bitcoin in his campaigns. The last time I watched him speak, it was all revolving around war, nuclear weapon, military, etc. However, should bitcoin be on his agenda, it's the least of what he's thinking about.",

Likewise, those who vote for Harris expect to benefit from her policies. And as you said: he can also learn and gain a little more knowledge about bitcoin, which is actually beneficial for both him and bitcoin since it has caught the attention of a presidential candidate.
