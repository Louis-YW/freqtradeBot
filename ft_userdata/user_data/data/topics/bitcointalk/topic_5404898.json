Even if you don't click on any links, run any suspicious software, there are still ways to compromise your computer without and zero day exploits are not uncommon as well.Quote from: dhavalnc on July 02, 2022, 08:33:49 AM2) What if I lost or damage my hardware wallet? Do i need to buy same hardware wallet and restore my coins? or can use private keys in any other online wallet and get my coins back?You shouldn't use online wallets. You will be given the seed at the initialization of the hardware wallet. That can be imported into many of the compatible desktop wallets to restore all of the addresses.Quote from: dhavalnc on July 02, 2022, 08:33:49 AM3) What if the hardware wallet is damaged or corrupt?Same as above. If you'd like, certain hardware wallet provides a limited warranty to cover for damages.Quote from: dhavalnc on July 02, 2022, 08:33:49 AM4) Instead of hardware wallet can I keep the separate phone to store my coins in wallet app like trustwallet and keep disconnecting from the internet unless i want to do transaction. Is this a better choice?Not really. Hardware wallets are operated in a sanitized environment and it is difficult to compromise that environment. This is why they are secure, because they are designed for specific tasks and are intentionally secured to execute and accept certain commands.Disconnecting your internet periodically actually does nothing to improve your security. Malware would just wait for an internet connection to relay any data back to their C&C. Your best case would be to ensure that the wallet never gets online and use another device to send the transaction data, aka. Airgapped wallet.",

Is this a better choice?Well.. if the separate phone is factory reset except for the latest security updates and free of unnecessary apps and you don't use it for anything except for your Bitcoin wallet then it's at least safer than storing the coins on a phone that you use on a daily basis. Given that you keep the wallet phone itself safe and the wallet backed up of course.However that solution is nowhere near as safe as a hardware wallet or a fully airgapped device, for the reasons mentioned by ranochigo.",

Maybe someone else can chime in with other hardware wallets.Either way it is recommended to purchase hardware wallets directly from the vendors or at least from an official reseller (I believe those should be listed on the websites of the respective hardware wallet). Avoid market places like Amazon or Ebay as on those sites you may never know whether you got a legit wallet or one that's been tempered with.",

      "body": "Let a signing device cost you ~$200. That's less than 1% of the price your coins are currently worth. For me that would be a no-brainer.If your coins are Bitcoin only I would suggest you also buy a signing device that just supports Bitcoin. First it minimizes possible attack surfaces by eliminating code intended to support the other coins and second - at least for me - it is an ethical thing as I despise most of the crypto casino which one would indirectly help flourish. That would rule out the Trezor and Ledger mentioned above. The latter also had a serious leak of customer information which led to some threatening and blackmailing of customers. I even heard stories of people getting a visit from not so friendly people who wanted their coins. Maybe just rumors idk...Considering the above I would advice you to buy a Foundation device or a Coldcard. Coldcard also deletes your customer information after some time (at least it says it does).Best thing would be to pay with bitcoin, provide a false identity and let the shipment come to a place somewhere you have access to, but which is not exclusively identified with you. This way you mitigate some risks, since ordering a signing device directly to your home provides plenty of evidence about your financial business to outside people...But don't let the hassle be a non-starter for NOT buying one.",

That is to say, it internally signs transactions with its seed and only sends those signed transactions to the computer without exposing the seed.If you want to safely store your funds in a mobile phone, it's better to use an old one as a cold wallet. That is to say, you should never use it as a phone till your funds belong to the seed in it, you should remove the sim card and only use it in airplane mode (no wifi and even bluetooth connection). It's even better to physically turn off/remove antennas if you can. You can also do the opposite : using an old laptop or tablet that you won't connect till their seed is in use and broadcasting signed transactions with your smartphone.",

These computers exchange information between themselves. Information about transaction tells who has access (possibilities) to spend a given “coin”. And, to be able to spend some coins, you must gain access to private keys which allows you to do some actions. Now we come to the most important part - where the information about private keys stored. If you ask me if you generate keys on mobile phone connected to internet, using application you downloaded- the answer is “I do not know”, theoretically if application source code is known, you may trust it.Some use hardware wallets, because private keys “never leave the device”.

It could only give you pre-generated seed phrases from a list known to the developer, or it could send your seed phrase off to some server somewhere where someone else could access it (like Coinomi did when they sent seed phrases to Google servers).You should stick to open source software wallets like Electrum, or go one step further and get a good hardware wallet.Quote from: dhavalnc on July 06, 2022, 12:28:48 PM2) In hardware wallet, does coins are stored in hardware? or only private is stored in a hardware wallet?

Secondly, as I said above Trust wallet is closed source, so you should avoid that too.To answer your general question, any closed source wallet could have access to your private keys and coins. Since it is closed source, you have no way of knowing what it is doing. It could only give you pre-generated seed phrases from a list known to the developer, or it could send your seed phrase off to some server somewhere where someone else could access it (like Coinomi did when they sent seed phrases to Google servers).You should stick to open source software wallets like Electrum, or go one step further and get a good hardware wallet.Quote from: dhavalnc on July 06, 2022, 12:28:48 PM2) In hardware wallet, does coins are stored in hardware? or only private is stored in a hardware wallet? Eg. suppose if there is 0.1 BTC in our wallet it is stored in address and can be seen in blockchain ledger so actually coins are stored in wallet address on blockchain server and not on hadware or software wallet. Am i right? or not?You are right. As PawGo has explained, coins are not stored on your hardware wallet. The only thing which is stored on your hardware wallet is your private keys, and these give you permission to move certain outputs around the blockchain.Thanks for your answer. I am sorry, not bitcoin.com it's blockchain.com",
