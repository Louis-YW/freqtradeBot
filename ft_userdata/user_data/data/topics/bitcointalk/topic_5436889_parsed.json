Because they are owned by the US and Nato... particularly the CIA and MI6.Ukraine run by CIA, MI-6 specialists, not Zelensky â€” former PMhttps://tass.com/world/1566051Ukraine is now being run by specialists from the US Central Intelligence Agency and British MI-6, Ukraine's former Prime Minister (2010-2014) Nikolai Azarov said on Monday.\"Ukraine is now very seriously governed not by [President Vladimir] Zelensky, not by [Ukrainian defense ministry's intelligence directorate chief Kirill] Budanov, not by [commander in chief of the Ukrainian armed forces Valery] Zaluzhny, but by special groups of highly-qualified specialists in military science and intelligence who represent first of all the Central Intelligence Agency and MI-6. They steer practically all steps allegedly taken by Zelensky and Zaluzhny,\" he said in an interview with the Solovyov Live television channel.The Ukrainian authorities are fulfilling ready-made plans \"under supervision from Western specialists,\" he added.Azarov told the Izvestia newspaper earlier that Kiev's readiness for settlement talks depends entirely on the United States.",

If there was no support from these great nations, Ukraine and other parts of Europe would have become the vassal states of Russia. Now when it comes to negotiating for peace, the US must be a key player in the negotiation process because it has spent so many resources to help protect Ukraine. Ukraine would have to be loyal to the US and NATO because, without them, Ukraine is powerless. It is a well-known fact that the helped must always do the bidding of the helper.",

Ukraine would have to be loyal to the US and NATO because, without them, Ukraine is powerless. It is a well-known fact that the helper must always do the bidding of the helper. However, when you look at history, the picture is a bit different.Back at the time of and after WW1, the US wisely set the current Russian government in place by supporting the Bolshevik Revolution against the Tsar government. Why? Probably to use the new Russia to offset the German threat, while at the same time trying to take over Europe for the US.Russia followed through with its US purpose in WW2. It was Russia that conquered most of Germany back then.But the US didn't have as its only goal to take over Europe... which was done thru Nato. The US wants the whole world. The people of Russia simply want their own country. So, as the US pushes forward with Nato, Russia is going to fight to keep herself free from US aggression.It's not so much Russia invading Ukraine or any other country as it is Russia pushing back against Nato and a US, that are forever spreading toward world conquest. Of course, the conquest is being done mostly through deceit and trickery. One of the only reasons the world remains free is that the agents of the old Russian KGB understood what was going on, and saw through the trickery and deceit of the US and Nato. Putin and others in the Russian government are former KGB.Japan was right in WW2 when they called US as it truly is... imperialism.If you are in the mood for a good movie that shows a little of how real espionage works, try \"The Kremlin Letter\" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmuKDVIpc1I. I need to watch \"The Kremlin Conspiracy,\" a modern movie... to see how it compares.",
