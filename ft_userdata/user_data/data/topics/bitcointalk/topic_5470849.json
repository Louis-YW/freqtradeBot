I wouldn't touch on the issue with Israel or any other countries banning bitcoin, there are pros and cons, but it's their decision not to accept it, so we can settle on that argument.And I don't think that government that are against it's is a mockery, let them know their lessons already. Just like what the internet in the beginning, many governments are against it, but look at it right now. So let's not rub it in, on the contrary, we should just be quiet about it, it we are in the country that accepts bitcoin then good, (as in my case), continue to accumulate. And for those who are living under a authoritative government that doesn't want to give control to the people, just be careful and try to stay safe with your bitcoins.",

Governments fighting any phenomenon may not necessarily lead to its disappearance, but it will have less impact. Bitcoin can be the currency for international trade and its price will increase significantly if it moves away from political polarization and becomes cash for settling payments rather than money used by everyone who does not like the banking systems or tries to circumvent sanctions.",

They are manufacturing it domestically and mostly inside the prison known as Gaza. For example their rockets are made out of the ancient sewage pipelines that ran from Egypt into Palestine.Additionally majority of their weapons are spoils of war. These are stuff Palestinians have taken from their enemies aka the occupiers. For example they now own at least 4 Merkava tank they seized recently.Almost all the guns Palestinians have are also Israeli made, either acquired by taking it from their military bases or buying it from Israeli soldiers!Quote from: Prestongold on October 19, 2023, 12:28:48 AMWhy should someone as big as a governmentWell in your story, Israel is not a \"government\". It is an illegitimated regime that is more of a terrorist organization than a government.Quote from: Prestongold on October 19, 2023, 12:28:48 AMBig up to El Salvador who was bold enough and has a smart leader to have discovered the potential advantage of Bitcoin and adopted it accordingly,Bitcoin's benefits are for individuals not for countries (on big scale). Of course the case of El Salvador is slightly different because we are talking about a very small country with a very small economy and lots of problems. So impact of Bitcoin there can be considerable specially if the plans their president has (tourism, foreign investor, etc.) works.",

Freezing accounts of terrorists is a good activity anywhere on Earth. But why do they need to ask it now if KYC on Binance works at the first place.KYC serves for AML (Anti Money Laundering) so if Israel government asked Binance to do this now, it means KYC does not work for AML before this abnormal and urgent request.Why KYC is extremely dangerous - and useless. Again that thread shows its meanings.I don't say Israel do everything right or they are better than Hamas. In the middle, many people die for nothing.",

I don't believe this and I don't want to get into conspiracy theories about the Hamas attack.No, this ban won't change anything. Terrorists and criminals will still be using Bitcoin(and altcoins) along with fiat currencies like the US dollar and the euro.

First, Bitcoin is not bigger than the government. We don't need it to be that. We just need it to be a decentralized digital currency which it already is. If we begin to make it like a revolution against the government it might not end well for us. Secondly, I don't think Israel banning Bitcoin is entirely true. There was a time they did, but it was not an outright ban on Bitcoin, and it wasn't recently.And yeah, the Bitcoin ban can change a lot. As someone who lives in a country where Bitcoin was banned at a time, I know what it means. Do not underestimate the power of a government. Using Bitcoin where it is banned may seem like a small disobedience to people who do not live in such conditions, but it's more than that.If you're unlucky, the government might try to make an example out of you and they may come at you with all they've got. Quote from: Prestongold on October 19, 2023, 12:28:48 AMBig up to El Salvador who was bold enough and has a smart leader to have discovered the potential advantage of Bitcoin and adopted it accordingly,A country making Bitcoin legal tender can not necessarily be termed as Bitcoin adoption. It's evident in the country you mentioned El Salvador. The adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador has not improved. People don't pay with Bitcoin and businesses don't accept Bitcoin much. Last year it was reported that Bitcoin adoption has gone down by 60% after a year of making it legal tender.Adoption to me, means the amount of people that use Bitcoin.",

Another country? Instead of attacking Bitcoin in vain, maybe its time to look at ourselves and change. For all you Bitcoin fans out there, especially those who live in places where it is being banned: make your security even stronger, keep your eye on the end goal, and remember that Bitcoin's promise goes far beyond these short-term changes in government.",

The impact of such ban usually stays within the jurisdiction of the same government. Nothing really funny is there. It's always the case because Bitcoin is something truly global and free from the control of any centralised authority.",
