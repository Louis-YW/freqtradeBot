Using Bitcoin for trading doesn't always work with your past experience since the market could go otherwise.Now talking about altcoins, it's wrong for both investment and trading because there's a low chance altcoins price will always increase, more over it could become a dead coin and you will rekt.",

Just use your trading & investment EXperience yesterday in your trading & investment EXperiment today to achieve your trading & investment EXpectation(s) tomorrow.It is not that simple, you could use your trading experience of 'yesterday' in your trading 'today' and still lose, you could even lose more than you did the previous day, the market is unpredictable and you cannot predict or guess what is going to happen. Trading is difficult, better one avoids it, but if you cannot always be ready to endure losses. Investment is much better, you can either use dollar cost averaging to buy bitcoin periodically, or you can buy a lump sum and hold it.",

Of course we can say that some of our decisions are based on expectations that again stem from some of our previous experiences or the experiences of some other people, but the future is always uncertain no matter how much experience we have and no matter what we know about something. I think it is wrong that most consider investing in Bitcoin only as a way to one day reach their magical exit point and profit, and not as what it was actually created for. Therefore, I think that each individual should have his role when it comes to the future, because if we let the big ones become the main players, there is no doubt that they will destroy everything they can get their hands on just for the sake of greater profit.Bitcoin is not just a matter of making as much profit as possible, it is something much bigger - but it may only be understood by those who use it as a currency at least from time to time.",

Every single altcoin has lost a significant part of its price against bitcoin with no exceptions. That means none of them are ever good for \"investment\" when you have a choice between bitcoin and altcoins.A more detailed look at the altcoin market shows that they are only good for short term high risk trading since they only get pumped and dumped.",

For me, speculation make a great factor that it will pump in the future but it doesn't guarantee that it is a long term investment and will not rekt you. That is what I've learn with the LUNA and UST issue, I haven't bought it but my friends did and that time they keep saying it has good fundamentals but look what happened now.\"Invest what you can afford to lose\" saying will always be the best for me even though anyone already knows it.",
