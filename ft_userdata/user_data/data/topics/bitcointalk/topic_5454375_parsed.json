Really, the Lord's Prayer is John chapter 17, some of which I will quote:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/john/17.htm20I am not asking on behalf of them alone, but also on behalf of those who will believe in Me through their message, 21that all of them may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I am in You. May they also be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.22I have given them the glory You gave Me, so that they may be one as We are one— 23I in them and You in Me—that they may be perfectly united, so that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them just as You have loved Me.Don't simply breeze through it. Actually see the words that Jesus prayed to His (our) Father, requesting that all believers be ONE with God.It's time to live as you believe, just as Jesus did. But to find out what and how Jesus believed, you have to immerse yourself in the Bible, but especially in the New Testament.",

Your word, scriptual, should be 'legalistic'.Legalism tries to be obedient to a set number of laws in the Bible. But the written laws are only a tiny number of laws that really exist.To be lawful towards all the laws, one needs to act out of love and faith. The spirit of love lets us identify the laws without even making them into written laws... so we can automatically obey them.",

God.These words are important, the way they fit together and are to be acted on. They are words of supreme law and supreme love. Examine these words individually, and together with each other.

We can't know the things that are not of this creation except in a very general way. Why not? Because they are entirely different than things of this creation. If they weren't different, they would simply be a different part of this creation. However...Job 19:27:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/job/19-27.htmI myself will see him with my own eyes—I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!God made this universe the way He wanted things. He is making the new universe in a similar way, but much more glorious. It will be different enough that we can't understand the new one from here. But it will be similar enough that we will have eyes to see God... but they will be a much more glorious set of eyes, able to see far more than our eyes can see in this universe.It's like God is not only programming a new program for His universe-computer, but He is making a whole new advanced universe-computer, that can handle greatly upgraded programming.",

Someone who doesn't know much about math, might be tempted to say that most of math is silly.But when that same person studies math and the things that can be done through math, he suddenly finds that math isn't so silly as he formerly thought.Same with religion. Study the history of each religion, and see what you come up with. For example:1. The Hebrew people have in the Bible some of the best laws for living life free and equitably;2. The Hebrew people have passed their Scriptures down from parents to children for 3500 years... the historical time of the nation of Israel since Moses;3. The Old Testament as a history shows over and over how not following God and His law caused trouble for the people of Israel, and how God saved them when they started to follow Him again;4. The New Testament was copied around 25,000 times in the first and second centuries after Jesus birth. Why? Because Jesus was powerful, and the people kept the memory of this power;5. The Bible is the most printed and sold book by far, not by accident, but because there is power in it.In other words, when you start to examine the Bible, the info in it, the history of the nation that 'wrote' the Bible, and a lot of things about the whole history surrounding the nation of Israel outside of it, you will find that the Bible is an impossible-to-have-been-written book. God is in the Bible.There is no other nation, and no other book that has a history anywhere near as strong as Israel and the Bible. People don't believe the Bible because they haven't looked. However, for those who have looked and still don't believed... God has given people free will... free will that is strong enough to resist even Him, His Holy Spirit working in them.",
