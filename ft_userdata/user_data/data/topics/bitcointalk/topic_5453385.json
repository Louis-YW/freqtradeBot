  "content": "I operate a (FX) currency fund that trades fiat currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, etc). The fund itself is denominated in BTC which means all gains are paid in BTC. Strategy generates double digits per month in client net benefit.  Highly liquid as it's an intraday strategy in the markets. (Typical trade is under an hour)This is a great way to earn a return on BTC holdings while acquiring more bitcoin at no added cost. The fund is structured as separately managed accounts (SMA) so nothing is commingled. You open a brokerage account and I receive the power to trade the funds for a fee. You retain full autonomy over the account, your BTC stays in your possession and you can revoke trade abilities at will. No capital lock-in periods.Looking for those who can invest $250k worth of BTC minimum. Preferably larger. Total AUM is over 250BTC (across all investor accounts)2023 Client Net ReturnJan 2023 - 54%Feb 2023 - 28%March 2023 - 27%April 2023 -  22.5%Pitchdeck containing 3rd party audited records available for serious inquiries only.
