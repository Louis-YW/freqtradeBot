  "content": "Have you ever thought of a government implementing a Cashless gambling?  Making hard cash obsolete for gambling purposes?  Armenia is currently pushing this law that force their gambler to do gambling transaction via bank[1].  It was stated that the said law is created so that the government can tax gambling institutions effectively.  They also add an additional requirement that the gambling establishment needs to pay in order to get the desired licenses on how much  bet the establishment can accept.This may look profitable for the government but I believe it will hit hard gamblers.  With the implementation of cashless gambling, gamblers are now exposed since they have to use their credit cards or debit card to play.  (Another way of the government to spy on their citizen.)In a positive note, minors gambling incident would greatly reduced because the gambling transaction can now be traced via bank statement, except if these minors can freely use their parent's cards.May take on this.. screw the government if we really wanted to do cashless gambling, there is always a cryptocurrency gambling platform option where we can at least play gambling without the need to use our bank account.So what do you think about this cashless gambling, is this another breakthrough of the gambling industry or just a way of the government to track their citizen and earn from the gambling establishment.[1] https://www.casino.org/news/armenia-introduces-new-taxes-restrictions-on-its-gaming-industry/",

And as far as I know, government have been giving traditional based casino lenient taxes, because that's one way to attract them to put up a billion dollar business in one's country and then have a pay cut.So if they are going for cashless gambling to put another tax for us, then I wouldn't be agreeing on that proposal. It will be too much for us. The argument for KYC and the whole tracking is already there, when you play on a traditional based casinos, to enjoy the perks you have to register your name and other info and same now with the online casinos. So there's no surprises with that already, the real eye opener is the tax.",

This may result to other ways citizens will go into more illegal gambling and unlicensed gambling which are probably not from their country. I do not think they should think too much about tax if at least they are still making more profit from gambling through tax and they can find other means to make the tax effective and unavoidable through other payment means.",

But I also know that this will not come into fruition because there's just a lot of factors that throw most gamblers off the gambling bus and would surely seek other alternatives to have their gambling fill. Underground gambling dens will rise and the government will have their profits go down the drain - most especially these casinos that paid for this license in order to operate legally.",

When gambling online we are used to only deal with digital payments and got used to it. I am not really a big fan of cash anyways, so in case the casinos in my country would stop accepting cash all together it wouldn't make a big difference for me. Since the covid pandemic I have switched to using my card in 9 out 10 cases. But there are people who only want to deal with cash, one of my friends is like that. He always runs around with large sums of cash and never has a card with him. For people like him the ban would be a big deal, for the average gambler this will probably not change much, they can deposit their money first at bank and then use their credit card to play at the casino. In general I am not a big fan of any bans that limit our life in such a big way, gamblers should be allowed to choose between cash and digital payment options. For the government it might make sense to only rely on digital payments to make sure they are getting always paid their taxes, but some gambler don't want to have digital receipts for where they are gambling. It could be that some gamblers want to hide their activities from their wives and can't use the bank account that they are sharing.",
