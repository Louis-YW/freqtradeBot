  "content": "I have a nano ledger s and use it with my windows laptop along with ledger live.  If I use a new laptop and also buy a nano ledger s plus, what is the best way to set it all up?I would first install and verify ledger live first.  Then connect my nano ledger s to it to recognize it and then add the same accounts to it right?Now after doing this, what about the nano ledger s plus?  I would like the nano ledger s plus to be more of a hardware wallet that I use more often so to speak.  Thus I want the older nano ledger s to be more of a storage hardware wallet.  The nano ledger s is the only one I have now and use it only when I need to.  I don't do lot of transactions on it.  So with the nano ledger s plus, i would generate a new seed for it.  Then I would add accounts on ledger live there as well?  So say you call your btc and bch accounts on nano ledger s as bitcoin account and bitcoin cash account.  What do you name those same btc and bch accounts on the nano ledger s plus to differentiate it from the nano ledger s accounts?  Or most people don't do this and only add other accounts not in their only nano ledger?  I also plan to install other apps as well since I read you could install up to 100 apps on it.  So I don't mind installing ETH, LTC and a bunch of other wallets   Current the nano ledger s, just have btc, bch, waves so cannot add that many more accounts.  But I haven't needed to.  Yes I know you could just delete the app and readd it later on.What is the best way to this?  Also if i were to do this on a new computer, should I delete my ledger live in my old computer or not after doing all this?  The thing is say i do not.  Any future transaction i do on a new laptop with the nano ledger s account, well opening ledger live on either computer will show the updated coins and transactions right?How do people who have 2 hardware wallets handle this and what is the most common way?  I did hear people who have a 2nd hardware account as a backup and input the same seed on it in case something happens to their original device.  Would you recommend that instead?  I do see that as a good idea in case your original device breaks or something happens to it.  But should your 2nd hardware wallet ever be never set up and just laying there?  I assume most people who have 2 devices... one is for long term storage... the other is for daily use such as trading etc?  Also the 2nd hardware wallet would be more of a daily wallet so the long term storage would be safer since it won't be used daily like if you were trading etc?Also, the nano ledger s that I use.  I did not setup a 25th word/passphrase for it.  Reason being I set it up the original way and don't want to mess around with it and mess it up somehow.  Now if i get a nano ledger s plus, and want to do a 25th word/passphrase on it, do that but make sure when you setup the new nano ledger s plus, send a very tiny amount of btc there and then reset it and enter the nano ledger s plus seed and the passphrase and as long as it shows up on ledger live for that account, then you are good? The thing is right now I kind of still want to setup a 25th word passphrase for it but never attempted it because I only had just the 1 nano ledger s and didn't have a 2nd device.  I was told you could do this but it would be tougher if I don't have a 2nd nano ledger with me.  So if I get a nano ledger s plus, what would be the best way for me to setup a passphrase for the original nano ledger s seed I have?  However, remember I want to use the nano ledger s as my long term storage wallet and the nano ledger s plus as the daily hardware wallet.Also I heard a lot about metamask which I never used but heard if you do a mistake, you would have tons of issues.  Thus I would only want to experiment with that on a hardware wallet that doesn't have my long term storage and just mostly altcoins.  Based on all this, anyone can give me advice on how to go with this?I am hesitant of moving my coins to a 25th word passphrase in case something goes wrong.  I mean the passphrase could be up to 100 characters.  How in the world or why in the world would someone even do this?  I can't imagine someone even using more than a 25 character limit for the passphrase because what if you mess up typing it somehow.  How do you make sure you not only type it in correctly when setting it up... but when having to recover it if your passphrase is ridiculously long.  I can't imagine someone passphrase being like 80 characters and they having to enter 80 characters one letter at a time etc.",
