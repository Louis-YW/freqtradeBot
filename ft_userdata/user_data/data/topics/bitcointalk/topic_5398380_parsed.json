No. Yet, bitcoin has the highest marketcap and should still be considered less risky, but altcoins like ethereum, litecoin are less risky as well. Quote from: Freeveto on May 12, 2022, 08:55:26 PM\"ETH have actually become seen ... as a less risky asset.\"But that does not change the fact that ethereum is centralized just like other altcoins. To go for a decentralized coin, go for bitcoin which is the most decentralized.Quote from: Freeveto on May 12, 2022, 08:55:26 PM✓BTC halves every four years and gets more scarce and is deflationary .✓ETH gets burn everyday becomes deflationary Asset.Agreed, but I prefer a coin that has limited supply, bitcoin has only 21 million supply. The qualities I need in a coin, bitcoin has it most.",

This has been the case in every bear market or just price downtrend - alts fall harder than Bitcoin.

We can't change the mindset of the people to choose Bitcoin ever ETH as it was highly recommended here and that fact that Bitcoin is considered as a high gaining investment. Again, it was a market preference, investors had already seen the difference between investing in the two, and Bitcoin getting higher odds. Well, of course, I have ETH on my list and this one is my favorite among altcoins but I put huge chunks into Bitcoin. Bitcoin - 60%ETH - 20%Others - 20%",

The long-term stability that you evaluate in any respect, but still the most important time is looking at oneness time. We all see and know the popularity of BTC in this market and its influence for many years from birth to present, and if OP thinks BTC volatility cycles are unstable, then even the ETH case you mentioned is something much more volatile. While I consider these to be long-term buys and holdings in this space, we want the stability between them and the fiat to sound like a joke.

If Terra had been backed by Eth, then Ether would have been hit hard and not Bitcoin. So I wouldn't say that Ether is the better investment.",

A temporary record can never be an example. King will prove it.I disagree, bitcoin could be a lot more riskier than what we are seeing today from ethereum, sure ETH is not above btc yet on marketcap however it's \"used\" more in the sense that ERC20 network is used. Which means that even though bitcoin has a lot of backing from a lot of different places, we have to accept that ETH is getting the same attention if not more from the tokens using their network.This is why \"one day\" it could become less risky to hold ethereum in the future, still doesn't need to be biggest, could stay at second, but that requires it to be a bit more in the line with usage rate and if it's used more then it will be less risky.",
