Important note: crypto will not be able to eradicate poverty. Especially if the government doesn't really want to let the people prosper, you don't have any options to help them.",

Especially if the government doesn't really want to let the people prosper, you don't have any options to help them.It's not about helping it's about making profit.Anyways we can do other project but we need about 50 000 people each Will invest 30$ then we can do a many things.",

This is more likely a scam.This offer is pretty risky and actually, crypto doesn't need new coins or token. All people needs is already on other coins/token.",

I see you only want to make a profit for yourself and maybe the community you want to create.",
