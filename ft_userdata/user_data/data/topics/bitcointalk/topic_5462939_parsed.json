I know having fun with friends is important but they don't talk and teach something new and interesting(all things are in my imagination) so how do i make new friends who also are like me? in this forum also very brave and intelligent people, but we cannot meet them in place because they are here because of their privacy. so anyone indian from this forum met any other user inplace? and what are the best places to find intelligent friends from i can learn something?",
