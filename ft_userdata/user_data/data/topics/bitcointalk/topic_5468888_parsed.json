Being active in the NFT markets in ZKSYNC and having an active wallet in general are some of the criteria,having an omnibus NFT might be a force multiplier in the upcoming expected ZKSYNC airdrop...",

Did you ever heard of any layer 2 project given an airdrop based on NFT?  No. Please don's say aptos given an airdrop. Because aptos is a layer 1 project.  Most of the users are thinking they will be eligible for this airdrop from holding the \"Libertas omnibus\" NFT.  My suggestion is to sell the nft. Otherwise it will be less than 1$ soon.",

Yes, this NFT is unlikely to directly affect the qualification of receiving airdrop, but...But this NFT is used by the service https://trustgo.trustalabs.ai for \"Non-Sybil Verified\", which in turn is used for Gitcoin passport. And despite the fact that you consider it unnecessary, it is very actively being bought at the current price of about $20.",

But it would be really crazy if we are going to buy that NFT in hopes that it might be a possible “multiplier” of an upcoming airdrop by zkSync Era. Until now, I am still tempted of trying to acquire it at a much lesser price when everything calms down.Just like the Linea Voyage commemorative NFT where we heard about them trading it via P2P for as much as $1k (alpha) and $800 (beta). I also see a post on Facebook months ago that she is trying to sell her Linea Alpha NFT due to emergency reasons and the demand is so high at that time.",

That may be the criteria for the ZkSync Airdrop as many Youtubers and the Airdrop hunters are saying that, as the price of Libertas Omnibus ZkSync Nft was 9$ in the past, and there are 179k users are eligible to mint this NFT. And now we can see the price has been pumped hard as yesterday they announced a role in their Guild that the person who has this NFT will get a role of Libertas Omnibus NFT at ZkSync Discord, so its price pumped in just some hours and its price is 60$.I'm also eligible for it and I'm happy for it, I'm not going to sell it. Holding this NFT may be me some serious reward from the side of ZkSync, it would be the criteria for the ZkSync Airdrop then I hope I will be eligible for this. And my opinion to everyone is not selling it at this cost. If they have two in the wallet then it would be better to sell only from one wallet.",

Last year you meant. im holding some libertas omnibus and got decent profit since many people dumped it like it was nothing last season. The bitcoin pump made the hype to the NFT becomes even bigger now. Expecting the price to rally even higher if there will be a news related to the zksync airdrop.

Any NFT released by the projects that have not released tokens can always be valuable. I can also remind you how babylon NFT pass gets pump from 20 to the 200 bucks in a day caused by the hype.",

This NFT in the Yalintl network is special, since it is its owners who receive an additional role in the Discord and is one of the criteria in https://guild.xyz/zksync-era",
