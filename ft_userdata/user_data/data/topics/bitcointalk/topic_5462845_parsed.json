What is just noticable about bitcoin spot ETF is that it would be approved by United States SEC in a time that will favour bitcoin price to move higher and higher it will go.Bitcoin spot ETF is another reason that more people will have access, not directly but through bitcoin spot exchange traded fund.",

I don't think everyone's that keen on the ETF too lol. People in here have been made aware of this news since the earliest parts of this year and everyone's just tired of hearing about it. On the other hand for sure it's going to pump bitcoin's value and that may well signal a bull run before the halving even commences but at the same time I don't think it's THAT sustainable per se. So people in here are just not that stoked anymore about the Bitcoin ETF. On the other hand, they're probably biding time until bitcoin's in a more desirable price point before they re-appeal this again and have SEC approve it. Whatever happens I don't think it's going to really help the common folk or whatnot.",

However, there is no question that an ETF can surely open up more avenues for the whole cryptocurrency industry as this can be a big vote of confidence and can signify that BTC has come of age. In summary, I have a 50-50 optimism for ETF though of course I would not mind much if Blackrock can use its influence for its approval if not this year then eventually.",

And since it’s blackrock, pretty much all their etfs are approved by the SEC. So this one actually has a decent chance.Same way how CME applied for Bitcoin futures and was approved. Same situation here and when the Bitcoin etf was approved for the derivatives on CME. However what happened right after? A huge sell off.",

The price of Bitcoin has been relatively stable in recent months, and the SEC may be waiting for a clear trend to emerge before approving an ETF.It could send the price of Bitcoin soaring. This is because an ETF would make it easier for institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin, which would increase demand and drive up the price. An ETF would provide a more liquid market for Bitcoin, which would make it easier for investors to buy and sell the cryptocurrency.Or It's not possible. The SEC has been hesitant to approve any cryptocurrency ETFs, and it's possible that they will continue to reject applications until there is more regulation and oversight of the cryptocurrency market.Only time will tell if the SEC will approve a Bitcoin ETF. But if they do, it could be a major catalyst for the cryptocurrency market.",

On the other hand if the SEC refuses to approve it,I don't see anything that will change from the current movement of bitcoin price and bitcoin price will still pump when the time comes for a pump. The halving is next year and ATH next two years. The price of bitcoin will still reach the speculated price either with the acceptance of ETF or not. Bitcoin has come to stay and no matter what happens it will be follow the bitcoin circle. So let's worry less of the approval of ETF by SEC because demand and supply is what affects the price.",

Absolutely not, you can buy bitcoin in several ways, and it varies by country, and the rich can buy bitcoin through the OTC market. It is true that ETFs will facilitate the adoption of bitcoin, but without them, bitcoin is still working and adoption is still increasing.Some Bitcoin ETFs are accepted in Canada and all ETFs that rejected in the United States.",

In this forum we should care less. The only thing is that the approval of the Bitcoin ETF is supposed to throw a bullish sign into the market and bring in more institutional money. But that's the theory, that just as it can drive the price up it can drive it down. Imagine x famous company buying many millions of dollars in Bitcoin ETF and then after a year selling it. It would also affect the market negatively, just like when Tesla sold.So, I don't worry, I keep accumulating real Bitcoin, not ETFs or shit, and that's it.",

The regulator is expected to respond to seven other bitcoin ETF filings during the first week of September.\"A physical bitcoin ETF will likely carry a management fee of 0.7-1% which could still bring in $200m per annum for those ETF providers with marketing expenses front-loaded,\" the report said.The note said that any SEC spot ETF approval could have a \"material positive impact\" on bitcoin's price, and investors should have enough \"upside exposure\" on any day that the regulator is scheduled to respond to the ETF applications.If the SEC needs more time to assess the practicality of the surveillance-sharing agreements, then the bitcoin price may correct initially in mid-September, and this is the \"dip to buy,\" the report added.CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group, owns Grayscale....",

Whether they're rejected or not, the market will still soar high. That's the common thing that we have but with these ETFs if they're approved, they're surely going to push the market into a crazier price. But then, it's a driving force that will contribute to the price of bitcoin to get it back to the bull run. Otherwise, they've helped the market to get at least a bit head of it but then if all of them were rejected, there's no need to be dependent on it. We've got halving which is the major force that will make the market push to the bull run and that's not dependent to these ETF approvals being done by the SEC. For now, we don't know if there will be more rejections or some more approvals and IIRC there have been approved in the past but it wasn't just covered by the media at all.",
