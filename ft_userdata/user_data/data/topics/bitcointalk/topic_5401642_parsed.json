  "content": "Hello everyone,A user left negative feedback on my profile, which reads as follow:Quote[Be wary. He is adamantly and irrationally defending someone that is using the forum to manipulate a casino with fake scam accusations. I don't know what his motives are, but his arguments are definitely not in good faith.What stands out are the words \"adamantly\" and \"irrationally\". This is very ironic, given how Twitchyseal's own arguments have been out of context and proven wrong by me again & again.It all started when a newbie \"PalamarNadia\" started a scam accusation against Stake for holding their 40,000 USD, suspending their account, and how they are unable to withdraw any even though the account is in \"withdrawable\" mode.They were suspended for breaking a T&C and were accused of having multiple accounts. I found this to be very absurd since any customer can be accused of the same breach, and many users on Stake do hold multiple accounts. It only became a problem for Stake because they were in profit and not losing their money? There are many unanswered questions, which are best left to be discussed on that thread itself https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5400984.0 Then twitchyseal decided to participate in the conversation and instead of adding anything of value to the discussion, were just repeating whatever was already discussedhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5400984.msg60285215#msg60285215 (Even went on to make a comment on a video that they didn't watch or couldn't comprehend   )I requested them to read the post and the thread before making any further replies.But instead, they decided to ridicule and judge OP for being a \"newbie\", forgetting how every user is just a human and their status on a forum doesn't devoid them of justice or answers.Even went on to muddy up my character by alleging \"Were you offered any sort of compensation for successfully helping OP get paid? \"  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5400984.msg60290032#msg60290032It did upset me greatly, I recorded all of my conversation that I had outside of this forum and provided it in a Video & picture format. Not sure if Twitchseal can do the same  Up to this point, twitchyseal failed to add anything of value to the discussion, but continued to pass on judgment in their kangaroo court. So I decided to include them in my ignore list.Now today, they left negative feedback on my profile  Not sure if this is personal vengeance or a means to censor any criticism against Stake?I will leave it up to the members of this forum to decide",

Red feedback from TwitchySeal or not paid $40k to PalamarNadia?I would say that negative feedback does not end life, and only if you are behind this Nadia profile, then I understand why you are so unhappy about these $40k.About your negative feedback from TwitchySeal. (I did not read the whole discussion in this accusations, I'll take a look later)I think that is inappropriate negative feedback. here everyone should have the right to freely express their opinion, as long as it is guided by a moderate way of expression, this cannot be a reason for a negative tag. It can't be \"I don't like what you say, then I will give you red on profile\"Plus reference link does not lead to proof of \"your mistake\", but to the comment of someone completely different (forum moderator from Stake casino).",

Please don't be presumptuous. If I had anywhere near 40k, I wouldn't be asking for a loan on this forum to pay my bills and feed the cats  And about leaving the forum, I had my run here.

I have always thought of bitcointalk's DT system as the three estate hierarchy followed in Europe before the french revolution. I don't think we(the third estate) have any say about the position of users above us (or even our own position) but we can always try like the peasants' revolt of 1381 lol(it will be futile but we will get to take a shit on the queen's bed)",

This can be good feedback, for instance when someone helped you out.I think Neutral Feedback is currently undervalued on Bitcointalk. It's a great tool to de-escalate without drastic consequences. Please use it when appropriate.Quote from: theymos on January 30, 2020, 09:13:15 PMThe system is for handling trade risk, not for flagging people for good/bad posts/personalities/ideas.Quote from: examplens on June 07, 2022, 09:57:40 AMthe fact that someone has made a lot of money does not oblige him to waste it. he can spend it however he wants, this is not your or our problem.

I would say it is almost equal to \"argue in bad faith\" on all three sides PalamarNadia, edgycorner and TwitchySeal (I neglect other anti-Stake trolls from this topic).
