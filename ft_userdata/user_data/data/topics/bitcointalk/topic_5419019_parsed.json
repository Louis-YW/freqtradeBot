      "body": "Now i am with restricted access to their group because i called them scammers. They workers Coco and Cecilia blocked me from telegram to https://prnt.sc/4HVrxcSA4uMOhttps://prnt.sc/vdi6rTxhLXnVFucking pathetic scammersNever ever trust fucking chinese re-sellers like CanaanLong story short.I order 4 x Avalon Miner A1246-93T 3420W from their website paying exactly 0.32390139btc.After some hours i did some researched here and there and i found that i did terrible mistake by trusting them with my money..I was already in their Telegram so i decide to contact their admin Coco with username @cocogao on Telegram.I have send him/her screenshot from my phone with the payment confirming its me, i also provided them with my personal information, my shipping address, my order number and like everything they needed to verify me.As that was enough in that time, later i was requested to send them email requesting refund from the email i used to order which i did.Because my ledger broke few hours ago and i don't have the seed (yes i know i am dumb) i requested my refund to be done to wallet i have access to.I provided the wallet i want my refund to Coco in telegram, also send them email from the very same email i have registration on their website and everything.After i pass all their nazi checks, i've been told that they have a \"rule\" that force them to return the payment to the \"original wallet\" it was send from   I explain them that my ledger is broken, that i have no seed to access my wallet and if they return the money there, they are lost without success.After i send them again couple of emails requesting my refund to be done to wallet i have access to i was blocked from their telegram and by their admins.I have passed all their nazi checks to verify myself, requested refund to wallet i have access to and explain why the refund should not be done the the wallet i send the payment from but without success...I was \"chatting\" with Coco for several hours doing whatever she/he ask me for as requests, but seems like even that didn't help.So now they are trying to \"refund\" my bitcoins to my ledger that i have no longer access to, trying to \"clean\" their hands by \"refunding\" to wallet that no one have access to  and leave me scammed and without my money.I can understand that there could be language barrier, but there is so many free translators over internet if they don't understand English.And of course, they should understand English if they want to work with people outside of China.Seems like Canaan is scamming me and don't want to refund me after all their nazi checks and everything",

Not taking Cannan's side as I've never dealt with them but how you approached this every single merchant out there would have done the same, muting you and requiring email communication.They are sending the money back to the address you have sent them the payment, they're not taking your money so it's not really a scam, at most it's very poor customers support, but you're at fault here too, unfortunately.",

Yeah sadly hardware dies without notification. It is not my fault, and even if it was, in the end its my money right? Why i insist on a refund to new address ? Because i don't trust Canaan anymore and i want my money back ? Consider my ledger is dead, what other options i have than requesting my refund to wallet i have access to?And why you are missing the part that i passed KYC, and provided 10 other NAZI checks to verify myself?I provided things that no one else than me can provide and 1000% proof that i am myself.I respect their ToS, but at this situation, there should be solution to take my money back right? It is not like i have other options?I had few red flags before i order and i did it with shaking hands. After little bit of time, i realized my mistake and before contacting Canaan i tried everything to run my Ledge without success... Tell me what else i can do ? And how come you blaming me for asking for my own money? What's my fault here? That i am not hardware specialist to fix my ledger or not keeping my seed? Jeez..I have access to my email address and i have send them many emails, and they confirmed they have my email... What are you talking about?They even requested me to send the new refund wallet via original email i have registration on their website, i did it.I provided every single request they ask even WAY WAY more as i already said. I can provide screenshots hiding the sensitive information that i've done everything to verify myself.Going thru KYC, Sending email confirmation with new refund wallet via my original email, sending TX of the transaction, sending screenshot of the payment page while paying to them, my full infos including shipping address and everything.Excuse me but they have ALL the information from me to verify me.This is just poor customer service from their side for not understanding that there is situations that doesn't depends on the customer such as faulty hardware wallet.*I was so mad that i miss type saying i don't have access to the original email, while i was trying to say i don't have access to the original wallet.Above you can see confirmation from them for receiving email from my original email providing new refund wallet.The fact that they blocked me in private messages, banned me from the group saying many things without words...",

If you have Bitcoin with a \"bad\" history, you can't use that Bitcoin with a regulated entity. Same for regulated Bitcoin-exchanges. What is bad history is determined by chain analytics companies and includes hacks, scams, bad country, peer to peer exchange, coin joins, etc.Many people desire frangibility and claim Bitcoin to be fungible. However government regulation enforces non frangibility of Bitcoin by enforcing discrimination depending on the transaction history.",

      "body": "Ok, so, even before I read the rest of this thread and how you respond to people on this thread, and decided that you're an ass --hey, that was an honest impression I get from how you replied to them all-- I've frowned upon several things based on your opening post only, and get more and more curios as I progressed through the rest of the thread. A small tip before we begin and/or you continue with other member --me, especially-- leave your swearing and slurs elsewhere, my swear jar is currently full, I don't need your pennies overflowing it.The first thing I stumbled upon and made this forehead creased is hpw you said that Coco ignored you both on the screenshot I cropped below as well as your other screenshot timestamped 09.04-09.08. But here in between 8.56 on your previous screenshot and on the next one --09.04-- we can see the top of Coco's chat buble, which indicate they responded to you. Do you mind showing us what their reply is? I really hope it was a simple case of you tryin to point out important chats instead of selectively screenshotting chats that works in your favor.Second, I have to ask, really-really have to ask because I'm really curious and you can't seem to stress it enough: what are those 10 NAZI checks about? Was it the \"simple\" things a la KYC like your full name, DOB, govt ID., etc, or was it really-really hardcore NAZI stuff --that worth mentioning on each of your post-- like.... they asked you to verify yourself by a picture of you holding a paper signed with date and full name on your right hand while you standing with your left, a pumpkin on your bum, placed exactly at 90°, while your left and right hanging-in-the-air leg bent in a perfect shape of hakenkreuz, all the while three NAZI hippies performing blood ritual, naked and chanting in a morse code on the background? Wow, that's really serious.Third, in regards to Coco, sadly I have to side with them at this point. In spite that it IS their job to help you, I don't think anyone would appreciate being yelled scammers on so many bubbles, alongside with passive-aggresive \"do you understand me now?\" --which somewhat borderline racist--, especially because I have allocated hours trying to help you and the real solution is out of my hand because I am bound by the company refund policy. So, if I was in Coco's position, you'll be lucky I was just ignoring your chat. Unless... of course, it'll probably be a different story if the chat buble from Coco that you decide to crop turns to show otherwise. I might as well muted you from the group chat because you go ballistic there too, so yeah, maybe that's not 100% their fault.Bottomline: you dig your hole by throwing tantrum. I understand that losing 0.3btc is not a pleasant cup of coffee, and I'm really sympathetic for that, I understand that you're frustrated and scared and certainly the lack of sleep did't help, but you make matter worse for yourself by going aggresive on anyone poking their head into your snowball of mess --spoken while holding my swear jar at arm length because I don't want your horde of swears and NAZI attack filled my jar.You can't blame Canaan or anyone else to be extremely suspicious. I mean, go ask yourself, how likely is it for someone to have their ledger broken right after they made a huge transaction and asked for a refund to different wallet, and the person who goes very-very careful that they choose hardware wallet against cheap online ones somewhat forgot to backup the seeds? If I have to be honest, their reaction to raise a defense mechanism is very nice.Oh, --fourth-- speaking of ledger...Quote from: CanaanScammers on November 01, 2022, 10:31:55 AMTell me exactly, how i can grand their conditions consider i don't have access to the wallet because the ledger is dead and i don't have the seed?[...]Uhh... maybe try to fix it? Or at least troubleshoot it? https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405497678481-Follow-device-repair-instructions. Try to submerge it in a nice cup of coffee, it seems both you and your ledger needed one --ok, the last sentence is not really necessary, LOL.Quote from: CanaanScammers on November 01, 2022, 11:09:12 AMBad excuse? Yeah sadly hardware dies without notification. It is not my fault, and even if it was, in the end its my money right? Why i insist on a refund to new address ? Because i don't trust Canaan anymore and i want my money back ? Consider my ledger is dead, what other options i have than requesting my refund to wallet i have access to?[...]Fifth, and this is the last of my rambling, let me get this straight. According to your narrative so far posted here and there on this thread, you've do a research about Canaan before you decide to proceed buying from them, found so many red flags, but still decide to finalize the purchase, got cold feet, and then asked for a refund? Am I correct? Why? You have all of the red flags, and you still decide to continue, isn't that... well, theres no point on rubbing it further on you. But was it your fault? Hmm... *raised my shoulders*Now, I've never heard of Canaan before, but I am somewhat sure if a customer from any marketplace platform or whatever online store there is, requested to cancel because they finally decide to go against their initial decision, especially if that request is several hours after the deal is finalized and the fund as well as the order is already processed, the patform or seller has every right to deny the request. Them agreeing on refunding you is already a good start.Finally, Canaan Online Shop, is there anything you can do about it? Granted, you're suspicious of the request of refund because the address is not the same, refund policy, and all other things said above, but given the buyer has passed all of the verification you asked, can you do an exception this time and allow the refund to go to the designated wallet? This account of his is disposable, but you have all of his details already, I think banning him from any further transaction with you by using that info for any further purchases is a punishment enough --not that I think he'll ever want to buy anything from you anymore, anyway.If you still want conduct a further DD on his details, maybe put the fund into an escrow to hold until you're satisfied with your DD. Meanwhile, he can get less stress and more compliant because he is now sure his fund is safe and secure somewhere else.",

Of course i will screenshot EVERYTHING that doesn't include my personal detailsThere you go:https://prnt.sc/NO-2d2IOyEMNhttps://prnt.sc/UmH5FbyLHMvsThey are mad because i open scam report in bitcointalk to expose them.I consider as \"NAZI checks\" everything else than simple KYC, proof of payment.I provided things which should not be required from a customer for EXTRA verification.Some of them i passed to them just to make them even 101% sure.I've sent them screenshot of the payment from my phone, my shipping details, my email (which they have of coruse, also sent them email from my email, the one i have register there, made order and everything) and extra stuff which they know exactly what i mean.I didn't only provide EVERYTHING they need but extra from my side just to make their job easier.I am not aware how rich you are, and i don't care, but if 6000$ is small amount for you, i would like to shake your hand dude, you are doing well.For me, this money is not small amount, and as i mention before, i did the mistake to order with shaking hands and realize my mistake soon after.Now you blame me for my broken ledger saying to fix it ?  it would be more easy for me to request my refund to  wallet i have instant access to because i wanted my refund faster of course.Why would i give those scammers even 10 seconds more, consider i can request my refund legally to different wallet? I have provided them that wallet AS THEY REQUESTED via email (the same email i order and i have registration on their website).I did nothing else than grand all their requests: Proof they requested to provide NEW WALLET FOR REFUND: https://prnt.sc/iTzXfuQoCrueProof they received my email: https://prnt.sc/ENfTVxEZIOVDP.S: I did EXACTLY what they told me to, and based on Coco stupidity, because i reported them here in bitcointalk, he cannot help me...He blocked me from Telegram, and from his Telegram to send him private message...Proof i am banned on their telegram group: https://prnt.sc/q0Y2PuESEBLRTheir Telegram group is in shop.canaan.io down left corner",

How much time do you need for the final decision, whether he passed all the required checks...Yes i provided brand new wallet for the refund for the reasons above. I just created Electrum and provided them wallet for the refund.The so called \"Nazi checks\" are things that no company request from people as verification.I still have hope to receive refund, and consider i was banned from telegram for reporting them here, i am cautious what i post here because things can go even worse...If they not refund and scam me i will show everything.Video of my ledger being damaged ?  Is this some kind of new nazi check or just a joke ?Why should i provide anything else than verifying myself as the sender of the payment and providing my KYC and things that no one else could know.Please, don't rise your post count here with non-sense...This community cannot help me and i know that because scams are not moderated. I am doing this report only people to aware and they to see that their scam is exposed.They are the only people that can refund my money and based on their actions against me to silence me, and telling me \"now how i can help you\" after i reported them, making me way way more cautious so i can receive my refund and not being scammed...So please, don't post non-sense trying to make my case worst than it isThis is my money after all, if i want, i will receive them with bird over China right?I am responsible to provide valid proof that i am myself, i am the sender of the money and that's all.How i am going to receive my OWN money is my own issue. Especially consider my hardware wallet is dead",
