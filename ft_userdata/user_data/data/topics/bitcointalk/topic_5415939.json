  "content": "We are Oasis - the leading privacy-enabled, layer-1 blockchain. Our backers include Polychain, Pantera, Dragonfly & we have established partnerships with companies like Genetica, Nebula, BMW, Binance and more! Ask us anything! GREETINGS BitcoinTalkIt's the Oasis Protocol Foundation team, here to update you on our recent developments, and share our vision for the future of Oasis Network. Before we get started, weâ€™d like to introduce ourselves:William Wendt - Ecosystem Growth ManagerMeredith Darden - Community ManagerWe will be answering your questions and discussing all things Oasis for 1 hour, startingÂ 1 PM ET, on October 5thAbout OasisOasis is the leading privacy-enabled and scalable layer-1 blockchain network. It combines high throughput and low gas fees with secure architecture to provide a next-generation foundation for Web3 and will power DeFi, crypto gaming, NFTs, Metaverse, Data tokenization and Data DAOs. Oasis propels web3 forward, scaling it and evolving it from infancy to maturity. Supported by top industry backers, Oasis recently announced the $235 million Ecosystem Fund to support projects to build on the network. Oasis Labs, the ecosystem technical contributor, has partnered with the likes of Meta, BMW Group, Genetica and others, to build platforms and products that further individual privacy protection, data governance, and responsible data use. What Makes Oasis Network Unique? Scalability: The Oasis Network is multi-layered, making it highly flexible, scalable, and future-proof. The modular architecture separates consensus and smart contract execution into different layers allowing developers to deploy low-cost privacy-focused dApps. The ParaTime Layer, a layer which allows for dynamic compute environments to be built, is where all smart contract execution happens, enabling incredible scalability for the network. ParaTimes can also evolve independently while maintaining consensus as security, scalability, or privacy technologies advance into the future.Privacy-Enabled: The Oasis Network is the worldâ€™s leading scalable, privacy-enabled blockchain with its ParaTime layer enabling customizable confidentiality for developers. ParaTimes on the Oasis Network then leverage its privacy-preserving technology, enabling users to have complete control over the confidentiality of their information. With the Cipher ParaTime, developers can experience a proper Web3 environment that is privacy-first and geared towards confidentiality. Cipher supports the building of complex confidential smart contracts, opening up a world of opportunities for users who want to be in charge of their data.Sapphire is another privacy-enabled ParaTime that is the first and only confidential EVM compatible. Solidity developers now can easily switch to Web3 in an environment that is familiar with tools that are well known, and built Web3 dApps like never before.A Foundation for Web3:Oasis is working to establish itself as the foundation for the Web3 world. The core value proposition of privacy gives way to other tenants required in the next iteration of the internet. Oasis supports critical pillars like decentralized identity, decentralized society, a responsible data economy and data sovereignty through its range of privacy-preserving technologies and robust blockchain platform. Through its separation of consensus and computation into two parallel layers, Oasis is far more scalable than other blockchains and can manage many complex transactions at scale. Oasis is ideal for DeFi and GameFi due to instant finality, 99% lower gas fees versus Ethereum, high throughput, privacy protection, and defense against MEV. $ROSE is the native utility and settlement token of the Oasis Platform. We recently launched Sapphire on Testnet.The Sapphire ParaTimeÂ Sapphire is a groundbreaking developer environment as it is the first and only confidential Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible ParaTime. This runtime has the ability to help scale blockchain rapidly towards Web3 and allow EVM developers to quickly lay the foundations for privacy-enabled blockchain dApps, which are becoming a necessity as users demand data sovereignty.Sapphire offers Solidity developers a familiar, Ethereum-compatible building environment, but with the added benefits of Oasisâ€™ privacy technology which is key to allowing blockchain to be part of the Web3 world.Keep it Confidential Sapphire Hackathon With the launch of the Sapphire ParaTime on Testnet, we want to offer developers the chance to experience Web3-enabled confidentiality in a language they already know and understand.We are excited to launch ourÂ Keep it Confidential Hackathon, giving developers the chance to build the worldâ€™s first confidential DApp in Solidity. We are looking for innovative front-running resistant and privacy-first applications built on Sapphire. Join today to win up to $5,000 in ROSE for your submission:Â  https://oasisprotocol.org/hackathonDocumentation: https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/sapphire/quickstart/Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePp1fFSmKgI Â Drop your questions below, we will be answering on October 5th, from 1 PM ET to 2 PM ET.
