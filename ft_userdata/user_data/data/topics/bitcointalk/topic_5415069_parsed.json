  "content": "Today I look back with not just gladness but hope and enthusiasm because I know that tomorrow will be better.The crypto journey I started a month ago Taking the awareness of crypto and Btt forum to youths has successfully come to an end. My purpose is simply to make humanity and our society better by introducing my peers to crypto and the Btt forum to enable them to have an idea of crypto, develop knowledge in it, and also safeguard their future.The process has not been an easy one. I faced enormous challenges lecturing the youths about crypto. But still, it ended successfully, and I have helped inspire a new generation to learn about how crypto can better their lives.I am constantly on the journey of levelling up in a bid for me to become the best version of myself to help spread the awareness of crypto. Big thanks to Btt forum members for impacting, encouraging and educating me on what to know about how to succeed.",

I see crypto as the distinction of the greatness of the young generation. This is one of the traits I like doing to lecture people about crypto.Investing in people involves the risk of entrusting them with responsibility and things of value.",

The forum is always overrated and is definitely the best avenue to gain knowledge and insights about bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I’m glad OP that you never fail to see the value of this forum and even uplift it with your good words and enthusiasm learning in the forum. I hope you will continue your journey learning and sharing your experiences in crypto to others as it will always leave them inspiration and even draw them closer to the real world of bitcoin and the crypto community.",

Well, it’s not important that you have already obtained good knowledge prior to entering the bitcointalk forum, because the forum itself builds knowledge and skills that you will gained gradually through months and years staying in the forum. It’s true that experiences and through the influences from the bitcoin community helps you understand better about bitcoin, and with the support from the forum members, you will also be capable of sharing to other people what you have learned and gained in the forum.",

My advice is for to introduce them to the forum so they could also get forehand knowledge just like you have also gottenQuote from: Sanitough on September 27, 2022, 09:35:59 PM The forum is always overrated Overrated!! I think the right word you were looking for was Underrated. This forum is not getting enough recognition to the ratio of people it had/has/still impact knowledge on. The forum is an encyclopedia of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency in general",

Could be easily achieved. Sometimes, it really makes me wonder why people perceive cryptocurrency as a risky investment opportunity. I guess the entire playing field has already changed so much so that people don't anymore mind the purpose of cryptocurrencies or the real-world problems that they try to solve or whether or not they are practical. Today, cryptocurrency is seemingly treated as a new asset class in which people would choose a handful of coins or tokens out of thousands of them that they would think are the ones that would give them profit. I think this is not what cryptocurrency is.",

It can be helpful to learn more especially the techy-side, but you're not really \"obliged\" to learn those. One could be a trader and could have know a little or two about the technical side and surely that would suffice him already since his niche is primarily trading.If you're going for software dev though, well of course you need to learn that.",

My teachings to the young generation have made me understand that many people are eager to learn new things each day in an easy way without being scolded when they make a terrible mistake. Most of those whom I teach on how they will learn the most important values and useful things in life mostly want me to do so \"nicely''.  Which I always do though.Many are just looking for pampering and not particularly seeking to learn.Taking medicine doesn't feel good taken but it makes you get well.
