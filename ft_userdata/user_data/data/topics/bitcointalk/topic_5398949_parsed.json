  "content": "After talking about Anonymous UTXO consolidation through LN a few months ago, I'd like to hear a few opinions about consolidation of (traditionally) mixed outputs.With this I mean mixing through ChipMixer, CoinJoin, JoinMarket and the like.I pondered on this a bit and I see a few reasons for and against it. Some questions seem trivial or silly, but I'm just trying to give food for thought and discussion. [1] Firstly, if you're looking to consolidate many small inputs, you could send everything to the mixer 1 input at a time. This way you won't link them when sending.Next, send all the mixed, anonymous outputs to one address in one transaction.It should be reasonably secure except from one aspect which is tracing wallet sizes. However if the inputs weren't linked to each other before mixing, it should be fine, right?[2] If you perform a UTXO mix on ChipMixer and don't want to end up with many little UTXOs, you may consider doing one transaction that bundles all those output chips into one fresh UTXO.Since chips can be chosen in relatively large sizes, I don't think that having too many little output chips is really a realistic risk, so best would be to just make them large enough and withdraw each one to a fresh new address?[3] Consolidating change. As we all know, using a common change address is one big privacy risk in Bitcoin. However if you deal with mixed coins and separate change addresses, you're generally speaking fine; but you quickly rack up a lot of 'change UTXOs' that you will sooner or later need to join together. Is it a good idea to individually mix change UTXOs and then join them, what do you think?By the way, if you want to get notified about low mempool fees to consolidate small inputs, this is the thread to watch: [May 2022] Mempool empty! Use this opportunity to Consolidate your small inputs!",

But, if I just mix all of my change in one transaction, I don't think it's so bad. Making it official that I'm the owner of those UTXO's doesn't harm much, and you've pretty much already known it.Of course, if they appear to be a lot, then you might not want to reveal you own that much money. In any case, it's better to split your inputs in several transactions.",

      "body": "The best thing you can do is not create change at all. This was very easy to do when ChipMixer was launched and Bitcoin was ~$1,500, since the smallest chip - 0.001 BTC - was only worth around $1.50. So any payment you wanted to make you could round up to the nearest $1.50, have no change output, and not really mind paying an extra buck (or just add the extra on to the fee). Now that 0.001 BTC is worth $30 or more, then it isn't so economical.You can still avoid creating change outputs with careful UTXO selection. Or instead of rounding up your payment as described above, round up your basket - throw in a couple more cans of beer or an extra month subscription or whatever else you were buying to bring the total up to whatever UTXO you have available so you can avoid creating change. Or just let the merchant keep the rest as a tip. Other options are merchants which will let you open an account or tab with them, top up that account with any amount, and then spend from your available balance.The way that I deal with the change I do create is usually via ChipMixer, because I find it more economical than trying to coinjoin lots of small change outputs. If I already have some bitcoin stored on ChipMixer under a voucher, then I can just add any change in to that same stack to better hide it. So if, for example, I have 0.012 BTC in a voucher on ChipMixer, than after a couple of small change deposits I can withdraw a 0.016 chip, which prevents them being linked from people looking at individual sizes as you suggest.If I ever have to deal with any really small change outputs, I usually just fire them off to the donation address of something like Tor, Tails, EFF, etc.",

Rather than trying to consolidate 5 addresses with 10$ worth to pay for a subscription, I would rather break in 5 a 500$ one and use one of the fractions.That being said I do have a ton of \"dust\" in my wallets but I've always postponed any consolidation simply because at this point one screwup and years of mixing have been for nothing, so I'll just let it sit there till I can buy a house with the change from a protonvpn payment",

That some anonymous person used a particular mixing service several times and later decided to mix their funds again but in a single transaction, in my view, doesn't tell much because it is still unknown to an observer where funds have landed up after a final mixing round. The thing is UTXO consolidation always involves certain trade-offs, but sending everything (mixed outputs) in a single transaction is at least less time-consuming and, more importantly, a lot less block space-consuming. Please note that I was talking about a specific case in which you are using the same mixing service both for the obfuscation of your inputs and their subsequent consolidation. If your inputs are from completely different sources (Wasabi, JoinMarket, Whirlpool, Chipmixer, Mercury, etc), then it definitely makes more sense to send them one by one to a mixing service before consolidating them.",

Sending multiple outputs to a single CM mix, individually, will keep them completely unlinked, right? If they're below the minimum of 0.001, I guess you could 'LN mix them' and then send to CM afterwards. It may be less secure and whatnot, but if you can't afford to just throw away 30 bucks it may be an option.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 17, 2022, 08:29:17 AMIf I ever have to deal with any really small change outputs, I usually just fire them off to the donation address of something like Tor, Tails, EFF, etc.That's pretty cool; but I wonder how long it will be sustainable; 0.001BTC might be well over 100$ in the future; in some countries like Colombia, BTC0.001 is already over 100k of their home currency COP.

I would withdraw a 0.016, 0.004, and 0.001 chip, pay the merchant 0.021 BTC (not minding that I just overspent by 50 cents or so) and leave the other 0.079 BTC on ChipMixer as a voucher until I next needed it. No change created. But as I said before, this isn't really economical anymore since the lost 50 cents in this example is now ~$10.Quote from: n0nce on May 17, 2022, 11:22:30 AMI tried to bring this idea up but wasn't sure how to correctly phrase it. Sending multiple outputs to a single CM mix, individually, will keep them completely unlinked, right?Well, a single ChipMixer session provides a single deposit address, so no, it would link all the outputs. The way to do it is to deposit any UTXOs you don't mind being linked in a single session, withdraw a voucher for the total amount of your deposit, and then destroy that session. Repeat with another sessions with another set of UTXOs and withdraw another voucher. Repeat as many times as necessary - you can do as little as one deposit per session if you want (bearing in mind the minimum deposit limits). Once you have multiple vouchers, you can open yet another new session and combine all the vouchers together, and then make a single large withdrawal.",

I know Bitrefill give new address for each purchase, but i don't remember whether they also give new address for each deposit.Yes they do. I just tried it, sent BTC to the given address and as soon as it was confirmed and I went back there was a new deposit address.And even if there is an 'upper limit' of the addresses they will give you all you need is another email and you can start the process again. Perhaps not the best or even an ideal way of doing things but it does work.EDIT TO ADD: If you do use the referral link in the post above and make a qualifying purchase I will know what email address you signed up with, no way of tying it back to you but wanted to put it out there.Although LeoRockz@aol.com might point back to someone :-)-Dave",

Let's say I'm a merchant and you pay me some BTC; I can look at the change address and see other deposits. I can follow the transactions of these deposits and see that you also sent BTC to other (known or unknown) addresses; which could be exchanges (authorities can call them and ask 'who is the human behind address X'), stores or friends of yours that I now know you have some sort of connection to.True, but doesn't this answer on why you shouldn't keep change at all? As said by Leo above, whenever you're going to have a decent change left over from a transaction, send them to ChipMixer instead. Or, if you're thinking of buying in bulk, make your purchase and send the rest to ChipMixer. What I said is: If you have change in x outputs, which are essentially linked from your previous transactions, it doesn't matter that much to broadcast 1 transaction where you spend them all, or x transactions where you spend 1 in each. Oh, the issue with this is that I assumed the change doesn't all land in the same address. I'm not sure if there's a standard way; as far as I know, change is handled a bit differently from one wallet to another.Quote from: witcher_sense on May 17, 2022, 12:02:06 PMQuote from: DaveF on May 17, 2022, 11:40:13 AM<…>The biggest downside of this method is that your account may be frozen after you made a deposit and you will no longer be able to withdraw your funds or consolidate them unless by sacrificing your privacy by providing your real identity. If you still consider exchanges a means to merge your small inputs, a simpler solution would be using a nice bitcoin-only gambling website like bustadice where, as you said, you need nothing but an email address to sign up and where it is highly unlikely that you will be asked for documents. If you like, you can gamble with part of the funds to further obscure the link between your initial amount and your withdrawal amount.Well, those gambling sites could also close your account, though. So I see no benefit there; the moment you use a centralized party, there is going to be some risk involved.Quote from: DaveF on May 17, 2022, 12:22:07 PMAlso, and since I do like the service you can use Bitrefill and buy gift cards if it's available where you are located.~ snip ~I really like this idea; these gift cards come in handy anyway from time to time; even as a small birthday gift or simply to purchase something on Amazon. I've only used the service through Lightning so far and didn't know you can also create an account and top it up little by little.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 17, 2022, 01:10:02 PMQuote from: n0nce on May 17, 2022, 11:22:30 AMSo you just got tons of 0.001BTC chips from ChipMixer and used them in full when paying something? Wouldn't that make for pretty large (and expensive) transactions? Or would you create and withdraw appropriately sized chips / UTXOs on the spot?Let's say I deposited 0.1 BTC to ChipMixer. I then wanted to pay for something which was 0.0207 BTC.

No change created. But as I said before, this isn't really economical anymore since the lost 50 cents in this example is now ~$10.This implies you fully entrust those remaining 0.079 BTC to CM though; not that I'd ever doubt them, but in general I try to minimize such trust. It could be that there is a problem with the website and I can't access it right when I need to or similar sorts of issues, but otherwise it seems like a viable option if the Bitcoin price was a bit lower or the smallest chip size was reduced.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 17, 2022, 01:10:02 PMQuote from: n0nce on May 17, 2022, 11:22:30 AMI tried to bring this idea up but wasn't sure how to correctly phrase it.

You'll maybe pay a bit more though, since every time you create a new session and deposit some coins, they'll be 'truncated' to 0.001 amounts, right?Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 17, 2022, 01:42:48 PMQuote from: DaveF on May 17, 2022, 01:28:50 PMAlthough LeoRockz@aol.com might point back to someone :-)Drat!
