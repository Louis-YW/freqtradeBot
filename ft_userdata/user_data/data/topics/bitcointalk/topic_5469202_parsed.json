The withdrawal fees varies and depends on the cryptocurrency you are withdrawing. I have attached here the link to the breakdown of Bitget withdrawal fees for various crypto assets. I hope this helps.",

I guess you are moving funds from bitget because they have made KYC mandatory:If you first want to test the withdrawals and the minimum withdrawal shown to you is 10 dollars, then why not test with 10 dollars? 10 dollars is not a big amount in case you have a lot of dollars (in any cryptocurrencies).",

Then, he should be advised to keep or move funds to off Exchange wallet as a safe practice to adopt and not because of the exchange implementing KYC in compliance to Regulatory requirements.

In this case, one month is more than enough for me to either withdraw my assets or even go through with the KYC lol. I certainly won't wait a whole 6 months to do that.",
