  "content": "Many of you must have benefited from early hodlings, but don't forget what the bitcoin vision was all about. If you only want to invest in bitcoin to make profits, you need to read the whitepaper again, as it's for your own financial freedom. Bitcoin was designed and created to enable P2P electronic transactions and for financial freedom. It was designed for you to unbank the bank and be your own bank.Bitcoin is backed by proof-of-work (PoW) and mathematics (difficult computations), whereas Fiat is backed by faith, propaganda, the government, and printers; one is under control, the other is not. Now choose wisely.Bitcoin cannot be censored, despite bitcoin ban in China, Bangladesh, Morocco, Algeria etc. their citizens continue to trade and mine BTC.Every Bitcoin Purchased is a vote for decentralization, now tell me have you voted this moth?",

Where will you buy bitcoin from if no one sells? I just have two points;1. Bitcoin is an investment, when you sell bitcoins for fiat, you’re not getting the same value you initially bought at but a higher value. 2. Bitcoin is a currency, we are supposed to use bitcoins as payment for transactions same way we do with fiat. If we all decide to hodl and stack more sats, isn’t that a vote against bitcoin adoption?",

Just look at what I will quoted and check what you have replied to other forum members. I am sure you will explain this for us to understand what you are trying to express here in this forum about Bitcoin.Quote from: borovichok on April 06, 2023, 11:12:07 PMBitcoin cannot be censored, despite bitcoin ban in China, Bangladesh, Morocco, Algeria etc. their citizens continue to trade and mine BTC.How will those people get their money to buy groceries, vegetables, meat when their country banned Bitcoin. Answer: To sell it. Right? And yet check your reply below Quote from: borovichok on April 07, 2023, 12:18:07 PMEvery sale has a negative impact on Bitcoin, so why are you selling? To get back your fiat? Bitcoin can do everything that fiat can, so why are you selling instead of stacking more Satoshi?Not all country have supported or didn't ban Bitcoin and even use it as one of the payment method. In my case, how can I buy vegetables, meat in a public market where the vendors didn't even know about Bitcoin You can say that they are like farmers in mountain who doesn't know what Crypto is and they only accept fiat for whatever they sell in the market. One more thing, those people who are in a country where Bitcoin is banned must sell their Bitcoin and that's where other people bought if they want to buy more BTC. What will be the solution if selling have negative impact?.Quote from: borovichok on April 06, 2023, 11:12:07 PMEvery Bitcoin Purchased is a vote for decentralization, now tell me have you voted this moth?And every Bitcoin purchased are sold by someone which means they are selling which as you have said have negative impact on Bitcoin. Are you proposing that we should hodl and never sell just as what Satoprincess asked?.",

This okays the use or adoption of a decentralized bank that is almost as stable as fiat. It is a vote in a positive light.",

And that the outcome of the vote is close to zero, because every purchased bitcoin is also sold?Every sale has a negative impact on Bitcoin, so why are you selling? To get back your fiat? If there is no one selling then the market will stagnate.  It will be more devastating than reducing the price of Bitcoin in the market.  Remember, there will be no active trading or market if there is no supply.  It is also the same as hoarding goods to make an artificial inflation of prices in the market.  So selling in market activity is normal and healthy, even the occasional dumping and price crash also helps the bitcoin market to let new investors and allow a window for re-entry.Quote from: borovichok on April 07, 2023, 12:18:07 PMBitcoin can do everything that fiat can, so why are you selling instead of stacking more Satoshi?One major reason why people convert Bitcoin to fiat because of the absence of Bitcoin merchants or store that accept Bitcoin.  You cannot pay a store that is not accepting Bitcoin with Bitcoin, can you?  It is a no brainer.Quote from: Despairo on April 08, 2023, 03:41:29 AMDo you think most of countries in this world accepting Bitcoin as a currency? only 2 countries right now accepting Bitcoin as a currency, while most of them accepting Bitcoin as a commodity, some of them ban Bitcoin completely.

If you just buy it and then leave it on centralized exchanges in order to resell in a few months or year then you didn't really do anything for decentralization. If you buy Bitcoin, store it by yourself and use it whenever you can then this can be seen as a vote for decentralization.",
