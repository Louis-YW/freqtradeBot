      "body": "I have tried several promotions in different casinos but what I truly enjoy are Tournaments and Competitions with certain conditions in mind. First , I prefer competitions that aren't only determined by who wagers the most money because it basically favors those who already have a significant amount of money. For exemple, someone with a million dollars wouldn't be thrilled to win just $1,000 or even less.Secondly, competitions offering prizes that require you to wager them 10x or more don't feel like true prizes to me, but kind of a deposit bonus that you will have to risk even more.Tournaments and competitions create good competition among players and aren't solely reliant on luck or the size of funds someone has. They often require strategies, good thinking and there are various types, including sports betting and achieving the highest multiplier….etc",

      "body": "I voted for Cashback offers. It will be interesting to see what will it be, I like to see more of daily cashbacks and obviously big % too. Specially this is good if let's say that you are in a losing streak and doesn't want to deposit more money. So in turn you can used this cashbacks to at least continue to have your gambling session and see if it can break your streak or not.Of course, there are some minimum amounts that you have to deposit before you could take advantage of it. But I guess if you are really into gambling, casinos should have this kind of promotions to give back to their customers and so that they will continue to play on their platform with this cashback promotions.",

      "body": "QuoteWelcome BonusesMost of the time, welcome bonuses is the same as deposit bonus where players need to make deposit in order to take the welcome bonus. It comes with high wagering requirement as well, so as a gambler, I will not consider welcome bonuses as a good bonus.QuoteFree Spins   Depending on what kind of free spins and its wagering requirement. Is it free spins with deposit requirement or is it free spins that given to players after the players wager specific amount or is it a completely free spins given to players without deposit? QuoteReload BonusesThis one is usually the same as deposit bonus, I do not think it is good bonus as well. QuoteCashback OffersAs small player I will prefer to get rakeback than cashback, because rakeback is counted based on how much I have wagered while cashback is usually based on how much I've lost. QuoteLoyalty ProgramsToo many type of loyalty programs, and above mentioned bonuses can be under loyalty program. What kind of loyalty program you are referring to? QuoteTournaments and CompetitionsAgain it is depending on what kind of tournament or competition you are referring to but you as owner of a casino should provide regular tournaments such as wagering contest, multiplier contest or any other contest to give a reason for your players to stay as long as possible in your casino.",

I don't know if it is a psychological thing, but I tend to be too reckless with bonuses and easily waste them away without any form of caution. Therefore, my choice is loyalty programs. With a loyalty program in place, there will always be incentives for joining and helping the online casino grow. It gives a sense of ownership because if the casino succeeds, the users will, so it is a win-win for everybody.",

But I don't know of a casino that will allow you withdraw bonus that they gave to you either as a new comer to taste and wager or spin to have a feel of how it is with your real deposit.That is what I like about bonus, it helps you taste the casino website to navigate around it and really I like when the bonus wager is not limited to just certain areas.",

So a lot of people will be dazzled by a welcome bonus like that. I just can't remember which online casino I saw that at.",

      "body": "Cashback offers are definitely my choice. Welcome bonuses can be received only once but cashback offers or rakeback will be there forever as long as you can keep on gambling and wager. There are times that I only use $10 but I can make a wager up to $100 - $200. I know in cashback you can only get a small percentage of the wagered amount but still that is free money after enjoying yourself at any game that you played. If a gambler could somehow lengthen his playing time by not losing then he will probably get more in the cashback system although I doubt that will happen. Anyway, it's still a good thing that we can receive money from just playing around and it's a win-win situation for both small bettors and big ones unlike other promotions that is only relying in how much was deposited.",

I'm also sure everyone has different views of course so this thread will be full of many variations of what they are interested in from casino promotions and it's not always the same.",
