If the rate is good with USDT and you’re ok with it then I think you are on the right path beside you’re more safe from this bear market. I can suggest that make sure you can get that USDT anytime and if you see opportunity, its better to convert it into BTC than to another Stablecoin.",

But for ling term holding, i don't think it's a reliable method to stake your savings using one of the stable coins because of some few reasons :- How you guarantee that those stable coins are safe for long run ?- Based on what you may chose this stable coin or another ?- What's the difference between using any of them and using any other form of Fiat money ?- Some of them are backed by real dollars money, then what forbids you to use dollar itself ? Isn't much more safer ?Holding in cryptocurrencies means investment by staking. Using a stable coin for long term investment staking seems to me like no sense .",

These days people didn't even care about what kind of stable token as long as they can secure their assets. i think that if still holding your USDT was a very good choice for now.

But off course the decision is up to you, however from my perspective with the volume and asset treasure (USDT are not gonna to de-pegg).Amongst all stable coins, USDT is the oldest stable coin and it has proven its strength through many drama, attacks. I hope this time, in the massive attack on stable coins, USDT will show its strength again.Anyway, if the OP is really worrying about USDT and risk of depeg, why does OP have to consider about USDC?It is a bit stupid my opinion, why we have to move from oldest, safest, strongest stable coin to alternative?If we are worry about stablecoin, we should cash it out, and switch to USD. When all the attack completes, we can switch USD to USDT again. It is better and safer approach.",
