The altcoins are also rising and if you believe some altcoins will have adoption like ETH or BNB then it's your option to buy.Just like gambling, however, high risk and high rewards. You invest so you gamble your way because there are also altcoins that don't move an inch. Picking the top ones is what they advice.",

      "body": "Why people are always interested in altcoins?Some people believe that they have the potential to increase in value over time, similar to how Bitcoin has risen in value since its creation. Others may be drawn to the technology or features of a specific altcoin, such as faster transaction times or increased privacy. Additionally, some people may buy altcoins as a way to diversify their investment portfolio, similar to how they might invest in different stocks or other assets. I hope this helps",

If I remember correctly some $SHIB OGs only bought their holdings for a couple of hundreds worth of dollars and turned it into millions worth when that shitcoin pumped. Although, this isn't always the case as thousands of alts/shitcoins are also prone to drastic decline in value especially when the hype for it is over and people started dumping whatever they can into the market.",

Profitability.Profit is surely a main motive here. But there are people who believe in it's future and innovations. Bitcoin surely would remain dominant for years to come but they won't always be in the top. As market adapts to changing economy, people would start looking for use case and efficiency on running the network. Both of which, bitcoin fails to modern currencies. I personally still has larger portion of my portfolio on bitcoin but I'm always exploring from promising new coins which could be the future.",

People's mistakes are being too greedy to put their trust in altcoins or being too hasty with the ambition to get rich quickly and forget about the risks they face. I like to invest in altcoins because of their returns but since it's too risky I wouldn't put too much money in them and never put it all in altcoins.",

In fact, it was not also advisable to just invest in Bitcoin alone, investing in good altcoins is also profitable. It can't be denied that many people have gained a lot of profit from investing in hyped projects, they got too lucky about it and people got interested in doing this. As long as you are not investing dead coins, that is still fine. Along with my Bitcoin, I have BNB and ETH in my wallet and plan to add some someday when the market had recovered.

Many altcoins had been pumping when ICO made a good run on the cryptocurrency industry. I did experience it myself when one of my supported altcoins hit the biggest price on the market. Because of that, I made some good profits and invested it in real estate, for myself and my family.

I don't see anything wrong with investing in altcoins, as long as you know what you're doing with your money, you can invest it wherever you think is right for you.Advice to invest in bitcoin and stay away from altcoins there is nothing wrong as people wanting you to be safe, but the decision is up to you as no one will give you any profit, you have to make it yourself, so the decision is in you.",

Don't forget with altcoin have huge risk, actually huge return will having huge risk due many time altcoin price drop drastically. Talking about long term investing in altcoin have huge potential profit after seeing many altcoin price drop under $1 last several years and today have been reached above $50 until $100. But many time wrong choose when investing in altcoin after few days price pump and lately drop drastically until potential delist on market.",
