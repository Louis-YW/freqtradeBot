But to stay in their house, a little more (around €32.000 more) is still needed, so it's still open for donations.Quoted from the article in \"Noordhollands Dagblad\":QuoteZijn familie is nu een inzamelingsactie gestart. Doel is om vijftigduizend euro op te halen. ’Joeri was de enige kostwinner van zijn jonge gezin. Joeri heeft twee jonge meisjes die voor de rest van hun leven zonder hun vader moeten. We zullen als familie er alles aan doen om te zorgen dat zijn vrouw opgevangen wordt, financieel geholpen wordt, en wordt bijgestaan in iedere stap van dit gruwelijke verwerkingsproces’, aldus de tekst bij de inzamelingsactie.translated:QuoteHis family has now started a fundraising campaign. The goal is to raise fifty thousand euros. 'Yuri was the sole breadwinner of his young family. Joeri has two young girls who have to live without their father for the rest of their lives. As a family, we will do everything we can to ensure that his wife is taken care of, is helped financially, and is assisted in every step of this gruesome recovery process,\" says the text of the fundraising campaign.I don't expect to find donations on a forum where everyone is pretty much anonymous but every Euro counts...",

For a previous forum member I suppose it would be logical but I imagine that the wife or the person who organized the gofundme may not have a clue. The goal is €50,000But you're probably right, for a lot of people bitcoin and crypto is still very vague and unknown.I imagine GoFundMe has, in some way, have to make sure they know where donations are coming from, so an anonymous currency doesn't really work out that well. Donation under €2,240 (per donor) are tax-exempted in The Netherlands, so as long as each individual donor stays under that amount, the receiver doesn't have to pay taxes. Over €2,240 it's 30% iirc.----Quote from: Eternad on September 16, 2023, 10:47:52 AMI remember that he manage one campaign here before that offers highest rate among all campaign's except Chipmixer.

Glad that you share this here so that his account can be preserved against hacker that might hack and sold it to new user. A new user can impersonate the old owner if ever you didn’t brought up this thread.RIP to manager Joerii. Done donating using google pay. It's that the site doesn't reflect immediately my donation despite its already charge on my visa card. I hope this platform accept crypto tho.",

Just earning his money, being creative with a team of people (see first link in opening post).And right now, nobody is earning the money for his family.For me, it's pretty much the same, crypto didn't make me rich but it got me into a job I wouldn't be in without the existence of crypto.",
