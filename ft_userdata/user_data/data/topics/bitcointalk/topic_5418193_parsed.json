  "content": "I've been living with my girlfriend for the past few years. We go to the supermarket for groceries 2-4 times per week, depending on our purchases and needs. I'm generally careful when picking items that will be consumed and not expire or go bad in my fridge and avoid going on a junk food shopping spree because not only is it a huge waste of money, but also because eating junk has no nutritional benefits.My largest issue, however, is that I'm constantly finding myself throwing out food. It's not that we're making excessive purchases during our supermarket trips, it's just poor food management. I don't know what to call it. We'll buy a few apples, eat one or two the first two days, and then completely forget about the rest until they get bad and are thrown away. This is way more common when buying marmalade, toasts, and drinks in general. We're literally throwing a bag full of groceries at least once a month or two. Not only is it a shame, but it also costs too much money, especially in our day and age.The worst part about food waste, though, is not the one occurring from individual consumers but from businesses such as hotels or supermarkets. Until recently, I was working for a large supermarket chain, you can't imagine how much perfectly good-to-eat food and supplies were thrown away either because they didn't look good for the customers or had damaged packaging. It's heartbreaking. If only such organizations bothered to give away these products to people and institutions.How would you deal with food waste on a personal level, and what other action should be taken from businesses in order to reduce food waste? Do you have any tips you use? I can't see any more food expiring in my fridge, it's a huge waste of resources.",

But generally, I try to be frugal and not purchase in huge quantities or buy products in large packaging, because most of the time, it'll simply go bad before it's consumed. I'm trying to limit junk food by switching to salads and fruits. Chocolates, chips, or bars because they are nutritionally worthless. They only provide you with a sugar boost, and that's it. Not only that, but a bag of chips costs something like €1.50-€1.50 and is consumed in a matter of minutes. I'd rather buy a few apples or bananas that'll get me going for a day or two.Quote from: suchmoon on October 24, 2022, 09:39:53 PMQuote from: Ultegra134 on October 24, 2022, 07:01:32 PMWe go to the supermarket for groceries 2-4 times per weekThat seems a bit excessive... once a week is the best I can manage As far as advice, I don't think there is any magic in it, just takes a bit of planning and discipline - track what you typically consume and buy only as much perishable food as you will need until the next trip to the store.

To each their own I guess.Hmm, maybe I'm over exaggerating, but it's at least 2 times per week, maybe even 3. I tend to purchase only a few things at once, those that I only currently need. Knowing myself (and my girlfriend) if we buy a ton of food, there's a good chance that some of it will end up in the bin. I don't have the tendency to leave food on my plate, but once in a while, there will be leftovers that'll be forgotten about and thrown away. It's sad.",

It just pisses me off, when I had to go to supermarket, spend time in lines, carry those bags home, and then throw some food away, while there are people who are starving. Usually every 2-3 week I make a visit to fridge and food shelves to check what is close to due date, to throw it away. I just dont like all those open bags, cans, cut vegetables and fruits and etc. I just dont like to open fridge, see that it is full, but never find anything tasty  Sort of full, but nothing to eat. We have stopped bulk buying, but still I notice that a lot of food is thrown away. Like we are lazy to finish it, or producers make packages so huge, that it is impossible to finish it until you are full or it is spoiled. I would gladly hear some food management advices",

      "body": "It is good we understand our daily consumption rate and shop towards that. Make a list of what you consume everyday that are perishable,for instance If you always eat one apple a day and you go to the grocery thrice a week,mathematically you can buy two  apples per shopping and on the last day of the week you buy three apples demanding on your space interval. Three times is even much at least once a week, write the budget of the items on the list and make sure you know the quantity you will need. Non perishable items can be  preserved for a long time so this don't implies to them.When cooking,have a measuring material that you use in measuring the quantity of whatever you want to cook,so that you don't cook too much or too small because you know your gauge,so that it can be consumed immediately. I was also wasting food but when,I practised this,it got limitedAs for the hotels,they will have waste because they can't know how many customers will becoming to buy on that day. Sometimes when they cook,it might finish fast before closing time and you will see that instead of the hotel to close, they will cook more food to be able to meet up with demand of customers,this can also lead to waste and sometimes they cook more what the customers will consume on that day.",

Fresh produce should be bought in fewer quantities, and donating leftover food might be considered.World hunger isn't a problem that involves an actual lack of food supply. Most people waste food they get in the developed world. It's a matter of logistics/transportation and storage. Freeze drying is a method I've come across over the last years that dehydrates the food and extends shelf life up to decades. Not all food can be freeze dried, but it's something to consider.And hey, in the event of global apocalypse, you'll at least have plenty of food",

So there would be no apprehension of things getting wasted. Secondly, what I use the policy is FIFO (First thing, first out), which means if you have bought any new items, please consume the previous one on a priority basis, and if you are not willing to use it, please give it to any needy or homeless person before it gets expired. Finally, it would be helpful to feed those who don't have money to buy food for themselves and their families.",
