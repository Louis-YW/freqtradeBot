That's the reason while not as many who is a trader comes out of the market with profit, so trading is a skill and your profit comes from your ability of understanding the possible risk's involves in trading.",

If the market is boring, it's no task for traders. They can hang out, fishing, playing whatever things to refresh their body and mind.If the market does not have waves, don't trade. When it has waves, you can start to trade but it is not true to say a profitable trading season because a market has its zero sum game. If you are winner, others are losers in a same market.In a same season, it is a profitable trading season for some traders but it is a lost trading season for others.",

The market trend can help a trader, but no good time for a good trader, they trade during bear and bull market and they make money from it if they are good enough not to make losses instead. If you trade and lose, better to stop trading at that time and wait for next time to let the right mindset to set in you before trading. Profit can be usual, but losses can be at anytime.Quote from: Wiwo on February 21, 2023, 10:42:49 PMseason you mean lucky days, if that is what the ops mean then the answer is yes, in trading we have our lucky days where the market just moves in your favour but to state the exact time and period when that will happen is unpredictable so at that, we can't say the is a specific season that could be call trading season. Never mind I will use gambling as an example, if you gamble and you are an addict, you will have lucky days, but addicts have losses than making profits. Trading is different from gambling, but many traders are like gamblers, while many learn but still losing than making profit. It is not about lucky days but about being a good trader.Quote from: GreatArkansas on February 21, 2023, 10:42:49 PMFor me, if you are a good trader, wether it's a bear market or a bull market you can make profits.Exactly.",

No trading season and I'd like to say it as gambling trading season. With such gambling trading season, there are more trading volume, more gambling traders actively buy and sell on the market but trade, they don't trade, just gamble.",

Another thing is that trading isn't only dependent on luck but it can mainly be based on skills and knowledge of a trader.Maybe his friend is only just a newbie with it and he blindly trades while for those who are already a pro at it. They can always make a profit no matter what is the status of the market is. If his friend only says that there is a season in the crypto market or in investing then that would be more valid because there are actually and that is none other than the bears and bulls season.",

When the price of coins can increase little by little, the profit season arrives; at that time, we can start to benefit from trading many potential coins. But this season is not always shown by the market conditions that turn around because even though the current market conditions can begin to increase, we still often encounter the price of coins, and sometimes the correction can be too deep.

The meaning of profit season can be hella elusive and depends on who you ask, but for me, it's when I'm making bank consistently over a reasonable period. It's not just about timing the market right, you gotta get creativee with your approach to trading. Being creativee means looking at different strategies, learning from past mistakes, and stayin open to new ideas. And lets not forget to have a sense of humor, 'cause somtimes the market can be a real jester, ya feel me?For example, I came up with this dope-ass idea to buy a fat stack of a new coinn with fire tech that nobody was payin attention to 'cause it wasnt in the top 100. I held that bad boy for months, and when it got listed on a top exchange, the price went straight to the moon, and I made mad profit. It wasnt nothin I learned from a book or a seminar, just a uniqe and creativee idea that hit me outta nowhere. So, my advice to all my fellow traders is to get creative, learn from yur losses, and have funn with it. Tradin aint just a science, it's an art that requires a mix of skill, creativity, and straight-up luck.",

So if you stay in the crypto trading field you can understand this. For example, after a long silence, bitcoin goes up 20-30%, which means there is a big chance that other cryptos also follow bitcoin and try to grow up. In this period if you can catch some potential coin like ETH and another high-ranked crypto, you could be a winner. But you must have to pick it up at the right time. On the other sometimes we see the market just grow up. Don't follow any news, don't follow any analytics just grow up. For example, we have seen it during 2017-2018. This generally comes after a few years. And tbh the more days are going it's very hard to get a bullish market like past. So it's very hard to identify the season.",
