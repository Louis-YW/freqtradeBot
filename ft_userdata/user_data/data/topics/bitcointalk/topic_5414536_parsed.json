And with this strategy and partnership that Opera has done, this may increase the traffic that will come from their browser as many are now looking for those rewards even they're not that a lot but as long a there's a way to monetize it and also, that web3 adoption that they'll promote is timely.",

At least people will be curious about what Elrond is which might in the end make them curious about crypto currencies.

Is it because of browser integrated the blockchain service? Or is it because you think it is going to be hyped? If it is anyone of those reasons, then I doubt it is a good project.",

After releasing crypto browser on Mac, windows and android operating systems, this year they also released a crypto browser with the built-in non-custodial wallet for IOS operating system.

But I haven't seen how successful it is though.So I guess including Elrond blockchain in their wallet is a good thing. Of course, it doesn't mean that they will have the advantage on the raise for web browsers as Google still takes the lion share. But at least crypto enthusiast might shift to them because of this news specially for Elrond investors and supporters.",

So, I doubt there will be considerable affect of a regular user that is being interested in it.It looks like Opera did build a new search application for the Crypto community - Opera Crypto- In fact they created an Opera Crypto twitter account, not combining it with the main Opera twitter account.This cooperation does not benefit only one party. Opera can get new users from the crypto community and retain their users who are in the crypto community. And Crypto can also get new users/communities of more than 300 million from Opera users. this is because Opera will introduce their new features to their users.",

Although this is a well-done Opera integration, to be honest, it adds a lot of confidence to crypto enthusiasts.",

Most of the browser support web3 wallets such as metamask that supports multiple blockchain already which means web3 is already mass adapted even with this opera browser news. There’s also few users that using this browser so I doubt this will really give a big impact.",

Opera is one of the best browsers with many users, so far they have more than 300 million users. Maybe soon we will see a new wave of crypto adopters coming from the Opera Browser. Even though Opera has only 2.2% of Worldwide Browser Market Share data, it's worth more than nothing. What we need now is to spread public awareness regarding the Web3, moving from small things first, doesn't seem like a problem.",

But it doesn't seem as popular as how the browser user community uses it. Because the level of Google users covered the movement of Opera until now. People will find it easier and know where Google is easily accessible, it's not much different from Opera, it's just that looking at Opera's prospects seems to have shifted its position among internet users.",
