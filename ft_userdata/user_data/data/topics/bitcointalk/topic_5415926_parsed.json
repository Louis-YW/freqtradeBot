The difference with stock markets is that they're international and there's always a bull market out there (even if not with shares than with forex which has most pairs in both directions).The main trading blocks the US fed focuses on seem to be US, EU, UK and Asia, one of those is often bullish while the others are bearish unless an international event happens like the last 2008 financial crisis - in which case a lot of areas of commodities like gold, land and food start to enter bull markets instead as money that's able to be withdrawn needs to go somewhere providing the rate is good.",

But if the cryptocurrency market goes down 50% people will sell their house to buy bitcoin or some crypto which they think is very profitable in the future.and the cryptocurrency market differs from the stock market in that it is much less regulated, whereas there are no rules or regulations governing how it works, which means that anyone can buy and sell cryptocurrencies as they please.it also means that the cryptocurrency market is much more volatile than the stock market because prices can go up and down very quickly, and this is the beauty that investors especially whales can take advantage of.",

Because due to fear of loss small investors worried about their capital and this is a big mistake not taking risks. I think one important factor to indicate is that the stock market is heavily regulated- where you can only trade at specific hours and tax becomes a factor to your earnings. Whereas in BTC, the latter is more volatile and no government or any entity has absolute and full control over its supply. While whales do exist in order to manipulate the price, it isn't as destructive when large conglomerates decide to manipulate the prices in stock market, thereby creating this \"inside trading\" scheme.Though BTC has been in the bear market for a while, remember that the halving will happen in 2024, which is relatively near. Stock up your BTCs and HODL for long-term for maximum profit and gains.",

You can only make profit if you can speculate in that market by knowing what affects it and will lose money if you enter it blindly.But the difference that bitcoin has from other markets is that it is on an adoption path which means its price will always go up in the long run. Unlike stocks which don't really have an \"adoption phase\" and can only go up if the company is doing well or the economy is good.Quote from: fennic on October 04, 2022, 04:11:13 PMI have seen that Bitcoin is always goes in bull and also bear market seasons and in these cycles only big whales are earning and they wil be always be millionaires.You don't need to be a whale to make profit, you just have to be wise.QuoteBut in Stock market that has lasted almost decades to centuries and I do not know if they have also been going like Cryptocurrency market. The cryptocurrency (aka altcoins) market can be compared to penny stocks market which is a small market that lists shit stocks with low value and most of them have no utilities and die sooner or later. Altcoins are the same. We also have the market manipulation that is dominating the altcoin market because it is not regulated.QuoteI think that united States dollars was in bearish for many years when Us Has war with Afghanistan.All fiat currencies are always in a bear market simply because there is an unlimited supply of them. In other words the governments keep printing them so they lost their value over time.QuoteAnd now I think it is in bull run season for many years though United States economy is not too strong. Considering the inflation in US and how price of everything is going up, US dollar could be considered in a \"bear market\".",

Could be different in terms of volatility obviously, both markets are connected, but if you can see last month, when bitcoin is like -10% because of the CPI, the stock market is just like -2% to high of -4%.

The cryptocurrency market is a lot more volatile and a lot riskier, if you don't hold bitcoin without holding shitcoins, shitcoins will die or disappear making you lose your money forever but this does not happen in the forex market. They are just fluctuate and will recover then it's just a matter of time fast or slow, not disappear like in cryptocurrencies. Because without regulation, cryptocurrencies are more susceptible to manipulation and there are more scams during bear season, which is rare for the other 2 markets.",

Maybe thats the only the same in them but since cryptocurrencies is more risky due to many coins and factors affecting it, it is much affected when bear season and crisis happens. If it happens that we're holding a shitcoins it may not be able to recover at all after the crisis.",

While for stocks, it's good as the game of the whales too but not that much volatile. Having a little capital in stocks will only teach you some lessons but it won't grow as much as holding bitcoin.
