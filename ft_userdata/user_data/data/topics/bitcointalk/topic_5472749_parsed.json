You need to backup your post with some explanation on what you mean, or a question you're trying to ask, so we will know how to answer you or give our opinion.I think what the OP is trying to say is that it can buy or sell either BTC or USDT from any of those countries that are included on its list, and for security and trust reasons, the OP is also open to the use of an exchange or escrow, where he or she can send their payment first to the escrow service, and after the final deal is complete, they can both receive their payment either directly or from the escrow service, or better yet, the use of an exchange can still be acknowledged. I think the OP is just trying to create some form of local Africa exchange for himself or anyone who wants to buy crypto.Â But what's in for the OP, and why will people choose to buy from the OP rather than using any Dex that has been existing for years, or better yet, still use a CEX if the person is not concerned about privacy? Instead of taking the risk of dealing with an unknown trader, tinted coins are actually real.",

I wouldn't even count that as a limitation because Nigeria so far have gained the title of the most consumers of Bitcoin in Africa despite the rejection of Bitcoin by the government. Bitcoin usage in Nigeria is growing everyday and I think it's owe to the massive opportunity that the youth if the country see and also many other benefits that come with Blockchain technology and even the government themselves can see this and that why this administration have decided to give an open stand to Bitcoin and actually work towards it adoption here in the country. It wasn't long ago when the government decided to train some certain number of person on Blockchain technology to enable underated the technology behind the trending Bitcoin and how could take advantage of this wonderful trend that is ongoing. federal government and Blockchain technology",
