There is more than 2,638 online Gambling Projects in the world. At least 1217 of them have less than 5,000 sessions per month. Most of the top is quite predictable - traditional bets on variety of sports and online casinos. Well, tbh actualy the most share of the list was.. expected. In meaning of product features and the quality of the list, not rankings. But at the same time - some of data and insights was quite qurious and I want to share them.On of the most impressive fact for me personaly became the popularity of horse races. And second cool fact - there some domestic igamling projects, which have more thaffic than popular international gamling leaders. Let's combine those two facts.PositionNameLanguagesLicencesMobile appTraffic 04.2022 4netkeibaJAJapan (unspecified)X77 600 000 13TJKEN, TRMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry (Turkey)X25 210 000 18HKJCEN, ZHHong Kong (unspecified)X18 290 000 \"Position\" means #4 out of 2,638 ranked by traffic scored in April 2022.netkeibahttps://netkeiba.com/ Horse racing is a very popular sport in Japan, with over 20,000 racehorses taking place every year and a huge number of races held on Saturdays and Sundays, even during major holidays.Horse betting is legal and there exist a well-established betting system, governed by the Japan Horse Racing Association (JRA), which, in turn, is controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Bets can be placed both remotely and at the stadiums where the races actually take place.netkeiba is a comprehensive service on the networks operated by Net Dreamers Co. Ltd. It is also one of the major horse racing information websites in Japan with the largest number of users.The platform has a news page structured like a sports newspaper. The articles are divided not only into central horse racing and local horse racing around Japan, but also covers international horse racing events. netkeiba.com provides a full range of information about its field of expertise.The database contains large amounts of information.

Although the races are mainly held in Turkey, you can also find races taking place in different countries here. You can always bet on horse races held at the 9 racetracks in Turkey, including in Adana, Ankara, Bursa, Diyarbakir, Elazig, Istanbul, Izmir, Kocaeli, and Sanliurfa. In addition to this, TJK also keeps watch over races in the United States, England, and France.The Turkish jockey club is a federation and is included within the state tax system. As of July 20, 2011, Horse Racing (TJK) games cannot be played at other dealers, as virtual dealership contracts have been cancelled by the Jockey Club of Turkey pursuant to the Horse Racing Joint Bets Regulation.Horse races in Turkey are only played on “e-bayi” (https://ebayi.tjk.org/) within the Turkish jockey club or offline, which is entirely due to the corresponding article in the constitution of the Republic of Turkey.Like many legal bookmakers in Turkey, TJK.org does not offer a welcome bonus to its new members. There are currently no promotions or campaigns, and their last promo event was held in December 2019, where users could win the right to a lottery with coupons worth ₺20 each. Several big prizes were handed out after the raffle.The website is very similar to its competitors in regard to the upper bet limit and the minimum amount that can be withdrawn: sums as low as ₺10 can be withdrawn, and the max one-time bet amount is ₺2,500.TJK.org has an app compatible with Android and iOS devices. In addition to betting, it is also very useful for watching live broadcasts and tracking race results. All functions, including financial transactions, are also readily available in the mobile version.So, why is horse racing so popular in Turkey?First, horses hold a very important place in Turkish history. In the recent past, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk personally attended horse races to promote social harmony and socialization in the Turkish society. In fact, he was the one to coin the quote “horse racing is a social need for modern societies.”For this reason, among other things, horse races are very popular in Turkey, attracting many gambling enthusiasts.Going back to the website in question, there are still functions that could use improvement when compared to their international counterparts, especially when it comes to adding real-time bets and making them more convenient. There are also no incentives and benefits for newcomers.The Hong Kong Jockey Clubhttps://hkjc.com/ A non-profit organisation providing horse racing, sports, and betting entertainment in Hong Kong, holding a state-granted monopoly in providing parimutuel betting on horse racing, the Mark Six lottery, and fixed odds betting on overseas football events.The HKJC was instrumental in persuading the Hong Kong government to pass the Gambling (Amendment) Bill 2002 to combat unauthorised cross-border gambling and the related promotional activities in Hong Kong, making it a criminal offence for any person in Hong Kong to bet with an unauthorised bookmaker, even when the bets are received outside Hong Kong. The offence applies to tourists and local residents alike.The website is simple and intuitive, although loaded with lots of unnecessary data. It is available in Chinese and English, providing plentiful information about the company, the licenses, the rules, charity events, etc. In the upper-right corner, you will find the registration and authorization buttons. Below is a link to the Experts Column with useful daily predictions.HKJC offers betting exclusively on horse racing and football events. Like in the situation with the Turkish project above, this project provides no bonuses, promo codes, promotions, or even loyalty bonuses for bettor.Bet-makers wishing to register in any of the HKJC outlets must provide the following documents which must be submitted to an HKJC agent, for a successful registration: Minimum deposit of HK$100; A legit travel document or HKID; ATM card or a savings/current account at a Hong Kong bank.FactCombined those 3 websites have more than 120 mln sessions per month. For example, bet365 which was the #1 in April, had about 292 mln sessions; and well known here freebitco.in had \"just\" 66 million session, having rank #7 out of 2,638. That makes horse races one of the most popular Gambling content in the world in meaning of active players and session-per-player. And not \"just\" popular, but outstandingly and massively popular.",

Do they even accept cryptocurrencies? Netkeiba should at least add that as a payment option since crypto is widely accepted in the country.",
