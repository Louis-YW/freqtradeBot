      "body": "I want to commend your writing skills. The article looks organized and coherent. But you are promoting an exchange website which is not a bad idea. I think this post will be more appropriate in the service section where members usually visit to get information on services such as this one. Your post will get more visibility and you will attract the type of client you need. The legal segment of the forum is more concerned with how laws, policies, or directives of the government and its agencies affect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency ecosystems. This section covers constitutional matters as it relates to Bitcoin. I wish you all the best as you promote your business venture.",
