There are gamblers who are treating gambling like their daily job and some are earning a lot and that’s the time we can call you a successful gambler if you are able to control your finances and keep on winning in gambling.",

People may see anyone who gamble excessively to be addict,  but in the end, it all depends on the individual and what they want from the active game involvement,  but the chances of sliding into an addiction truly since he will be gambling excessively just to meet the set income and on a steady basis.",

Based on the mathematical analysis of gambling in the long term almost every gambler will lose to the casino or bookmaker. What success are you talking about? We are all well aware that gambling is not a job, which means in this area will not be able to earn consistently. Today you are successful, and tomorrow you lose everything. Or am I wrong?",

Some professionals like to make use of arbitrage and some other ways to make money from gambling. I have not tried that before but if possible they can use that means, that proves that not only pure gambling that gamblers make money from. Some even make money from deposit bonus. And other means. That is why you will see gamblers going to new gambling site that is trustworthy already to gamble. But all these do not mean they are addicts.The way some people are gambling are different. Some that go for pure gambling may not be gambling often, but look for a particular game and go for it. Some people will only try their strategy like martingale and if it works and they make money, they may not gamble for a while. But casinos is more addictive. But we should not call anyone a professional gambler. Some people called themselves professional because they are skilled in gambling and they try to follow the rules of discipline. That is different and the opposite of gambling addiction.",

Many are trying their luck with gambling and once they are able to find it, they become more active until it became their daily activities. Maybe its a positive addiction since it brings money most of the time and if a gambler are more capable for this, then there should be no wrong and we should not call them addict.",

The worst part of it is that whenever they don't have money to gamble they moved out to visit the physical shops to see and feel the environment. So whatever chances they had or luck, possibly they are gift money instantly they gambles with it without even knowing whether they will win this or not but what they knows is that certainly they must hit one day while continually trying their luck's.So the rate at which they develop themselves makes it turns to an adiction, then amount of time spent might makes you became a successful person through gambling and after becoming successful you have to keep standard by continue to gamble since it has turned to an occupation.",

Because there is no such thing as slot machine pro player or any other game that is based on pure luck to be a successful.So for me it is it skill based games like poker then it's no accident that they become successful because they know the game and have the experience and having a strategy to beat their opponents.

It is a separate issue that often leads to compulsive behavior and affects individuals regardless of their success or failure in gambling. Sure, there are folks who may have a few wins here and there, or maybe they even go on a hot streak, but addiction does not really care about that. It is not just about the money – it is about the uncontrollable urge to keep gambling, even when it is tearing your life apart.",

A successful gambler is someone who may have developed skills, knowledge, or strategies that allow them to win more often than lose. They probably approach gambling as a form of entertainment or a calculated investment by having a bit of luck. But still that even successful gamblers can still be prone to the risk of developing gambling addiction if they exhibit signs of loss of control, negative consequences, or other addictive behaviors associated with gambling. In short, not to be seen as an addict is to have a limit on yourself.",

They tend to bet compulsively, poor management, always on their gambling account, the urge to gamble is always there, they can resort to using money that's not theirs to gamble.But for a successful gambler you won't see any of those characteristics in them, they don't gamble anyhow since they have to take their time to analyze before placing a bet and if they are unable to figure out a good probability for their winnings they can just leave the game till another time. Although not everyone behaves the same way so among those that became successful through some lucky bets you'll be able to see adducts among them.",

Gamblers do continue until they would be able on achieving something on which it would acts out as a driving force them to continue on what they have started.
