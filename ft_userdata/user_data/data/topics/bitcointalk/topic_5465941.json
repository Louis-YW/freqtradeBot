I mostly browse the forum using my pc but sometimes when I'm outside I view it using my smartphone. I must say that if you want to have a better viewing experience on your smartphone then use the forum in a landscape mode because with portrait mode you have to zoom in and zoom out many times which isn't a good experience. I think that the official developers of the forum may release mobile friendly application in future, and there are also chances that the other developers of the forum may also think about making an unofficial mobile friendly application in future. But, in current times the only solution for me is to use landscape view on my smartphone and it works like a charm for me.",

Is it supposed to be more cell phone friendly and more app like in its nature and usage? OP, one simple way to simplify the view of Bitcointalk on your mobile device, is to click on the drop down menu of your browser, where you can find bookmarks, history, share, recent tabs, refresh. Then click on the desktop site button or box. It would optimize the view to fit your browser instantly.",

I've always browsed this site on smartphone without much ado. The few times I tried it on a PC, it felt bulky and difficult for me to use. Except for those who always want their stuff delivered to them on a platter without lifting a finger, I don't think anyone would say this site on phone is burdensome. Yes, I agree one has to zoom in and out to have clearer views but that's what it's. We do same on other sites and even on PCs too and I don't see anything out of place with that to bother with.
