      "body": "If you want to access to the cpanel of someone else and you have a list of websites that you want access to, that is probably going to be a criminal offence in every country around the world. Can you elaborate when you say \"no illegal thing included\" what does that mean because if you are proposing to hack in to a website you are proposing to carry out an illegal act.You will not find anybody in the forum who will be a partner to criminal activity such as what you are proposing therefore you should refrain making such posts in future.Quote from: clarksandam on July 11, 2023, 07:15:10 PManyone here knows how to get access of some http cpanel websites? contact me tg: jsalwslwI have a list of some websites I want to get access to (no illegal thing included) I will pay you good money on every website you get me access to",

      "body": "The funny thing is, that if you had of said \"the websites are evil, and host immoral or illegal content\" then maybe a whitehat hacker would have been willing to work with you, for the greater good......but since there's nothing wrong with the websites, you're the guy that's in the wrong.Unless you have a very good reason for hacking into these cpanels, don't expect anyone to reply or help you.And yes as JollyGood said, it is a criminal offence and if you are reported or do not practice good opsec, you could land yourself in trouble. Though don't panic. The nature of the internet vs. what will have you investigated is a line....and I don't think you cross it yet by requesting what you're requesting. Conducting it, that's another story. I'd recommend just ending the pursuit here, your call though now that you have some insight from us.If you want hacking services, there are better forums for it than here.",

It violates the principles of privacy, security, and digital rights. Hacking into websites without authorization is generally illegal and unethical. It's important to respect privacy and security. Unauthorized access to websites is a breach of security and can have serious consequences. It's important to promote lawful behavior and respect the rights of others.",

As he is not active here, I assume that he is doing the same in different forums and networks. So I don't think that he is looking for attention to be noticed as you said: he just doesn't care about the bitcoin talk (nor Bitcointalk).On the other hand, I have zero knowledge on the topic, but I don't think that the clearnet is the best place to ask for that kind of deals.",

To put that in some sort of context it means he has been making on average one post every two years and I find that behaviour is in itself extremely strange. Keep that aside I think using the forum to ask members to participate in criminal activity in unacceptable.Quote from: Porfirii on July 15, 2023, 05:35:12 PMI think it's more about creating his account here (back in 2017, btw) to simply reach a larger audience.
