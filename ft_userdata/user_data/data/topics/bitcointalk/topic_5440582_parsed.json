For that purpose, to reduce the chances that your investment is lost and give you a level of assurance when investing in cryptocurrency, invest in bitcoins. Do not have the idea that it is just because you are on a forum about bitcoin is why it is being endorsed, that is not the complete reason, it is also very much because it has been researched and tested and it still remains trusted. Create a plan and keep investing in bitcoins.",

Many altcoins are scam but few stands out to be the best, like Polygon and Binance coin (BNB).",

Everybody have their appropriate time of investing on there self, now that you realizes you need to do needful of investing or trading on cryptocurrency is a good step but don't do it because others are succeeding.You said you need a good knowledge, the only ways to learn fast is through books, journals, Newsline, mentorship and imitating principles. When you have had a wide range of ideas of what crypto is all about, you can cravingly indulge on it yourself. Knowledge is good but application of it is better says Mike Murdock. So I urge you to do reading.As for which crypto currency to invest in bitcoin is best but altcoins too are OK, is just that the moves of bitcoin directly or indirectly influence the price movement charts of altcoins but if you have a enough money you can split your investment but learn the secret first to avoid losses.",

That is not possible. Even though you were not constant and you were crypto enthusiast, you would have known the best crypto to deal with. Okay let me ask you simple question. When you were the enthusiast, which of the crypto were you using? Was it Ethereum or bitcoin? Since you don't know again which one to go I will ask you to use Ethereum. But if love bitcoin then you can invest in it. Or you can invest on all the Cryptocurrencies to taste them and to Know more about them so that you will have a good knowledge about all of them.

I mean....I thought you knew the reasons why you got registered in here at first?..and you prolly learnt alot already behind closed doors?..      shrugs.Bitcoin is preferable for now until whenever. I don't even think there's gonna be a time that forked coin would get a better scalability than BTC, I doubt. Secondly, hope you've known the basics of investing in Bitcoin already? Cus that's actually very imperative. Now if you've had more that 20 Ops suggesting the same BTC, I think you should atleast be partly convinced?Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

Though some coins give huge returns to their investors, there is no guarantee that they will do the same. Because these coins are controlled by their respective authority, they will do whatever pleases them. So it is best to avoid altcoins and focus on bitcoin with your money.",

They are trying to scam money from you. Why not learn on crypto on your own. Use the time and dont rely on people with your hard earned money. At least if you loss then its you who used your money than random anyone who just gonna screw it.But if you are really wanted without much knowledge only buy bitcoin.

However, it would be advantageous if you could conduct your own research as well, as each investor has a different motivation for buying coins. For example, I've heard some people claim that Bitcoin doesn't generate as much profit as other forms of coins investment. Some  altcoins are also worthwhile, but I won't ever advise anyone to invest in one because I don't.",

Also focus on realistic things and if the platform offer to good to be true like investing without doing anything which is commonly offer and give you huge profit then declare it as scam to save your money from scams.
