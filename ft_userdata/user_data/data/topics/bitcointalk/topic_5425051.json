  "content": "In continuation of my course on the Bitcoin Promotion and Adoption in my locality, this is the phase two (2) while you can see the phase one (1) here; https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422241.0  I on-boarded this young man who render laundry  services in my locality. He was recommended to be a good laundry man in my locality for which he has been up and doing. He owns a mini Laundry service which he has been running and has been his major source of income and sustenance. I met with him and we had a conversation. At first, he seems to be sound and knowledgeable enough to assimilate new ideas and mostly innovations. He is also inclined a bit in technological innovations and discoveries so I told him about bitcoin. I used the scheme I already used for the previous as earlier stated which he find interesting. It was a series of question and answer session we had an in-depth discussion on blockchain, cryptocurrency and bitcoin. After which, he told me he is interested in accepting bitcoin as payment for his services and I should show him how he could start  by setting up a wallet which I did.  For  better view, here was the scheme which I used;1. What is Bitcoin?2. When and why Bitcoin was founded.3. Founder of Bitcoin.4. Importance and benefits of holding bitcoin.5. How to trade bitcoin. ( listed some  notable exchange where he can trade bitcoin)6. What is blockchain and how it works.As I did for the previous,  I also did to him as well. I taught him how to set up a bitcoin wallet, the easiest to be precise so he could easily understand and do it himself, copy and send his wallet address to his customers for payment. As earlier mentioned above, I also told and showed him the difference between private keys, public keys  and transaction harsh so he could get acquainted to them all.I encouraged him to reach out to his friends and colleagues  because it would aid in the faster and rapid adoption and promotion of bitcoin in other locality where they belong.This course for which I have started has been an interesting one so far. It has exposed me to lots of experience as well and also knowing more  of the societal perspective about Bitcoin  and cryptocurrency as a whole. It has been a wonderful one and time out there for me as I made new friends in my locality and beyond.If I can take this course to my locality and beyond, you too can do it more. I am open to welcoming contributions and opinions.",

But it occurs to me that it is easy to do this in services that are managed on the Internet without the need to obtain licenses, while this will be a problem if that business is run in a country that does not fully recognize the acceptance of bitcoin payments. In addition to the technical problems in accepting crypto payments, on the basis of which the prices of goods and services are supposed to be determined.",

Just a little addition to that bond paper where you've written \"we accept bitcoin\".I think it's better if you do what the others are putting in that sign which includes the logo of bitcoin. It's easier to be acknowledge when someone who's also a bitcoiner in your area sees that logo of bitcoin and that's an automatic response to their minds that they know you're accepting bitcoin as a payment.",

But I really agree with the adoption made by OP by accepting bitcoin as means of payment for his services, but he must still pay attention to the convenience of transactions for his customers so that both parties don't have to wait too long for network confirmation when payment transactions are broadcast.Quote from: Antonas1 on December 02, 2022, 01:06:13 PMMy question is, why didn't you use advice from your first thread already?Maybe OP still secretly adopted it, so the sticker can't be put on the wall yet, or something, Who knows.",

It is good about transaction fee but also makes sense because you will not have to rely on centralized exchanges.

As earlier mentioned above, I also told and showed him the difference between private keys, public keys  and transaction harsh so he could get acquainted to them all.Out of curiosity, what wallet did you teach him to setup? Was it by their choice or did you sort of recommend a wallet? The reason I ask is; since in your phase one you've already taught them the basics, and the benefits of Bitcoin. Did you allow them to make a educated choice on what wallet to select? Also, be interested whether they selected a hot wallet or a completely offline wallet? I'm definitely not criticising you there, with those questions. I'm just wondering, since I believe there's teaching, and there's teaching things correctly. You should be allowing them to use the information that you've fed them, without actually being too biased, and then allow them to use their own initiative. That way, you can sort of check whether they've truly understood what you've just been teaching them too. It's one of the reasons I avoid teaching people about Bitcoin. I don't consider myself to the proficiency required to teach them about Bitcoin. I usually just point them to references, because I don't want to teach them wrong, which could potentially be dangerous.",

Accept for payment and pay using btc, which was created for this. This is hindered only by habits and fear of the new. People like OP can help to overcome these barriers by personal example. He has already contributed to bitcoin adoptions, and you, reader?People are lazy creatures and until the need arises, they will not use bitcoin as a means of payment. Why, if there are simple and familiar traditional ways. You can get out of your comfort zone and learn new things if there is a strong need.

Start accepting only btc for payment and you will see how quickly the world will change.Generally, users have to be annoyed at the current system to change, since it's quite well known that us humans don't particularly relish change in our lives. So, things like a bank interrupting your transaction or potentially being locked out of your account are things that force people to look at alternatives. That's not a bad thing, there will be plenty of users getting annoyed at the traditional money system, and this is only accelerated by the recessions that we keep dipping into. Every time inflation pops its ugly head up, there will be people questioning why it continues to happen, and will soon come to the realization they're getting poorer despite holding the same amount of money.",

This is actually the correct way to go for it because once the working group starts understanding the value of bitcoin and once the money starts moving in and out of the system plus that too based on p2p system it could create perfect balance of bitcoin. The more it comes into social circulation the more adoption it will have. Just like the normal currencies it will also be in circulation and as it move around it will be valued more.

I took this upon myself because I have seen the worth of it and the goal of Satoshi is to make sure each and every nook and cranny gets to know and hear about Bitcoin which is the new financial freedom and breakaway from oppression and poverty. I have learnt a lot from the system. Some one brought me here and I learnt about it more from my research so I owe the society this by giving back to the society in this very own little way of mine. Nevertheless, i give or teach them the basic fundamentals and how it works. I have been on this for sometime   and I am achieving my goals in that regards.",

However, as a very simple non-techie person, the most important challenge when I was starting with Bitcoin years ago is always the learning curve which is so important especially in protecting the crypto we have in our wallets.
