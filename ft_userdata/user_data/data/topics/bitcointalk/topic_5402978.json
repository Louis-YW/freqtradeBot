  "content": "iBTC is an inverse derivative to Bitcoin, which means its price is supposed to go high if the BTC price goes down. Currently, you can check Binance or any similar site to see they're both going down.Can anyone specialized in economics here explain to us why or how this is happening?.If I can speculate that Bitcoin is actually going up in some sense, but it's like the whole DeFi or crypto vehicle or ship is going down by a higher rate and that's why all is going down, is there some economy science or like theory that supports this speculation?I mean what could be this crypto vehicle or ship?",

      "body": "It is there from its meaning, it is inverse form of bitcoin in price relation. Assuming you buy iBTC when bitcoin is at $10000, if bitcoin drops in price to $9500, it means iBTC will be at $10500. If bitcoin increased to $11000, that means iBTC will decrease to $9000. That is, inverse form of bitcoin price. Which means as bitcoin is having more price gain, iBTC price is reducing, or as bitcoin price is reducing, iBTC price is increasing in inversely proportional order. To learn more, you can read this:https://docs.synthetix.io/tokens/#inverse-isynthsSo, iBTC is not going in the opposite direction in a higher rate, but not recommended to be used in my opinion.",

All projects is based on the demand and supply. The names such as iBTC is for publicity and there is no tangibility behind it.Take for instance, I can create a coin and name it 'Sun-Rise'. I will tell you that the coin falls at night when there's no sun but rises in the morning as the sun is rising. That does not mean I coded the sun into the project. I only gave the name to make you sell in the evening and buy in the morning. And thousands of people will keep selling in the evening and buying in the morning, and you will think the coin is fulfilling its name. Yes, it might work for sometimes until the  big boys (whales) will prove you wrong.I don't know if this answer helped.",

Yes, it might work for sometimes until the  big boys (whales) will prove you wrong.I don't know if this answer helped.I suggest you go over the answer provided by OP above. The creator of iBTC doesn't have the power to control the price of BTC to go inversely to the price of his own coin and neither does he have the power to control the price of iBTC to move against BTC.These two coins are traded on exchanges and the market decide their price not some pre-conceived speculation. The only reason you're confused is you're taking the words of the creator of iBTC for it. You're better off ignoring those speculations.",

I think there is no such thing as that where a coin can move oppositely from the rest and if ever it is legit then it would be an easy money for the people that discovers it because it will now be easy to predict things by just basing on their opposites. They can also place their bets on two sides to increase their potential income. Maybe this coin is just another meme coin that uses the current trend of btc because nowadays btc is in the headlines due to its new all time low and also about the repetition of events based from the past years.
