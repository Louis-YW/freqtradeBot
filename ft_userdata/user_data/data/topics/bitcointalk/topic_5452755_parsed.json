  "content": "Both spot buying and selling and futures trading have their personal benefits and downsides, and it ultimately depends at the individual trader's desires, threat tolerance, and trading style.Spot trading entails buying and promoting assets at the cutting-edge marketplace rate, and it's miles generally considered less unstable than futures buying and selling. It is a great alternative for novices who are simply starting out in trading and want to get a feel for the marketplace. However, spot trading can also be volatile, and fees can differ swiftly, so traders want a good way to manipulate their threat correctly.Futures buying and selling, however, includes buying and selling contracts that promise to deliver an asset at a destiny date at a predetermined fee. It allows buyers to take positions on the course of an asset's price movement with out definitely owning the underlying asset. Futures trading can be extra complicated and unstable than spot trading, and it calls for more understanding and revel in. Futures buying and selling can be appropriate for buyers who have a better threat tolerance and are looking for greater superior trading techniques.",

When you buy  0.02BTC @ $500 and the price dips and its value drops $400, your BTC will still be 0.02BTC. Nothing is lost compared to futures trading where you'd lose some if you exit the position. Worse if you get the margin call your money will be liquidated.For a newbie, the Spot market is a good way to train yourself, you don't even need a demo account.",

The largest difference is that with futures you aren’t buying the physical coin you are just buying a derivative. And hence you get larger leverage. Sometimes 100x. Sounds good doesn’t it?Well the problem is that with 100x you can get liquidated very fast and blow your account. With spot there is no leverage and you can’t get liquidated. So for new people it’s safer.Also there are funding fees with futures, especially perp futures while spot doesn’t have these fees.",

With spot trading, the trader is more or less investing their money, just like buying the asset and holding it, which poses a reduced level of risk compared to futures trading.Future trading is just like traditional financial market trading, how many people have you seen that are successful through it? The risk of leveraged/margin products is always high and the chance of losing one's money totally is high too.",

      "body": "Most of the beginners prefer to trade on futures as opposed to spot because they are impatient and want to quickly profit from their trades. In futures there is margin which can be a leverage for beginners who have little capital to be able to earn more from their trades, but most beginners get stuck here and it's no wonder that many beginners end up empty handed when they trade in futures, because they are too greedy and hasty in making decisions. My advice for beginners is that it is better to trade on spot than on futures, because actually futures are provided only for professionals to trade freely. When you are a beginner, you should trade on the spot market, which is much safer, because when you lose, it will not use up the entire deposit you have because there is no term margin call there.",

Most people always think about the high reward in future trading, but they don't know the higher your reward, the higher the chances of you losing money, the higher your leverage, the higher your chances of losing money. Basically newbies should just start trading with stop trading, I believe it's easier to manage your risk in spot trading compare to future trading. In spot trading you can hold your coin even after dumping, but in future their is a level you will get to that you will get liquidated and all your money is gone.When I also started trading, I started with spot trading, after few weeks I discovered future trading and I noticed that the amount I was making from future trading was kind of higher than spot trading, but I didn't notice the risk associated with it early. When I started losing money in future trading, I wasted all the money I deposited to trade with, I deposited more money and moved it to my future trading account and wasted it again, I was kind of addicted to future trading then, but when I came back to my right senses, I have to force myself to stop trading futures, and since then I don't really go close to future trading and I don't encourage anyone to do that.",

Future trading brings more profits so people will be naturally attracted to it but it also has its worst side which is losing in a larger scale. As a beginner, focus on spot trading. It's the simplest form of trading and you can easily understand that spot market. Spot trading doesn't have a high leverage that'll make you lose very fast.

It's the quickest way to gain but also the risk is too high compared to the spot trading. For newbies, it's recommended to just stay in the spot, and if you want to test out futures then be prepared for the potential losses that you'll get. It's just easy to have it heard from others that futures are profitable. But you test and see if it's an easy for your own experience because the reality will make you regret that those overheard statements are overrated and far from the reality. While those spot traders that have been confident already, they're the ones that will try to go in futures but it has no restriction, anyone can try it and if you want to get eaten by the whales and market, be aware of that.",

Spot trading is one of the simplest trade setups available to newcomers. Spot trading is simple since its characteristics are not as complex as those of futures trading. In practice, a beginner may initiate trades by simply looking at the Spot sector, but futures require PDFs and tutorials before understanding how to use these features perfectly. Furthermore, there is always potential for development in the trading sector; it doesn't take long before one realizes he's operating whole trading accounts autonomously and printing profits.",

Then the next step will be starting spot buy sell (trading) with a small amount of asset just to understand the concept. When you get a good understanding of the market with spot trading, you can jump into future trading. The concept is the same but with a bit of extra risk.
