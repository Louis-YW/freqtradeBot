      "body": "You should add one more option- doesn't matter. As long as it remains the same supply and doesn't get changed (which is impossible as doing so will create another chain, aka altcoin), there's nothing wrong with that. I don't exactly know what satoshi had in his mind when he fixed the supply(I can't remember if I have ever read any explanation), but my opinion would be the same if the supply was 42 million or even more but a fixed one, not like unlimited as we have in our centralized currency.",
