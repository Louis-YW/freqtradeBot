  "content": "It was just announced that Google Authenticator is now getting a  cloud backup.QuoteWe released Google Authenticator in 2010 as a free and easy way for sites to add “something you have” two-factor authentication (2FA) that bolsters user security when signing in. While we’re pushing towards a passwordless future, authentication codes remain an important part of internet security today, so we've continued to make optimizations to the Google Authenticator app.One major piece of feedback we’ve heard from users over the years was the complexity in dealing with lost or stolen devices that had Google Authenticator installed. Since one time codes in Authenticator were only stored on a single device, a loss of that device meant that users lost their ability to sign in to any service on which they’d set up 2FA using Authenticator. https://security.googleblog.com/2023/04/google-authenticator-now-supports.htmlFor sure there could be some of us who are using Google Authenticator here as another layer of protection for our crypto accounts. But as they have explain it, one drawback is that when you lost or your devices are stolen, it's hard to recover it already.But now, they said that they are going to do a backup on the cloud.However, I for one is not comfortable with it. Obviously, it's our responsibility, but what if the Google clouds are hack as well? it is going to be open for all sorts of vulnerabilities in my opinion.What's you take on this?",
