The site was not really responsive and I struggled visiting the bonus page, but that could maybe be just me. At a first glance, you don't have any in-house games nor vip system? Is this something that will be added in the near future?",

The whole theme/UI is also the same, how can it be the same? Is it due to the same software/script? No offenses, but I think you should have different UI to make it unique, for now your site is just like a copy of sherbet.",

The mission is great, but do you already have profits or revenue why you can already give donation to charity?You are just starting on this business, so for me, it is understandable that you will take time to accomplish this part. Also, I noticed, when you create an account - the link is not working if you click to see the Terms of Service as you need to agree this part. And just wondering the high allotment to charity. I don't think that's a sustainable approach, unless, you will soon screw gamblers. Just saying.",

      "body": "Welcome to the forum, I didn’t create an account since I was required to insert my Email and I’ve been skeptical about that because of the amount of mails that have been flooding into my phone lately, l just can’t risk adding more to it. But here are a few things I noticed and I would love you work on. No KYCI went through your TOS, privacy policy and FAQ and you never mentioned that your casino does not require KYC. I also took a look at the whole interface that a guest should see when visiting your site and I still didn’t see “No-KYC” anywhere.You even mentioned that you have the right to request for personal information if under age gambling is suspected, I’ll advice you also add something about KYC so that if any issue should arise the user can have something to back him up. ToS in registration page I pretended as if I wanted to create an account so that I could get to view the Terms and Conditions but it turned out that it contained no actual link just a test with purple color, I’ll also suggest that you make it a link so that users can easily the Terms and Conditions that they want to agree to.SupportI tried clicking on your support button several times and nothing happened, I don’t know if it’s different if I create an account but you should make it possible for guest to be able to contact support. They have been cases of scam accusations of casinos and I was able to reach out to the support to get a few information about their service to know if they used went against it or not so you should consider making it general and not just available to those that have an account in your site (if it actually works though.). Affiliate The same complaint I have for “Support” I tried clicking on it to see how much one can earn but affiliating with your site but it kept taking me to the home page, I’d suggest you add more information about it, and if you don’t have anything to add i.e if you haven’t started affiliating with anyone then make it non-active cause right now it’s misleading. The above are just some things I noticed in your site, I might consider creating an account to check out how your games and UI works but for now work on the following.",

Many of us are not very familiarized with charity and it's relation with the world of cryptocurrency or Bitcoin, for example, this is the first time I have heard about that charity organizations you just mentioned. To many people like me who are not familiar with it, would you mind to give us some documentation or some reliable information of that charity you mentioned about? How will be the people around here be sure you are actually donating to such charity, would you be willing to disclose your transaction history in a regular basis for us to check?Also, leaving the charity part to one side. You mentioned the casino does not ask for KYC, but won't you start to ask for it if your casino gets contacted by regulators and ask you to comply?",

      "body": "@btcwild Welcome to BitcoinTalk forum,I have just visited your casino looks cool but some elements buttons are not working,  like the left side panel- Bonus and affiliate when I click on them they show the same interface. And seeing that you have mentioned that No KYC, but ultimately the fourth condition of your terms and conditions acts against No KYC. Anyway, I have some questions, May I know the deposit and minimum withdrawal also the fees in your casino without registering? Also, I would like to know a little about the licensing of your casino.Some suggestions- ANN thread Image size looks huge,We have to scroll a lot to read the thread. If you want, these images can be presented in a more beautiful way through resizing.Moreover, you can implement live support system in your casino, it is more comfortable for users. Moreover, if you want to make your casino more visible, you can run some campaigns like Signature campaign, Review Campaign etc.",

You can't trust anybody anymore.@btcwild, I tried checking out your site again to look at it more closely, but I ran into some issues that other people seem to be having too.  The site wouldn't fully load, and there were missing pieces and images.  Is the site still being built or sorted out? Or could there be some hosting server problems causing these glitches?",
