And I would be happier if you also became an active user and take part in discussions here. And don't hesitate to ask anything you want to know. Because members of this forum will be happy to answer your questions. Increasing insight by actively discussing is indeed the best way because there is a reciprocal process that makes it easier for us to remember things that we previously did not know. It's different from just reading from a book which is sometimes difficult to remember even though it has been collected more completely. But through discussion or direct interaction, everything will go easier. What you have to do now is read every rule in this forum if you want to learn here while joining in the discussion. After that, please go around and read topics that might be interesting for you to know. And if something is not clear then ask by replying to an existing topic. The point is, enjoy the process.",
