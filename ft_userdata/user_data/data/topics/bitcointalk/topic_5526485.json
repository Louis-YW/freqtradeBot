That is good point we should wait and see what happens next before making any decisions. Idea of considering Bitcoin as reserve asset is very interesting and it is normal to wonder what might happen if it becomes reality. It is also interesting that they are selling Bitcoins that were taken away from people who broke law. Maybe money they get from selling those Bitcoins will be used to buy more Bitcoins for reserves. If that happens it could make many people want to invest in Bitcoin and other organizations might do same. For now let's just wait and see how things go.",

That day if it will ever happen will not be today. It's going to be a long time before countries start having a bitcoin reserve. Bitcoin is against everything they stand against so let's not get ahead of ourselves. Decisions like this take time to happen. It will be deliberated before the bill can finally pass so let's not see it as something that will happen soon. I don't even think there's any country that has gotten to the advanced stages of this decision-making process. This is one minor reason why I belive bitcoin can get to unbelievable prices in the future. By the time a country like the US finally agrees to have a bitcoin reserve, it will mean bitcoin price will soar exponentially because it will create a lot of demand.",

It's just unfortunate that governments are likely to become adopters before most average citizens do. Many people could have already started holding Bitcoin, even when their governments don't talk about it or discourage the adoption. However, most people only take a decision based on what the government encourages them to do.Of course there are pros in governments adopting Bitcoin as strategical reserves, but there are also cons as consequences, like harsh regulations imposed over Bitcoin enthusiasts, besides the usual abusive taxation over profits made on BTC sales, which is a dream of every broken governments which aren't willing to cut their own expenses to maintain its functionality.",

If the government use it as their reserve while they lack the needed knowledge it is still a waste of resources.For this reason with the volatility in nature of Bitcoin, I don't see the day the government will have Bitcoin as their only reserve we should expect them to have Bitcoin as 15% max of their reserve, and I expect the country to start it to be the US, or El-salvador.",

I don't know about that and is it really something good for the BTC network if almost all the countries in the world hold BTC as a strategic reserve, i don't think it is so good because the power of manipulation will be in the hands of centralized institutions and who can tell what they will do. Take note that so many countries are not interested in the idea of a strategic BTC reserve and even the countries it has been mentioned, we are not yet sure if it will be implemented.",

I thought I would see Bhutan in the list but it is missing. Bhutan mines bitcoin and already has adopted a crypto reserve maybe  it is because they are a small country that is why they are not there as they may not have been able to generate enough buzz to get attention from the public. As for the United States, we are all getting ready to know what Trump has up his sleeves after January 20th.

All these Bitcoin strategic reserve considerations are because of the newly elected US president. The US is seen as a pacesetter to other Western countries. More nations will consider buying Bitcoin if Trump finally implements the reserve policy. A few years ago Bitcoiners were seen as lunatics. They were mocked because many of them never believed that Bitcoin would become a generally recognized currency. When these critics observed that it had started gaining prominence, they tagged it as a currency for criminal activities. As they began to realize that Bitcoin is taking centre stage in the global financial system, they now want to be a part of it. This is just the beginning of the reign of Bitcoin.",

Few years back, we all would really be doubting the possibility of the US even considering having a bitcoin reserve, especially looking back at the way Donald Trump handled crypto during his first tenure. Now see how far bitcoin has come and the number of countries and institutions trying to be part of the Bitcoin family. Nothing is really impossible with bitcoin. Yea in years to come the price must have skyrocketed and governments too will get tired of fighting Bitcoin. You would agree with me that the hate on Bitcoin has really reduced, let's just be optimistic and bear in mind that nothing is impossible.",

China, Japan and other developed countries if also adopt it as their national reserve or maybe Australia too but first we need this step made by USA.If they will made this step then most of the other countries will follow USA.
