This would enable them to properly managc any amount you give to them.Also, what vices do you speak of that are precipitated by crypto in a teenager?",

I don't know of their ages but I believe they can be able to understand the whole configuration instead learning it outside or being that you don't give them right orientation towards bitcoin would make them probably gets involved with ponzi scheme and any other money making easy way, but with the right knowledge they could be able to manage themselves and overcome any other illegal means of investment. Besides if you don't reveal to them you made an investment to each of them they won't know you have such plans for them and it's good to learn from you being that you have no such privilege from your parents, and you were independent this shows they should also learn from you than being blinded of not showing them up the right way of digitalization and the innovation enveloping the world.",

The best things and experience, and achievement most of the time start from what our parent's have prepared for us from the on set. If most of us who are now grown up have had this kind of opportunities from our parent's we could have been more expose then where we are now though lots will miss use the opportunity.",

Instead of having a fixed deposit account in local banks for your kids, its better you open a wallet and ensure to fund and keep enriching the portfolio over time and they would appreciate what you've done for them when they truly understand. Either in regrets or in enjoyment the fruit from having a thoughtful parent.I have highlighted those words for a reason. For your kids not to lay waste everything, they've got to know something about finance. They've got to understand that, it ain't a do as you want just because you've got the funds for it and funds not properly managed finishes.Again, this doesn't come with age and so, 18years for a bench mark might not be idea but, its good enough for a start.",

How safe are the wallets?? How about if one of these kids don't take the whole idea of the digitalized world seriously, since you haven't even started it from birth with them, and for the fact that some peeps don't even like everything they see or hear??

I hope you are extra careful in keeping your savings for your children. At the very least, keep them in a cold wallet.

I'm surprised that you are choosing Bitcoin for your children's future and yet you don't want them to learn about it as teenagers.",

With self custodial wallet, you don't have to open any wallet like open accounts on centralized exchanges. You can install wallet and create receiving address then assign address labels with names of your children.However, if you plan to give it to four kids, you must create four different wallets, each is for one kid. You should not create one wallet and give four addresses (in a same wallet) for four kids. Because they will co-own that wallet later that can cause conflict of interests. If one of children is bad, he will steal all coin in that wallet.",

I'd consider to give your Bitcoin to your children as an inheritance because you don't need to think and control them how to use their coins, you might ask them to hold their coins until the next bull run, but if they don't listed to you, it will cause a drama where you're not willing to let your coins spent by unnecessary thing e.g. buy a luxury product.",

Your obligation to your children ends when they graduate from college; consequently, they are fortunate to have a parent who goes above and beyond. But when you do not want to teach your children about crypto when they are teenagers, I do not get it. High school level is the greatest year to support your kids about their true capacities which they could take for their college courses You are not required to inform them of your secret savings, but it is preferable to inform them of crypto when they are young. If they are interested or not, you will know, but at least you told them about it.",

I have this in mind as an inheritance plan, but how will they avoid all the mistakes if I don't teach them? Even adults lose funds to scammers or hackers too.

Being a parents is being a responsibilitiesIn my opinion maybe just creating a bank or adding a separate vault on your bank would already work as long as you do save separately for your child it would work. I mean it doesn't actually need to be bitcoin or any cryptocurrency because they are still children so they don't really understand it yet and don't have enough knowledge about bitcoin, I know bitcoin is an investment but at the same time, we all know that bitcoin and cryptocurrency are also so risky because of its volatile market price. 4 wallets or maybe banks looks like a lot of work, It doesn't really need to be 4 specific wallets since you could just split them in the end, Anyway, it still depend on you, but I guess as long as you teach them your bitcoin knowledge it's already enough for them to start their investment journey because its everything will be useless if they don't have enough knowledge and would just end up just selling the bitcoin you accumulated for them.",

Op plan is very good, he has been preparing to invest in his children from an early age. This question is very important to the Op, as long as no one else has the keys there is no guarantee his children will be able to access the wallet for up to xx years if something happens to the Op.It takes trusted heirs to keep the assets in the wallet so that they can always be accessed. Nothing can go against the laws of nature, get sick, lose memory or forget and the worst possibility is death. Op needs to consider this question so that his assets are not frozen in the wallet, Op must trust the heirs so that the baton continues.",
