Thanks in advanceTechnical analysis in trading is not related to understanding about Bitcoin technology. It relates to apply technical indicators in trading to Bitcoin price movement, volume to predict its future movement to support your trading plan and decision.However, personally I feel only technical analysis is not enough for your trading. You must learn about fundamental analysis too. Because without good fundamentals, you will put your money at risk. If an asset has good fundamentals, even if your technical analysis is wrong, you can hold it (like Bitcoin) and still have chance to get profit  by holding your bitcoin long enough to cover your mistake in technical analysis.",

      "body": "Many traders just do not employ technical analysis. Some are profitable despite using fundamental analysis. So if you trade with either of them, you can still make money. To make money, you don't need to know how to evaluate the market technically. However, combining fundamental and technical research increases the likelihood of making a large profit.Quote from: Iloveegusi on April 13, 2023, 01:31:30 AMCan I learn myself or is important I about them from a professional?\"Do your own research\" is essential in trading so that you don't blame others for what happens to your money. However, you can learn more readily if you learn from professional traders while independently researching what they teach.",

Thanks in advanceI don't think that it's a must know, but at least you should have a grasp of TA for starters.And that's why there are holders in the bitcoin market, those individuals who doesn't want to complicate things on their end. Just going to buy thru DCA or whatever they can, and then HODL for it and then they sell during the bull run to take profits.While on the other hands, there are individuals who actively trade in this market, and those are people who are into this technical analysis side.",

Thanks in advanceTechnical analysis is not necessary if you invest on fundamentals, that is, instead of betting on whether the price is going to go up or down, what you do is inform yourself about what you are going to buy, in this case bitcoin, and when you realise that it has a great future, you buy it for a long time. Then, in TA you don't need it at all. Add to that the fact that more than 95% of traders, no matter how much TA they know, lose money.If it's for entertainment, fine, but if you expect to make money with it, you have to know that the odds are very low.",

I've seen many ppl wanting to trade and make money because they are seeing others do it, but got no interest in TA or whatsoever. The urge to learn must come from the inside.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on April 13, 2023, 03:18:01 AMTechnical analysis is not necessary if you invest on fundamentalsAFAIK, technicals are equally important like fundamentals. We cant succeed by knowing about one but not the other. Atleast we need some basic knowledge of technicals like breakout/down patterns and candlesticks to make things easier to judge.",

True, it can help you understand market trends and identify potential buying or selling opportunities, but I think ultimately your psychology at work is your gut feeling at work and personal experience plays a large part in your decision making. It's always good to have a thorough approach to trading and be open to learning new things. So, don't worry about breaking any rules and keep exploring the crypto market!",

Thanks in advanceYou know how to read chart? That means you are a forex, commodity or stock trade. Those deals with price of something. Crypto also deals with price of something which are cryptocurrencies. If you use chart for those, you will also use chart for crypto analyses. But I will advice you not to go beyond bitcoin for now. Learn bitcoin price history and use the charts and indicators reading of forex for bitcoin technical analysis too. Fundamental and sentiment is also in crypto. Take note of that.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on April 13, 2023, 01:48:14 AMHowever, personally I feel only technical analysis is not enough for your trading.

If an asset has good fundamentals, even if your technical analysis is wrong, you can hold it (like Bitcoin) and still have chance to get profit  by holding your bitcoin long enough to cover your mistake in technical analysis.Fundamental analysis is very important, but it is not about people learning it like technical analysis, it is more about reading news, known how CPI and interest rate can affect the price of bitcoin and crypto in short term, relating exchange inflow and outflow of a coin on exchanges to possible price drop or increase, and also knowing if miners and investors are accumulating or not etc.Quote from: Lamkuthang on April 13, 2023, 04:50:56 AMWelcome to the forum.
