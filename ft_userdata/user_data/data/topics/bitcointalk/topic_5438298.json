So if you have problem reindex or got error, maybe that msising something, better to back up all bitcon folder, not only blocchain folder.",

That is the whole point of bitcoin: you either can independently verify the state of the network, check all incoming and outgoing transactions and make sure there are no dishonest double spends or the thingy you are looking at is not a decentralized electronic cash system that no one can control or hack into. Of course, if you are not comfortable with the slow speed of validation, nothing can stop you from trying to speed it up. To decrease the amount of time that is needed to make full validation or other costly operation such as reindexing, you can simply move part of your files to a faster storage device, namely a solid state drive (SSD).

The screenshot that i have said the following:Welcome xWelcome to Bitcoin Core.As this is the first time the program is launched, you can choose where Bitcoin Core will store its data.Bitcoin Core will download and store a copy of the Bitcoin block chain. Approximately 8 GB of data will be stored in this directory. The wallet will also be stored in this directory.Use the default data directorye Use a custom data directory:[mnt/61CCC2CO311E1DCA/Bitcoin392 GB of free space available.Directory already exists. Add /name if you intend to create a new directory here.            When you click OK, Bitcoin Core will begin to download and process the full Bitcoin block chain(420GB) starting with the earliest transactions in 2009 when Bitcoin initially launched.This initial synchronisation is very demanding, and may expose hardware problems with your computer that had previously gone unnoticed. Each time you run Bitcoin Core, it will continue downloading where it left off.If you have chosen to limit block chain storage (pruning), the historical data must still be downloaded and processed, but will be deleted afterward to keep your disk usage low.v Limit blockchain storageto 2GB -_ (sufficient to restore backups 6 days old)@ Cancel @ok",
