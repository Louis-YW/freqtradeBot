Do you have plan to achieve this? Given the token are gained for free, I think most will dump it right away at the slightest chance without considering any value, since they get it for free.",

You are correct in that all tokens were distributed for free, via airdrop, faucet, or social giveaways around the Ravencoin ecosystem. We're currently working on an exchange listing & trading support within the Ravencoin ecosystem to test your theory. Many of the top holders are active Ravencoin users who see value in the project, but time will tell if they'll quickly sell their holdings or only trade in fractions.",

I also peek at your channel and umm... there aren't much members on it? Those on the channel are all of the holders?",

How do you plan to set the initial price? Will it be like the old projects that \"leave it to the market\" where the first person selling the token will set the price? Or will it be predetermined through a system like a vote?",
