It allows a deeper contact with reality and a more immersive and efficient learnship method, which will attach knowledge to your memory much superiorly than reading books, articles or watching videos on the internet. I just recommend starting with low sums of money, so you mitigate risk of losses. Once you gain more experience and confidence dealing with Bitcoin, you can raise your budget destined to the investment.It's important to make progress, slowly, but surely, accordingly to the knowledge acquired along the way. Also, to learn on practice is a good method for young people who have a lot of free time, so they spend it doing micro tasks on the internet, which will reward them some satoshis, so they can make their first transactions, getting used to Bitcoin's features and learning its basic characteristics.",

Take for instant as an adult one of your responsibilities for those younger one close to you is give them some of your experience especially on things that may hurt them so that they can learn. There are so many experiences of people out there about Bitcoin and how they have been able to either avoid mistakes or made mistakes, you should do lots of research, learn from other mistakes so you don't learn the hard way(experience).

You've made some really good points OP but when next you're relating trading with Bitcoin you need to be specific on whether it's P2P trading that involves buying and selling or the trading that requires on to speculate about the price movement of the market, P2P trading is cool especially when the persons holding  is due for profit taking, maybe they could just sell some portions via P2P on exchanges. But the trading that involves market speculation is not something cool with Bitcoin and people shouldn't involve it with Bitcoin cause the risk is very high, one can speculate the market with other coins but not with Bitcoin cause it's very valuable and shouldn't be losed easily, Bitcoin is precious, it's scarce and should be held for longer time instead of trading with it.",

But while they start, they have to start with small investment capital so if they make mistakes that would result in them losing money, they won't get hurt that bad. They are all in the learning process and as beginners, mistakes should be welcomed so they can learn more and make researches where necessary.
