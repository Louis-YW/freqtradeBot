  "content": "I run an extremely large retirement plan here in the United States (well, I am the sole advisor on it).  I got asked the other day during a large presentation I was putting on, if you could give a young investor one piece of advice, what would it be.  What immediately came to mind \"never listen to your friends, family or co-worker when it comes to investment advice.  If I had a penny for every bit of piss poor information I've heard one co-worker tell the next or uncle tell his nephew or whatever, I would be a filthy rich man.  Why do I bring this up?  A buddy of mine whom I love to death, as nice as I can possibly say, is an idiot.  Two summers ago we went to the Nelly Ja Rule concert together and someone brought up bitcoin, he said \"oh that's a scam\".  Knowing full well he knows NOTHING about cryptocurrency or finances ..I didn't even hit him with the \"ok so bitcoin is a scam, fair enough, what's the blockchain?\" NO ONE has ever been able to explain that who's told me bitcoin is a scam.   I just told him it's not.  He's knows I'm an FA and pretty sure he knew I was pretty \"deeply\" involved in the bitcoin community.  He texts me today \"do you know anything about bitcoin\" , well last night.  I said in fact yeah, I know quite a bit.  I asked why \"A friend told me I should buy some\".  I sent him a voice message back ... \"Sean, I'm a huge bitcoin supporter, I've been around for over a decade now and truly fell in love with it for the tech.  But here's the thing, it's inherently NOT an investment, and you shouldn't consider it until you get your finances straight. He has NOTHING to his name.  He just for the first time in his 40 plus year life got a decent job.  I know he doesn't know how to properly bank even (credit unions for check, online banks for savings...AVOID the big banks like BOA, Chase, Wells Fargo etc).  I also know he doesn't have knickle in any \"backbone investments\".  What I mean buy that is your long term financial plans.  401k's, IRA's etc.  I said once you get that on track, then sure I think you should probably put a few bucks in to it, but until then.This is a reminder that your friends likely don't know jack shit about investing, and seek advice from a licensed professional, not some jerk off co-worker who tells everyone to do the same thing even though everyone's situation is different.Let's not forget bitcoin is NOT a replacement for traditional finances.  A write up both myself and Greg Maxwell contributed to heavily.  Greg is cypherpunk, he sits at the table with best of the best in the \"game\"...so no need to take my word for it.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288768.0As always, my DMs are open.  I'm willing to help provide guidance.  I will never ask for a fn cent.  It's my passion helping people (more so animals, but people too lol).  I've offered my services many times here before and I think ONE person has taken me up on it.  I'm a 20 year FA, Series 6, 7, 63, 65, life, health, CRC licensed.  I'm no fool, take advantage of free help.  But my main stressor is don't be dumb, set your foundation first,then buy bitcoin.",

They think if the return is higher than inflation rate released by central bank, they're in profit. Like, if the inflation rate is 4%, they're making 3% per year if the return is 7%. But, the real inflation rate is actually around 10% per year.It's really hard to find investment that pays higher 10% per year, Bitcoin is the solution and it's the lowest risk for me compared to business, low cap stock, and P2P lending.",

I just disagree with something.While I don't know your friend at all, you obviously know him better than me, I don't think he needs to have all the things you mentioned before he puts money into Bitcoin. A better advice would have been for him to learn about Bitcoin and understand it before he could put money into it. If after understanding bitcoin, he still wants to invest in it, then fine, but he shouldn't do it because a college or whoever said he should do it. Also taking financial advice from relatives who actually know what they're talking about ain't a bad thing as long as you do your own research. You for example are a financial analyst and you probably have relatives or friends or nephews, you've have decades of experience so you definitely know what you're talking about when you give financial advice, so if the person giving the advice is like that then I don't think its wrong to take it seriously. All you have to do is do your own research and seek a second or even third opinion if you have to. I don't think you have to have your life or finances in order first before buying bitcoin. As long as you know and understand what bitcoin is, and have a source of income where you also have enough disposable income, you can buy bitcoin by DCAing if you want to.",

At this point is going to look asive you introduced them to a scam project. mean while they didn't follow the instructions that was given to them, this is why most of them always end up losing in bitcoin investment.Of course for you to have  peace you just need to stay on your lane because sometimes telling people about bitcoin investment is like inviting problems to ourselves, so to avoid being pressured over nothing or getting unnecessary headache. We just need to keep our investment plans to ourselves without telling anyone about it.",

In the end, they either sold below their buying price because they badly needed the money or lost it because they took a pic of their backup phrase and kept it in their phones. So, I definitely agree to \"set your foundation first, then buy Bitcoin.\" Or perhaps Bitcoin might not be for you.Theses sets of individuals fall into the category of 'i saw them doing it, so I thought to give it a try'. These people do not have the knowledge and won't bother to make a little research about it but because they heard that it makes one filthy rich, their interest becomes piqued.I like the fact that the op, despite his love for the tech surrounding Bitcoin and also his position as a financial advisor to pressurize this friend into making a decision he knows nothing about and could eventually regret in the future, but rather steered him in a path that's more 'safe' and suitable to the friend's personality because people like that may not know how to handle the pressure of when the markets start heading on a downward spiral or maybe a loss so it's best to use your head first and not get carried away by emotions or the excited chatters of financial freedom from coworkers.",

Apparently, co-workers, Friends and family often only suggest and/or gives advise to anyone who they think needs it specifically on what they either regret not investing in or what they wish to invest in even though they are obviously limited in knowledge of (whatsoever investment) the invest they sure will offer you without any considerations. And of course I wouldn't also gree 100% percent that one shouldn't take the advise of co-workers friends and family because sometimes this friends and family could be you @OP with all the in-depth knowledge hence saying one shouldn't take such advise might equally mean your relatives friends should disregard your advise \"if all things being equal\" Well it is meant to be implied, though I should have been more specific of course as I've seen a few people mention this same thing..of course if your friend, co-worker, family member is a licensed professional then by all means, that's of course not what I'm saying. Now there are people who aren't advisors who are extremely knowledgeable.  My good buddy, someone I look up to and see as a bit of mentor @LesbianCow is probably the most well rounded financially savvy person I've ever met.  You should take advice from someone like him.  However, the issue becomes, how do you know that they are as financially savvy as they say.  I do, because of my trade..but the average Joe wouldn't.  There in lies the issue.  Also guys, there's a HUGE difference between a veteran advisor and a \"Financial Rep\" (someone with say just a series 6 and 63), and an insurance agent (someone with a life and health insurance license).  They are NOT reputable sources of financial information. Again, as always, my door is always open. Of course this are probably the words I wanted to read in the first or second paragraph of the post and sure you can edit and include them to make things more balanced and reliable. I often seek advice from a friend who is more like a brother now because his very smart with investment with and knows so much that I always want to hear his opinion on all my ideas before I could carry them out, yeah there is always a sign to know if one is really good/professional financial advisor but if one can't spot this traits then looking at what one have achieved can be a good way to know if someone's advise will be meaningful or not.",
