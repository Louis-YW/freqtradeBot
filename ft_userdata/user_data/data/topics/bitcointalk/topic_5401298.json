TIA!I don't know how you calculated these percentages, but it is not how Bitcoin works or calculating transaction fees. It does not depend on the amount of money, but rather the number of input and output addresses, and the type of addresses.Does your transaction have a lot of inputs? In other words, are you receiving a lot of small payments, running a faucet or receiving a lot of transactions?In general, if you do not have a lot of input, and your addresses started with bc1, you will not pay a lot of fees.",

      "body": "You don't have to rely and use the estimates that Electrum suggests. Set your own fees. Right now while writing this post, mempool.space shows an almost empty mempool with less than 700 unconfirmed transactions. That means that 1 sat/vByte is all it takes (probably). But if you have hundreds of UTXO, it can be problematic. If you set the fees to 1 sat/vByte or 1.1-1.2 sat/vByte just in case the mempools start to fill up and that would give your transaction a bit of an edge compared with everyone else paying only 1 sat, is it still too expensive for you?",

In this case, 2fa can't be the cause because Electrum will send the 2fa fee to trustedcoin as a second/extra output not as a transaction fee, hence the too high fee warning message will not be displayed.I believe the problem is with the denomination as nc50lc suggested. Electrum uses mBTC as denomination by default and most likely OP entered the amount he wants to send in BTC.",

This part is very important - it's not some one-time \"lifetime\" fee to enable 2FA in Electrum [which I believe would be much more logical].If for any reason the BTC price skyrockets in a few years and there is no corresponding update from Electrum developers, people could easily end up paying around $10 for each 2FA wallet.I'd say that 2FA should be abstracted out to an Electrum plugin with license keys that you have to buy from TrustedCoin for like 10 bucks (once/Electrum installation, as opposed to per-wallet)",

It is received from the TrustedCoin server in which case it could be updated any time to lower the fee.",

It only suites those with some technical knowledge of how bitcoin works and how to safely set something like this up. But I'd argue that someone who is \"technically savvy\" using a simple cold storage (with single sig like P2WPKH) using an airgap system is better and cheaper since their transaction size would be smaller too.",
