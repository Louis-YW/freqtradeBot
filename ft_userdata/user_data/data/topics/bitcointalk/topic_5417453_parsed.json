In addition to this piece of advice, with which I agree, I would suggest you to go for the best known casinos in the field and avoid using services with strange names and urls: this is a clear warning sign (if they can't afford to pay for a good domain, why would you trust them and give them your money?).If you are still not convinced or don't want to do your own thorough research, pick up any of the non-tagged casinos advertised in this forum, read over their T&Cs just to be sure you don't do anything that would legitimise them to hold your funds, and have fun responsibly.",

Few years ago I lost a huge amount of money that I saved for a long time..Your best bet is to work your way up slowly, keep the balance on your casino / sportbook account as low as possible if you're not betting with it at the time and don't bet too big. You should really define how you think you were scammed as well, because some people just cannot accept losing and blame the house when they should clearly understand that the odds are stacked against them. If you lost money because of your betting patterns, that is on you. If you lost money because the casino disappeared overnight, you're right to be annoyed. However all of the casinos advertised here (except 1xbit & 1xbet) that have lots of regular feedback and dozens of pages worth of discussion should be as safe as they come. They are turning over hundreds of thousands, if not millions in bets every day, so it doesn't make sense for them to disappear.",

If you have some specific requirements you may need to scour more (or maybe even find a new thread for casinos) if needed but I believe it should have a general list of trusted casinos. I'd recommend after finding a casino to skim through their ANN thread here (if there was one) and to look them up in review sites just to crosscheck whether they really are trustworthy or not, as well as to look at some of their possible problematic cases that they were able to resolve so you have an idea whether they're doing something or not when an issue pops out.
