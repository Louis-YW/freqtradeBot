(so, @dkbit98, if this is a reason to ignore me, it's up to you, I am playing fair and notifying you).I was already thinking on this back then, but I made my mind just now and I've also done it now: I've cleaned up my ignore list.It was not only as a \"second chance\" gesture (Merry Christmas!), it was also done in order to make sure I won't get into troubles with unresponsive \"Ignore users settings\" page.Yeah, I also think that some may have improved in the past years (it's my first such cleanup), but I know that some will think that it's highly unlikely such things happen.As a matter of fact I've already added back one user, so please don't be too harsh with me; the show goes on.",

It had though nearly 500 entries.I've read about people who couldn't open that settings page when reaching bigger numbers (I think that it was 2000).

There is a trend where a lot of bounty hunters are starting to take advantage of the kindness and generosity of merit source to earn some merit to be eligible to apply for signature campaign, this trend has increased and it is true that I have seen them trying to stay on threads that allow them to get some merit.I don't know why this could become the new standard and what the considerations are, but I don't want it because basically there are a lot of users who deserve to be on the ignore list forever.

Though this is a little off topic, I remember receiving a PM from a member who told me something similar about being given an ultimatum.He said figmentofmyass (yes the one with several accounts rolled on to various campaigns including at least three known farmed accounts rolled on to the Chipmixer at the same time) had told him to add me to his distrust/exclusion list otherwise figmentofmyass would exclude him.The member never gave in to threats or blackmail, he did not exclude me but a short while later when the known farmed accounts of figmentofmyass were exposed in this thread, I realised I must have tagged one or more of his farmed accounts (that he was trying to build up) with negative trust therefore he took the step to try to mitigate his losses and resorting to threats in order to achieve his objective. To this day I do not know how many people he contacted to try to get them to exclude me but at least one member did let me know.Basically, regardless of which members might be involved in any case (and not being specific about your case with dkbit98), I think it is petty conduct for one member to say to another they will be added to an ignore list if they do not do such and such as instructed especially if it means controlling who you can or cannot even post to. That in itself is tantamount to blackmail.I do not know who Jerry is but you excluding or ignoring him and others has to be your own decision and not that of someone that does not like Jerry or others you post to.Quote from: NeuroticFish on December 29, 2022, 09:20:12 PMQuote from: 2double0 on December 29, 2022, 09:12:02 PM@NeuroticFish, such a nice way to wish Merry Christmas while throwing away grudges and hard feelings out of your heart and mind for the users on your ignore list (especially for dkbit98).I think that something was misunderstood. dkbit98 was never on my ignore list.
