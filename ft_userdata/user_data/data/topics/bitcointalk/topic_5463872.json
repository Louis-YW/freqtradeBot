      "body": "There will be for sure a new bull market in the coming months, but we can not also over look the fact that we are already on the bearish season, Bitcoin price is already down by more than 10% over the past days, and same with ETH but ETH seems to be recovering by 5%+ from what it have previously dump with after the recent news of it getting approved by the SEC on Bitcoin ETF. It is just a matter of time for the crypto market to recover again, maybe before the end of September we might see a green market again, as of the month of August I don't see any great price upward movement coming soon.",

Bitcoin and Ethereum almost dropped 10%. Bitcoin was pushing another coin to be dumped. Please look at this https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/spacex-sold-373m-worth-of-bitcoin-acquired-in-20212022-report-3156924Bitcoin needs a lot of volume to push it back again to the 29k -30k. One of the companies that holds a lot of btc was just liquidating its crypto. Im not even sure what's gonna be the future of bitcoin. I can consider spacex leaves crypto is bad signal.We must be patience until market turns to be bullish again soon. Quote from: shitpost pioneer on August 19, 2023, 11:17:12 PMBut Bitcoin and Ethereum are still up from previous gains. It is very difficult if we will have new bull market or new bear market ahead. The price of bitcoin and ethereum are still very strong at this moment but it seems like that it's lack of buying volume. This is not bad but i hope there will be more volume to come for bitcoin. It may stuck in the same place this time. Quote from: shitpost pioneer on August 19, 2023, 11:17:12 PMWhat is your personal expectation? Slowly but surely crypto will be going up again in the future. The market being shaken by the dump from one of big company in the world. I would not be surprised to see that everything turn into the red due to the bitcoin dump.",

If everyone (or most people) who own Bitcoin now, do not sell it, while many new people buy it, it will result in a big market demand and it's a very good base to start an extended bull market on.",

      "body": "Basically, we repeated the pattern we've seen already in March to June (when Bitcoin fell slowly from 30K to 25K). The difference is that the Bitcoin Dominance in this sub-cycle is substantially higher, this means altcoins are in a bear market since March already.I believe there are however some signs to be optimistic:- BitVol (implied volatility)/EthVol. Even if very recent volatility is growing again, these indicators are still very low. Low BitVol and EthVol values always preceded bull runs in the past (at least since 2019). But sometimes there were short dumps before the bullish turn, so we could be in such a situation again.- Possible double Bitcoin bottom at 25K. This could stabilize the whole market again.- Possibly, a volume uptrend after August with positive outcome for BTC and altcoins.",

It's a Chinese belief but knowing how big its economy is and its worldwide contribution then I won't be surprised if many non-Chinese are also practicing the same beliefs when it comes to the open market. There were years also in the past when I used to sell nearly all of my holdings in favor of USDT and then buy I'll just buy again later. Lately, I am starting from scratch so my holding is not big and it's probably the same reason why I am not very sensitive and forgot the ghost month. Anyways, at least I am able to accumulate more altcoins and bitcoin this time.",

But if you are a holder, then nothing to worry cause everyone knows after the ghost month it will be the real market movement. This drop is now occuring due to that reason but as September approaches that will be the start of a new market trend.If you got more stables then you could add many altcoin in this bargain sale.",

What is your personal expectation? Despite the price decline of Bitcoin and major altcoins, I was not worried yet nor I should have to. I was aware of the possible drop and I guess we all know about it because we are here in a volatile market. And to say that 2023 is in the recovering year for crypto and even during the time of the bull season, price corrections are still present. It is not wondering why the situation goes like this as FUDs certainly have a huge impact on the market trend. But this is not the reason to think and assumes that we are turning back bearish again, I was still optimistic for the upcoming days.",

What is your personal expectation? If you browse the price chart of Bitcoin during April to June this year. Bitcoin price slide from 30k to 25k on same manner but it recover slowly after that. There's a bad news that time about inflation or something but the price recovered after a few days of 25K support hold the dip.I expect price recovery soon because there's no real bad news in crypto space unlike previous heavy that is really backed by bearish news.",

I won't have to panic about such slight drop as 10% on bitcoin or etheruem. Bitcoin move from around $29k to $26k is not much to fuss about. In fact some whales are still keeping their cups open to make a DCA on further drop because the larger aim is next year's halving and not really what is happening now. The bull run for next year is predicted to be massive and speculated to jump into 6 digits, that is going to be massive",
