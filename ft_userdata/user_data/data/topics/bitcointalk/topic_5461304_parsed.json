If you are a long term holder, what is the difference between $27k and $29k? I mean, the difference is not too big for you to consider and you should use the DCA strategy instead of waiting. If you are a trader, I think you should analyze and draw your own conclusions instead of asking someone. Bitcoin has always been, it remains unpredictable and no one will have a crystal ball to answer your question.",

We know Bitcoins are limited in numbers; hence, if the demand to buy or acquire them increases, in order to meet the demand, the price goes up. Similarly, the reverse also happens when demand is low and the price falls. Now if we see Bitcoins struggling in the 29k to 30k USD range, So yes, there are both possibilities that Bitcoins might fall to 27k USD or even rise in price.",

Yes, demand influences the price, but not because of deflation, but because of expectations that the price will fall or rise. I think 27k is likely because it's not much less than it is now. For example, if there is a market panic, the price could fall even lower.",

If we will say no, do you have a strategy?You are creating a thread with a low quality post on it. Just asking a question? For what reason? Will you make a move if it will goes down below $27,000? If yes, then good for you, but just to take note, we can't predict the market, and no one can, so better make a plan if just in case that price will be reached a few weeks from now because it seems like the momentum of Bitcoin towards the upwards is slowly fading away, and we've seen some drops on it's price already. Right now Bitcoin is at $29,200, so it seems like the $30,000 will act as a psychological resistance again in the short term, and $27,000 might be the support.Either way, I hope OP will make a strategy base on what we are saying.",

Prior to the uptick to $31,000++, during the big hype around the Black Rock news, the price of Bitcoin around around $26,000-$28,000 give or take. And now that that hype has gone or somewhat it the news has been buried, there could be possibility that the price could go back to where it used to be, around that price and then we might see a sideway pattern again.So that's how I see it for now, so again, this is just my wild and educated guess that there is a possibility that it might return to that range and there could be a price drop. Nevertheless, everyone is welcome to his own opinion and may disagree with me.",

The lowest price in 30 days on the chart was $29,045.Yeah, The 29K price support is holding up well for the last couple of weeks since Bitcoin keeps bouncing back whenever the price reach that level but right now the price is consolidating near the support which means that there’s danger for a potential price slide when the start of the August turns bad with the FOMC interest rate new high.27K is still far away but it’s really very reachable once bulls lost total control on the trend. Many is hoping that there will be a price recovery next motnh after the FOMC vmeeting impact to the price.Answering the title, It’s possible but not guaranteed",

And the price looks very strong at $29k and up. So I also don't see a decline unless we've seen another round of negative news.And for me, $30k is a great price range, it's a round number and we all know that it's difficult to break that price. However, if again we reach it then maybe we can go up a notch and break that $31k and sustain that run. So for now the biggest barrier is $31k and that will be then next target and not a decline to $27k or lower.",

What we're observing is investors trying to stir the market and capitalize on any panic they can cause before every FED meeting. We can't blame them, it's how they make money.I don't care what they manage to drop bitcoin to in the short term. Selling it now is selling to BlackRock and other big investors who know what's coming. The closer to the halving we are the more people will decide not to sell and then you'll see what happens.",

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price is still at the $29k level and is still getting red this weekend so there is a possibility that the decline will continue as usual.But if that happens, what will you do? Are you going to panic and sell all your Bitcoins? I hope you don't because it is a loss you will regret because the price of Bitcoin could immediately increase and return to its high price again.It's better for you to be reasonable and follow the market movements and prepare your money to buy more Bitcoins than before. It was a great move to start buying Bitcoin during deep downturns. We probably won't see another low in the future, so take your time buying Bitcoins.",

We are getting more and more with the new ATH, if there are some corrections happening it is very natural. Even as low as $27k might happen, but we need to be prepared with our reserve funds. Buy and hold for the long term, it doesn't get any better than that. We just need time to reach the main goal which is the new ATH. Everything will be fine.",
