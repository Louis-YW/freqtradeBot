Financial incapability is a reason that this can happen. If the woman know that if she allow the babies real biological identify known that it will affect the training of the child including education, she might keep quiet to it and allow the man who has the financial capacity to train the child .Hatred for the baby papa is another of the reasons. She may have given birth out of unreadiness to the father of the child but got married else where thereby having hatred for the man who is not aware of the child.",

To ruin the man out of anger,To get some kind of fame and attention if the man is popular,To get some kind of financial benefit if he rich,Also, because there is no serious punishment for false accusation yet. The recent case of Former Manchester City footballer Benjamin Mendy breaks my heart. A false rape accusation has ruined his career. He was even fortunate not to get a jail term while he was innocent. Many innocent people have gone to jail because they were falsely accused of rape. The false accuser was not fined, asked to pay damages, or sent to prison. This is one of the main reasons for the rise of false rape accusations. If false accusers are sentenced to jail for this wicked act, such attitude will reduce. In most cases that involve rich victims, these accusers are targeting financial benefits.QuoteWhat other reasons do you think make women accuse men falsely for rape?False rape accusation is also triggered by racism. Sometimes when some persons or authorities want to destroy the career and wealth of a foreigner, they use false rape accusation charges. QuoteInfertility in partner,Still keeping relationship with ex,Infidelity,Wickedness.What other reasons make women allow a man raise children that they know do not belong to them? Infertility should be one of the reasons why most women get pregnant with other men and keep it secret. When a woman has waited for years without pregnancy, they might want to have sex with another man to check if they are fruitful. When they get pregnant they have no option but to keep it secret. Infidelity is another cause. Some women might have had sex with other men due to lack of self-control and they are not even aware of who the father of the child is because they are also having sex with their husband.",

      "body": "Falsely accusing a person of rape and sexual assault is relatively dangerous and serious here in my country, because the prisons are run by gangs which do not hesitate on punishing those who allegedly assaulted women and children.It is a well know thing here, that the inmates would physically and psychological punish those accused of such crime until there is nothing left of them to be recognized. It is one of the reasons that being falsely accused here can lead to lethal consequences, culturally people here are inclined not to question the accusation coming from a woman in terms of sexual violence.

What other reasons do you think make women accuse men falsely for rape?Infertility in partner,Still keeping relationship with ex,Infidelity,Wickedness.What other reasons make women allow a man raise children that they know do not belong to them?  First question :1. For revenge because the guy is a scoundrel2. because they have a mental illness3. because they were paid to do soSecond question :1. They love their husband but think that he does not have a very interesting genetic heritage (too small, having a genetic disease which may affect the baby...)2. Because at one point things weren't going too well with their husband and they got pregnant with another. They think telling the truth would break a family unnecessarily.3. Because they think their husband will be a good father to their childrenI have a question too : What authorizes a man to abandon his pregnant wife with his child? Or never caring about his child once it's born?",

Sometimes reason for this is to gain a financial support when the man who is responsible for the pregnancy is not financial buoyant,  some women would want to put it on their male friend that is financial stable who have been having affair together. I think women do this because of fear of how they will be able to raise money to take care of the child.",

Eh, some women can be so vain and selfish that they can go the extra mile. Some may not be selfish, they just feel secure with the way the guys treat them and while the dude may want the relationship to be on a platonic level, they want something more and as such might decide to accuse him of rape just so they can spoil his rep. More like a ' if I can't have you, no one can\" mentality.But in another angle, the dude could be responsible but due to his money and popularity, can clear any case against himself and look like the victim.",

Certainly this isn’t the norm, but I can see it as a possible explanation in some cases. There’s also rejection when women seek to further the relationship or more nefarious reasons like extortion, but I’d like to believe a majority of rape accusations are true.",

She is also looking at the shame of what people will say to her if they found out she slept with someone not \"worthy\". Women have so much reasons they will decide to keep such secret away.",

In same room and she's naked and threatened to scream if I do not go to bed with her.
