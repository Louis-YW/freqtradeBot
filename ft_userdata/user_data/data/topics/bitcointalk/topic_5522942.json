  "content": "Jon Collins-Black, a web entrepreneur and early Bitcoin investor, made his fortune by selling a website and hodling his Bitcoin from the early days.He wrote a book, There's Treasure Inside, which contain all the instructions and hints required to get the loot.Quote from: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jon-collins-black-treasure-hunt-book-bitcoin-b2663044.htmlCollins-Black commissioned five unique puzzle boxes, which have been scattered across the United States, four of similar sizes and then one larger box containing the lion’s share of the fortune.Quote from: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jon-collins-black-treasure-hunt-book-bitcoin-b2663044.html“We’re in a digital world and what I’ve put together is an analog adventure,” he says of his new book There’s Treasure Inside. “All you need is a book, some water and some shoes.”The treasure contains one of the physical Bitcoins by Casascius.So, why did this guy do this? Just for fun!Quote from: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jon-collins-black-treasure-hunt-book-bitcoin-b2663044.html“At the end of the day, there’s value to the excitement and the joy of the experience,” he says. “That sounds like cliché but for me, when I was searching for Forrest Fenn’s treasure, it was the idea of it that was most exciting. If I had found the treasure it would have been euphoric, but I don't know if it would have exceeded the total joy that I had just through the whole process of it.”",

Different things blend in to create an adventure worth remembering.There are relics of the old, an Olympian medal, and there also should of been something from Einstein, but Jon lost it in a bidding war   ( source ).Interesting to see what would be in the biggest chest.",

Even during the pandemic, he was already launching a project to have people treasure hunt. But we have to realize that this kind of project requires time and effort which is why it is only now that he got to launch a project as big as this was. The reason why bitcoin was along the items to be hunted is so that different kinds of people will find something they are interested in and participate in the treasure hunt.These are what said to be in the stash: A fourth-century BCE gold Greek laurel, A coin designed and minted by Pablo Picasso, A rare lunar rock specimen, A Michael Jordan 1986 rookie card and the bitcoin of course. It is really interesting and I am quite excited to see who would find these items.",

Exactly what I thought, the strategy is quite cliche to sell an autobiography book, in my opinion. Nevertheles, it is not a bad way to drive sales, a good way to boots its sales to people who loves adventure and riding the wave of hype of Bitcoin nowadays, kudos to him for having this idea. I believe, if later there will be news of a person who succeeded in solving the hints and find the loot, this will be a big news and boots this book's popularity and sales even more. I'd like to give this book a try when the news is out and hearing what people think about this book beforehand.",
