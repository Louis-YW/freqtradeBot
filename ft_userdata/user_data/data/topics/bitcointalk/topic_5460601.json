      "body": "You could discuss in more details how the Bitcoin adoption is advancing on Roatan. You could tell Bitcointalk what you can buy with Bitcoin and in what type of shops. It would be interesting to know what's the price difference between purchasing with fiat vs crypto. Additionally, what wallets are the most popular on the Island? Mobile, desktop, airgapped, hardware...? Another interesting point of discussion would be how different generations are reacting to Bitcoin. Are the older and senior citizens using it at all, and how are they coping with it?There is enough to create a brand-new thread or compile everything in this one.Also, tell us more about the goals of Roatan Bitcoin Experience tour, and what you hope to achieve?",

I've checked the island and it looks promising, especially since it's a Carribean island although I don't get why make it a bitcoin island, maybe expound on that stuff too, maybe I'm not the only one who wants to know the reason why Roátan should become a bitcoin island.",

It would also be useful if you put some links and pictures to introduce the island as well as the services that accept payment by bitcoins. This would be a great promotion of bitcoin by visiting exciting tourist areas and services that accept bitcoin payment.",

It is perhaps not the best main promotion, perhaps the fine print.Caribbean airports, you get (or you see, you hear) things like: \"Cambio Dolares...\" because although you can pay with the green currency, USD, they are not accepted in all places, or yes, but there are losses, so changing to local currency is the best, then! use an ATM.That is, if you hear a person saying: (*)\"I exchange dollars for Fiat...\" ignore it, you must use the regular channels, I would do the same with this OP.Unless it is presented as it should, fiscal address, who they are... that is, for terms of bitcointalk a white paper.I do not doubt (maybe)that it is a sincere project, but given that You arrived and waited 24 hours to make that very poor post, I would say that it is someone hunting, I repeat again, hopefully it is an entrepreneur who wants to develop the idea of bitcoin, if so, thank you, but do your best to serve customers.Welcome to the forum.(*) If you hear bitcoin, mmhh, don't turn your head, no. Come on, not all Caribbean islands are like this, but for those places with low traffic and I say low traffic because there are paradisiacal places that the locals themselves know that tourists are their source of income, but with so many islands the competition is high and there are tourists who can't always go to the best places, so they choose to travel to the Caribbean, ok, but what an island. Then, as always common sense.",

How possible is this,I feel amazed and I hope that almost every country will learn from this practice. I have not seen a place where bitcoin is celebrated in my country,maybe as time goes on our government will adopt bitcoin and make an event where bitcoin will be agenda of the day and also will allow bitcoin to be used freely by citizens. But from my research,I have seen that it isn't everywhere in that country that you can use bitcoin freely without fiat currency, only on the Roatan Island. I wish I will be part of that tour to see how many people uses bitcoin and also to know the challenge that they have when using bitcoin. I love the project.",

For example, if you are on the island of Bitcoin in El Salvador, then the laws in that country will definitely apply, and therefore strikes and other problems.Therefore, this idea of colonies makes sense if they are on the periphery, where international laws are followed, which are less stringent than the laws associated with each country, and here comes absolute liberalism.I remember @theymos talking about a similar idea.",

Roatan Bitcoin Experience tour? this is when anyone wants to go sightseeing in Routan can use Bitcoin to pay for travel? but if exactly in the area of Routan Island Bitcoin is not yet known on this island? please correct me if I misunderstood.Does this mean that Bitcoin adoption will be established in Routan island? because not a single merchant in Routan island is doing Bitcoin payment yet. But if this happens for sure it is of course good news for the Bitcoin community.",

Also, if you can share the experience of the first tour somewhere near the end of September will be great for everyone who are thinking to join in the future.And I guess since it's a Bitcoin tour, you will be charging in bitcoin and not in the local currency.",
