Given its current valuation of $7 billion, this may be the largest airdrop ever.I don't think so. Metamask may have allocated some percents only for airdrop purpose. The valuation will be determined by the price of token combined with how many distributed to the airdrop. So many rumours about MM tokens appeared again for now. I don't even think that if this token gonna be real. The chance will always there but consider about how many people who will acquired this token and the value for each token may be big. It's too early to say that marketcpa will be around 7 billion. it might be less.",

If that's going to be for real, there have been announcements already.But, to look at it now, it seems that there's no official announcement on it. I think it's going to be a big project since there are too many metamask users but I just hope that they don't go along with the path just as other wallets that have made their own tokens like TWT.It's better to stay as is.",

Well, anyways, Metamask is making its way to always have interest from the community. They'll need to keep stay on track which is why they are doing some airdrops but with the huge number of its users, the allocation is small enough to compensate the participants, and sometimes it was just ignored as it doesn't matter by many users because what they need is the good service coming from this platform. But if this is true, I hope they are true to their promises as well, otherwise, this will be the reason for distrust.",

Given its current valuation of $7 billion, this may be the largest airdrop ever.It doesn't matter how much the token is valued, even if it's $70 billion, it doesn't mean anything. The value of the Airdrop depends on how much interest the developers are willing to give to the community. Amount for community = amount of airdrop, if they don't want to give anything at all, there will be no airdrop. I don't think MetaMask will give away a generous airdrop. If they're lucky, they'll give away $30-$50 worth of tokens, no more.",
