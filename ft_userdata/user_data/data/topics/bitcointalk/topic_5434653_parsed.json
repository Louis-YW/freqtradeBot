And with apologies to the coin / collectable makers that have not fucked everyone it's still a bad situation.The coldkey was the last straw so to speak.There are now enough electronic ways of generating private keys through provable secure hardware.Get a bunch of opendimes https://opendime.com/ or satscard https://satscard.com/faq or one of the other similar devices out there and have them generate the address. Ship them with your custom coin. Make f--king sure people know that there is no private address on the coin.You can laser laser etch, engrave it, make it pretty, or if you want use a sharpie to write the address on it, who cares. The ONLY way to get to the private key at that point is by using a device that WILL TELL YOU IF THE PRIVATE KEY IS OUT THERE. It's even better since you can now DISPLAY the coin without fear of loosing the BTC on it. Because you can keep the device with the private key on it elsewhere. Someone steals the coin, it sucks but you still have your BTC.And lets not forget, even if the maker is trustworthy security holograms can suck too: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5401502End of rant.-Dave",

I am not one who cares to generate my own keys, but rely on the trust I have in others to keep them secure. Yes, that’s dumb for real amounts of btc - but most people would not sell out their life for tens of thousands of dollars. I say - let the market decide - Let the buyers buy if they want to. I prefer limited mintage and decent load values with people you trust. Don’t invest it all in one creator and roll with the punches as they will obviously come. Coldkey was my first rug pull - it fucking hurts, but if a peasant like me can keep on going - then it seems there will always be a market. I swept all but the playtoshi and Diwali - to recoup funds for I’m sure another collectible at some point (probably funding for my lealana set).",

I will not be part of this. Doesn't bother me but I wont have someone accusing me of a being a risk because I wont use a HW wallet - like you are. All I was trying to point out, after spending hours going through a bunch of cold keys, that we should come up with a better way then having to trust people. Did not mean to come off as an attack on you, just that though no fault of yours bad things could have happened. That is the point. There are people out there now refunding from what appears to be out of their own pocket. In a few months what do you think most people will remember? The theft or that smoothie setup an auction to help the people that lost funds, or that people are donating to it, or that people are going out of pocket to help those that lost funds. Sadly, I think it's just going to be people talking about the theft.Quote from: Humble Bitcoiners on January 14, 2023, 09:13:02 AMI think it's best to understand that we are many here and surely 99% or more of us are trusted & honest people....As I keep saying it's not about trust. I have trusted Mopar and will continue to trust him, I have trusted smoothie and krogoth and minerjones and a ton of other people and will continue to trust them. I have funded pieces from a lot of people. I know and have known and understand the risks. BUT and this is just me. I really think we as a collective group keep giving ourselves a bad image.2016 COINOGRAPHIC 2017 ALITIN2017 MICROSOUL2018 cryptopaperwallets.com2019 HyperionGold2020 Sol Noctis20xx Titan Mint 2022 Cold KeyAll I am trying to put out there is that there HAS to be better way then just trusting people. It's kind of like open source code and many other projects. TRUST but verify.As of now we really don't have a way of verifying. I pointed out a way that I thought might be better, there are probably a dozen other ways of doing it that I can't think of but others can. A 1oz piece of gold is a 1oz piece of gold and I can drop it on top a tester that can tell me it's contents and if it's real gold. Yes it's a few hundred dollars for the unit but if I am buying and selling a bunch of silver / gold / platinum it's worth it. Once those devices became available at those prices the fraud in those circles dropped like a rock.As of now we can't do that here. Side note, I will continue to buy these pieces. But, I stopped *selling* them for the most part. I might put up one now and then that have more collectable value but after I sold someone a Sol Noctis and Titan that were swept / could not be redeemed I stopped doing other ones. I reached into my own wallet and paid them because they didn't know the risks and I did not communicate to them the risks that I knew. If I loose it's on me, I don't want to be responsible for others loosing.-DaveEdit: Yes I lost funds on the cold keys. No, I don't want to discuss it, it's over and done I lost and am moving on. It hurts but so be it.",

But since I obviously came up a bit harsher then I wanted to towards Mopar earlier let me start again with I am not insulting or attacking anyone or any product in this entire thread. [ Except yogg, fuck him ]. I really want to come up with a better way that everyone can come close to agreeing on. I know we will never all agree 100%. But, in the process I will probably point out flaws that exist that some people may not want to think about. With the BIP38 option you mentioned it would work for your coins that you are going to keep. But you could never sell them since at that point you are just moving the trust to someone else.What I am thinking about now is combining the 1splitkey that whyfly setup https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5397602 and something else.This way you could in theory generate something that can be put under a hologram, and have something else that without the piece under the hologram is worthless.What you would also have to create is a way to verify without revealing things that should not be seen. Trying to think of (or over think) of a way of doing that. Ballet has the right idea BUT and this is a big BUT, their app is closed source: https://walletscrutiny.com/android/com.balletcrypto/Make it open source and it would be better, sill not perfect but better.And full disclosure I have a few ballet products in my collection and have used a few others.-Dave",

But also, there are merits of pre-funded collectibles and even though I thought so at first, I don't think demand for them will ever seize to exist for a few reasons (will explain later).Some improvements of transparency are necessary for any reputable project in the future creating funded items, though.",
