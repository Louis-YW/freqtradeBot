It depends on the country that your business located to apply for business license unlike online casino that has global e-gaming license globally. Your exchange will fall under the category of exchange which you will need to apply for it on each country that you want to offer your services.You can get profit on by having a customer. Make a decent marketing to get customers. Partnership is your best way to attract customers especially those project with strong community.",

I advise to dial back sir... it's best to plan out the whole thing first before you try setting up.and if by online mining, you mean cloud mining, I say forget it. It has bad rep as most of the time, it's either a scam or unprofitable.",

License? What kind of license Op you are trying to get?Haha seems like you had just brought a domain and set up a view and someone who helped with your idea really misguided you... + Buddy No one can provide the mining and Trading license except for your country's law enforcement department and IT ministry.",

Now you've got a vision to initiate in a website that's mines Bitcoin I guess?? Where you told that there are websites that mine Bitcoin??You cannot make profits from something you don't even understand properly - assuming you're being introduced innit, how do you run it? Does you know the cost of running a mining pool?... I'm surprised how people ask questions with zero understanding.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

Drop the website here so people can check the site and make some corrections and recommendation, as this how we know that you have launched an online mining site. This is where you will start from but first show us the website link in op so we can visit the site. For the trading you need advertisement for more people to visit it. And for the mining, you have to use cloud mining.",

It is possible that the OP bought one of those websites and does not know what to do with it.
