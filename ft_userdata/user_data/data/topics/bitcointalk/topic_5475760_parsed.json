  "content": "Sometimes a thing of one could generate a thing of hundreds. I was specifically triggered to make the thread after coming across this this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472871.msg63106223#msg63106223 it literally got me to turning back the hand of time.I know it is lengthy but have to bring all necessary lines best understanding.Sometimes around 2017 where I worked as a bar manager, lot of customers has been coming to spend some good times in the bar and they are always interested and feels more fun when drinking at the same time playing games such as casino. A lot of them who are not accustomed to the vicinities keep asking asking to know where they can find a casino center with a relaxable environment? And of course I keep giving them the destinations directions.So as time goes by o feel like I am loosing customers because sometimes they lives and never come back maybe it was the fact o don't have any form of fun entertainment as the games my my service place (bar).So I talked to my boss if we could have either a table tennis or a snooker board if not just to make the environment look special and unique from other bars around the vicinities but atleast it would profer to serve as other means of generating incomes which can also attract and retains customer to the company.Although my boss happened to disagree with me saying he is not seeing any good outcome on it probably easy as said but uneasy to reality proves.However I asked him of I could install one for myself maybe the incomes it generate comes to me and he permitted because I am the companies manager.I embarked on it and have 2 snooker board installed and in just 2-4month there were appreciative number of customers who comes drinking because of the snooker game andÂ  there are also some of them who only plays the game but doesn't drink.I specifically gets my profits on according to rounds played and I charges per round at $3 per single player in a round. While the game players could stake bets and gambles amongst themselves.At a time, I felt like I was at the peak of building my own casino because I was trying to save some money and have my on personal game center were there would be series of skill-based gaming and gambling.Along the lines, my boss (the CEO) sighted that I was making cool money at the gaming board and was jealous so he quit me for no reasonable reason so also I lost the lucrative dream in building the carrier because I wasn't financial fit yet.",

      "body": "Building a casino isn't just a thing to just start up one single day and requires time and money to have classes of games over there, and moreover you need a larger hall to start up your casino because when you have a very small hall there may much congestion and could suffocate people. Then boiled down to your boss, I know too well there must be spirit of jealousy when time will come because at first acquiring a snooker board should be between $1000 in our local currency and having him pulled out this amount to install a snooker board could cost him much including the shipping fee and installation.",
