IMO, it's never too late, when BTC is priced at $6000, many people are feeling it's too late, but BTC can go to $60K. BNB is currently also below the ATH price, the potential is there.Will the price drop? Anything can happen, but if you look at the current market pattern, the price movement of cryptocurrencies is in a bullish direction, but remember, global sentiment can affect price movements at any time. So prepare yourself with research, judgment, faith and a readiness to lose. because we will often see asset values drop dramatically, when crypto prices decrease.Not Financial Advice/DYOR/DWYOR",

Current market condition still not stable with Bitcoin up and down and I don't sure right time for investing in BNB.Have nice trick when investing in some coins, you can buy Binance coins with two price kinds between $280 until $300, we can't guarantee with Binance coins keep stable on higher price because any potential if Bitcoin down I sure another altcoin will back to lower price.",

Also BNB grown a lot and the highest profit that you can get assuming that it will beat its peak price was only around x3 of your investment in comparison with other project that down more than x3 in value from their peak.I knew CZ is tough but he canâ€™t do anything once huge player gang up on him and set him up with a massive trap. I highly suggest to stop investing on BNB and focus on other promising project like TON.",

Or can we expect huge price drop in this year?It should and shouldn't come back to you because you have that right, from my own point of view BNB itself has a fairly large market capitalization and includes the top 10 marketcap, so far there are many platforms that exist on the Binance network, of course the BNB ecosystem is also very large and has excellent opportunities for the future. But on the other hand Binance itself as the parent has a large scope in the crypto market and is the biggest exchange, what I fear is that binance will monopolize the crypto industry just like MT.Gox used to be.it all comes back to you to find more credible information that can make you reason why you should buy BNB .DYOR",

Since BNB is a native coin of the Binance exchange, there is no question that it has potential. If the entire cryptocurrency market doesn't crash, they won't let it down in the least. Since we are unable to provide suggestions, we may only express our opinion. Because investing in cryptocurrencies is risky at all times. BNB coin has solutions such as reduced trading fees to Binance exchange and gas fees. In light of other currencies, it is a fairly powerful coin.

A huge price drop is expected when it just came from a huge pump. I think we're done and pass that moment so, it's now time for it to see some pump in the next months to come when we go near to the halving. If you want to buy, buy it with all accountability and you have based your decision solely on yourself and not with anyone else.",

If you will ask why, it is because nobody here in God's green Earth can predict the future or what will happen in a given time.But one thing is for sure, it's not too late to buy BNB. It's much better for you to start now rather than regretting about it later for not taking the risk.",

Although technically we are still in the bear market, so if you really wanted to invest on BNB then why not?DCA is the best thing to do, we still have a year before the bitcoin halving (an event that triggers bull run), so maybe in that span of 12 months, you can accumulate and be ready for the next bull run and new all time high.

You can actually buy them if you want, that was your decision because I tell you that, I was also buying too. I did what seems best for me because I have the trust that BNB will be moving high when the bull season comes, so before it happens, I already fill my bag with potential coins to make everything ready. While it was still cheap, we never had to miss the chance. Might the price will dump but it doesn't matter as long as we are holding and waiting for the bull season.",

I donâ€™t usually suggest to buy but right now is a good opportunity to increase your holdings in preparation for the next bull market that can happen later this year or even next year. Buy and hold if you are not a trader and just set your target price, BNB will grow more and I love how they manage to rise again despite of some issues with them.",

But looking over at the BNB price currently,Â  I will personally believe that it is a good entry point, but this is according to my observation and it may be wrong since no one can predict what happens in the price of any coin. Even though the binance chain and BUSD suffered some losses a few days back, I still believe in the capacity of binance to stick around for a while and make positive gains in the future.",

I'm talking about experience here, Like BTC for example, I continue to accumulate even if we enter the bull run, or right after the halving. So I just buy whenever I can, whether thru DCA or any other method that fits my strategy. And obviously it hit a all time high in 2021. So still a period for me to make profits even if the price keeps climbing up that time.So yes, not to late, just continue to accumulate and never worry about the price drop, you can still buy more though if the price goes down hard.

Just hope that if bitcoin will stay at the current level for a few months before another rally to happen.Buying BNB looks good enough but the risk is quite big right now consider about how volatile the market is.",
