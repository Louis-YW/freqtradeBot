  "content": "I've been trying to get my boyfriend to get me some renovation equipment as I have intentions to give our bathroom a new look and he's been refusing with the claims that I can't do it and I might eventually get hurt. Lol I appreciate his care and concern, but I get bored when I'm not looking at crypto charts, sewing or doing something important and I thought to get occupied with renovating our bathroom. He refused and he's not going to do it because he's got no time. Now I'm stuck with the ugliest blue tiled bathroom ever. Guys how do you convince your partners to let you do things you want to do?",

Its not the easiest or most glamorous work and its not for everyone. If you're serious about it. Look for the hardest and most labor intensive thing that needs doing around the household. Then go do it. Home renovations are more sweat and heavy lifting than intellectual or artistic pursuit.",
