I also don't see much changing, and most will remain sceptical all the way to $30K. Eventually the bears will get it right though!Bitcoin is excellently forming new support in the 17k-23k range, being at the top of this price range at the moment. As we can see, the price is constantly trying to test this support, but the lows are always rising. That is, earlier we tested 17-18k, then 20k, then 22-21, now 23-22, we donâ€™t go lower. Ultimately, the price should break through this local resistance at 24,500 and move higher.I agree generally with this statement, though I'd break it down to $20K to $22K support level, with $22K to $24K trading range that price is now trying to build support in as it consolidates. As can be seen by volume profile, the $20K to $22K level has been the highest volume traded since ATH of $69K, while $22K to $24K is currently the third busiest trading range for volume after $30K levels. I personally don't see breaking through $24K as a guarantee as of yet, even if it seems likely now the bear market has lost it's momentum, but more so that if price does break through this level re-testing $30K prices becomes highly likely based on the volume gap that was created (due to the capitulation), even though are is some volume from late 2020 up to $25.5K, these are now \"old coins\" if not already sold.Though zooming out further I can see the broader volume range between $17.5K and $23K, the lower half of which existed longer before this year from trading in late 2020. But now this implies that dropping below $20K would more or less confirm $20K to $22K as a distribution zone, as opposed to accumulation as is currently the case, as there is now more volume traded above $20K than just below, therefore I wouldn't be as confident in continued relief rally if sub $20K prices arrive soon. We've already shifted the support level up by around $3K, so turning it into new resistance wouldn't be a good sign at all imo.Quote from: Ratimov on August 05, 2022, 06:06:55 PMI agree that for many, fixing the price of bitcoin above 30,000 will mean the end of the bear period. And this is so, because it is in this zone that the global downtrend of bitcoin takes place. If this trend is broken, then this will mean the beginning of the birth of a bull market, which will move into an accumulation phase, as it was in 2019.I guess I see things slightly differently, that of a bull run within a bear market, otherwise known as a relief rally or dead cat bounce, like in 2019. I personally didn't see 2019 as a bull market, as price made a lower high at $14K and had yet to make a higher low. But I realise for others the end of the bear market is when the low has been reached, so this is more of a subjective opinion really.Quote from: Lucius on August 06, 2022, 10:41:58 AMI may be wrong, but it does not seem to me that we should expect any kind of bull market this year, and probably not even in the first two quarters of next year. It is simply too early for that, and the global world market will only feel the real challenges in the coming months.I completely agree here, I'm not expecting any bull market for approximately a year. I'm only anticipating a relief rally (as referenced above) that could take prices to $40K to $50K. Then price can finally make a higher low maybe around $25K to $30K prices sometime early 2023. Some would call that a bull market, but I'd consider it further confirmation of a bear market with a lower high being formed.Quote from: Lucius on August 06, 2022, 10:41:58 AMI will be skeptical even if the price reaches $30k, because then we are just going back to where we were before the idea of the genius from South Korea collapsed. If that hadn't happened, maybe the bottom would have been somewhere around $25k, but that now remains only in the sphere of speculation.I will also be quite sceptical at these prices, as $30K \"theoretically\" should act as strong resistance after being support for 18 months. But also realising how much leverage there is in the market these days, then similar to 2019 this \"strong resistance\" level might end up being similar to $6K to $8K, that price broke through relatively easily, followed by continuing much higher. That said, $30K was around 3x times stronger support (based on time) than $6K to $8K support level, so it may well take 3 times longer to break through as resistance, hence not ruling out a re-test of the 200 WMA once this level is tested.",

But I realise for others the end of the bear market is when the low has been reached, so this is more of a subjective opinion really.Why does the bullrun always have to update ATH? A bull market has different properties and investor expectations, whether we are talking about a local bull run or a global one that aims to reach a new ATH. The first half of 2019, in terms of global market phases, was recovery, and in terms of local vision, it was bullish, because bitcoin rose by almost 400% in half a year. From $3 200 to $14,000.If now Bitcoin, for example, collapses to $5,000, and a few months later it grows 12 times, to $60,000, will you also say that it was not a bull run, because Bitcoin did not update ATH?As emphasised, it's a subjective opinion. It's simply distinguishing between a bull run and a bull market. I personally see the two concepts very differently, hence the subjectivity.For me, a bull run is when there is bullish momentum on short and mid-term time-frames, like at present, while a bull market is when there is bullish momentum on longer-term time-frame (ideally also all time-frames). It's not that I need to see an ATH for confirmation of a bull market no, but instead a higher low and generally a lower high being broken, therefore negating the bear market.Hence in 2019 there was no significant higher low until $3.8K was re-tested in 2020. I was confident to consider price action to be within a bull market around $10K-12K once all short, mid and long-term moving averages were aligned in bullish formation and price had broken the resistance trend-line (from $20K to $14K to $10K), which was exactly when price began to increase in a parabolic manner prior to making a new ATH unsurpsingly. Until then, in the macro picture, Bitcoin had only created lower highs, for me that is not a bull market, but instead the very definition of a bear market. Similar to how creating higher highs is the concept of a bull market. At the peak of $14K Weekly MAs had aligned themselves in bullish formation, but only to create a lower high prior to MAs crossing bearish, hence unsurprising correction.Quote from: Ratimov on August 07, 2022, 06:16:37 PMIf now Bitcoin, for example, collapses to $5,000, and a few months later it grows 12 times, to $60,000, will you also say that it was not a bull run, because Bitcoin did not update ATH?I'd call it a bull run for sure, but not a bull market. Especially if price created a lower high than corrected by 50-75%.",

Similar to how creating higher highs is the concept of a bull market. At the peak of $14K Weekly MAs had aligned themselves in bullish formation, but only to create a lower high prior to MAs crossing bearish, hence unsurprising correction.I wonder when there will be such a period of time when the bitcoin market will no longer be able to update ATH so quickly, but will be able to recover quite effectively, how would you then separate these concepts?As I said, when price is no longer making macro lower highs, then I wouldn't consider it a bear market. Especially if there are higher lows along with lower highs, then I'd consider it a neutral market at minimum. Similar to a lot of 2020 when there was both bearish lower highs but a bullish higher low. I generally don't see markets as a binary concept - bullish or bearish - but sometimes simply consolidating and therefore neutral.A good example would be Gold in around 2016 when price began to make higher lows and no longer making lower highs, but equal highs. This confirmed the neutral to bullish market the asset was in before making a higher high in 2019, while by 2017 long-term moving averages had already aligned in bullish formation indicating the likelihood of another bull-run or bull market, like what happened in 2020.Quote from: Ratimov on August 07, 2022, 08:08:03 PMIt is obvious that someday the Bitcoin market will slow down to such an extent that ATH will be updated at least once every 15-20 years. When bitcoin reaches some unrealistic price values â€‹â€‹(I hope this will happen) and the price is already close to $500,000-$1,000,000, and the capitalization exceeds, for example, 10-15 trillion dollars, then the ability to update ATH will no longer be so fast.This is true, I think an asset like Gold shows this, taking over 30 years to make a new ATH after decade long bull-run from 1970 to 1980. But otherwise I think until then it'll be more likely Bitcoin will make new ATHs more often then present, kind of similar to Nasdaq after initial dot com bubble, especially with it's current inflation halving every 4 years effecting supply 50% less each time. At some point the 4 year cycle will break due to the lack of significance of inflation halving when it's already so low, at that point it's more likely to see new ATHs with gaps of 1-2 years at most imo, similar to S&P after 2008 recession.I guess this is part of the \"super cycle\" theory that I still think is quite relevant, as a lot of emerging markets (such as Nasdaq & S&P) have followed this same pattern, once adoption reaches a level where it becomes almost guaranteed to continue, or otherwise considered \"normal\" to allocate wealth to such a market. Clearly we are very far away from that with less than 1% adoption or normalization of investing.",

However, it didn't last that long, being rejected again.So we will have to see if we can retest $25k, and how are we going to react again. And obviously, if the trendline is broken, we might be or at least the bears will be in control again.Now that price has tested $25K (ish) a few times already, I think it's due to break if tested again. Especially when price is forming higher lows and horizontal resistance, even if it's far from a guarantee. I guess the trend-line you are referring to is from the two previous lower highs, which currently puts it at $22.5K, though personally I think there is immediate support below this around $22K so I wouldn't consider it fatal if broken, as also only two points of contact for that trend-line so not convinced it's confirmed as support anyway. The fact that price continues to find support from $23K and the 200 WMA is a positive sign though. Yesterday the price was looking a bit unreliable, but already today it's back above the 20 Day MA and looks comfortable consolidating between $23K and $23.5K which is good to see.I do agree that before we break over prices, we test them a bit and that's how we make bull run. Even during the 68k period, the first time around we end up with a good amount of test, like first at 20k then end up with 30k then end up with 50k actually instead of 40k. That is why I agree that it's going to be similar this time around as well. It means that we are going to see 25k having a bit of a rough patch for us, when that happens, we will set our eyes on the next target and then the target after that and it will keep going. Not because we can't break it, we just end up doing something like that because it's not always easy for us to leave it aside that quickly and go up, need to get some good rally behind us and that testing helps us.",
