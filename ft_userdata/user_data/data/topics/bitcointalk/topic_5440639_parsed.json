  "content": "Hi guys, due to a demanding period during the last few months, I started to play online slots game for fun. In the beginning, NetEnt was my first try. I played their games for fun. However, it lacked various types of games to make me keep playing. Then, my Thai friend recommend a game provider from Asia named BBIN which I had never heard of before. I played but haven’t won the big prize or jackpot yet, but I got times of free games and I’m really satisfied with the whole time to experience their game. And I recommend Dream Bali because the fine art and free were made me enjoy it.What’s your favorite game so far, please share with me, hoping that everyone who leaves a message on this post could win a mega-win!This is the game image of Dream Balihttps://ppt.cc/fRCOkx@.jpg",

      "body": "Well, to give you the best answer... people should first know if gambling is allowed in your country.... because a lot of slot providers block certain countries from playing their games. There are not a lot of difference between all the slot providers... apart from graphics and game play... and also what RTP options they offer the casino. A lot of the games from Hacksaw gaming have a very high variance, so your probability to win often is much lower ..but your change to win something huge is much bigger.",

Now it's No Limit City but as there is so much variety I keep trying new ones.If I see another provider that I like while testing, I will post it in the thread. As for specific games, I don't have any favourites. In the end all the ones from a provider have the same style, although it changes, obviously, but I think we enjoy them more or at least we think so, when they give us positive results, and that depends more on the mathematics than on the provider or the specific slot.",

Some of them offer a high volatility games which is very hard to win but it’s pretty massive profit once you hit jackpot while others focus on medium volatility to low volatility slot games which gives you small win most of the time.I suggest push gaming, hacksawgame and Nolimit if you want high volatility games or high risk high reward games.Then Pragmatic, PlaynGo and AvatarUX if you want mid volatility games.",

I also want to share one game from BBIN, named Wealthy Girl, I got a mega-win for the first time, but this game is a high volatility game. I may only play this level for one time haha, for lack of confidence in winning more bets. and I regret not screenshot of the historic moment.

Vouching as well for Tome of Madness. I do sometimes play slots to kill time especially if I have no interested matches in sports betting;which is where I am usually betting. In TOM, the experience is decent and I had no problems with withdrawals and deposit. The display is okay but the only downside, just my cents, is that I cannot access their gambling site freely using smartphone. So I have to play through my laptop. I just saw it on foreign streamers and again, it was a decent experience for someone like me who is not so into pure luck games. But I saw other suggestions in this topic so probably I would be checking those out as well.",

I also second Daltonik's recommendation on Rise of Merlin, their stacking free spins can be fun since you can easily hit a full screen wild.Quote from: ralle14 on February 18, 2023, 12:12:53 AMI'd recommend Moon Princess and Grim Muerto both are from Play'n Go, the gameplay of Moon Princess is similar to the Tome of Madness while Grim Muerto's gameplay is similar to the Book of Dead.If you're interested in trying another provider i'd recommend the games from GameArt like 88Riches, Wild Dolphin and Dragon King these games are tough to win on as most of the time i'd be unlucky and won't win anything but they can be fun if you can get a good session going and trigger the free spins.Quote from: swogerino on February 24, 2023, 08:19:55 AMPlay n Go is also my favorite provider,the reason is simple,while they may not give you the huge wins No Limit City and Pragmatic Play gives you,which by the way are extremely rare in here,at Play n Go you will get the bonus feature of each slot more often than in other providers and they use to create a new slot a week,kinda like Pragmatic Play.It's the same for me mainly because of the less punishing experience as you tend to get several small wins.",
