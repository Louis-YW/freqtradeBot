(sometimes it is hard to find since they have a \"hidden\" fee with a crappy exchange rate)Pretty hard to tell, especially if the rates are different on different sites/exchanges, especially exchange and slippage ratesIf I were you, I would just open up the exchanges I feel I would like to use in different tabs at the same time, and then I enter the value of BTC LN I would love to exchange in each of the exchanges and proceed as though I am ready to exchange. You will be able to see with exchange has the fairest rates.",

(sometimes it is hard to find since they have a \"hidden\" fee with a crappy exchange rate)I found an old reference of exchanges that support Bitcoin LN, https://lightningnetworkstores.com/?tags=exchangeat least the cheapest exchange fee right now is if you can successfully trade BTC><LTC on the spot market. LTC withdrawals, generally only 0.001LTC. But I suggest you find out the KYC preferences first for each exchange.",

Bisq, AtomicDEX , Lightning Labs, ThorSwap.DEX platforms tend to have lower fees than centralized exchanges. Bisq and ThorSwap are both DEX platforms, so they may have lower fees compared to AtomicDEX, which is a hybrid DEX/CEX platform. However, the specific fees for trading BTC Lightning and LTC can vary depending on several factors, including the liquidity of the trading pair, the size of the trade, and the network fees for the underlying blockchain.",

It's a CEX, like Binance. So you need to:Deposit your funds to the exchange's wallet -> wait for confirmations -> go to the trading page and create the order -> withdraw.If you're interested in other instant exchanges, you can check this list (not all of them support LN though): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5218464.0Quote from: wajik-tempe on March 26, 2023, 06:17:59 AM-snip-AFAIK, Thorswap doesn't support the lightning network. I'll also have to disagree about the costs. Since they have low liquidity, you usually find yourself dealing with very bad rates.",

(sometimes it is hard to find since they have a \"hidden\" fee with a crappy exchange rate)use this site to know withdrawal fees https://withdrawalfees.com/coins/litecoin , most of CEXs dont ask for deposit fees There are rarely any hidden fees.Quote from: logfiles on March 23, 2023, 09:58:19 PMThere are a few sites that can help you swap BTC Lightning for LTC1.

Coinswap - https://coinswap.click/4. Boltz exchange - https://boltz.exchange/ (Only possible to exchange BTC LN and BTC)If OKX is option then it is the best, they ask for $0.09 (0.001 LTC) fees with $0.93 (0.01 LTC) min withdrawal amount.What makes you hodl BTC lightning or not try to convert it into Bitcoin? There are also better options instead of Litecoin.if you need Swapping then use DEXs",
