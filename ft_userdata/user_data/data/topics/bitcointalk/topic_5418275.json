What should I choose in order to feel safe??I think all exchanges under Korean regulation will do the same. Do you mean \"safe\" is want to keep trading with those coins? If yes, then just use global exchanges that doesn't only serve users from specific countries (if your regulations allow it). But you also mean that you will not be able to legally sue the risk of involvement with those coins.",

Don't forget there's many problem where DEFI got hacked until now, how can a true decentralization could be hacked? Bitcoin is a true decentralized currency but until now no one can hack Bitcoin. This mean DEFI is actually CEFI or centralized finance since they're store their coins on centralized wallet aka hot wallet. Many developer just add the word of \"decentralized\" in order to attract stupid people or newbie to invest into their shitcoin.",

Financial sector would need would need decentralization yes, but full transparency with open ledger not so much. Transactions needs to be private in layer one in order to prevent front running for example, but they need auditability too. So auditability with confidential transactions. Immutability too is a double-edged sword as transactions of security tokens for example needs to be somehow reversable.",

Not quiet but rather they are really indeed smart yet they are really just looking for some holes and it wont matter if its DEX or CEX as long they could really be able to penetrateand stole millions of dollars which is really that their main target.In talks about CEX having that delisting all privacy coins then it isnt really something surprising specially on a platform which is heavily centralized where its really normal for government to imply out laws and regulations which do really exempt anonymous or privacy coins totally on being listed on a platform.Platforms had nothing to do or able to avoid these circumstances as long they do get in line with government laws.",
