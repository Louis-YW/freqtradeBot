Did you remove the old wallet.dat every time you made a backup?Quote from: Amph on August 15, 2023, 07:18:48 AMwhat if i run a old bitcoin verion like 0.12 it should work there, myabe there is some backward compatibility issueWhether you install the old or updated version of the Bitcoin core wallet. That should work just fine because it is backward compatible.",
