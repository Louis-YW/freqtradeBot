  "content": "Amulet ProtokolAmulet Protocol (hereinafter Amulet) is a decentralized insurance protocol created for the Rust-based ecosystem, starting with the Solana blockchain.Amulet has developed an innovative and open insurance model that not only effectively solves the common problems of existing decentralized insurance protocols, but also creates a new paradigm shift for the entire insurance sector.Risk underwriting and insurance claims are at the heart of any insurance business; however, all existing decentralized insurance protocols face the critical problem of resiliency in risk underwriting and insurance claims. Amulet is creating the industry's first Protocol-Controlled Underwriting (PCU) approach, in which Amulet will build its own underwriting capabilities and implement a claims structure that incorporates the unique Yield Backed Claim (YBC) method. This is a significant departure from current insurance models in which underwriting capabilities are leased from capital providers, in favor of a more sustainable protocol-controlled underwriting and claims structure. Amulet's vision is to is to offer simple, reliable insurance for all in Web3. With the addition of Amulet users throughout the Rust-based ecosystem will have access to a new way to hedge various risks through insurance product offerings.Unlike some existing insurance protocols that use a combination of general underwriting pools and individual pools for insurance products, Amulet will use an individual pool for each product, and users can choose one or more pools for underwriting by investing their $aUWT in specific product pools.https://amulet.org",
