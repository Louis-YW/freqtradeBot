The second one seems not true all the time. It can or can't be true. It's better to stop an advertising mixer if the forum gets in trouble.",

The forum is important than all mixers.We must to have a bit long term vision (if things go worse) but I know fighting for freedom is not bad.However, let's see a story, we can not build a house and let everyone get in and out, do anything they want and say we are not responsible for it.If theymos can stop forum ads banner, the same can be done on mixer signature but it is a hard decision I know.",

It could be due to all the heat created from the chipmixer situation which indirectly linked to the forum and anywhere else the mixer had an online presence.It is a drastic decision in my opinion, one which may be to create indemnity; the forum and it's staffs are not directly linked to a mixer and they operate independently. Best case scenario, it's just a precautionary measure against any future occurrence.",

But these points are valid for other services:- What guarantee is there that a casino doesn't close and scam all its users?- What guarantee is there for any service that is advertised to state that it has privacy, and not actually does not?I can even understand why @theymos might have asked for this. Whether he really did, I don't know.But those are not the reasons for sure.The moderation of the forum, can be considered employees, so everyone should avoid situations that put the forum in question.Anyway, if @theymos really made this kind of request, he must have strong reasons. And I trust him, and his good management of the forum. So we may not understand right now, but at some point, I believe this will clear up.",

      "body": "I agree that the forum is more important than mixers, but disabling advertisements on mixers might not be the best solution. Mixers can provide anonymity and privacy to users, which are essential features for some people, especially in countries with strict regulations or surveillance. Besides, mixers can also help prevent transaction analysis and improve fungibility, which can enhance the overall security and privacy of the network. If we disable ads on mixers, we discourage people from using them.However, I think the concern is not about mixers per se, but about the risk of censorship or control by external forces. If the forum is threatened, it makes sense to consider all possible options to preserve it, even if it means sacrificing some other features.",

I say that before the authorities they can be classified as such, especially if they receive something (I don't know if they do).Another thing is the fact that mixers are not illegal, but in a gray area of the law. In fact mixers are not illegal, they can exist. But according to the US authorities must comply with some rules. Note this interesting article from Coindesk, in part it says:Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/are-crypto-mixers-legal/In the U.S., the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) considers mixers to be money transmitters under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) that need to be registered and meet certain requirements. Chainalysis, however, noted in its report that it is “not aware of any bitcoin or Ethereum mixers currently following these rules.”That is, the existence of mixers is not illegal, but they have to follow some rules. Rules that no one seems to follow. This may give the impression that they are illegal. Well, those who do not comply with these rules are illegal. But, will Bitcointalk have to verify this? Logically not, it is the authorities who have to verify.",

Then moderation only has to limit published information that is illegal. Mixers are not illegal, so anyone can post information about them.Moderators advertising these mixers or any other service, which has problems with the law, can convey the idea that the staff supports these services. Even if this is not true, and it was just advertising. This could create inconvenience for the administration of the forum, which would be forced to have to present more justifications and lose a few hours in court, which in the end would most likely come to nothing. But it would be a nuisance.So the option of not advertising services that are more sensitive to having problems, is better than having these inconveniences.",
