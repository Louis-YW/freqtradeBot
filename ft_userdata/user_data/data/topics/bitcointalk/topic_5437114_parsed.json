  "content": "The recent killing of Tyre Nichols by five American police in Memphis is raising more questions about the genuineness of the struggle against police brutality against blacks. This 29year old black FedEx worker, who was also an aspiring photographer was beaten by five all-black police officers and three days later he succumbed to injuries he sustained.This senseless killing is clear proof that some of the killings of blacks by white officers are not racially motivated. I am not disputing the fact that some are connected to racism but not all are racially motivated. This is an indication that other factors are contributing to these killings.Could it be that the United States trains its police to see blacks as potential suspects or criminals? They may be trained to perceive blacks as potential risks to the police. Like the killers claimed that he was reaching for their guns, which was unverified. This would make them treat blacks harshly or unfairly.I am also suspecting that it might be possible that the lifestyle of some blacks has made the police generalize that every black man is a potential risk. This notion is reminding me of the killings of some Africans, mostly Nigerians in South Africa because it was generally believed that they were all engaging in criminal activities. This led to the death of many innocent Nigerians that were law-abiding and engaging in legal economic activities.It might also be true that these actions might be a result of the individual behavior of these police officers. These officers might just be the bad eggs that are giving the American police a bad reputation.It could also be that the killing of blacks by white policemen receives high publicity and are overblown to the extent that the root cause of it might be skipped. The press normally focuses on the racial aspect of the issues without giving attention to the major cause of the killings.How would five black policemen mercilessly beat up a black man until he was mortally injured without sympathy or a brotherly love? It might be possible that white officers would have stopped them from this senseless killing.",

      "body": "Within 20 seconds after getting him out of the car, they have a tazer out and pepper spray, as he is talking calmly to them and trying to get them to settle down.Within 48 seconds, they're pepper spraying him, he reacts, they then taze him and let him go (so they don't get shocked themselves) and he starts running for his life. I wish he would have just rolled onto his stomach and let these guys get over their power trip, but I think in his head he thought he was complying by being on the ground, and kept trying to talk to them.Long story short, once they catch up to him, they brutally beat the shit out of the guy, and he dies later in the hospital.Quote from: Fiatless on January 28, 2023, 02:29:56 PMHow would five black policemen mercilessly beat up a black man until he was mortally injured without sympathy or a brotherly love? It might be possible that white officers would have stopped them from this senseless killing. At one point, even calling him \"bro\" as they beat him and kicked him in the head on the ground. In video 3, one cop was pissed off that he got pepper sprayed in his own face and went back out of anger to attack the guy and take his pain out on him, with a baton, while shouting \"Imma baton the fuck out of you\", aiming for his head (video 2 shows where he is aiming). AFTER this, two cops hold the guys hands behind him while a 3rd full force punches him in the face 5 times until he couldn't stand anymore. Didn't look like the first time they've done this TBH, it was a brutal beating, and they seemed to enjoy talking about it after, they didn't seem to see anything wrong with what they had just done to another human being.The amount of riots that would be happening right now if these were white cops would be through the roof. They apparently pulled this dude over because he was driving towards incoming traffic (no video shows this of course), he apparently didn't stop for them initially (also not shown), and then eventually he is seen stopped at a red light trying to get back home, he was 80-100 yards from his house, probably why he got up and tried running home and calling for his Mom.Still kinda crazy to see something like this post-George Floyd, but I do think it sheds light on the fact that (IMO) it's not about race, even with Floyd I don't think it was, it's about authority, control and over-use of power, which cops can easily let get to their heads and disregard a human as a human, which is a problem.",
