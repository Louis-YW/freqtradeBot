Prices have risen about 25% over the last 10 years, but the price of gold is the same as it was 10 years ago despite that inflation.I believe it is due to the falling demand for gold.Only tradition has supported demand after the gold standard was finally abandoned in 1971. As time goes by, that tradition will continue to fade and people will have less desire to hold gold as an asset. Its falling value will also cause a reduction in demand by central banks, and that will eventually result in the abandonment of gold as a purely financial asset.I decided all of this recently, and I plan to sell my gold as I don't see prices ever going up from here.",

Although bitcoins will become the generally preferred choice, gold still has the potential of becoming more valuable if it gets scarcer.When the crisis worsens, cash is needed to survive even if its value is exposed to inflation. Investing is also necessary but may not exceed the larger portion of the cash that needs to be saved during a crisis. Due to deteriorating economic conditions, you are forced to survive and have food supplies for at least the next 6 months. The economic crisis will not only have an impact on investment assets, but the price will increase and you need to be alert to bad conditions. Apart from setting aside a few percent in Bitcoins, reducing the lifestyle portion and keeping the base stock in mind is much more important. Decide in gold is also necessary as a value resistance in a certain period of time but in retail gold not in heavy form. In anticipation of a prolonged crisis. I think countries that are aware of closing their gold stocks have predicted that the value embodied in gold will still exist in the midst of a crisis that could allow banks to freeze withdrawals.",

Even when we look at it as a boiler, gold could not exceed a certain rate. I don't see people around me investing in gold. Everyone is looking for innovation and more profit now. You can say that gold is a guaranteed investment, but at what rate will it be able to withstand inflation?",

I think gold has quite good characteristics in investing and the price is relatively stable without any increase that has peaked over the last 20 years.

Because Australia has gold reserves of 10,000 tons last year. So that 200 tons will not affect the market price. While India is also not included in the list of countries that have high gold reserves. In this case, gold prices tend to be more stable than others. In other terms, gold has no limited stock, or maximum stock. So that price conditions also tend to be more stable, or the price pump tends to be slow. We can also compare this with today's crypto. Why Bitcoin price is higher compared to Ethereum. Due to limited supply.",

      "body": "Central banks do not agree with the bearish views that most of you have expressed.QuoteCentral banks added 463 tons of gold to global reserves in 2021. That was 82% higher than in 2020.A WGC survey found that “gold’s performance during a time of crisis and its role as a long-term store of value/inflation hedge are key determinants in the decisions of central banks to hold it.”Last year was the 12th consecutive year of net purchases. Over that time, central banks have bought a net total of 5,692 tons of gold.Central Banks Add Gold for Fifth Straight MonthWhat you are ignoring is that the price of gold is manipulated:Quote\"The manipulation of gold prices began on 5 August 1993,\" the German analyst points out, and the reason was none other than an agreement between different central banks and the then chairman of the US Federal Reserve-FED, Alan Greenspan, \"who did not want the price of an ounce of gold to exceed 400 dollars\" because an uncontrolled increase in the price of gold could affect the \"inflation thermometer\". So this agreement was in place for several years, and materialised by acting on the markets with orders to sell and lend gold with the blessing and participation of other central banks, which, he recalls, \"work closely with private banks and financial institutions\".The way of operating and manipulating prices was \"very simple\", because these entities possessed significant amounts of gold that they used to control, if not lower, the price of gold, \"expelling potential buyers\" of the metal from the market who did not see the expected return on their investments. For Speck, states are the first to benefit from these practices, especially the US because its currency, the dollar, \"is the world's reference currency\" and gold is the main rival to loan-based currencies. \"A rising gold price accentuates the debt and deficits of states\", especially in the US.¿Quién manipula los precios del oro y por qué? (I have translated the quote from Spanish into English.)Having a little gold is not a bad thing. You can't pay for your groceries with it but you can convert it to cash instantly in any medium-sized city in the world. And even in small towns, if there is a jewellery shop or similar, even if it does not advertise itself as a gold dealer, it is quite likely that they will accept it.",
