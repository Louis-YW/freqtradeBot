Sounds a lot however price was like $200 back then. So with 5000 watts, you net about $10 a day.With 2018 and Ethereum mining I remember making exactly $0.00 per day with my 470 GPUs with like 8-10 cent power. There was also a period where earnings where negative.",

At 9Â¢ power, the ROI would've been 20-40% per year. When the bull market returned, not only did their rig double in value, but the rig made a 300%+ ROI in 2021. The total ROI from 2019-2021 was 500% or so. So buying video cards cheaply seems to be very important.",

I am more greedy than them, so I will buy whatever brand I think is best for the market.I was one of those short term get-rich-quick miners and thanks to FOMO, I rushed to rent a warehouse, get investors and build rigs in early 2018. I paid $370 for each RX 570 4GB card even though I ordered 20 at a time. The business went bankrupt, so my investors and I got badly burned. From then on, I learned my lesson.

The only group I would exclude from here,are the guys who did the above things,yeah credit card or loan and bought the gear in January-February 2021,most likely the gear already paid off until December so now it is up to them what to do,I am at such group although I bought the gear with my own money,mining money I made by mining at a loss in 2018-2019 and the gear has already paid off for me in December so from January we are still in small profit for a 330 Mhsh rig and we continue to mine,we make like 270 USD a month minus 70 USD electricity so we are still in 200 USD profit now.I agree the ones who overbought in April/May 2021 that was the biggest mistake they could make as the future since that time has been only in the descending except October which was an all time high in which they could have sold some crypto to cover some expenses.In the end it is all as the book \"The Psychology of Money\" says risk and fortune,some are taken by the risk,the ones who lose on their investment and some by the fortune,the ones who win from their investment.However the book doesn't state that old saying,fortune favors the bold.",

So then you decide to buy 5 GPUs, then you buy 10 GPUs, then you need to buy fans, additional electrical equipment like extension cables, add more power to your place. And before you know it you got 100 GPUs.However the difference is that your first GPU is usually much cheaper than your last. Due to the mining gaining traction, they get sold out and you start to over pay for stuff. And then if you started in the wrong quarter you can start to lose money fast. We have all been there.

You are right but the reason why a bear market is a good time to start mining is low mining difficulty, if no miners are leaving the network it will make no sense, look at the situation right now, we are in bear market but not as dip as that of 2018 where people are switching of their rigs, mining difficulty is still very high still.",
