      "body": "I don't think it's necessary to use any third-party website to check how secure a project is. Because it can show you data that is available to the public. It can't be sure whether the project will scam or rug-pull. There aren't any such tools to show scam projects or legit projects. They would make the data available online. So any user could check it themselves manually and decide if it's secure to invest. Any investment in a new project is highly risky. Because 99% of projects are dead after a few days,",

      "body": "I didn't click on the link. But since you're already here presenting your new service, how about you tell us exactly how you will do it? Are the project information that you'd provide something that the investors cannot themselves access? If they are, how do you gather them? If they aren't, then why should they need you?The same question as to the updates that you'd provide. Will you be providing them before all the announcements, press releases, and news? If you will, I'm curious how you get insider information from so many different projects. If you won't, then I see no need of your services. Anyway, I guess there's no service that can ensure in any way the safety of anybody's token investment. If I invest in Kim Kardashian Inu (KKI)-- an actual token, by the way-- for example, how could you guarantee me of a worry-free investment?",

No link shorteners that require users to view an ad.Rebrandly is a url shortener that doesn't require users to view an ad, so it does not break the rule #5. But i can't access the url, saying a dns error.Regarding the OP, i don't think such third party service is really a must have. As long those details are on the internet that can be research publicly viewed, then no need to hire someone to do it for you.",
