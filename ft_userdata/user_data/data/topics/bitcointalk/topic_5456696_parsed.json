      "body": "People simply have listened to the politicization of the media when it talks about Trump. Almost nobody in the mainstream media has good things to say about Trump. That's why I'm not surprised at the low percentage in the poll. Way-worse Biden is not portrayed nearly as bad as Trump. And most of it is the doing of Biden and deep state cabal that is trying to make you into a slave, along with the rest of the world.What good things has Trump actually done? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5313290.msg60834577#msg60834577Poll: 55% of independents find Trump’s indictment politically motivated – because IT IShttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-06-20-55-percent-independents-trump-indictment-politically-motivated.html A poll has found that 55 percent of respondents – more than half – who lean independent believe the federal indictment against former President Donald Trump is politically motivated.Legal scholar Jonathan Turley pointed out on June 18 that the poll, conducted by Harvard University‘s Center for American Political Studies and Harris Insights and Analytics, spells “bad news” for both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General (AG) Merrick Garland. He zoomed in on the survey’s respondents who leaned independent or had other political views.The survey found that 55 percent of independent-leaning respondents believe that the former president’s indictment in relation to his handling of classified documents was politically motivated. In contrast, only 45 percent of the respondents in the cohort believe the DOJ’s indictment of Trump was valid.Moreover, 56 percent of independent-leaning respondents in the survey deem the indictment as election interference on the DOJ’s part. Only 44 percent of the respondents whose political views leaned independent see the indictment as a fair application of the law.According to the survey, there is a clear divide along party lines on the issue of Trump’s indictment. Eighty-three percent of Republican-leaning respondents believe that the move was politically motivated, and 84 percent of the same cohort considers it election interference by the Justice Department. Meanwhile, 72 percent of Democratic-leaning respondents are of the opinion that Trump’s indictment was valid and 68 percent finds the indictment as a fair application of the law. (Related: Matrixxx Grooove: Federal indictment against Trump shows absolute TREASON and TYRANNY – Brighteon.TV.)Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, noted that the Harvard CAPS and Harris poll “is also bad news” for President Joe Biden. It found that 65 percent of respondents believe the former vice president “mishandled” classified material. Seventy-two percent also believe that former Secretary of State and failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also “mishandled” sensitive emails.Trump indictment puts Justice Department in a quagmire...",

Doubtful.The thing that is amazing is how much controversy comes about in peoples' minds over such a few basic words of law. The underlying thing in most minds is that, they have been led into thinking that their individual security has been diminished or harmed by some activity or happenstance.Attorneys and judges and law professors often seem to have many different ideas about the same chunk of law wording. Then the media takes these ideas and emphasizes whatever parts of it they want, just to push the agenda of the media owners or editors.Most of the things we hear from the media have to do with a popularity contest that they try to bring about by wording that stimulates our fears in one direction or another. Regarding ALL the major government leaders and politicians, we basically only see what the media wants us to see. We don't really know what the legal reality is. Even attorneys and judges often have a difficult time understanding it.",

There are also the simple laws of nature that really suggest love for other people, as well as love for God. How many times are laws broken that nobody ever hears about?... except for the law breaker? And often the law breaker doesn't even know he broke a law, himself.The point is that circumstantial evidence is used all over the place, both in court, and in personal evidence in life. So, where should we focus?We could focus on Trump, and the relatively little amount of law breaking he might be doing in his big business operations. But shouldn't we be focusing on the big law breaking? You seem to be a real hypocrite in your focus. If you can't focus on Trump's 'nothings', you try to take the focus off the Bidens' gigantic crimes.How much is Soros or whoever paying you?",

But all those same things, and way more in addition, that Biden is doing WITH ill effects on the country.The question is, is Biden President? Are a bunch of his people in office really in office, including the Vice President and the AG really in office?To be in office, one has to take the Oath of Office. We saw Biden and Harris and maybe others take their Oath. But doesn't the law also say that the Oath taker has to sign an affidavit of Oath of Office, and have it on file, available for everyone to see who wants to see it? And doesn't this Affidavit have to be done within 30 days of the swearing in, or the person taking office is no longer officially in office?They can't find Biden's Affidavit, or the Affidavit of the others on his team.See https://nationalfile.com/court-filing-kamala-harris-merrick-garland-violate-us-code-have-no-oath-of-office-on-file/.Biden administration officials took oaths of office, despite post's claim | Fact checkhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/biden-administration-officials-took-oaths-of-office-despite-post-s-claim-fact-check/ar-AA1cU4Tm?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=7a345c6042d54f82baa110953dd4a3d3&ei=20A May 14 Instagram video (direct link, archive link) shows various images of President Joe Biden and his inauguration ceremony, former President Donald Trump's inaugural address and internet searches of military cannons.\"Do we have public servants in office who are acting as elected officials without swearing an allegiance to the Constitution?\" the narrator says. \"A writ of quo warranto has been filed in the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., stating that numerous oaths of office cannot be found on file for many of our federal public officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.\"The video received over 8,000 likes in less than two weeks.

My opinion though In my eyes, the Chinese American relations are mostly about keeping themselves as trading partners while also fighting over human right violations, ideological stand points and territory like that in Taiwan. the CCP knows that their biggest and most important export associate is the United States and the American companies like the labor they can get at lower prices in China. It is about economics but the ideology and the struggle for power gets in the middle of all of it. Biden is indeed being biased, he does not talk sharply on China as he does against Russia, the reason though it is not completely clear to me.",

Hunter Biden gets a slap on the wrist after the obvious crimes. No media will ever say a word about it.Democrats and Republican are two wings of the same bird; the deep state still control them. However, what I find so strange is why America become stronger under Republican and weaker under Democrats. For instance, under Biden, America have become more like a joke as people rarely take America seriously these days unlike how the BRICS nations are becoming stronger and better organized. America have left things of importance and are enmeshed in major distractions. Let's hope they elect a better leader that will start repairing the damages we are seeing today.",
