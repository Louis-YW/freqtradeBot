Do you bring anything to the world of crypto other than burning people's miners on this instead of something that makes money?(Not like Scrypt mining really makes any money these days...)Yes, people bitch at me for saying these kind of things. 'no one is forcing you to mine, why complain'. First off, this is how society keeps spinning its wheels in the mud. Doing the same thing (clone with zero improvements) and expecting a different result. Secondly, I am not complaining. I state the resounding obviousness of lazy script-kiddies that simply watch a yt vid on cloning a coin. They bring NOTHING to the cryptosphere. Why get people to waste time and hydro on this? Why entice this madness? I'm going to make a coin. 99% pre-mine (you know, for 1 coin airdrops and other nonsense things like social media blitzing) 1k block reward. 500 MN FEE (everyone can MN!). MN earns 99% of block reward. 30min block time. recalc diff every 2 weeks (let 1 ASIC cram the diff then shut off... oh the stalemate of a non-PoS coin). Dev fee of 50%. Never contact exchanges. Don't host a pool or explorer. Mirror another coin's 'whitepaper'. Make the algo something obscure like Cryptonight or Tensority or Ethash. ;-) Sound good? Expected in 2024. I'll call it Bitocoin. Bitracoin. BitcoinX. Shitcoin. Scamcoin. All taken. I'll random letter generate a name.I wrote an article to help the project and sometimes developers are not even interested in creating something bad or something that will harm people. In general, everyone has a dream and Bitcoin provided us with this opening and the possibility of reaching new heights. Creating a project involves many things and I agree with you on the issue of wasting time.But dreaming implies breaking barriers and I hope the developers of this project will do that...https://www.publish0x.com/crypto-bits/mateablecoin-the-change-is-not-externally-but-internally-xlqqekoIn a way, here is my contribution to the project and I hope that it goes forward, breaking barriers and using criticism as fuel for development.",
