  "content": "First he was knoched out by Ariel Helwani, then he called a super tight fight with Jared Gordon \"a fight of the night, lad\" - as if he managed to beat Khabib Nurmagomedov... and arguably many claim he lost that fight.He had the audacity to ask Joe Rogan how much he should be paid for the post fight inerview, yet he is cricizing journalists like Ariel Helwani for getting paid for doing their jobs.Paddy - you're laich the biggest joche in the MMA, there's laich no better joche, you're talchin a lot of crap and constantly lie to people, you lost so many fans.Here are a few of his lies:1) He said he fought in the past with Jared Gordon before the main event, Jared disputed that claim.2) He asked Ariel Helwani to meet for business purposes (listen to the recording, involving his \"Graham\") - then later claims he just wanted to meet Ariel as a \"friend\" - liar.3) He disputes Joe Rogan saying the fight with Jared Gordon \"was not even close\" despite having a 29-28 score, saying \"was not close at all\".The guy used to be legit, but right now he's going through all the possible roads towards destruction - why?****Note: The 'K' was replaced with 'ch' in this text to reflech the way Paddy talchs, because he doesn't pronounce letters like 'k' like 'k' but instead like 'ch' (jaja in spanish).",
