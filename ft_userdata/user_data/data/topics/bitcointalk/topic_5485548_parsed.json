You can either watch individual addresses, or a whole wallet using your xPub.If you also want to watch your exchange's wallet (that cannot be done by watching your receiving addresses) then you should probably look into Portfolio apps like Delta.[1] https://bluewallet.io/watch-only/",

Not only Android, this wallet is also supported by several platforms such as Windows, MacOS, Linux and Python here. This application is also easy to download on your cellphone. You need to remember, don't just download it from various other sources, download it on the official website electrum.orgYou can also study here the official docs for beginners herehttps://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/",

Bluewallet has a decent UI/UX compared to Electrum but both wallet are reliable in terms of watching specific address. Bluewallet is the best answer for me since you are just looking for a wallet to watch address. Bluewallet only sucks sometimes on updating the recommended transaction fee when sending Bitcoin but the rest of its feature is superb like Electrum but better design.",

That is the reason I prefer using it only on my Android phone. There are other wallets that are available like others have commented on your thread, you can use any one of them for Bitcoin.",

But in my mind, I will prefer that you use the Electrum wallet because it is one of the best and safest Wallet for storing Bitcoin, and if you don't know much more about crypto so you need to use only the Electrum wallet because Electrum wallet is user-friendly like very easy and simple to use. Thus, the Electrum wallet has a very easy and friendly interface, making it very easy for newbies to navigate with it. So it means to say that Electrum Wallet is a very unique and easy-to-use wallet, so if you didn't know too much about how to use a wallet so as a friend, I will recommend that you use Electrum for the reason I explained above. . The rest, I have no compulsion on you, OP you have your own choice of which one you like to use.DYOR!",
