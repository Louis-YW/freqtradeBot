      "body": "Basically unless it’s listed somewhere like a CEX or unless it’s also on another chain like BNB or ARB then you are basically forced to pay that fee.Earlier today if you wanted PEPE with Uniswap you were paying almost $100 just for the transaction fee. Basically Defi is not good for small purchases and especially on the ETH main net.",

      "body": "If you want to buy a coin without a gas fees, it's 100% impossible. But if you want to buy a coin without pay too much gas fees, you can. You have two options, it's either you buy through a centralized exchange, using other chain, or trade with user in this forum. Wassie don't get listed in any centralized exchange [1] while BOB, you have a choice to use Polygon or BSC network [2]. But why you're want to buy BOB? it's a stable coin.[1] https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wassie/markets/[2] https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bob/markets/",

      "body": "Buy from someone directly so it's gonna be P2P and let the seller shoulder the fees. But being it quite high today, I don't think that someone's gonna do that unless you know him and he don't mind paying such fees.

The fees are high too as well.",

But, as far as my search goes, $WASSIE is not registered with any CEX yet, so, if you want to own $WASSIE, you have to be prepared to incur the high transaction fees you say.Unlike the $BOB token which has been listed on several CEXs such as Poloniex and LBank, you can buy this token at a low cost by buying it through those exchanges.",
