It would not surprise me if the US government comes knocking on his door, demanding to confiscate his BTC \"to protect the monetary stability\". Or they develop prison sentences for known holders of BTC. In that regard he reminds of Jack Ma, the richest man in China who disappeared for months and was supposedly forced to sign off the rights of his company Alibaba. I believe the future is bright for BTC, but anonymity will be key when banks and governments launch their attack on DeFi",

If the monetary system were to collapse and BTC reaches those high valuations, it's true that he could potentially become the first trillionaire. So, like you mentioned, the intrinsic value of other major players like Elon Musk and Bernard Arnault would depend on their companies and assets. As for the risks Saylor might face while BTC continues to rise, I agree that it wouldn't be surprising if the government tries to intervene in some way. Example, look at the case of Jack Ma, who faced intense scrutiny from the Chinese government. However, it's hard to predict exactly how the US government would handle the situation.",

And for them to be the richest in the world, the market cap of Bitcoin would probably have to be around $20T at least. Which means approximately a $1m/coin BTC. Certainly within the plausible BTC ranges. I think $3-5M is semi bullish and getting to 10m+ starts getting a little loony but possible especially under certain constraints like hyperinflation.But all that to say that yeah, big BTC players may control a lot of wealth in the future on the global scale.",
