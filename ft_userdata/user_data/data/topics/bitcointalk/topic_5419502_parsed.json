  "content": "Hi Everyone,I was hoping to have a running list of all new coins/tokens that can be mined with a GPU and for which mining has just started or will start shortly. I enjoy mining as a hobby, so I'd like to just mine a bunch of new unknown coins... one for a month, then switch to another for a month, switch to another the next month etc. in the hopes of hitting the lottery and having one of them take off someday. Recent ICOs, brand new altcoins, etc. would be perfect.Could you help me to generate this list so that I can go off and research/mine them? Don't worry about details unless you'd like to share a story about them. If you just list the website or ticker, I'm happy to do the research.Thanks!Jamey",

      "body": "I think if you're comparing potential coins to mine with your GPU then there's one site that stands out amongst the rest.www.whattomine.comWhile they might not have the newest coins, I think you're probably best off stacking Bitcoin and letting your GPU help you do this.  With whattomine.com you can see what will be most profitable for your GPU to mine.  Then, you can use a site like nicehash.com to mine that coin with your GPU, but receive payouts in Bitcoin.  I've long thought this is the best use of a graphics card, but it's a bit less risky than mining shitcoins directly and holding them hoping for a moon.  I think all you need is BTC though, and stacking here would be a good idea, even if not the most profitable option currently.",

      "body": "Thanks all for the inputs… I’m new to this forum so not sure how to reply to each of you. For the first tip.. with unmineable, I have heard of it and may go this route. I would need their list to be quite extensive… I’m looking really to mine the newest/unknown mineable coins and I figured unmineable would only have the big named tokens and coins as options. However, I will research this and may just go the unmineable route. For whattomine, this is what I’ve used when I started out to see profit of my rig, but the list of coins is also too limited. I’m hoping to find a resource where I can see brand new unknown and Unestablished crypto. Perhaps my best bet is to continue to scour ico lists for presales and upcoming coin releases. I will look at the mining pool stats. I have read about this strategy before….. if it’s what I think it is… I could use the stats to see what others are mining and when I see new items on the list I could research those to potentially mine them myself. Because profitability is so low and electricity is expensive in my area, I’m not looking to mine for profit by selling or trying to produce significant amounts of ETH forks or BTC, but rather to mine a bunch of different tiny things with low difficulty and store them long term. Because of this, i see it more as a hobby because perhaps none of them will be worth much someday, but I’ll have fun building up the rig and learning the different mining software and building up a pile of random crypto coins/tokens and who knows…. Maybe one of them will turn out to be the next big thing. I think ideally what I’m looking for is unmineable, but with the ability for it to produce in tokens that just came off ICO. I have a feeling unmineable is more limited than that… but I’ll take a look! Any other tips are greatly appreciated! Thanks again",

And gambling, hmm you advertise fucking casinos - so its senseless to explain it to you - casinos = shitLol.Thank you for your clear explanations but I know very well,as you said several times to me I have also said several times my story here that I mined Bitcoin through Nicehash in 2019 when everybody shut down their rigs.Even my closest friends called me stupid but I was convinced in my journey for the long run as it turned out in 2021 I withdrew a lot of money,namely 40.000 or a bit more dollars,of course no life changing event but life changing lesson for me.Now to the buying advice you say,if I bought most likely I would not have been patient enough to wait 2021 but I would have sold earlier in December 2020 thus losing out on the winnings,that is why I always prefer to mine at a loss as I have better control over my coins.",

      "body": "So, I mined ETH for a couple of years with 2 3090s. I’m not brand new to it, but I’m no expert. I sold my 3090s right before POS update but just recently bought a 3070 to play Illuvium and also to mine for a hobby. I’m doing it knowing it’s not worth the electricity, but I enjoy mining and see it as a hobby now, not for profit. I am not interested to mine ETH anymore at current profit levels and there’s no coin I know of worth putting any time into trying to pull a profit…. So now I just want to find some projects I like that are recent ICOs to mine a significant number of tokens (which in epoch 1, I think is possible even with 1 3070) and just store them. I plan to switch tokens once every month to every 2 months to a new project that I will enjoy researching. Hence why I was looking for a list of recent ICOs that are mineable. I’ve already got what I needed I think with the miningpoolstats link so I’m thrilled to have that! I really don’t expect to make a profit, but I spend a lot of time researching crypto projects and I think mining is fun so it makes sense for me personally. I appreciate the help from this community!

The calculator shows a profit of 0.045, even possibly 0.05 ETHW per dayYou will receive 500 ETHW coins in 10,000 days, which is more than 27 years.For your 500 dollars you will now buy 120 coins, or you will be mining these coins for more than 6.5 years. But if the price of ETHW rises, then this period will increase.Therefore, I advise all beginners to learn how to use a calculator. And if an experienced user like you wants to mine coins, then I wish you success.I just want like 25-50 ETHW and I will sit idle then,I hope to make them by 14 months which are left to the end of the year 2023 and then see what to do,I bought the rig as a gamble but a gamble worth taking because the prediction for this coin hopefully will surpass the prices of ETH coin.Maybe the price of this coin is stupidly low but I know a lot of Dapps or at least I heard that many had already joined in this coin offering,I know with the passing of time it will catch up and offer all the things that the old ETH offered,it is at that time that I predict the highest price of this coin and it is at that time that success will come.I hope to have at a minimum 25 of such coins which would be more than 100.000 dollars if the ETHW hits the all time of ETH,I know that I am just investing/gambling time and resources into this coin but it is the only one I believe from the coins left to mine.I have already explained why I don't believe in buying coins because you will be not that up to date with what is happening as you are while mining every day so I thank you for good wishes.",

Looks like pretty much what I was looking for! Thanks. If you have additional resources like this, I'd be happy to see them!All beginners repeat the mistakes of other miners that we made many years ago. I also mined different shitcoins instead of mining popular coins and only got a loss. Mining hobby will quickly become uninteresting when you have expensive electricity and your investments only give you a loss.We maybe have another ETH in its beginning,I know most people will look at this statement with much reserve but this is only my personal opinion which I am giving also as an advice to newbies so they don't go and mine shitcoins.Right now the difficulty of ETHW coin is extremely low at just 368 T and the price of this coin is also low,meaning most people are not at all interested in this.It is exactly this time which can be called a good one to mine as much as you can with your rigs,even at a loss would make sense for me,I would not buy it rather mine it keeping track everyday in my wallet and enjoying everyday a bit more of this coin.This I suggest to people who wanna start a small rig with 1-3 cards to test the waters or those who want to try as hobby,sure there are a lot of other coins but I doubt any of them has the same potential which ETHW has.Imagine if ETHW goes just the 50% of all time high of ETH which is 2000 dollars or a bit more and you have mined like 500-1000 of this coin,isn't this a life changing event?I saw your post about mining farm with 150 mhsh hashrate.
