  "content": "Looking for the L7s Bitcoin asic and any others potentially available that are producing a profit . . I'm not paying outrageous reseller prices I have 50k to spend an don't mind waiting to get direct from manufacturer. My electrical costs are locked in at 0.042/c per k/wh for the next 2 years so I might as well take advantage of the 200amp panel sitting in my garage not doing anything. Drop a post if ya got something for sale. Post here prior to contacting me. Much Thanks!",
