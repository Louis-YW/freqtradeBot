People don't understand that it's a question of numbers where as an individual trader you have a close to 100% chance of losing your capital. Roughly 90% of traders lose money and the retail trader who starts out always thinks that it will be 10%, but is not aware that this 10% decreases as trading becomes more short term, as you have less capital and for example leverage, or as the asset becomes more volatile (e.g. cryptocurrencies). That is, someone who starts with little capital, and makes short-term trading with cryptocurrencies leveraged has a probability close to 100% of losing everything.When you start because you have seen a Youtube video or bought a course, you are not aware that the person selling you the course probably earns more from the courses than from the trading itself, and that when you trade you are competing against big money like Hedge Funds that can move the market at will and use high frequency trading algorithms. But trading is still promoted because it makes a lot of money, both for those who sell courses and for the houses, which charge fees. The more trades, the more fees. The system of buying bitcoin and forgetting about it for another 8 years or doing DCA does not make as much money and that is why it is not promoted as much.",

I doubt it, but they are going to try.",

During the very early stages in the boom of buying investment in land and estate, scam is not excluded like people are made to pay for properties that at the end of the day, they won't be able to legally acquire it after cut cases but the scenario has really reduced as more people have tasted it and got wiser. Likewise in the case of cryptocurrency investment. There are different levels of scam in this industry, from telegram bump groups, meme and shit coins, bounty hunting exit groups etc, they are all experiences that we have seen and can talk about, all you do is move on and learn when it happens to you. Be wise and careful not to invest what money that you can't forego. The risk is there but reduce your appetite.",

That's what a loser is expected to do because such people are unaware of the rules of trading and investment. They put their money into assets without gaining essential knowledge about the assets and put their money into it blindly.The meme creator has just created the inverse of what investors can achieve with crypto investing and trading. The can fortunately move from bicycle and bus to their own cars if they do everything with proper planning. Now not every trader is going to earn as there will always be the ones who will lose. But, if someone knows the basic concepts of trading and investing then he/she will not face huge losses even if market goes against his/her predictions.Therefore, I always recommend people to learn the basics of trading, by developing their own working strategy with technical indicators and one should learn to read the trading charts, and he/she should have a proper working plan. That will definitely make the investors prosperous as it's a fact that those who do investing with proper plans and have control over their emotions are always the winners in the game of investing and trading.",

It's funny for those who don't know what happened to some of the investors out there who lost their money.

Often times than not it could be that these people perhaps invested into the wrong coin and timing too.Of course, there are such things like wrong coin and timing. But I don't really see the problem with a long-time holding. After all, even if the price drops after you purchased a coin, it is very likely that the price will recover and rise in the future (if we are talking about reliable assets). It seems to me that as long as the loss is not realized, as long as you still remain in the asset and do not sell it at a low price for you, then you do not lose your positions. And it is unlikely that in this case you turn from a billionaire into a millionaire. The only problem is time, how much you can afford. But this factor should be taken into account one of the first and you just do not enter into a position if time is limited, and you are not sure about the direction of the market movement during this period.",
