But cmon, lets get real here - if he hadnt began sinking cash into bitcoin the year prior to 2017's bull run, his portfolio would look totally different and  truthfully if we take those calculators online at their word, even putting 30 bucks a day into investments over the last 7 years still lands you nearer half a mil than a full one.",

Bitcoin tend to favour Those that are patient, those that can literally build a good stash and hold it for long .Yeah this will actually motivate some investors to keep pushing and striving to a greater heights, just like are most users here that have been holding for long kept motivating us , I hope one day i will also motivate others to do the right thing.",

It's not like those cooked-up stories that misinformed the people about how they made thousands of profit by just investing a few hundred in bitcoin without explaining and given how long it has been before they got that profit.  If we have something that's given us enough money to spare some instead of saving in fiat, I will also consider buying and accumulating bitcoin like this for a long time, maybe before my child will finish college. It can be enough money to inherit.",

Your efforts have been paid back nicely, with a much superior profit margin when compared to traditional investments offered by fiat institutions and governments. I guess it's not easy to think outside the box and invest on the exact opposite way everyone is doing and telling you to do. Despite the negativity faced due to hopeless commentaries of people around, Bitcoin investors still took their investments ahead and are proud participants of the supreme 2024's ATH.Everyone has their frustrations and struggles in life which are pretty hard to be surpassed, but in the end of this year of 2024, we have a very important reason to be thankful for after seeing all the progress which has been made in this industry along all the years and cycles we have passed.Be satisfied for that, and hopeful that the best is still to come.",

What you’re seeing now is the reward for early investors who took the risk back then. At the current price, that kind of growth seems less likely, but who knows? In Bitcoin, nothing is impossible. With its limited supply, if demand skyrockets again, it could surprise everyone.Holding for 8 years takes serious discipline, and that’s the true meaning of HODL. And speaking of trust, you should develop how to resist the temptation to cash out during a bull market or panic sell in a bear market and staying focused on your long-term goals.Good luck to you! It’s never too late to start investing and remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s future.",

He may have done a lot, but we should always keep what we can do within our capabilities.We don't have to follow his exact investing plans as we can invent our own and follow it and still make profits. Everyone is free to invest in the way that they'll be comfortable and it'll not make them to go broke. What he was doing is called DCA and you can invest through DCA in any way that you want but you have to be consistent for you to see results. I do mine monthly and I have good results too. I was looking at the image and it looks like he's up 10x from his invested capital. In 8 years for someone that has been investing in Bitcoin daily he barely has over one Bitcoin and it makes me begin to doubt if truly he was investing daily. I wonder too how much was he investing daily because if I was investing daily for 8 years I should have more than one Bitcoin by now. During the bear market that Bitcoin was very cheap, I should have accumulated many Bitcoin and be in a better profits than just 10x but that's massive gains too.",

Patience and having a stable source of income should always the keys as you can’t buy bitcoin continuously if you don’t have a sustainable flow of income. And since bitcoin is a long term investment, never rush to see your profits. If possible, just try to forget that you have bitcoin investment. Don’t be paranoid with its price fluctuations, and just focus on adding your bitcoin portfolio everytime you have excess money.

That's over 100% yearly on the initial capital if we use as a basis, but if you put your moeny  in the bank, you'll get less than 3% per annum. However, it's a misconception to compare investing on bitcoin and saving your money to the bank because when you put your money to the bank, you aren't investing but instead you are just safekeeping your money. And of course it has a little risk as money is insured up to a certain amount, the only downside of just keeping your money is you'll be impacted with the inflatiion unlike investing with bitcoin is you beating it.",
