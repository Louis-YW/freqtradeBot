If you think high volume trading is another thing of bullish trend, just look on the previous months where Bitcoin price is below $20K, why the pump doesn't start from July last year? the volume is similar like the the last few days!We're still 14 days in this year, there's next 351 days where Bitcoin price will down due to FUDs, government ban Bitcoin, top exchange got hacked, etc.",

Many crypto veterans have said, if you are able to buy Bitcoins anywhere under 20k usd, then consider yourself lucky and buy as many as possible, but still when Btc was at 16k usd, many people argued and waited for more down price of Bitcoins. Now they have to buy the coins at 21k usd and will regret for less profits. Bear market is almost over we can say. Sit tight, Bitcoins to the moon.",

I knew that the adrenaline due to the hype makes you become optimistic like this. You maybe right or wrong about this but this kind of impulse pump usually end to a sharp down which the Elliot wave usually didn’t occur on this scenario. There’s no expert that can predict what’s gonna happened because there’s always 2 possible scenarios that can happened. One is a double top and the other one is what you are predicting. I really that your chart will happened as better preparation for the upcoming Bitcoin halving next year. It will be good if the market is on the positive side when this big happened for greater chance to hit new ATH.",

At first I thought that crossing $20k ceiling would be the start but not to be a pessimist; seeing the rally to be continuous is still hard. There's nothing supporting the increase we are currently seeing which makes the buying pressure not as strong with what we have saw before. Thus, riding the wave is somewhat scary to do. On my end, I will be waiting for a more visible trend line because I might end up being crushed in the middle if ever there will be a sudden downfall with the market given how unexpected the increase was.",
