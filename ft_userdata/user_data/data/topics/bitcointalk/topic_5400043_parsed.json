He used to buy sell USDT from binance previously (he is not a merchant), but currently, he is facing this issue. He has no clue why this message appears and what the solution for this is. Anyone, please advise on it so I may pass on the solution to him.",

Anyone, please advise on it so I may pass on the solution to him.Clearly shows that you do need to contact customer service yet they are the only ones who could resolved such issue or problem.So far as a binance user for a long time, i havent experienced such thingthats why i dont have any idea but since this do involved buy and sell then this would really be connected to P2P i guess.He might able to trigger out something which make their security do ableto act and such prohibition or restriction was applied. So there's no other solution but to contact them. Close this thread.",

Anyone, please advise on it so I may pass on the solution to him.The solution is already mentioned in the screenshot and that is to contact customer support. I don't think there is anything to worry about unless and until your friend did any serious violation of the rules.In case, you do not know how to contact customer services chat on your mobile app, click on our profile picture. go to Help & Support and click on chat to start the conversation with support team.",

If the person is very sure that he/she has not committed any crime which will result to this. The person can use the Binance chat support option, and the issue will be discussed and resolved in minutes.",

Reporting the account to the customer support2. Opening a disputeReporting the account to the customer support does not automatically lead to opening of a dispute, and they even warn before one makes a report, that, if they maliciously do it, they could face the consequences. I don't think the warning is a result of someone or group of people reporting the OP's account, though.",

I told them that I already had returned the money. They confirmed from the buyer that the issue was resolved and now I can do the P2P trading without any issues.  I guess someone bumped this old thread, anyways thanks for your advice.",
