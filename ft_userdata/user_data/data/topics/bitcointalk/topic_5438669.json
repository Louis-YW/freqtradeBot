  "content": "Greetings BitcoinTalk Users,Today information is specifically for new users and is also implemented for experienced users. As we have seen recently(in 2022) there were some crashes that happen, which affect the whole crypto wold. There were two most effective crashes:1)LUNA Crash2)FTX CrashLUNA is a token/coin and many small investors, as well as Pro investors, have lost their precious investment(including me), while FTX is an exchange and the Whole exchange was crashed because of some Fake News as well few Tweets from the reputable persons.Risk Warning:Crypto is not a business that can make you rich overnight and nor it’s a money-making machine, so chose wisely before involving in any crypto assets, as it can damage you entirely, like there was some news at the time of the LUNA crash, as some users attempt suicide because they lose everything.Bounty Warning:New users join all the bounties without reading the conditions/rules and just spam the BM Telegram, Project Telegram, and the Project itself. So it is recommended to read the rules before joining any bounty and doesn’t just copy and paste information from the internet(google).Also not every bounty comes with huge reward and also you can’t get the rewards after the bounty was finished, because of the current market conditions, many fake crypto projects are pop-up on daily basis just to make new user fool so they can loot their investment.Recommendations:I am not that much experience, but I am in the crypto world for over 7 years. I would recommend Binance Exchange to all the new users as they can’t differentiate between Dex's & other exchanges, also there is no recommendation regarding the Investment/coins, because you will learn it with time, and regarding the Bounty Managers, I would recommend @BountyDetective, Alladin. There are also many more but you have to read their previous distribution records before joining their campaigns.Stay safe and happy Crypto Trading.",

SAM will keep doing his creepy thing behind the back and more companies will be brought down to their knees in future.",

That's a pretty long time for someone to still stay inexperienced, even those that have been involved in crypto for a shorter time like three to four years have still been managed to gain some experience.

I can't even imagine working for a project for up to four weeks and still receive less than $10 that won't even be able to cover my internet bills.",

SAM will keep doing his creepy thing behind the back and more companies will be brought down to their knees in future. The fans of the great leader still live in the belief that he saved them from complete ruin, although CZ is basically the same as Bankman, only he is much more cunning and experienced, so he still manages to avoid his company going downhill. The dubious business that this company conducts around the world, the avoidance of paying taxes, the listing of tokens/coins that are nothing but a scam are nothing that anyone should be proud of.Do you think it is positive that CZ advocates the idea that we should keep our coins in his CEX, because we are obviously too stupid to do it ourselves and we will lose them sooner or later?",
