This is not to undermine you mate, but this is your first post on the forum and you’re going straight to looking for a way to create awareness for it. The first thing should be you seeking knowledge yourself and understanding it before educating others. This could be done by engaging in bitcoin yourself as we say experience is the best teacher.You can check out the links below for the basic knowledge in bitcoin. This will help you in achieving your goal. https://learnmeabitcoin.com/https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbookThe major thing education to spread about bitcoin is how to purchase and how to secure your wallet from possible attacks as this is the biggest obstacle face by learners or newbies. Investing into bitcoin although it is an hedge against inflation is risky due to its volatility so when educating yourself and others it best not to invest an amount that is beyond your limit of losing",

You said \"I will start from the very beginning and I will explain like I was explaining for a child\", then you mention proof of work, blockchain, and mining lol.Overall, it's not something I'd share to anyone.Don't get discouraged though — you can definitely improve it to the point that maybe it's worth sharing some time in the future when it gets good enough.

It would be better if you edited your post by removing the Twitter links. Before teaching others about Bitcoin, it's crucial to learn about it properly yourself. There are different stages of learning, and it's essential to start from the basics and progress to advanced topics. Instead of considering Bitcoin solely as an investment, explain how it works in detail. By doing so, newbies will learn the proper way to navigate the topic.",

Things would normally be flowing considering that we are still a decade old and there's still soo much room to grow because we arent that still been heard off totally. If ever there are people who do really make out some approach to you and asking out about Bitcoin then it is really just that right that you would really be telling them about the basics, the thing on here is that you shouldnt really be giving out some assurance that they would really be making money or profitsbecause this is where you would really be blamed out on the time that they would really be losing up money and if you dont like for it to happen then its always ideal for you to explain out about its riskand the danger when it comes to volatility.",

There's a way to buy Bitcoin with a dollar, but it's not worth it and better to find a job with higher salary.Helping a newbie to understand about Bitcoin can be started on this forum! you don't have to convince someone to buy Bitcoin, if they interested, they will find a way to buy Bitcoin and learn by themselves.[1] https://mempool.space/",

It's the same thing that applies to every natural resources which Bitcoin isn't. I just needed to kick that out.QuoteAny ideas to spread the Bitcoin education to the world?Now to the issue at hand. The simple way is either by talking about it to those around us or by writing about it so that many who aren't around us can get acquitted about it.

But other than that, it seems fairly accurate. I'd also add here that, unlike gold, it can't come in different qualities or turn out to be fake. And unlike gold, it doesn't weigh anything, so you can access it anywhere and don't have to be physically close to someone else to transfer it. Also, while gold is limited in total supply, we don't really know how much gold is out there even on Earth, let alone in space, which can become a big devaluation risk in the future.",

The seminars should be conducted by well educated crypto enthusiasts because people really don't care about those who aren't well educated about Bitcoin themselves and are trying to promote it with low levels of awareness and following. The seminars will attract so many investors into this technology and they will add Bitcoin into their list of investments.Another very good way to promote Bitcoin is though social media. Many good social media celebrities mostly on YouTube who can promote it through their live streams because thousands of people attend those live streams. They can easily recommend Bitcoin to their followers and offer them giveaways in Bitcoin and that will create excitement and  passion in the minds of the viewers. They will try their best to learn about this technology and gradually incorporate it in their day to day life.",
