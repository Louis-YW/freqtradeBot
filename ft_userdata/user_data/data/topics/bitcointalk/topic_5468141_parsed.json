People who goes for shopping might shop above their expected wages or salaries per say but would depends upon their next month payment or salaries to be deducted through there which is a very bad habits compared to gamblers, and one thing about gambling is that it has a very bad spirits or habits whereby whenever you funds your accounts and its happens that the funds were sweeps off you don't have any other options to funds back using credit card on other to recover the previous lost funds by so doing they are involving themselves in serious debt whereby it could be very difficult to payback.",

This is just common in some parts of the world, where the government tries as much as they can to make things easier for their citizens in order for them to live a stress-free life and make things easier for them to survive in the economic situation of their country. But it's really saddening and heartbreaking to see how most people use their credit card eligibility loan to gamble their lives out. Ordinarily, I don't support taking money from someone just to gamble a single game, which the person might not require you to pay back with interest. Talk more about using one's credit card to acquire a loan and using that same loan to bet on a gambling platform. This is really annoying because this kind of debt repayment is always painful since the person does not use the money for anything useful, but they use it all for gambling rather than investing those funds in things useful, and they can use their earnings to gamble and try out their luck if they can win some free money. @MainIbem Even though our country doesn't give us such opportunities to take loans directly from our cards (we don't have much of a credit card active here in our country), there are still some loan apps that most gamblers still take loans from and use those funds to gamble, something of which they are not entirely sure of the outcome yet will borrow to do it.",

It is not only the gamblers that uses their credit card to fund their casino accounts but also those that keeps on swiping without paying their debt at the right time.They think that they'll be able to pay it on time so, they're confident to just keep on using their credit cards on any purpose that they like and one of it is in gambling.Quote from: Outhue on September 26, 2023, 09:08:39 AMImagine someone you know telling you that it will take him 12 years to pay off his debt, I now know why few countries don't want their citizens to gamble using their credit cards,  betting on credit cards has left too many people in thousands of debt. It is sort of exaggerated about paying a debt for 12 years but trust me, I've known people that can't even pay their debts for more than that year and even asking for condonation and restructured payment, they still can't.

Whether they have credit card or cash, as long as they have the urge to gamble, they will gamble no matter what. Let's take a look at those gamblers that don't have anything but still want to gamble, they do something to sustain that crave they have for gambling.Quote from: Outhue on September 26, 2023, 09:08:39 AMI'm glad I don't even like using Credit cards for gambling and my reason isn't even because of possible reckless gambling but because I don't like centralized payment solutions, you should stay away from using Credit card to gamble online, it sure would easily throw you out in the street, homeless.

And if casinos accept credit card to play games then addicted gamblers would misused and over used the privilege. As the Op said, they would be on debt throughout their life and paying debt. Things like would make the gambler to have hope that he would win big to pay back his debt and unknown to him that he will be indebted deeply with credit card gambling. This is not really good for the gambling space because they are creating more poverty in the society and making people more reckless. I have not used it before so I don't how it works. And I don't it is because this countries ban gambling. From what I heard Countries ban gambling because of the rate \"suicide and high rate of crime\".

I have seen someone who was required to pay a very large credit card bill with interest and it was almost past the maximum limit even though his salary was not as big as the money he used. This incident often happens to employees.Most of them started using credit cards because many of their friends already used them and they joined in making credit cards. They don't read the terms and conditions of the credit card company and just agree to it and start using it. A friend of mine also uses a credit card to deposit money into his gambling account but is lucky to be able to manage his finances well so he doesn't mess it up. But I always remind him to stop using credit cards immediately before he exceeds the limit, especially since he is getting married at the end of this year.And it's not surprising that many people are in debt because they can't pay their credit cards at the end of the month. After all, their usage is so high. And for those of you who want to register with a credit card company, you should refrain from doing so, especially if you don't have good self-control in using the card.",

You shouldn't be able to deposit a lot of money from your credit card because your credit card limit is calculated according to how much you earn and how well you pay.

Actually, not all gamblers who use credit cards are addicted to gambling. I think only a few are addicted, so with the ban, it will sacrifice those who are responsible. It's not fair in my opinion.Australia is saving her citizens from falling into a pool of debts, through gambling addiction. The best thing for them is this decision, because two problems are at stake here; gambling and debt addiction.  How do you expect one to escape such addictions. Debt addiction is very bad to anybody, especially those who use the loan to fund gambling activities. The blame, yes, goes to the gambler, but if you have taken loan frequently, you'd notice how your life would almost depend borrowing money. Even though you payback those funds. The only means of saving yourself from such problem is by terminating the source of the loans. Which method the Australian government used in saving her citizens from two addictions. It's a good thing for both those who gamble responsibly with borrowed funds, because they're at risk of accumulating debts. Playing games with credit cards are quite bad, for any player, the fun disappears immediately. If you win, the money goes back to replenish the debts and if you lose the problem continues to pile up. Think deep into it, and you'll understand that banning credit card gambling is a very nice and smart move from the Australian government.

Going out with a few amount in our pocket, limits our spending, but on a credit card, it pushes the shopper to buy what they don't need and more. Same is applicable to gambling, continuously playing with credit card doesn't help the gambler by any means.  S/he would spend more time chasing losses, expecting to hit big and balance their debts.",
