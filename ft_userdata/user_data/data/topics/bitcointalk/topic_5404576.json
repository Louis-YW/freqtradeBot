      "body": "This is not the right section to ask this you need to move this to service discussion. Anyway, I'll try to report it to move it there. About this site, it seems it is a cloud mining site and someone talked about this 9 months ago on Reddit but I don't trust anybody it could be alt accounts of the owner of the post from this link. They just want to make this cloudmining looks legit and it's actually one of the marketing strategies to get potential victims. For me, or even ask for someone here 99% of Cloud mining sites are scams so avoid them if you are planning to invest there. Another thing that I notice is that the website is totally built on WordPress and designed using Divi Page builder. Most cloud mining sites that use WordPress as their CMS is 100% scam.",
