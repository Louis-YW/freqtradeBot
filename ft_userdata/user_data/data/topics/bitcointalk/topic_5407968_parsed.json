I believe the thread will receive the necessary attention that will trigger further discussion on this topic in the right section so do the needful to move the thread there, let keep the discussion on the topic, in my opinion IEO is no longer profitable not like 2018-2019 when IEO investment was the hype of the market.",

You must also aware if the fact that these days IEO was always doing so well even during the bearish market. Once IEO will be launched through binance and there would be a profit guarantee for you caused by binance was full with the whales who will be pumping the price of the new token. IEO will always become the best way to launch the new project. The demand guaranted by the exchange site and it will always be traded in a big profit after the trade already started.",

Is it something like the coin list thing that you will wait in line to get into the presell or something? I think the lockup is quite the sad part of participating in that. That's going to be the downfall of it, though; you might get out once it's too late or something. It's still the project devs that have profited from it from the people who bought in. I think it's a chance type still when it comes to profiting.",

What are its perks and benefits?IEOs are just an upgraded version of ICO. Since the credibility of ICOs has gone down to drain, the shady coin creators have found a way to sell off their shitcoins through an exchange. That's what is IEO. So personally I don't invest in IEOs. Because no exchange is doing a due diligence before accepting a coin into their platform for selling. So IEOs also don't have any credibility where I can put my hard earned money!",

What are its perks and benefits?IMO, from the various types of initial offers, IEO is the safest type of initial offer. Because this offer is an offer held on the Exchange. Of course this is an advantage for potential investors, they will feel safe because their funds / investments are protected by the exchange. Apart from security, investors will also benefit in terms of ROI, I don't see many projects fail after IEO on an exchange.Note: I'm talking about IEOs on major exchanges like Binance and FTX.",

We already have so many new investment thingy right now like NFT that many investors are no longer like wanted to be an angel investor on IEO. And I haven't heard of any top tier exchanges that their launchpad is still alive to support this projects.",

This era is ending, just like when the ICO era ended.it looks like not much else brings big profits. but at this time we still see many new projects also doing IEO sales. some cooperate with launch platforms and then trade on exchanges like pancakes. even some projects are not promising after trading.as you said, the IEO will probably end up the same as the ICO. when more and more projects end up scammed.",

      "body": "My advice - if you can not identify a good project on your own, use one of the reputable exchanges we have in the space to participate in ieo.The reason - these exchanges know how to scout for the potential project with experience teams who are ready to be fully committed to the project they create long-term. The market is full of short to mid-term projects that are only based on hype with no real utility. And to be honest, it is not easy to fully identify a good project just by looking up the website and the team, there are other details that need to be checked which may not be accessible to an investor but can be accessible to exchanges. so imo, the best way to have a good ieo project is through exchanges.",

Lol, I thought everyone is no longer or at least the majority is looking for other investment method this year.Sort of, there are still a few projects that are going through Binance launch pad. But unlike before, there's almost no interest in it. Those projects that come out on Binance these days, they're just like a bunch of incentives for their BNB holders on their vault.But the actual interest for investing into those projects, we're almost certain that they're not that really interested at all but they're just all for the value of it once it's sellable in the market.",

These parameters will always matter in IEO, regardless of the market or trend. Even in a bearish trend, there can be projects that yield tens and hundreds of X's. Think of step ann or STEPN projects that gave 100 X's in a bear market. The trend of altcoins themselves is also important, if it is NFT or Metaverse, the project may collect a bit more capitalization than some DeFi protocol.",
