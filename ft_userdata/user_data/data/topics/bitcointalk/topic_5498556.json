  "content": "One of the big health companies Salmer Scientific Inc. announced their biggest adoption of bitcoin as a treasury reserve, Salmer Scientific has bought over 581BTC which is worth over $40 million dollars. Quote from: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/semler-scientific-announces-bitcoin-treasury-strategy-302156715.html A pioneer in developing and marketing technology products and services to healthcare providers to combat chronic diseases, announced today that its board of directors has adopted bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. In addition, Semler Scientific announced that it has purchased 581 bitcoins for an aggregate amount of $40 million, inclusive of fees and expenses. According to Mr. Eric Salmer he believes in bitcoin for two major reasons which includes it's unique characteristics as a scarce and finite asset that can serve as a reasonable inflation hedge and safe haven amid global instability and it's architectural resilience makes it preferable to gold. Since the ETF approver bitcoin has witnessed alot of adoptions by big institutions and this has kept me pondering to myself that I'm being so lazy to have a good quality of bitcoin. perhaps if this big institutions are still buying big quantities of bitcoins why then you a small quantity holder sell? if this big institutions grap your quota of bitcoin are you sure you would be getting them back?.what I'm saying in essence is that we should keep buying, holding and never to sell as the night is still very young.",

Small unit holders: most of them buy bitcoin without a target. Some buy with a target, and once they hit the price at which they target, there is no point for them to hold back again; they will just sell and take profit.  There are also some people who buy bitcoin with money that they would have used for something else, and once the need for the money arises, they will have no other option than to sell it off and solve their pressing problem.  One of the best ways to buy and hold bitcoin for a long period of time is if the person has a stable source of income, so the money they invested in bitcoin won't affect their expenses in any way, and even when the price drops, they won't be affected.",

Well its up to someone if his in profits they will sell obviously. Dont forget that bitcoin is a speculative asset, so it means it also go down and some traders take advantage of its during its down and up situation.They can actually do swing trade to accumulate it since we cant afford to do what big institutions can capable of acquiring huge chunks of bitcoin.Another gamble it is for this huge institution hope it panned out good in the end.",

I don't know how good an advice it is to tell people never to sell or spend their coins, BTC is a currency, so it should be normal for people to spend it on things they can buy with it.

Maybe because some of us cannot afford to buy more bitcoins yet? I know you are only trying to be encouraging but some investors might feel guilty knowing they only own small amount of bitcoin but a lot of us are trying our best. Some are doing everything just to keep doing dca. Not all of us have the same economic situation and only a few can actually comfortably invest without worries.",

      "body": "Wow, a health company invested in bitcoin and a leader that believes in it because of the most logical reason why bitcoin is the best hedge against inflation. It's such an awesome thing that there's more and more institutional investors that are getting their hands into the bitcoin market, I have some reservations about the increased number of these people but hopefully it's for nothing and that retail investors can still enjoy investing in bitcoin without any kind of gatekeeping.Quote from: Orpichukwu on June 01, 2024, 07:45:47 PMSmall unit holders: most of them buy bitcoin without a target. Some buy with a target, and once they hit the price at which they target, there is no point for them to hold back again; they will just sell and take profit. Can't blame them, there are bills to pay after all and sometimes it's just too difficult to get back into bitcoin because there are people out there that find the current price where they sold their bitcoin a bit hard to buy back and even if they wait a little while when the price is going down, it's probably a difficult time for them because it makes them think that they only have so little bitcoin and that it will probably take them a long time to accumulate something that would be decent to their standards. Some people just don't have that in them to go back in, or there are people out there that were able to do it the right way which is taking profit and using that profit to build a business or something and then they can easily just get back into bitcoin without a hitch because they have more ways to make money and they can easily put in a lot of money so they don't feel like their investment is really slow.",

That's a big and positive news for all the BTC owners. If someone is investing that much of amount from their business into BTC then they would have researched something that is not in mind of ordinary traders.Now it's difficult to understand that what he has seen in BTC and Invested such a big capital but it's easy to understand that everyone loves his money and no one would do that for the loss.",

I am only surprised that they have to buy Bitcoin this late when the price is already high than the price it was at the year start. If they had invested in Bitcoin earlier than this, they would already be happy for the profit they would have accumulated.",

I think the ETF approvals recently have given people verification that Bitcoin isa valid asset. I wonder also if Michael Saylor laid the foundations for companieslike this to get into Bitcoin?",
