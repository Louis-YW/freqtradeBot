I can’t say yet that I have confidence in AI trading bots. From my experience, I continue to conclude that for the time being, a person is coping with this task more effectively, since a human being does not analyse dry numbers and patterns on the chart, but also takes into account the fundamental indicators that affect the visual component.",

Even if it does 50 good trades, there is always the chance something horrible can happen at the 51st trade. You might say, the same thing can happen if you make those trades yourself. True, but at least that's my mistake and proof I shouldn't be trading if I don't know what I am doing. There is too much focus on trading here by people who have no skills to do it at all. Buy the coin you want and hold it. If it reaches a prize point you are happy with, sell it.",

      "body": "@OP, Do you want to start using bots to carry out your trade? Well, unfortunately, I cannot make a choice for you because I don't rely on AI decisions for certain things, like trading, gambling, and comments decisions. Just as Sir Pmalek has said, even if the bot makes 50 successful trades, there are still zero chances that the 51 trades will be successful because bots are not so certain about the crypto market andv price regulation, just as humans are not very certain either. I will prefer to do my normal trades myself, even if I am just making a little profit. I must not make a handful of profits before realizing it; a gradual and steady profit for me means I don't need the bot. Let's say, for example, that you rely too much on a trading bot, and sometimes the bot begins to malfunction when you have gotten so used to it. In that scenario, I believe you may not be able to trade by yourself since the bot is no longer working at that moment.",

In fact no professional will take you seriously if you say so. AI are machines programmed by humans to give out output based on some certain command and situations. Bitcoin market is not static is changes per second and new data is added per millisecond. So even if we assume that AI can do the prediction, it means some human agent must be present to training it with the new data which for now is not possible. I think for now we should focus on perfecting/ mastering our trading skills than looking for the easy way out.",

And from the looks of these they aren't that different. Calling them AI is just a trend when they actually are based on same algorithms as before.Most of these are going to belly up when market conditions are changing. Use your head. If there would be an infinite money making machine, it wouldn't be used by public as it would stop making money immediately.Trading is a zero sum game. If you think you can trust a trading bot doing the heavy lifting for you, you most likely are better off investing longer time frames and have an exit target that you commit to.",

The only different I see between using bot and normal real time prediction is that those bot will help in easy price prediction faster than a human will read a chart as that’s what they have been programmed to do.",

Good observation, actually I'm not disputing the fact that most bots are not  reliable but as a beginner OP should focus more on the learning process if he wishes to go far on trading, preferably I would advise him to make some research online and also watch some videos to learn the fundamentals and technical analysis and more because even using both trading without a basic knowledge about trading could lead to account blown so if OP wishes to build a career on trading acquiring the skill will be the best instead of relying on bot to trade for him.",
