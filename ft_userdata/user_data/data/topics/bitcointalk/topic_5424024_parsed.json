      "body": "Most Altcoin play to earn games have an initial investment requirement to begin with.  There are a few games out there, but I would say you are too late to start now as well, since others have been playing for many years already.Personal opinion.  Better use the playing time to sit down and browse the forum.  Once qualified, try to participate in a Signature Campaign.  Will not make you rich, but will not waste your time either.-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "There are many play to earn projects that are still active, have Benn unsuccessful or are new to the industry. What you need to look out for are those that are already in the market and are trusted. For example Sandbox, Axie infinity & Gods unchained. These are some of the most trusted and reputed once. If you are looking for something new in this niche then follow  BTT ANN page or you can check dApp raider. You also need to check the initial investment as most need your money and then only you can start. It is better to do your own research everytime before investing as scammers in this domain are always eager to grab your money.",
