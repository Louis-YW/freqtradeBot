I mean if the foreign currencies is bought by the citizens of a country and hold in their bank account, and not used to buy from another country.First, you might want to change the domiciliary account to something like a USD/foreign currency account for more people to understand. My experience with international dealings shows that domiciliary accounts are known in Nigeria and perhaps a very few other countries.As for the question, Foreign reserves are the assets in the care of the central banks of a country and they could be bonds, deposits/banknotes and other securities backed by the government and contractual agreements. In your case, the deposit is part of it, but mind you, the reserves are often used to back liabilities as well. Just because you deposited $1000 doesn't mean that a liability of $5000 will not happen on the same day. So, as you deposit your foreign currency, the bank merely owes you that amount but that doesn't mean that particular deposit wouldn't be spent as the foreign reserves continue to find the concluding summation between the country's assets and liabilities. And if citizens do not spend from the reserve, the government might.In case all of the citizens didn't spend FX but deposited, the government would still sustain their foreign obligations. But in this case, if the government earns more FX on their own, then it won't depend on citizens' FX savings and the foreign reserves will not be affected but increase. In case both the government and citizens decide not to spend their foreign reserves but add to it, of course, it will continue to grow.",

A positivity in the value of the foreign reserves indicates good economy.I'm not well-versed in economic matters, but I believe this is a mistaken assumption. How can they increase the value of a local currency? Do you mean an increase in the quantity, like printing more money? Central banks can do that, and even the US did so during the pandemic by printing more money.The US printed more than $3 trillion in 2020 alone. Here’s why it matters today",

I think the answer is No, the reason being that the individual having such foreign currency in their domi account will count it as an investment for themselves, whereas the one kept by the government is a reserve for the nation's economy. You said it already on the OP (which I think you already have your answer to there). If the value of the government foreign reserve is positive, that means the country's economy will be good, but if it's an individual account that holds some foreign currency and perhaps the value is positive, that means it's profitable to the individual alone.",

I mean if the foreign currencies is bought by the citizens of a country and hold in their bank account, and not used to buy from another country.You are answering your own question. The foreign currency reserves are held by the central bank of a certain country, not by the citizens of that country in their personal bank accounts. Usually the central banks are holding their currency reserves in other central banks, not in the form of cash, but in the form of highly liquid government/treasury bonds.In general, having less foreign reserves mean that the central bank of that particular country can't intervene in the currency markets, when the national currency drops down in value. The countries with less foreign reserves tend to have higher inflation levels and less valuable national currencies.When more people want to open bank accounts in USD or Euro, this means that the demand for USD/EURO in that country does up and the demand for the local currency does down. This means that the local currency becomes less valuable.",

UK oil when taking advantage of the good times do not trickle down the benefits to the retail price of fuel. for instance retail products did not get 37% cheaper in 2022-2023.. however UK fuel prices are no longer £1.90 a litre but now £1.50 a litre",

There are many types of foreign exchange reserves, they can be gold, securities, foreign currency, and etc. Countries can obtain foreign exchange reserves by purchasing gold bullion or through import and export trade activitiesIf someone has the currency of a foreign country and saves it, it does not mean that the country loses foreign exchange but instead increases the exchange rate because of the large demand. For example, many dollars are saved as foreign exchange, so even though USD is printed many times, the exchange rate remains high because market demand for dollars is always high. America is also the country that holds the largest gold reserves",

For example, gold acts as a reserve in every government, and every individual buys gold as an investment/asset it mean the reserves of the country increase? NoThe reserve is something that the government holds not including the assets of their citizen and to my knowledge, only USD is considered as a reserve currency, not fiat in general. The important reason is that USD is used for every international trade whether it is between a country in Asia and North America or so on but in recent days things have changed which could change the whole dynamics of the dollar if things become successful I mean if international trades becomes possible without involving USD.",

I was put under the impression that foreign reserves could be anything that has value and from a different country, like resources used to pay off national debt for instance. From a macro level of management such as a country, it doesn't make sense to hold on to money and use it as a form of systemic store of value for when times are tough, that's a little skewed. It makes much more sense for it to be stuff that has inherent value, like resource or perhaps anything that came from the country of relevance, so it could systematically decrease in amount and actually be a factor in causing inflation.

Yes of course! I believe I've already answered it as part of deposits/banknotes (through banks) is part of the foreign reserves. Only that the central bank is the reserve custodial, you can't remove it.Removing the central bank, then what you are trying to establish is simply \"Impossible,\" the central bank has to be involved to call it a \"Reserve\", mere banks can't reserve for the nation, they are only a \"Means,\" but the deposits through them counts.There can't be any foreign reserve without the central banks as they are the ones with the obligations, they have the central link/control of all banks which individual banks lack, so without them, your \"Deposit\" is just a deposit as there is no central control to add the deposit to be named a \"Reserve\" at all.

Rather, it is an indicator of the quality of the economy, since the foreign exchange reserves show the productivity of the foreign economy, the country's trade turnover and profit for the past years. By its state we can judge about the state of economy of a certain state. This suggests that gold reserves also serve as emergency reserves in case of economic collapse, giving strength to recover.The only nuance is that by selling reserve currency on the domestic market, the government can \"smooth\" inflation or speculative movements on the currency market",

Decrease in Foreign Reserve can only contribute to inflation if the reserve currency is used mostly for consumption of scarce goods and services of the country that owns it. Your country's Foreign Reserve is nationally rather than individually/privately owned. It decreases when it's spent or sold for another goods/currency by those who control it. It still decreases if your government sell it to you and buy up your local. currency Selling your local currency for dollar would increase the price of dollar if the demand for dollar is greater than supply, while your local currency would decrease in value if there are more sellers than buyers. Demand for your local currency would organically increase (consequently increasing its value) if your economy have enough better quality goods and services that are in high demand",
