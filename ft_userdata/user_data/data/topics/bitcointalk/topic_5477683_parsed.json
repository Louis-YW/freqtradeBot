We know that Sats are use to calculate smaller amounts of Bitcoin but the 1000SATS is totally different its an altcoin created by an anonymous team.We know Bitcoin halving and ETF is on the way which means more bulls than bears to bitcoin investors and this also as attracted scammers and so we should be cautious of how we store our bitcoin and scam projects like this.Binance Adds New Altcoin: A Tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto",
