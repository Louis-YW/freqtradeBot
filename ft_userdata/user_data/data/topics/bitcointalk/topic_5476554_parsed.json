I think the principle is simple, just keep adding ownership as long as the price is right and reasonable, even if LTC goes up again, wait again when the market gives a discount, if there aren't enough other options available in Altcoin, it's just time to research again to survey prices and potential increases",

Declarations as a commodity, together with backing from significant organizations like as Fidelity, EDXM, PayPal, Venmo, and Grayscale, strengthen its position. The prospect of an ETF increases the potential upside. The use of MWEB for anonymity, paired with a fair launch, no premine, and steady uptime, increases the legitimacy of Litecoin. Given these variables in the context of the changing crypto environment, the potential of Litecoin's imminent awakening becomes increasingly realistic.",

The giant in that comment goes with a question mark because Litecoin has remained embarrassingly on the floor while those other coins on the top list with it have continued to do well. It's even more embarrassing that it slumped after its own halving a few months ago, precisely on 2nd August, 2023 from around $90 to $72 as I type this. I don't want to worry my head over where its price is headed ATM with the few unit I bought but I'm hopeful it might do a triple of its current price once the Bitcoin rally begins proper.

I mean, I still think it's great, but I'm not so sure that it's gonna be in the top 10 again and breaking new heights. I'd be glad to be wrong.Well, it depends on the project but most of the old altcoins will still perform later next year but almost all of them will never hit their ATH anymore, or at least in the coming post-halving cycle. This is against what many expect but it's going to be the reality as several coins/tokens with better projects and scalability are now on board and money has to be distributed on them all (market capitalization).Litecoin in particular, I am becoming wary of it, I don't think I still have so much trust in that coin judging by how it behaves at times like this. Litecoin is still very good for transactions, but for HODLing, I will always have a rethink, there are better coins/tokens. The coin is seriously challenged for now, it didn't even show any sign that a bull run is happening, and that's too bad. For the 10th position it was before, I don't think it will ever reclaim it again. It's at $72+ with a position of 18, but might get lower in position according to my speculation.",

Old alts suddenly seeking to reclaim lost glory has to be one of the biggest twists we didn't see coming this bull market. Already bought a handful of them back in October and left on Bitget. Haven't checked the CEX in a while to see those bags, but it's good that they remain in safe hands for now, and I'm sure they will perform well when the bulls come.",

It’s wakey wakey soonNo matter how good other projects are, bitcoin and ETH will always be in the top two on my list. If i am going to invest in any altcoin beside ETH then it will be a new one that came to the market when the market was in a bearish moment. Also it needs to be a new narrative that can be in the next trend. From my observation, I saw that you will make money in the altcoin market if you follow the trend. When there is a trend going on about pow coin or pos coin and layer 1 or layer 2 blockchain then more people will start investing in those projects with FOMO. This will cause a pump and all the project in that category start pumping hard.",

It’s wakey wakey soonWith LTC there is no need to talk too much about the hype surrounding it, even without the things the OP mentioned, those who have researched and trusted it will still know how to make appropriate decisions to achieve the target they want.I don't doubt the ability of LTC to increase in price in the future, but like many other altcoins, we still understand the dependence and binding of altcoins through Bitcoin. When the upward trend becomes clearer, the top altcoins will automatically benefit, and we will see news like partner launches, or some kind of upgrade to attract more people.",

You could say LTC is a legendary altcoin. In short, LTC can be said to be one of the first altcoins to originate from Bitcoin's original open source code. It's just that with more and more altcoins emerging, making the cryptocurrency market competitive, LTC's popularity has declined somewhat, and up to now LTC is still struggling to enter the top 10 on CMC.For me, I need crypto to transfer money. Currently LTC is the best because of its low transaction fees. BTC is the king but Litecoin is for everyone as it has the best performance at the moment.",
