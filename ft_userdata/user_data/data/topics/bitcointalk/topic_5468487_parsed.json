Trading sometimes is done by naive people that feels you can just make millions overnight through this act but they don't know trading is something we actually need to play about and it takes year of study to actually fully understand the whole ethics and principle techniques behind trading successfully.",

Good thing that you've realized now. But still, you can try your luck at an amount that you can afford to lose.  Keep in mind that trading isn't a good source of income, and the chances of losing your fund are likely possible.",

You have to also have someone who's in the market before you to at least coach you through, give you some words of advise, not that because you think you know or have an idea of trading that you can do it on your own. Ones you have someone to guide you then I don't think it will ruin you.Even when you have that experience you still need a strategy to follow, because having a strategy will help you more than you could ever imagine. Sometimes those you refer to as \"newbies\" might be doing quite well more than yourself so is best to take advise from different sources just to be on the safer side.",

The art of trading is something that baffles me as I try to understand it. I advise new traders not to start with futures trading, it’s the easiest way to get liquidated. Like you said in the OP a more practical approach would be to buy, hodl and sell at a profit. Although this process is slow and is not the kind of perceptive presented to newbies by “professional traders” on the internet.",

Unavoidably you will be killed by the market and greed traders usually will try to revenge the market after one or few losses. This response only cause them more losses till they have nothing to lose.QuoteSo newbie, stay of trading futures if you know nothing about technical analysis or fundamental analysis for not to be ruined.Even you know about fundamental and technical analysis, you can still be ruined by trading.

It is a hardest experience for any trader if they touch altcoins and trade those shitcoins.Trading is already risky but if they trade altcoins, they have bigger risk by scam wicks, arbitrary minting more new tokens like Do Kwon did with Terra $LUNA tokens in May 2022. They can suddenly lose all if those project owners rug pull and drain out liquidity pools.Without scams, trading is already risky and hard to get profit with it in a long run.",

If you don't understand cryptocurrency it is impossible to make profit from trading. I think the reason beginners always fall into this big shit of losing money in trading is because they feel too lazy to learn and it can be done so good with their ordinary understanding.  To make it trading experience is needed so much, but beginners don't consider this as important.  Knowledge in trading is as important just like the capital that will be use for trading , Knowledge and the  money involve in trading works together.",
