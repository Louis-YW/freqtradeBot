What's your take?If Christians do not involved in politics then who will come and change the Society? Do you understand the concept or meaning of Politics? Now I believe you yourself is a Christian. Will be involved in Politics so you can do what others have not done to change the Society? Even in the Bible there is Politics. In the book of first Samuel and second Samuel, when the Israelites asked Samuel to tell God to give them King. And Samuel asked God and God told Samuel to select Saul as the king in Israel. Who was the first Government appointment by man in Israel. And the people were happy because they believed that Saul would do what they ( the Israelites) need in the Society. Therefore, Christians participating in Politics is the best way to develop the countries. Now we are suffering because the leaders are not born again.",

The whole thing about religion is about power and dominion and with that comes politics.",

However, when they lie, it's not vecause of politics, it's because they choose to.Working in politics requires constant evasiveness and cunning. Traits we usually find in wolves. This is because the politician is in a continuous battle with his opponents, who will come to power or who will implement his political agenda and implement his views on the ground.Religion is supposed to possess the ultimate truth through the authority of God. If we combine it with politics, it spoils both. Here I am talking about religion in general and not about Christianity in particular or any specific religion.",

EVERYONE should be engaged in politics imho and everyone should be free to run provided they qualify for the position. Then it's just a matter of making sure they keep their religious/ethnic biases out of their decision-making and that they not give preferential treatment to their \"kind\".

If the nation will not accept them, they will be ousted. But if they make enough sense, people just might start to wake up. Things might start to change.Politics doesn't really mean simply being a politician. What did Trump do? He started a media program to counteract the evil in media today... although he may not be wholeheartedly engaged in it. Bitcoin mining people could start power plants to supply their electricity. Christian politicians might need to start all kinds of businesses - not they themselves, directly; rather, their supporters - just to bypass the control the current, evil politicians have over the nation.It will take time. But more and more of current business will throw in with Christian politicians once they see the sense of their platforms.",

If you're a Christian and choose to be uninterested in the politics of your nation, if a bad person becomes leader, you will still be affected by whatever decisions they make. As a Christian, even if you do don't like to get your hands dirty by being a candidate, you can still be very involved in the electoral process of your nation, do don't just stand aside.",
