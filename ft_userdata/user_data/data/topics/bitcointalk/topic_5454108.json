And looky here - your only NON lending post ever is in the gambling section.Since apparently you're the \"gatekeeper\" of this forum, you would know that the gambling section isn't my only comment or response since you can research pretty good. And what temperament? I asked again after he didn't provide any feedback. So what's your point? You don't have one. You act like I got mad and said something crazy. I get it. You just want to be negative and comment. Enjoy",
