Saving recovery seeds and private keys in email addresses is something people still do today, I talked to a brother to ask if he has gotten his hardware wallet since he has been talking about buying one for a long time, he said he hasn't, I asked why and he said he didn't need to anymore, so I asked him what could be better than a hardware wallet and he said he opened an email address for the recovery seed and private keys keeping only.I was shocked, because this is someone who understands how secured hardware wallets are, he really believes that what he did is safer. He said hackers can't know the email address because he never uses the email for anything else, that's when I burst his brain with many possible ways hackers can still get his email address. There are many email tools out there, both free and premium ones, and they have this greatly disastrous way of finding and generating email addresses that are already in use. I am glad he listened and believe me, imagine what would have happened if we never discussed it.",

Trusting them can be a pain in the ass at times. I have witnessed numerous instances of people being tricked and cheated by their close friends and family members, which is why I have never advocated entrusting a friend or relative with a significant amount of money. No one can be trusted when it comes to money because, despite its occasional allure, it is said to be the root of all evil. I suggest that we exercise caution before entrusting our private keys to anyone.

Many people disregard these small security precautions. It's not a good idea to give someone administrator access to your computer because it will give them full access to everything, believing the owner to be the operator. Some users may delete files unknowingly or with malicious intent, so it's best to only give them guest access for security reasons.Quote from: tech30338 on March 21, 2023, 01:17:23 AMStoring sensitive data in your Email account - We have sometimes store data in emails, but what if the account were hack, all the data there will be leak and use, like wallet keys and seed phrase, some store it locally or in an external drive just to be safe , some write it on the peace of paper and keep it in a safe place.We should all refrain from keeping sensitive information like passwords, private keys, or seed phrases in our emails because storing sensitive information online is extremely unsafe and emails are also risky. In addition to them being hacked, saving them on email is like giving them to someone else to keep for you. What if an employee finds them and decides to use them to steal your assets? The ideal option to save any sensitive information is offline, in a location that only you can access.",

I didn't see administrator login as a problem since I'm the only one using my computer and I do not allow anyone to use it. So just don't let them use your computer if you have important accounts or files.When you save your password to your browser or your email it wasn't really that bad, but it would be easy for hackers to gain access to your accounts if they infiltrate your computer. The same as saving your files to your emailUsing an Authenticator is an added layer of security to your accounts so it's always recommended especially for your accounts that have balance. I was one of the guilty saving the same password to some of my accounts, but I did change it, especially to my important accounts or accounts that have funds on them, I guess if it's just a random account on the internet you could do some random or similar password. One of the most common hacking techniques is phishing which mostly happened through email messages disguised as an organization, sending malware, fake invoice, or asking a confirmation/personal information, etc. Probably just do not click anything that is suspicious on your messages or anything that is send by just some random guy on the internet.",
