Â Very correct according to the datas available the last post from the account is on the 12 December meaning yesterday, but active here in the forum on the 13th-12 this is somewhat a close case and should be overlooked considering the content of the statement which borders on an important actor in the development of Bitcoin and this forum, and if you have being following things, you will know already that the figures Satoshi did all that is needed to conceal his identity and also practices privacy at the highest level, this is quite commendable of him considering the nature of Bitcoin and how decentralization can be well practiced.Privacy and decentralizationFor Bitcoin to amount to it highest potential there must be none interference from external forces such as the developer and other actors in the Bitcoin network like the miners and developers who contribute to the project, it close consensiship and freedom is highly protected.Satoshi aim for Bitcoin:Let Bitcoin development and growth move organically with interference, and let the project evolve with time, which is the basis for Bitcoin decentralization, so Satoshi have to pay that sacrificed of disappearing, to protect his privacy and also the Bitcoin network, this is what make Bitcoin decentralized unlike altcoins who's developers and owners are known reason for their centralization.",

So in the end for now I will still take my hat off to those who are still anonymous not only to Satoshi but to everyone who does it because they don't even want to be known for their achievements and prefer privacy as one of the things that must remain a secret so as not to become something bad in the future.",

I am very happy that he made this decision earlier when bitcoin was still been seen by many as a joke and something that will never become profitable in the future.

I also have this same thought about Satoshi. The fact that Satoshi chose to remain anonymous does not mean he is not monitoring what is going on both here in the forum and in the Bitcoin network in general. Yea, Satoshi might still be here amongst us in disguise, he didn't not vanish into thin air or disappear as most people would say, he just chose to hide his identity and still give room for other bitcoiners to contribute to developing the network. Satoshiâ€™s decision to stay anonymous and also make other users of bitcoin anonymous is the greatest strength of Bitcoin. If Satoshi didn't make it so, the government would have succeeded a long time ago in banning bitcoin completely.",
