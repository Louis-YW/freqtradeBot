There are some that are very volatile like gambling just like altcoins are very volatile. Bitcoin is less volatile. So if you want to compare both, you can mention the stock that you want to compare bitcoin with. But as for me in general, I will prefer bitcoin.",

Does not make either of them good or bad, they have their own unique profile.Quote from: krishnaverma on June 22, 2024, 09:23:52 AMCan Bitcoin be a good investment over stocks in a recession period ? Also, explain why do you feel so ? In the time of recession, the costs of goods may drop and income may also reduce unless you are working in some specific sectors. You might not have money at hand to be able to continue to investing-rich lifestyle instead have to come to minimalist lifestyle to choose the needs over luxuries and by all means investing is a luxury that comes after needs.So if you are already invested in bitcoin before a recession hits, then it makes sense.",

But how much profit you can make from it depends entirely on your abilities, not decided by bitcoin. Bitcoin is better and has more potential, that doesn't mean you don't need knowledge and experience to rush into investing blindly and expect big profits. Financial markets don't work like that. It doesn't matter which market it is and profits will come from your knowledge, and not the market's decisions.If you have no knowledge, no experience but want to get rich quickly and think that just investing in bitcoin without doing anything else will achieve what you want. Then you will even lose everything, let alone how much profit you earn. Meanwhile, stock investors with knowledge and experience...will make more profits than you.",

But in general, Bitcoin has performed quite well compared to most if not all stocks from the time of its inceptionLet's not forget that back then, the price of Bitcoin was in cents. Today, I don't think we shall see yearly moves of 2,000%, like it was possible back then. So If a recession were to happen today, things may not be the same as they were 15 years ago.",

I remember in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of people invested in bitcoin and towards the end of the year, the price moon when stocks were crashing. I agree that stocks easily get affected by recession because during a recession company can easily get impacted with losses that’s why you see things like companies reducing staffs and so. Having stocks here can cause panic and many people can start reducing their investment holdings leading to bearish periods for the stock, that’s why the recession effect is dependent on the type of stock you invest in. Bitcoin on the other hand doesn’t have a central body and a country recession doesn’t affects it directly, but a global recession too will definitely affect the trend of bitcoin. During recession people are bent in to reducing their costs and more often volatile assets are the ones they do away with. A strong supply power as we know leads to fall in place",

I've chosen to buy Bitcoin instead of it and that's why this is what I have and don't have stocks at all. But I don't know during the recession period. We're all believing that this is the hedge against inflation and it's been made during the 2008 crisis. It's able to survive during the pandemic and Ukraine-Russian war. So what's more to ask about it? Maybe the worst hasn't come yet but I believe that even on the toughest period of time that the entire world is going to go through with such recession, Bitcoin will survive no matter what happens. It's designed to survive it although it's been made as a peer to peer cryptocurrency but then its attributes have changed and became one of the best assets on this century.",

It is because people will always have to use toothpaste, toilet paper, medicine etc… It is hard to beat these stocks during a recession.Btc on the other hand usually acts like a leveraged nasdaq index fund and the Nasdaq stocks are mostly tech stocks. Tech stocks don’t do well in a recession so I think Bitcoin won’t be an exception.In a recession I would go with the defensive stocks.

It falls harder but recovers faster and rises higher.",
