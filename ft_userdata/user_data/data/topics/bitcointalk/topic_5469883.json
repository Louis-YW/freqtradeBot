Due to that you have to take your decisions in hurry or being emotional. You have to Do TA and FA. while in hodl you need not to take that much stress.I had alot of conversation over hodling in this given thread where alot of seniors share their thoughts and experiences in this thread over it must read..........>>>>Buy the DIP, and HODL!",

      "body": "QuoteHodling vs trading I prefer holding because it doesn't bring too much stress to me and I have more time to do my main job. DCA and holding, are both easy to do and yield better results, IMO. Meanwhile, trading requires a large amount of knowledge and you have to spend a lot of time in front of the computer screen every day to test and analyze the market. But in the end, all of that is not enough for you to make the right trading decisions, things can still go against your predictions and cause you losses. As we all know, trading is much more complicated, and it is not for the masses.",

      "body": "Holding is for investors and trading is for traders. The investors basically find Bitcoin as an asset that will grow in value if they hold it for long term at least 4 years or more. The investors are the ones who believe in Bitcoin and they suggest everyone to purchase Bitcoin. The traders are basically the ones who are good at trading and they want to earn a certain percentage of income in a week, month, or a year. The traders are the ones who really don't care much about Bitcoin during their trading session because their main goal is to have profits in short-term and they can sometimes trade wrong coins which may cause huge losses for them. There are a group of traders who believe in Bitcoin trading only and they mostly exchange Bitcoin to another stable coin and again that stable coin to Bitcoin, and during the process they earn some percentage as profit.We need both of those in Bitcoin ecosystem because both of them are playing good roles for Bitcoin. The investors are the ones who are constantly investing in Bitcoin and they are basically helping the Bitcoin to achieve it's price levels while the traders are also keep the ecosystem active because they are trading Bitcoin on daily basis.",

Of course yes.Hodling is a term used to describe owning Bitcoin in a wallet especially for a long period of time.While trading on the other hand refers to the selling and buying of Bitcoin through an exchange.Both traders and hodlers can use an exchange to buy or sell their Bitcoin. Long-term investors can sell their Bitcoin through exchanges anytime they want so it is not only traders that use exchanges. It will be more comfortable to say that traders use exchanges more more often than hodlers. But in selling or buying our coins we should also bear in mind the risk associated with using centralised exchanges. I also think that hodling Bitcoin is more profitable than trading, but it requires a lot of patience and sacrifice. Bitcoin investors don't have a get-rich-quick mentality because they believe they know that their investment is long-term. If you don't want to pay attention to media drama and government policies, just concentrate on long-term hodling.",

Micheal Saylor, El Salvador President,  Robert Kiyosaki and those you know are real in for the uprise of Bitcoin,  they want to see you hold than they want to see you trade your coins. Sowhy not adopt the same way they go. If you can not buy the way they do to accumulate and increase your holdings don't panic just make sure you have something doing as that wouldn't lead to you pushing trade your Bitcoin. People trade for profits too, the question now is are your chances of profit  accumulations sure?",

Its a psychological battle with everybody having their method of persevering either due to their belief or another reason. Despite my belief in Bitcoin I'm still plagued by doubt and fear when it falls. I don't really have anybody to discuss my pains with but Currently what I do is go to the WO thread and start reading. People there joke and are sometimes happy when Bitcoin falls. They want to buy the dip, this usually helps me persevere and the wait is always worth it. I would be like \"they having Bitcoins worth thousands of dollars and ain't scared then why should I\"If there's anything as Anti- trading then I'm one. No matter how good your analysis is a news would still destroy it. The only way you recover is through holding.My bias view.Those trading Altcoins have a heart of steel",

It takes a lot of capital to hold bitcoin to get big profit, maybe this can be done by buying bitcoin in installments every month. Trading Bitcoin can get daily or weekly profits but the risks are big. So in my opinion there is no best of the two options, just choose the one that we think is the most profitable and suits our passionBut for me, I choose both, hold bitcoins and use them for trading so that I can take weekly or monthly profits and my bitcoin holdings will increase.",

      "body": "There has never been any debate about whether to hold Bitcoin or trade it. One can do either or both of them. It's their personal choice. The question arise only when you are confused which one to start first. And here's an idea of what one should do. Holding Bitcoin is a less risky approach. As in newbie who has less knowledge about Bitcoin and Bitcoin trading can always start with HODL. At this point all you need to do is learn how to keep your assets safe and how to keep your emotions in control. That's it. The more time passes by the more profits you will make. As you are HODLing, your assets are growing. At the same time you can focus on learning how to trade and forget about the holding account for the time being. So two things happen here. One, you get more assets or more value in the future. Two, you learn how to trade and by the time you master it you will have more assets to trade with.This is a great practice for every newbie. And as I already said, there is no debate about either to hold or tread. You can do both and take advantage of both of them.",

Although trading requires a minimum amount of coins, hodling does not.Trading doesn't require a minimum amount of coins, there's no minimum amount as you can trade with any amount but if you're using an exchange that's when you'll have to deposit money based on their deposit minimum of that exchange to trade. You can trade P2P directly without an exchange and you won't need a minimum deposit. Neither trading or holding needs a minimum amount of coin but to make profits you have to decide which amount you'll use to trade because the higher the amount, the more opportunity to get more profits when trading. Both Hodling and trading are guaranteed ways of making profits from Bitcoin but holding holds more pros then cons and that's why we're advice to hodl. You're stressing yourself when you trade when you could have just hodl and make profits. QuoteWith all these being  said it is important to note that hodling shitcoin is not advisable due to their exponentially high volatility which may lead to severe loss if not properly managed.Trading and hodling is always a choice as they indirectly serve as balance to the Bitcoin ecosystem.Shitcoins are to be avoided by all means, they should neither be traded or HODL because they bring nothing but losses. If you're trading them, you have to be very careful because their prices are more volatile and they're been manipulated by whales for their gains. Only trade or hodl bitcoin and you won't find yourself as a victim of the different scams that are becoming a frequent news in the industry.",
