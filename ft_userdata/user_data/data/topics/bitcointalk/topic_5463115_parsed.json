For me I think say this mining issue for here na solely because of the electricity problem but like you said even if person set this mining farm or solo mining the cost of electricity tariff go be him major issue to actually acquire profit for him Bitcoin mining but not withstanding Bitcoin mining can be still be done with solar power so finding solar na another option.Omo no be small my brother this country everyone just want find their belle. @ YouTubers",

      "body": "First, generally, bitcoin mining in Nigeria is a very good topic for us to discuss, just as the influencer in the video said, Bitcoin mining is a very hot topic here in Nigeria and that is because there have not been any known operational mining farms here in Nigeria I don't know of any other African country if there is any mining farm running effectively.One of the major challenges that is always pointed at is the lack of electricity supply and in solving that we have to look for.1: suitable location for bitcoin mining in Nigeria, where there is constant electricity and good environmental condition.2: high taxation and police brutality since Bitcoin is not yet legal in Nigeria.I believe that why the guy in the video choose Abuja is because of the electricity supply, because here in Abuja we still have stable electricity compared to other parts of the country, and also the weather conditions in Abuja also have good weather compared also to other states and may compete with Abuja in available electricity supply.You may be right that the video may have been acted since every YouTuber is looking for and trending topic to act their line on, to get the like and comment, follower so there is the possibility that the video may have been acted accordingly, from the name of the company (Shuga daddy mining) sound like a Ponzi scheme and that raised my suspicious higher in the authenticity of the video.",

Or they are making TikTok to go viral and earn money with it.Seriously have checked many a lot of post on this minning stuff but with most response have seen  minning now Is much  more hard . Imagine competing with the hash rate now is something else talk more of the country you are setting up your  miner the cost of maintenance  buying coolers because it get hot, Electricity and more .   I'm also obsessed about this minning of a thing though I knew little about it before but I get a lot more exposed here . It's  not advisable though but if you want to compete with what's out there you need the Recent ASIC MINER ranging from $38k above not to mention about the cost of maintenance. Even with the recent as have said the hash rate has increased so it takes a lot of effort . Besides,  next year Is the next halving so there's high probability  the hash rate increases drastically  as the amount of Bitcoin remaining to be mined will be reduced",
