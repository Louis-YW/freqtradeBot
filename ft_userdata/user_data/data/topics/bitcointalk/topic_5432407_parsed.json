Blockfi and Voyager already have thousands of users on it, so they know they can bring investors in the Tradfi to crypto and Goldman Sach as well will be a trusted counterparty. The collapse of FTX had boosted Goldmansach trading volume according to them and so they wanna be a savior of these firms.",

They are an investment bank which know where to put their money, if they see potential on a bear market then we should also do the same because bull will come and only time can tell, better to be ready for that.",

They are talking about the fact that the bankruptcy of FTX has caused a massive crash of basically every crypto project out there and this could be a good opportunity to buy into some good crypto projects with strong fundamentals because such a project has a very high chance to pump again once the next bull market arrives.This does not even mean that Goldman Sachs is having a positive view on cryptos or something, it just means that they maybe see a good investment opportunity here.",

After a big collapse, most whales and institutes look for only cheaper cryptocurrencies but this is first time I heard about the demand for the collapsed firm.What are the possibilities to acquire a bankrupted firm? By googling I learned these:1. Acquiring a firm for undervalue (not just for better price or cheaper price but far-best-price).2. Merging a bankrupted firm is easier and got tax benefits in some countries.Still, not sure about the exact case of Goldman Sachs and FTX but we can assume that Goldman Sachs is planning something big in crypto world by believing into the future of cryptocurrencies.",

To be perfectly fair, the fall of FTX was because of the dumb moves done by SBF, in general, imo exchanges are still and will always be a thing in the future, centralized or not. Most people just lost the idea that crypto should be stored in centralized exchanges, but it's still nonetheless functioning as an exchange imo, which is still a possible place for profit and potential growth. I'm assuming this is for other crypto firms though, and not FTX themselves specifically.
