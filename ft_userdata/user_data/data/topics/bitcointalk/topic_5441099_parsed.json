I guess the Iron Man theme slots, I love to play that game even though I actually never had any big wins. Of course, everyone one of us wanted to hit that free spins and then hopefully we can get that huge win, unfortunately it's not the case and we wait again and push and wish that we got to win again.We all have weaknesses on other games, such as those Egyptian theme games as well or like Greek mythologies based games.",

I do not bother about that and I keep gambling on football because I enjoy it more, especially during the big leagues playing. This can occur to anyone in both casino or sport gambling, but about casino, I do not think it would be pleasurable to the extent that I will lose and keep playing to keep losing more, there are other slots and games that are available on casino sites that I can choose instead.",

As an avid slot player but that has a lot of self control too I don't blame anyone playing slots,those are the games that make more money for the casino because they are highly addictive,the sound effects,the graphic arts and above all that highest payout you were seeking to get is all but something to keep you hooked.I also play 5 slots with the same theme,Arthurian Legend themed games from Play n Go provider as they all allow me to get x100 multiplier to my actual bet if I manage to get to the final round of the bonus game,that is what keeps me coming back,that x100 multiplier despite me many times losing money and very few times winning big exactly because of that multiplier.",

With your explanation, you are just wasting money unnecessarily, do you think that is reasonable? I don't think so. And if you don't know, what you are facing with the Bamboo is the same thing the addicted gambler faces in their life, so you are actually addicted to it.The mindset that you would get rich quicker by it has entrapped your mind, and if you must know, it's simply false, you won't, so break free. Perhaps you were lured to it by the first winnings, the latter is the reality, my friend.",

Well I can't tell more about such game but having much attention on sport betting more especially football, basketball and tabletennis. Secondly you have positioned yourself to make fortune out of gambling, I would advise you to just take it as a game of fun rather than having the mindset to get richer overnight.",

They are constantly losing on long term, but they can never stop playing, because it's a very entertaining hobby of theirs. I know that because I had close people to me who displayed this kind of behavior. When they lost, they felt upset and even blamed the machines, as the casino was rigged, however on the next week they were there again for another gambling session. And when they won, it was like they have never lost before, they count that as liquid profit...",

I also try to increase my wagered amount by playing it so I can reach a VIP that is higher than what I am now. The higher the VIP rank the more perks you can receive. Winning in sports betting is how I patch those losses and then I gamble it with Plinko for a longer amount of betting and increase my wager. It does work but there are times it could get brutal and it doesn't hit amounts that could get me back to ROI. That's my story for now but I may change strategy once I get to a rank that I am okay with.",
