Are you saying you can make transactions? How can you make transaction, if you don't have the 2FA code? And if you can make transaction, what's the problem now?Quote from: OmegaStarScream on August 18, 2023, 03:55:47 PMAccording to this article, and assuming you still have access to the email address you've used, trusted coin should be able to help you reset the 2FA if you reach out to them:This is only thing that can be done, if OP doesn't have the correct seed phrase (+passphrase, if there's any) and don't have access to the 2FA code.I would also send an email to trustedcoin, although I doubt they will help OP.https://trustedcoin.com/#/contact-us",

My wallet can now check the balance of the original address and send transactions normally (but the TrustedCoin two-step verification is missing)Please help me!By using TrustedCoin 2fa you essentially created a 2of2 multi-sig wallet.  If you try to restore the wallet with only your seed, you'll get a different wallet all together, that's normal.  Like any multi-sig wallet, you would need all the signer seeds to restore the wallet, and obviously TrustedCoin isn't going to share their seed with you.  However, when restoring the wallet, you'll be given the option to disable 2fa.  Once selected, you will be able to restore the wallet you want, and 2fa won't be required.  You'll have access to all your funds, and you can send them to another wallet if you choose.",

Take note that electrum 2FA wallet is a 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet and there are 3 master private keys. Let's say the master private keys are MPrK A, MPrK B and MPrK C and the master public keys are MPuK A, MPuK B and MPuK C.The wallet file contains MPuK A, MPuK B, MPuK C and MPrK A. MPrK B is owned by trustedcoin. The seed phrase can derive MPuK A, MPuK B, MPuK C, MPrK A and MPrK C. When you make a transaction from the 2FA wallet, you sign the transaction using MPrK A and with entering the 2FA code, you ask trustedcoin to sign the transaction using MPrK B as the co-signer. If you disable 2FA using your seed phrase, you restore the same wallet. The only difference after disabling 2FA is that transactions will be signed using MPrK A and MPrK C and you will no longer need trustedcoin to sign your transactions.

Since OP is deriving different addresses, he/she is importing an incorrect seed phrase.

That's not how electrum 2FA wallet works. Electrum 2FA wallet gives you a single seed phrase which can be used for deriving all required keys (three master public keys and two master private keys).With restoring your wallet using your seed phrase, you should get completely same addresses.",

      "body": "To expand on what hosseinimr93 has said above:Electrum 2FA wallets are a 2-of-3 mult-sig. As he points out, your wallet usually contains one set of private keys, and TrustedCoin hold another. However, your singular seed phrase can completely recover the 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet on its own without the need for importing a second seed phrase or any master public keys.The way it does this is fairly unique. Electrum will derive two master private keys from this seed phrase - one at m/0', and a second at m/1'. This provides the two sets of private keys needed to sign the transactions. To generate the master public key from the last share, it uses a hardcoded xpub from TrustedCoin, and deterministically combines that with your two master public keys at m/0' and m/1'.When you set up the wallet for the first time, Electrum will send your two master public keys to TrustedCoin. TrustedCoin can use the same deterministic process to use your two master public keys to generate your 2FA wallet on their servers, and of course they hold the master private key for the hardcoded xpub, allowing them to provide one signature when requested to do so.This process therefore allows you to fully restore your 2-of-3 wallet with two sets of private keys from a single seed phrase.",

The said search space shouldn't be that big.Also if OP had the wallet file or at least one outgoing transaction from that wallet, public keys can be extracted to be used in the loop for each item in the search space.",
