An increasing adoption for Bitcoin is going an soon its blocks will be fulled by bigger demand.In future I think Bitcoin developers will have to work and bring proposal to increase its block size like in 2017 with Segwit. Bitcoin community will vote to support that proposal and hopefully it won't be a mess like 2017 Segwit.",

You are right. If Lightning Network is in full action, bitcoin on chain transactions will be decreased. The transactions in Lightning Network has nothing to do with on chain. Only transactions, happening at the time of opening channel and closing channel, will have record in the bitcoin blockchain.",

I remember the fees of that time, though, which were around $25-30 per transaction if you want it confirmed within an hour or even a few hours. It seems that for the same waiting time the fees is currently around $2.5, so 10 times less. I'd say it's fantastic how much better things are now. I don't know how I feel about the reason of the spike, but it doesn't seem to hurt Bitcoin, so I suppose it's not a bad innovation.",

Although rising, tx fees remain relatively low compared to what they were in late 2017 / early 2018 and then the first half of 2021.I kinda think this time it's a kind of pyrrhic victory though, mainly because of the fees you mentioned. Truth is, if we're not careful and people keep abusing BRC20 spam, then Bitcoin is going to be rivaling crappy ATMs in transaction fees.Normally I would not have a problem with random meme tokens on the Bitcoin network, but as this is slowing the whole network to a crawl, there is some concern here.I guess the common hope around here is that this BRC20 fad ends as quietly as it started and fees go back to semi-normal. But there is no guarantee that is happening, especially if exchanges follow through with implementing this hot garbage.I'm also kinda bummed that BRC20 never turned out to be what I thought it was i.e. a protocol for Ordinals, and instead when you go to Twitter and look up its hashtag, you're immediately bombarded by \"WAGMI\" \"this is the beginning\" \"we are going to be rich\" type of posts about BRC20 meme tokens, which is going to fuel the maniac hysteria (and I can only imagine in horror what would happen if Elon rides this wave too, though it's not Doge at all so I guess we lucked out here).",

Even as it is one can boost his transaction by increasing the fear. One thing I am happy about bitcoin and ecosystem now is the massive adoption of the system. People are using bitcoin every day now.

There's nothing that can be done at this point to stop it, by anyone -- not even the core devs. So there's no point in getting mad at it. Having said that, I think it is just a fad that will eventually die down, along with the ordinals inscriptions, and I did prefer using BTC back when you could make a tx for 20 cents and get it confirmed in the next block, which wasn't too long ago.What's funny is the ordinals system is especially hard to implement in Dogecoin because of the random block reward from blocks 0 - 99,000, and then there are hundreds of billions of coins, so its near impossible to map all the individual dogetoshis. I think I remember reading that the Ordinals satoshi database is over 1 TB so the one for DOGE would be exponentially larger.",

Scalability is one of the issues of bitcoin whenever the amount of transactions is increased the fees also increases in an equitable proportion.

Increasing hash rate decreases the block-time, but then the difficulty adjusts every two weeks to effectively return the block time time to 10 minutes. Hash rate doesn't increase because there are more transactions either, as the block rewards remains the same, even if more transactions in the mempool means that miners get slightly higher rewards from the transaction fee, it's pretty negligible compared to the 6.25 BTC reward per block of transactions.",
