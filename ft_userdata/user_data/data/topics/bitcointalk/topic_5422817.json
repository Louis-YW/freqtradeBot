You can't just print some new bitcoin if your government needs more money, you cannot just take someone's bitcoin (even as a government), you cannot just ask the (nonexistent) bitcoin central authority how much bitcoin person X has...And those are the things governments like to do: make their country important by having a strong local currency, print money, take money straight out of accounts (or lock accounts), ask the bank how much money person X has (so they can tax/take it). I'm not surprised they're not a big fan of bitcoin.",

As we all know, the government always wants to exercise their powers by checkmating every financial activities that goes on in their respective locality. More especially the tax and revenue generation which is a major sources of income for the government. At all cost,  they do not want the citizens to bypass tax payment which we all know bitcoin transaction safeguard transactions against third-party. Nevertheless, they claim of money laundry being perpetrated via bitcoin transactions which is the strong reasons for their clampdown on bitcoin whereas, they are just doing that to checkmate financial movements of account holders in and out of their country so as to know who the owners of huge moving funds are. Most times, these are done just to scare their opposition and also to control the people preventing them from doing any transaction untraced and unnoticed. Without the above reasons, i see no reasons why the government should be afraid of bitcoin.",

Bitcoin doesn’t have any special acknowledgment but only just an instrument for scam activities since it is commonly use by ponzi group here to scam people in my country. Our own SEC and Central Bank are also the one who gives warning to our people to not use Bitcoin and crypto since it’s risky due to its volatile nature.I believe Bitcoin as legal tender will need a lot of years before it will be considered by the government. They need something to be controlled so that they can manage the risk to protect all the consumers of Bitcoin.",

Somewhat yes,I just think that when bitcoin is not legalized, then almost all user transactions are illegal without exception (although it's not a crime) and that just gives everyone looking for an \"untraceable\" transaction method not to get caught. Indirectly, the government teaches its citizens to break the law, while everyone knows that bitcoin is valuable enough to be exchanged for anything.",

The government approving Bitcoin as a legal tenders means they're giving up control which is something no government with power whats to do. If you noticed, those nations that made Bitcoin a legal tender are countries which are struggling financially and they're looking for a way out which Bitcoin provides. The dollar Standard has made many currencies useless while empowering the dollar that has no real backing but just can be printed from thin air. Since the fiats like dollars can be printed without needing a backing no government will want to give that up for a currency that they can't manipulate the supply or monitor.Also you have the privacy features that Bitcoin has, the government can try centralizing Bitcoin service providers but they can't centralized Bitcoin as such it's uncontrollably and anything the government can't control is a threat to them which makes them scared of it and continuously badmouth Bitcoin so their citizens don't trust it.",

If you make a mistake administering countries economy you can hide it by devaluation of a national currency. Using Bitcoin makes you managing economy the other way: deflationary money mean you need some other tricks, and you feel yourself more comfort with tricks you already know and used a lot. Then why would people from governments be happy with prospective of changing all the economy model?",

It goes one step further in addition to that. The individuals inside and close to the government are profiting from the fiat shitshow personally. So it’s not just about control, but also about their current and future wealth. Fiat guarantees them steady power and wealth without the hassle of needing to earn it on a fair playing field. Bitcoin would end this party and no one inside these circles would like that. Their life's would become worse, there’s just disadvantages for them by adopting it. So change will likely come from the bottom up, the people and governments most disadvantaged by fiat will adopt it first as they’re the ones benefiting from having a fair playing field again.",

But I doubt they are scared of it. Governments are just being cautious 'coz they won't be able to tax every transaction if efer they will adapt such technology. I said they are not afraid simply because there are already countries wherein Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are widely being accepted as a mode of payment and aforementioned reason might be why there are countries wherein it is still not yet. Observe how this technology is allowed in countries, but are not that supported unless if it is thru third party apps. Another factor is volatility wherein they might be worried people who are negligent, would complain about profit loss, and they could take the blame if they're about to support it. Last thing I guess is lack if assurance with this technology in general.",

Recently, El Salvador and Central African Republic announced that they have adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender.There are multiple factors in play. I will try to summarize them for you, Government can't control cryptocurrency. It is controlled by miners so a government can't print more if their banks need it.Cryptos are pseudo anonymous. With the availability of coinjoin and mixing services, it is next to impossible to trace any illegal transaction. So it can be very easily used for illegal activities including money laundering and terrorism financing. The price volatility is a real challenge and can affect a country in a very bad way.These are the major reasons why governments are reluctant in adopting bitcoin or any other cryptos. Also for a country with huge population, may pose some new challenges which we may not have an idea right away!",

It is very true as you said, the reason the government is afraid of bitcoin is because of control issues, because bitcoin is decentralized and bitcoin cannot be managed by third parties, so of course the government is very afraid of this, because the government's goal is to definitely want everything to be able to set under their control, the government also does not want to lose the tax revenue of its citizens.",

The bank is their ultimate power, they use it to manage us and find ways to take our money to serve them.
