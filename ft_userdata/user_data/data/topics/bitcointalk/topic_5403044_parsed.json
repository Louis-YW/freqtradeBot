Even if it may persist and increase over time, what is the persuasiveness of this site?And with the case of this coin, I still wonder about the cases that were once optimistic about it; now they really believe in its future, not to mention the future is too far away. Will you just predict like a fortune, and when it happens by coincidence, will you be praised or not? And the two-way judgment here will be created for many people to adopt and cause more confusion with the coin they are watching.",

      "body": "You can't actually predict what will happened next year, if you are going to use the existing data to make a prediction for the next couple of years there's a greater chance that you are going to predict it wrong. It is more like a speculation than real analysis to me. Just imagine the Bitcoin, they have a data of it since from the start and there's really a huge volume of this coin and most of the people (Even the good ones) predicted that it will go beyond $100,000 mark last year or early this year but look where we at now, we are at $19k mark. My point is there's no way you can predict the unpredictable coins. Btw looking at your website I can't see the prediction.",

Zero value...  zero and zero caused by this worth nothing. Quote from: dhru9 on June 18, 2022, 03:15:33 AMShould I hold or sell my SafeMoon  token ? Holding this garbage scam token during the bearish trend? you must be joking about that and can you tell me how much you lose from this token right now? Holding meme shit scam token during the bearish market was the worst decision.
