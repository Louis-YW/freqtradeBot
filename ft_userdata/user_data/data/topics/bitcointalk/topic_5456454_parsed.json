  "content": "I was wondering why the market is falling even after the pause on the interest rate by FMOC. There were fundamental reasons even which can dump the market and negative sentiments were as well under control. I was trying to find some reasons and found many things interconnecting with each other. The primary reason was market manipulation.Centralized Market ManipulationAs we know that some sites and unofficial sources before the meeting confirmed that there will be no change in the interest rate. So as the predictions were clear most of the traders were expecting the pump in the market so I was as well, Centralized Exchanges took advantage of the trader's sentiments and tried to push BTC below its major support level to liquidate the future trades. As always the market is somehow manipulated by the exchanges.Curve Finance's Fud There is Fud ongoing related to the CRV as we know a huge amount of the total supply is owned by the founder of CRV and he took a loan from Aave Aave by providing 289M CRV supply as collateral and took a loan of 63M USDT against his collateral. Now CRV market is continuously falling down and there is a huge risk of the liquidation of the Laon Collateral if it happens CRV will fall freely because there are no buyers in the market and it will make a great impact on the overall market. This was also a prominent reason I found that some retailers and maximum institutional market holders are taking an exit.ReferenceWhales Playing Dirty tricks again ETH was dumped at high and again here we found a manipulation by the whale, He is not only manipulating the ETH but also trying to put pressure on CRV Finance and 3 POOL (Stablecoin liquidity pool). A whale is continuously taking the sell trades on USDT on 3Pool to put pressure on the liquidity and there are high chances if the whale continues their manipulation that USDT might get depressed again and it will bring a huge disaster in the market. Even my fears are market won't be able to hold on to the current support level.Reference",

Interest rate increased many times, market falls many times. Interest rate paused to rise more, market falls. What is a correlation between interest rate and the market trend. Nothing else except psychological effect which is exploited by market makers to manipulate the market.QuoteI was trying to find some reasons and found many things interconnecting with each other.

Don't try to explain market falls with what you find because those events, news are planned to release as part of plan to make you feel the market has good reasons for its fall.",

So as the predictions were clear most of the traders were expecting the pump in the market so I was as well, if everyone expects it to go up after the news...it's logical that it shouldn't. Anyone who expect it to pump after news will frontrun this event to earn as much as possible don't you think? So the price will start to rise earlier. When will they take profits? After the news. Trading the market is not about reacting to the news, but about predicting it 6-12 months in advance to take profits where most investors think it's about to go up.From a logical point of view, it is not possible for the price to pump when everyone thinks it will, because it contradicts the fact that the stock market is a zero-sum game and the profits of one investor are the loss of another (and even negative-sum game, taking into account exchange commissions, market makers and arbitrage traders profits)",

      "body": "Let's think that it wasn't the whales that did it but because the traders panicked after they read all the news out there that they thought something would happen to the crypto market. Currently, there are not many whales capable of moving the market because to do so, they would require a very large amount of funds (we are talking very large amounts of money).The situation now is different from a few years ago, when whales could move prices in the market in past years because not many traded in the crypto market. But ever since Bitcoin rose to $20k, many people from the stock market and others have entered the crypto market. They don't know how the crypto market moves so if they get news, they panic because they think the same thing will happen in the crypto market.You could say that it is because of centralized market manipulation. But is that really what happened? We don't know for sure. We can only guess. And for now, we should be wise in looking at situations and conditions and not panic when everything goes differently from our analysis. And the important thing is that we can still use the moment of decline to buy and sell it when the moment of increase occurs.",

One event might send prices soaring one day, and the same thing happens, we might see something else. We might see it have no affect at all, or in worst case scenario, we might see the price dropping like it happened this time. As for manipulation, yes it is certainly possible that whales or centralized exchanges might shake the market a bit, but it is usually short-lived. They usually tend NOT to be very manipulative because it might backfire them, and eventually in the long run, the whole market together, gains more control over those whales.",

The human nature to see a downtrend as something bad or that someone out there made them lose the money invested by playing tricks on things they cannot control. This is common in speculative trading and there the hunt for reason is futile here. But most wannabe traders cannot digest this fact without passing some obnoxious smelling wind. I suggest users to treat them as just numbers going up and down, dont ask why its cycling like that. Then follow the buy low and sell high method and make your money. The patient waiting time in between will vary and that needs to be endured.",

So you are saying to me that 5th of Junes impact made market crash again last day. I don't think so you are really getting the point or not, my topic was related to the FOMC pause on the interest rate and even with no negative news and positive trading emotion market crashed then i discovered these reasons behind the scene (since Last 24 Hours of my Topic).Hope so you've got it if not and still trying to rush on rather than understanding the domain I cant help you.

There have been various biase for the falling reason of which some conclude interest rate to be the cause, some point to the cryptocurrency exchanges like binance and coinbase under the watch of US government. Whatever may be the case, I think it is natural to find a reason to discuss on the fall, it is also the same when price begin to increase and different reasons like Elon musk and other whales going into the market. It is better to understand that the crypto market is about rise and fall, don't depend on the reason to buy or sell because it will not matter but depend on your DCA strategy.",

Even my fears are market won't be able to hold on to the current support level.I don't think that a while could manipulate the whole market unless if he is Elon Musk or someone with that much capital to dump the market. I would rather go with exchanges than a whale because the exchanges wouldn't let the BTC's price to go up and if it goes up then many of the futures traders with huge leverages will earn a lot from their open positions. The market may see another dump but the chances are very low for that to happen. I think the market will recover once again from this pressure and the BTC will gain some more dollars in its price in coming weeks. This time the pump will be of a slow nature but it will most likely happen. There are some chances for a small dump again, but that won't impact the market by huge levels.",

If we could see who Gary has been getting paid from, legally as donations but also illegally as well which is the hard one, then we can find who caused all this stir up as well, they wanted him to do this and he did it because he was bribed by them, which they will make more money back again.",
