Yes, using Qrish is unconditional, carefree and only identity. This local payment option with Qris financial services with eth density from time to time, this is very good and appropriate, beneficial for providers and users and maybe later it will be more comprehensive and other payment methods. innovation.What do you think?",

      "body": "Seems like it originated from Indonesia and that's a good option for those who have been having a hard time accessing the exchanges. But usually with these third parties, they charge more than the market price. But if they give a fair price and rates then they'd surely go with the commission so they always get on top of the price still. Anyway, IIRC Indonesia is strict with cryptocurrencies but if this is another payment option to the supported countries then, that's good for people to have more options.",

      "body": "It seems like that the adoption for crypto is going massive. I have seen that metamask has announced that several countries in sout east will able to buy ethereum directly through their payment toolThis is very good. What you have been mentioning above has shown that real adoption of crypto is coming soon. That's a very good progress in my opinion. People from those countries will able to adapt crypto directly through their own payment system.It will make the adoption will much more easier than before. I hope that more countries to be added by metamask. this is driving the adoption from the country to be even more faster than before.",
