  "content": "In the future, we will get to a stage where or when we will no longer talk much about how much 1 full BTCbitcoin is worth, but we will focus on how much 1 satoshi is worth.And today, based on the current price of bitcoin, 1 satoshi is currently valued at $0.000366 according to coinmarketcap.If you missed buying bitcoin in its early days and feel bitcoin have become too expensive, then you have the opportunity again to invest in satoshi, treat satoshi as a bitcoin side project, for in the near future, 1 satoshi may worth up to $0.2 cents or even more, there are only 100 million of satoshis in every 1 bitcoin, and a total/max supply of 2.1 quadrillion satoshis off the total supply of bitcoin which is 21 million (disregarding that around 6 million bitcoins is estimated to be lost, which also means that the satoshis equivalent to this amount of bitcoins are also lost)Imagine buying 1,000,000 satoshis at current price of $0.000366, that will cost you around $366 todayHold the same 1,000,000 Satoshis till each worth $0.1 cent, that will be worth $100,000 (not money for children)Start investing in satoshi today, if you are too poor, buy and hold atleast, 2,000,000 satoshis worth $732 today, and be very patient.",

Satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin but I do not think saying investing in satoshi is correct, it is still investing in bitcoin but people can buy less than 1 bitcoin.Well, it is basically the same thing, I understand what you mean and let me say that I deliberately used the word \"invest\" to describe buying satoshi because its still the same thing as investing in bitcoin,  if you read in-between the lines, you did understand that I was trying as much as possible to make this very simple and understandable to newbies, this is why I said they should treat satoshi as a bitcoin side project, That, let bitcoin be like the tree and satoshi the branches.Some may misunderstand and think satoshi is another altcoin that is entirely different from bitcoin, but this is not too much of a thing to worry about as long as its bitcoin satoshi they are buying, and not just any random altcoin out there.Quote from: jrrsparkles on November 18, 2023, 05:56:24 PMQuote from: Fivestar4everMVP on November 18, 2023, 05:18:57 PMImagine buying 1,000,000 satoshis at current price of $0.000366, that will cost you around $366 todayAlong with what you said, try repeat buying 1,000,000 sats 100x times then it will become 1 whole bitcoin.

So, I think you could have been more specific there. Anyway, that feeling of having missed out is why many people randomly jump on altcoins. People find it weird that their let’s say $500 will be fractions of a currency so they rather feel it’s better to hodl something that is more numerous. We need to let people know that it’s okay to have these fractions as it equivalent to how much you purchased it with.",

According to my calculation, which might be wrong but when the price of BTC will touch around $2,722,222.22 or 2.7 million per BTC then 1 sat will be worth 0.1 cent. And for 0,2 cents double the rate.In my opinion, it's not an easy target and we might not be alive to see BTC achieving this target because halving will end near 2140 and we can\\t live that long so we might not see BTC touching 2.7 million so we could make $100k out of it. While we can make $100k out of any other alts if done proper analysis or by doing the job with a good salary. That's why I prefer everyone to do proper analysis before making any transaction and expecting profits that we might not achieve.",

The OP is actually right because soon the discussion might shift from BTC to Sat. However, there is no denying that Sats as a unit of Bitcoin is not widely known as Bitcoin. I have the feeling that when Bitcoin reaches $1m , sats will become very popular as people will feel more comfortable using whole numbers than decimal.",

      "body": "Nice advice,  because most people miss out on the most important things in life taking it to be too risky for them,  and when it comes to becoming,  the risk of holding is much less than the risk of losing out at some point if one failed to utilize the multiple opportunities to buy some few satoshis because at this point,  what really makes the difference in the amount of time you can afford to wait for your investment to increase since the higher satoshi,  the better but holding a few Satoshi may require you to wait let longer. But then also,  buying and waiting are the most important sacrifices that any Bitcoin investor will have to pay,  and in doing so also it is very important to look at the entry price of Bitcoin because if you jump on when the market is relatively high,  it won't be easy to wait all through since the high entry price will increase your waiting time so it best to buy always when the price is at discount price. So ops you did well to have brought up this discussion and this is an eye-opener to many of us who will want to buy more Bitcoin at regular intervals.",

Instead, make it clear that we don't have to invest or buy the whole bitcoin if our funds are still insufficient. Just buy a portion of bitcoin on an amount that you can afford to lose, and continue to grow it through doing DCA in your next purchases.I'd say people understand every piece of advice based on their capability to understand.
