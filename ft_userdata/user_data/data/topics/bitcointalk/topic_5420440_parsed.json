I really like your questions Integrated graphics in the central processor is very much inferior in performance to discrete graphics cards, because there are fewer cores and other computing modules.It is more profitable to buy RX 470 4 GB to get more profit.",

      "body": "It is possible to mine with IGPU, but makes not much sense for you.For example - my old Amd 2400G give me 77mh on Radiant or around 50mh on KaspaÂ  and only need 5w more. Not much, but if you have 1 in every rig, it can give some extra money. But everyone must calculate by yourself.",

One processor will pay off for a very long time, and a computer with this processor will not pay off in mining. Devil2man asked funny questions, without him I'm very bored.",
