      "body": "There's enough members here with bad histories that having some posts you don't like is probably nothing to react to.Sure you can delete all posts that aren't topic starters and edit topic starters to \"edited\" but is it worth it to make your account seem less authentic and more like there's something to hide? A delete all button would be problematic for the forum to have imo too - like if an account gets hacked, a hacker could sabotage it by just pressing a button or two. I think this was mentioned a few years back as being something that looked like an account had been sold if someone wiped a lot of the old posts - might be something to consider as well as the impossibility of deleting posts here as there are archives of them on other sites.",

On some boards you may have to way 24 hours before doing so, although there are some sections where I believe you can’t actually get to delete them (i.e. Archive, Auctions). You won’t be able to delete threads either. For those cases where you can’t delete the post, you can generally edit it and leave it blank.Having said that, deleting posts can lead to your Activity counter diminishing, and even to your Rank being demoted if you get carried away (see these cases).Bear in mind that most posts made nowadays are actually scraped and stored on third-party sites, so they are still accessible in a sense.",

Although, do keep in mind that if you're deleting your posts, and others have quoted them or responded directly to them, that can ruin the conversation a little bit for anyone that reads it in the future. Most users generally have lower quality posts when you're new, and excited. That's not an issue, and generally no one's going to go through, and criticise you for having lower quality years ago, when you've increased the quality nowadays. As with anything, you likely care more about your old posts than anyone else on the forum.",

I wouldn't blame him for doing so. I actually stopped posting there immediately I read about how snr members regard people posting there as shit posters. And I would say not posting there has helped me rank up easily. I wouldn't say I am quality poster but since I don't post there (except it is moved there ) my post is regarded as decent and I usually get merits for that.My advice to this user is that he should just focus on improving his post quality and refrain from posting on Altcoin boards frequently and he might get a chance.Moreover is on a campaign managed by Yahoo(if I am correct), that means he has a strong member that frowns at Altcoin board having faith in him already",

You may do the same as long as you want to clean your post history. For real? I had been thinking all along that it was quite impossible to do so, until I came upon this thread. At first, the replies I read almost dissuaded me from staying until I refreshed and saw this post. You actually did justice by reading the OPs mind. Am quite sure you read a lot of us newbies minds as well.  Cleaning up old posts actually helps one keep track, like a revision of the past work. It also stresses on ones growth over the years considering how long the person must have been on the forum.",
