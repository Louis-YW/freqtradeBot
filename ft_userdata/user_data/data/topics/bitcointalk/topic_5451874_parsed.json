Because other Bitcoin payment platforms are already closing down withdrawals due to the present network crisis.",

Can you try to check the transaction on other explorer to see if there’s a result?Quote from: Heyui67 on May 07, 2023, 08:48:59 PMIt's not even exist on block chain.I never heard of sochainAlso its my deposit amount and made withdrawIdidnt win any there You have already the txid. Your funds will be soon on the blockchain records probably the error is due to the congested network. You can check Bitcoin mempool to see what’s causing your problem. A delay withdrawal on congested network is not worthy for a scam accusation. Take note the casino in question is one of the reputable casino here.",

If you have little knowledge about crypto then you should no that once it is published on the blockchain the fund is on you if the sender doesn't cancel the transaction. And if it happens then the transaction will be failed. For now, you should wait for the confirmation though I have not checked the transaction which might be confirmed already. I think better if you lock the thread.",

If you really care, you should even edit the title of this thread to \"resolved\"It is confirmed already. I believe OP has little knowledge of how the system works OP could not be patient to do a lot research on what was  causing the delay as their is already given transaction hash but was quick to create a thread for scam accusations without proper evaluation. At this juncture,  Heyui67, it would be nice to know that your case is been settled and haven confirmed your  funds, it would be nice you lock this thread as your case has been resolved.",
