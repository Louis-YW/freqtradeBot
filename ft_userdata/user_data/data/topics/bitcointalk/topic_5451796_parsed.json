If your service is copy pasted from other forums or owned by other people who strictly not selling it but giving it for free then that's illegal you shouldn't sell it if it's not from your server or owns the program. And another important thing in the IPTV business is if you already get the necessary licenses and permissions to avoid any copyright infringement claims. I hope you have that thing in your service because if not then you are selling illegal IPTV service which is not allowed here.",

Yeah, most of the services I've seen in regards to IPTV seem to not have the \"proper licensing and permissions\". Which is why I asked to just make sure. I most definitely will offer 24HR free trials to anyone whos interested, maybe those who are Hero and Legendary have priority (as someone suggested). Thank you for the insight everyone",

Well based on our forum rules it depends in your or buyers country.I'm pointing to this rule 17Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.017. Trading of goods that are illegal in the seller's or buyer's country is forbidden. [2]And most IPTV sellers out there they get those sources for free but they sell them without permission and it will result in DMCA complaints due to copyright violations. Since these sellers do not have proper license and permission while providing this service it's illegal and punishable by law.It is just likely the same as plagiarism content that you don't own and you post it here without permission or credit to the owner it will result in ban evasion.",

Thank you for the insight everyone You're completely right. If all IPTV offered here would have licenses and permissions, they wouldn't cost something like $10.

I would recommend medium to good internet speed, just so that you don't run into any buffering due to internet speeds.

Frankly speaking, I find it strange that he publishes this subject here, pretending that he does not know anything and is asking for advice ; This makes me doubt him honestly.This field of services is very sensitive and it is difficult to maintain in addition to the competition as similar sellers are spread all over the social media and offer their services in differential formulas.",
