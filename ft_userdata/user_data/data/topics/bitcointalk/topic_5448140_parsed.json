The investment when asked him was around INR 30 lakh ~ $ 36,600 in US dollars. That is a definitely huge amount considering his age and country of residence. Even in America, 36K USD is pretty handsome money and you can do many things with it. So the gravity of this can be sensed easily. He was saved by the Cops after a local Cab driver alerted the police and the response team was at the incident quickly. He was trying to jump from the largest bridge on the river named \"Hooghly\" to end his life. The investment was not his alone but he collected the money from various sources. He took loans and also was using the pension from his mother. Definitely, he had no plans and no idea what he was doing.

For those who don't know how the market works or how to conduct proper research for a project whether should invest in it or not, it has been echoed several times that they should just stick to Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin, and hodl while they continue their learning process. For the case of the guy in Op, I'm sure he got his investment idea from the internet probably from a blog site, an article, or a hype group because the fact that he went ahead to borrow loans and even used his mother's pension indicates that he was promised a large return/profit from the investment. The whole crypto space is crawling with scammers who are now disguising themselves in different projects, with their major aim which is to gather the money of investors and disappear into thin air.",

Taking loan would not have been his resolution or alternative to investing in Crypto currency. It is either he was being too greedy or he was wrongly advised to the point of him going for such amount of money as a loan to invest in Crypto.Secondly, looking at his frustration to the point of wanting to commit suicide shows he has no other sources of income to remedy the situation which he got himself into. This is why it is advised to have an alternative sources of income outside investment in Crypto so that you do not get taken unawares. Lastly, going by his age and his current circumstances, that is a big thing to learn from that one should not go beyond his or her limit or point of elasticity.This is a big lesson to learn from. Always do your own research before jumping in to anything.",

But this should be a wakeup call to be hella cautious when investing in the crazy crypto world. You gotta have a solid plan and strategy before making any moves and only invest what you can afford to lose. Think of it like playing a sport, you gotta have a game plan and stick to it, yo!Let's not be all negative, my fam. Instead, let's flip this script and get our investment hustle on. Why not link up with a crypto investment crew or chop it up with some other crypto fiends? Having a clique to bounce ideas off of and keep you motivated is key. And yo, who knows, you might even make some new fam in the process!",

      "body": "I feel so sorry for the guy in the OP. I know how frustrating it is to lose something, especially when that thing does not belong to you alone. After thinking about the huge loss and calculating how to pay back those debts, there was possibly no way to do it, and the people whom the guy owes to whom he might have promised a huge return might be on his neck. This will serve as a huge lesson to him, the people around him, and the readers of the story to be cautious of where they invest. Investment advice is always to invest what one can afford to lose, and it's never advisable for one to take another's fund to invest for them because the risk factor is very high. Places where investment by third parties is encouraged are if you own a standard investment company where your clients have to sign profit and risk management documents so that if anything were to happen to the capital, every party would know their responsibility. It's always safer to invest in things that we are sure of and not just some random project or random things we are being told by influencers or so-called financial experts, because if we are to incur any form of loss, those people will not be held responsible.",

I bet he already racked up his brains hundreds if not thousands of times already just to find a solution or a way out of his mistake but just couldn't find any which has led him to his decision of unaliving himself. All those hopes and dreams that never happened and instead got replaced with unbearable feelings of guilt, regrets and so much more. Even I don't think I'd be able to have the courage to keep on living if I had made such a mistake. I wish he finds the strength to go on living. Sigh, such a young man.

Although you didn't specify which kind of crypto he invested in I guess he didn't invest in Bitcoin, if he did he invested just a little. Bitcoin is not like money doubling where you just invest and predict your profit. And if you trade or invest in altcoins using exchanges you are taking a great risk and if you keep your money in exchanges, you are on your own. Secondly, he borrowed money to invest in cryptocurrency, that's wrong. You only invest what you have or what you can afford to lose. Techie is depressed and he feels hopeless because of pressure from his creditors and great disappointment. There has also been a high rate of suicide globally mainly caused by economic problems. Thank God he was rescued, all he needs is medical attention and financial assistance. Use decentralized wallets, deal on only bitcoin, and invest only what you can afford to lose.",

That's why it would never be a great idea to use loans and money that you can't afford to lose in Bitcoin. People would thought the bullish run always last for long they don't know that it might drastically dump due to its volatile system of Bitcoin. Investing money that you'll need  soon would just worsen your situation. You always need to have a emotional stability and wise thinking most importantly the knowledge whenever to invest in a good time. Unfortunately I think those people you've mentioned probably got fomo to the pump of Bitcoin where they rushed into it despite the fact those money were loans and credit. Hopefully they'll take it as a lesson and wouldn't hurt themselves for that experiences. Mistake can be corrected, hurting yourself would not do good.",
