My daughter isn't ready just yet (turning 15 over the summer) but found that she can major in Analytical Chemistry at this Universities Boss. She has told me this is the only school in the US that offers this as a major. From what I can see it will be almost $25,000.00 this coming year. Any experiences good or bad I'd like to hear. Thanks, Tony",
