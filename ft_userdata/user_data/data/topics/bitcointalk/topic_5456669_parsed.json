      "body": "Hello and welcome to the forum! It would be helpful if you could provide more details about the project, including the website (if available), and more details about the team. In my opinion, one of the biggest obstacles for any crypto startup is to prove that it is a legitimate business, and not just another scam. I would suggest that you work on your marketing strategy, as well as consider some kind of promotions or campaigns to show the community that you are serious about this project and to attract new users. It is also important to understand why someone would want to use your platform; what makes it better than the other options out there? The fee for using your services seems quite high, and most of us have our preferred methods for converting crypto into fiat at much more favorable terms.Having said that, I think your project has some potentials and I wish it all the best!",
