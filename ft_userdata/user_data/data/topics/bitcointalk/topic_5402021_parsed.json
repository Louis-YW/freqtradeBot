      "body": "Quote from: miner29 on June 10, 2022, 12:55:02 PMYour white paper is garbage.  It is a sales pitch not a white paper. I am giving another pitch....... If it is a Sales Pitch or Reality Pitch its upto you.....When people hear the phrase Crypto, they form various opinions. Some see it as a gold digger for millionaires, while others see it as a fraud in general. Having said that, in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida resident, spent around 10,000 Bitcoins at a local pizza shop to purchase two pizzas. Because his Bitcoins were only worth $40 at the time. However, it is now worth many hundreds of millions of dollars.Experts have concluded that cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, are a bubble, which means that the price of a certain coin or digital asset is greater than its \"actual\" value.  In recent days, there has been a rise of various Alt Currencies (Alternative coins) entering the market, presenting a suspicious picture of being a Scam. Furthermore, the majority of these new cryptocurrencies have a tag line goal of \"Charity,\" which adds to the skepticism.  There is a fine line between a coin's success and being labelled as a fraud. This is found in the coin's and company's Plan, Potential, Purpose, Perseverance, and Promise.About The CEO:I am the Founder and CEO of a 20-year-old software company with products in the logistics, transportation, supply chain, and e-commerce domains.With clients from over 15 countries, we are completely operating in 5 countries and fast expanding in 12 countries in 5 years.My numerous jobs include being a Tech – Savvy Executive and Supply Chain, Logistics, and eCommerce Consultant, as well as a Solution Architect advising Logistics and other Software solutions to customers.With over 16 years of expertise building software and being the owner of the intellectual property for these logistics products, which are currently licenced in the worldwide market. With a team of seasoned IT professionals that have firsthand knowledge of AIoT, IoT, ASRS, and Blockchain.Globally partnered with branded products, with the privilege of working with top firms in the United States, Thailand, India, Singapore, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, China, and other APAC areas.Implementation Experience:Thailand, India, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam Cambodia, Spain, Germany, and the United States.Industries Covered:3rd Part Logistics & SCM, Modern Trade Business, Automotive & Auto Parts, Retail Chain, FMCG, Chemicals & Industrial Gases, Petro Chemical, Sugar, Food, Education, Construction, Materials & Certification.Perks Of The Company:1. Our organisation has created a cost-effective human resource power to code, develop, programme, create, mine, and manufacture our own currencies and tokens.  2. To install and run the currency servers, mining hubs, wallets, and explorers, we employ our own hardware resources and infrastructure. 3. To increase the value of our coins and tokens, we have our own social media marketing and branding staff.4. We have 16 IP-owned software solutions in Product Information Management, Logistics, Supply Chain, eCommerce, and Big Data. We will use them to achieve our goal of moving all of our goods to Blockchain and putting them to real-world use by developing a viable market for them.Business Principles Adhered By The CEO: I stick by my three main business ethics with my customers, with my staff, and with my service providers and vendors:  1. To never sell my items and services rather than having people purchase them on their own.2. Always strive for a win-win situation and empathise with others. The Win-Win situation is not one in which I win and you win, but rather one in which I WILL MAKE YOU WIN AND YOU WILL MAKE ME WIN.3. There are three types of bargaining (donkey, fox, and owl). I don't want to engage in donkey bargaining where I get to bear all the burden for less and then break down one day. I also do not want to enter into a Fox negotiation to make some tough sales that will last a few months and result in future disagreements. Both the donkey and the fox negotiations are uninteresting to me since I am the type of person who considers the benefit of others and makes a conclusion that benefits both parties.",
