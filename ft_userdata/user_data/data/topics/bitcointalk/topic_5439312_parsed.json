  "content": "Marina bay sans is a resort in Marina Bay, Singapore. It was opened in 2010 and it’s currently the most expensive casino property in the world at $6 Billion.The fabulous resort has 2,561 room hotel, 120,000 square feet of the convention exhibition center, a shopping mall, a museum theater, an infinity pool, and 500 table casino, among others.https://getnoticed.info/2023/02/09/inside-the-biggest-casino-property-in-the-world/This goes a long way to express how serious and exotic the casino business as an industry is, imagine a single casino property that's worth more than the budgets of some countries even three put together.  Another insight I feel to bring out of this is the thought that certain gamblers breed within about wanting to make sure they hit a certain huge amount of winnings that possibly could shut down the financial capacity of a particular casino they gamble with. The reality is that such a target will only take much more from you than you least knew so necessary you play with an open mindset of just winning any amount that comes your way and be satisfied.",

There are those who won't stop but I think that's a bad habit that would just jeopardize all the profits they made. Although, if you are in a good place like the MBS, maybe it will be difficult to control it. You might not even notice time passing by on the said place.",

If there will be Las Vegas in Asia, it should be Macau.It also become a tourist attraction for Singapore because of the grandeur of this casinos.Majority is being owned though by Las Vegas Sands Corporation.",

I can't imagine how much money is circulating in that casino and other places in a day, considering the place is very large for people who visit the place.

You have to be someone with tons of money and a connection to the thugs inside otherwise you get bullied by them as well.Never tried going inside in one of these, it felt like I can't afford anything inside of it. But for a country with a population of more than a billion, I guess 2,561 room is not enough for the number of high rollers visiting the hotel casino.",

The target market of online casino are those players that can’t access IRL casino before and some casino players that has no time to play in actual.This kind of huge casino is popular for vacation of rich people. Nothing beats the actual game which is what being paid by gamblers.",

Would that not mean losing a giant, perhaps even their main source of income? I have yet to meet a single casino which is hostile to anyone who wants to gamble their hard earned money. Perhaps they are snobbish when it comes to the amount of money you are allowed to gamble with? Singapore is a country with very strict laws, so maybe you are thinking of foreigners who get put in their place by local authorities whenever they do something which is not allowed?
