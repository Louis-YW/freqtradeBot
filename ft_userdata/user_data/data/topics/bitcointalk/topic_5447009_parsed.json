It is truly decentralized, that which cannot be said about most other coins. It is so decentralized that it does not have a CEO as you pointed out, only a founder, satoshi. Its security which it gets from PoW is higher than that of other currencies, making it the most reliable. It has a limited supply while many other coins have infinite supply and the creators can just create more for themselves.Quote from: Oti147 on March 31, 2023, 12:40:04 PMI have someone that wants to invest in crypto but wants to invest in other coins he wants to know if other are same values as bitcoin and if other coins can be easily be exchanged or sell  or for purchases.They do not have the same values as Bitcoin, but some of them have enough liquidity to allow easy exchange.Let them do their research themselves and decide what to buy, but do not invest in altcoins as a sort of protest against bitcoin.- Jay -",

      "body": "Apart from the longevity feature of bitcoin and also the first cryptocurrency other features like its decentralization and security is part of what makes it cryptocurrency top coin. There have been other Alticoins that have been created to either correct some acclaimed errors of bitcoin and compete with it but along the line some either fail or had one or two scam accusations. So the ability of bitcoin to resist such and such attacks makes it the number one coinThe price of a single bitcoin and its market cap which is the most expensive of any cryptocurrency coin has made has added to it been the number one on the cryptocurrency log. Also bitcoins ability to hedge against inflation and also store of value which has prompted many companies and businesses to accept it as a payment option has increased its popularity above other coins. Also the ability of bitcoin having the potential to grow in profits when hold for a long time unlike other cryptocurrencies is also a huge factor on why it is the number one coin.Quote from: Oti147 on March 31, 2023, 12:40:04 PMI have someone that wants to invest in crypto but wants to invest in other coins he wants to know if other are same values as bitcoin and if other coins can be easily be exchanged or sell  or for purchases.Bitcoin value is incomparable to other cryptocurrencies because of its decentralization, other coins are built in such a way that it could easily be manipulated by whales there by controlling the price movements of the coins. People looking to invest in other coins are either looking at the percentage of profits that could gain in short period of time. Some of this Altcoins can grow beyond 100x in a short period of time. They can also be traded on exchanges. Do not invest in Altcoins for long term gain some might die early",

First in crypto currency’sNot only because Btc is the first cryptocurrency, your investment is also very secured with right wallet address (non-custodial). That's the first thing investors look at. However, not all who are first will remain first and not all who are last will remain last. Btc was the first but he remained the first until now. His popularity continues to grow especially Bitcoin payment can contribute to that. And what should old investors invest in, of course that cryptocurrency that has already been established is very low risk. It is also one of the contributors that Bitcoin continues to rise because of more investments, especially since Btc has a nice feature called \"scarcity\". QuoteI have someone that wants to invest in crypto but wants to invest in other coins he wants to know if other are same values as bitcoin There's no other cryptocurrency that has the same value as Bitocin. But there are some coins that almost have the same volatility (has less volatility) with Btc because they also have huge marketcaps. Those coins are in the top 10 cryptocurrencies in coinmarketcap and are best to invest with.",

And not just in crypto, I mean in all facet of business, if you are the first one to invent something unique they you will have the full advantage and although there are a lot of crypto now, no project can replicate what Satoshi did and his invention.

The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi left the project in late 2010 without revealing much about himself. The community has since grown exponentially with many developers working on Bitcoin.Satoshi's anonymity often raised unjustified concerns, many of which are linked to misunderstanding of the open-source nature of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol and software are published openly and any developer around the world can review the code or make their own modified version of the Bitcoin software. Just like current developers, Satoshi's influence was limited to the changes he made being adopted by others and therefore he did not control Bitcoin. As such, the identity of Bitcoin's inventor is probably as relevant today as the identity of the person who invented paper.You are not required to buy bitcoin as an investment asset if you believe altcoin is suitable with your investment plan. Bitcoin is by far the best performing investment asset, which is why you always get it first before altcoin. But please, if you can afford bitcoin then do so instead of just having altcoin as your investment asset. Bitcoin is the best choice, you have to study to know a lot about it.",

Bitcoin came into existence to save humanity and not to make the pioneers rich as we have with the thousands of altcoins existing. Bitcoin is unique meanwhile the altcoins are just replicates of themselves, they aren't decentralized either as we have faces that if hurt could hurt the altcoins project so the project isn't total community owned.
