Bitcoin is getting crushed slowly under the burden of US government decisions. The problem has started since the start of this year and somehow they are responsible for shady workflows that made various exchangers and banks to go on the path of bankruptcy. What is wrong with them?Are they scared about bitcoin taking over their generations of work into fiat and losing the power with the time.The quoted article also suggests how US is literally overstepping their legal boundaries and thus making it look like shit market. Imagine having every crypto currencies under SEC rule, it will make them securities and we will lose every bit of decentralization due to this. Anyone understand the logic behind USA?QuoteThe cryptocurrency universe, ruled by Bitcoin and Ethereum, is facing a turbulent year due to a potential U.S. regulatory crackdown. A leaked memo to the Democrat House financial services committee sheds light on the lawmakers’ strategy to categorise almost all cryptocurrencies as securities.The memo urges Democrat lawmakers to counter Republican claims about providing market clarity through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CTFC) involvement in crypto. The partisan divide over cryptocurrencies has become increasingly pronounced, with influential figures like Ted Cruz endorsing crypto, while Elizabeth Warren takes an anti-crypto stance.Gary Gensler, the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has asserted the organisation’s authority over the crypto market, considering most cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities. However, this stance has drawn criticism for overstepping legal boundaries.As the regulatory battle intensifies, the crypto industry has expressed its concerns over the leaked memo’s implications.

Their regulation is moving in on it every day, it is a call for increased adoption of bitcoin, it will absolve many privacy issues and keep regulation blind. We should not forget that the US is not the owner of crypto, they can do what they like, crypto will increase in popularity and people will use it in many other countries.Don't let this affect you, the CTFC, SEC and US legislature must do something that will be opposing the freeness we enjoy with crypto, it is good to go for the one that is decentralized and let your P2P be strict.",

      "body": "For me, the logic of this country is to destroy everything around it, intervene in the economies of all countries, and submit to its own rules. Hasn't anyone else realized that the word \"democracy\" in this country has a completely different meaning than we are used to defining it? Hiding behind the motto that they are fighting for the rights of people, they completely destroy the economies of other countries, dictate their own rules, and fight those who do not agree to obey their decisions. Count how many times they have interfered and continue to interfere in the affairs of other countries.That they would like to regulate Bitcoin as well is not at all surprising. And until they achieve this, we will see negativity and barriers to the full adoption of Bitcoin. It is ridiculous to talk about any moral qualities of a country that goes overboard for the sake of its global control.",
