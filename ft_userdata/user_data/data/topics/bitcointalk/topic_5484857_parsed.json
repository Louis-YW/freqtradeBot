  "content": "Hey everyone!I'm thrilled to join this fantastic community and am eager to dive into the world of cryptocurrencies and cryptography. As a determined self-learner with some math and computer science knowledge, as well as some programming experience in Python (currently exploring Mojo), JS/HTML/CSS, I believe that the most knowledgeable people here have likely forged their own paths through self-education.I'm excited to gain the knowledge and skills needed to contribute to the community and eventually create interactive educational materials about relevant technologies. Therefore, I'd genuinely appreciate any advice from experienced members on the most effective resources for building a solid foundation in Bitcoin technologies, distributed systems, and cryptography.If any of you have personal learning paths to share or can recommend resources similar to the Rosalind project for bioinformatics (rosalind.info) or Project Euler for math/programming problems (projecteuler.net), but specifically tailored to Bitcoin technologies, I'd be incredibly grateful.Thanks a ton in advance for your insights!",

And if you already tried it few times, you probably already know the website will ask you for Bitcoin payment to keep using the chatbot.",

However, the ChatBTC project has given me an idea to create my own custom version of ChatGPT (https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) using a collection of resources from Lopp's list, some repositories, and Mastering Bitcoin. This will hopefully help me solve my information overload problem ðŸ¤¯",
