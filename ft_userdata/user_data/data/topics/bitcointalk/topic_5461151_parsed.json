Does transactions only involve those you trust?

It's easier to make a transaction if it's a local store. in today's online market, you usually pay before you receive the item. unless, it is local and they are accepting cash on delivery. that is why there are reviews of the seller if it is really legit or not. you won't trust a new seller without any review to buy an expensive item from him. just to give an example. so if you do really want the item, it is best to buy a trusted seller even if the price is a bit higher. at least you are sure that he will deliver.",

Just like bitcoin payments, cash transactions are also irreversible and it's down to the seller if they decide to give you a refund or not. This was never a major problem as we have customer protection laws that force sellers to refund the money in specific situations, and bitcoin payments are no exception here.",

Thank you.On the contrary, These are thoughtful questions that every business owner considering integrating Bitcoin should consider in order to make well-informed decisions. Also I have a tip for you. You can have just one list and many list items compared to using many lists with a single item in each one. Quote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMIf for example a user of a custodial wallet sends Bitcoin to buy some goods and the seller voluntary chooses not to meet their end of the bargain, who are they going to complain to?[/li][/list]Before placing the order and proceeding to payment there should be an understanding of the terms of the business between both parties that would be transacting. Once the state has been updated on the blockchain (payment confirmed), there is no way to recall payments. My suggestion is to clarify all the terms and enquire about a refund process if there is any. Quote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMIn countries where crypto are considered illegal isn't it risky to accept Bitcoin as a medium of exchange? Then why are some people still accepting it?If they have a way to convert it to their local currencies and can evade government or regulating bodies, then it should be fine. Accepting Bitcoin opens up a business to a wider audience. These days, If I want to make payments to non-local businesses for goods or services, I always check for the pay with Bitcoin option. Quote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMIn a trade does the buyer send their Bitcoin first or the seller send their goods/service?The buyer has to send the payment first. This is the same for even P2p trades as payment often validates an order. Quote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMLightning network has been praised for its speed in transactions thus used by many individuals. Does transactions only involve those you trust? Or there's a basis for the confidence of not been scammed?Ideally, payment should only come last when all due diligence has been conducted. The way bitcoin works is that we have to take full responsibility for any decisions that have to do with our Bitcoin. Knowing this, it would make zero sense to make payment without confirming the authenticity of business or the products and services being advertised.

(Not to be confused for safekeeping of coins, just a means to run the trade)[/li][/list]I agree it makes it safer especially in an event where one of the transacting party wants to dupe the other. Centralized exchanges can help mitigate those situations. But this has its downsides as well. But I believe problems like this will be solved in the coming years as the technology is still undergoing major developments.",

This kind of setup usually involves people talking about it themselves and making out terms that both parties would agree in. A middle party would be the best, but if it was a personal transaction between the two, then they only need to talk it out imo. In terms of complaining, I don't think there is between private transactions between small parties, but I reckon there's a law or something for products or services offered by companies (since you can report them to the local government who holds their license or something similar). Quote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMIn countries where crypto are considered illegal isn't it risky to accept Bitcoin as a medium of exchange?

I highly doubt people who are risking the use of Bitcoin are that ignorant in the ways and methods to use it anyway. Quote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMIn a trade does the buyer send their Bitcoin first or the seller send their goods/service?The buyer would most probably send the Bitcoin first since there's a period they need to wait for the transaction to be confirmed. Ofc, this can probably be adjusted depending on the terms between the two parties.

Or there's a basis for the confidence of not been scammed?It's why Bitcoin is decentralized in the first place, there was no need for trust since third parties (miners) would confirm the transaction themselves. The lightning network is only a network that's used to enhance the speed of the transactions themselves.

Accessing it is a whole nother thing. Not to mention a lot of centralized businesses can be rather dumb in terms of data security, so most people just can't help it but be doubtful of them. And with the advent of the internet, a simple full name and a contact number can get you a LOT of information about that person.",

Most buying and selling transactions, the buyer will send bitcoin first before the seller sends the goods. Because there is no COD system in bitcoin, maybe you can convince the seller to send the goods first before you pay, in my opinion this is more of an agreement between the seller and the buyerQuote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMI'm well aware of the dangers that centralized exchange poses, but doesn't their access to customers data make it feel safer to run a business? (Not to be confused for safekeeping of coins, just a means to run the trade)I'm not too scared of centralized exchanges, especially one with a big name like binance. I've never had a problem with a centralized exchange, I've used the exchange to buy bitcoins, sell bitcoins to fiat, or buy altcoins. I don't store my bitcoins/altcoins on a centralized exchange. I think you have nothing to fear when you use an exchange but if you keep your funds in the exchange like your own wallet then it is wrong. Use the exchange only for trading activities, don't think of it as a wallet",

Then why are some people still accepting it?In my country, cryptocurrencies are not considered illegal, and the government's functioning is not flawless at 100%. Among several business entities, some operate without strict government oversight. This creates numerous opportunities for small businesses that have little impact on the government and receive little legal attention.This situation provides a loophole for those interested in experimenting with Bitcoin as a means of payment (if they understand its transaction mechanism or simply wish to study it). Particularly, small business owners may be inclined to adopt Bitcoin, as the risks associated with operating in a country where cryptocurrencies are deemed illegal could directly affect their business ventures.In short, it is generally acceptable to use cryptocurrencies for small-scale businesses that remain unnoticed by the government. However, it is crucial to exercise caution and stay informed about any potential changes in the regulatory landscape.Quote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMIn a trade does the buyer send their Bitcoin first or the seller send their goods/service?In commerce, small trades value money first,But for significant exchanges, agreement's thirst.",

File a complaint for fraud/scam to the local authorities like they would when making a purchase with a regular currency (FIAT currency). If the seller isn't \"anonymous\" and is from your area, there is a chance you will get back your funds. If not, there is no way you will get back your coins.2. If bitcoin is illegal, then yes, they shouldn't be using it. I don't know why business would want to accept bitcoin and risk everything. Are you sure you don't mean legal tender? Because even if it isn't a legal tender, but using bitcoin is allowed, business can accept crypto currencies, but they can refuse to accept payments in bitcoin if they want.3. The buyer is going to send first just like when shopping online. What's stopping the buyer from paying after receiving the goods?4. Lightning network or not, both requires each party to trust each other.5. Yes, it does make it safer. Hence there are those \"wallet payment\" services that lets you pay directly from the exchanges to the merchants. But yes, decentralization is lost.",

Does transactions only involve those you trust?

(Not to be confused for safekeeping of coins, just a means to run the trade)1. Don't send your money for any trade before finalizing the amount so money should be exchanged only after consent from both parties and it is same no matter whether its custodial or non custodial wallet cause the transactions are irreversible.2. They are breaking the laws which may financially benefits them but not an encouraging act.3. Both scenarios are possible, the buyer sends Bitcoin first, and the seller provides goods/services afterward, or the seller delivers the goods/services first, and the buyer sends Bitcoin afterward depending on the situation and agreement between buywer and seller.4. There is no need to trust anyone for using the Lightning network, the seller just have to provide the invoice then buyer has to pay it.5. For them but I don't believe there is no benefits for users by using centralizing exchange other than convenience.",

If you blindly spend money, through bitcoin, bank transfer, gift cards or cash transfers you can always be cheated out of your money's worth.Quote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMIn countries where crypto are considered illegal isn't it risky to accept Bitcoin as a medium of exchange?

If it is illegal then it should not be accepted for payment by legitimate businesses.2. If online there should be an escrow;The buyer sends to the escrow > the seller sends the product > the buyer confirms the authenticity of the product > the escrow releases the funds to the seller.If you are in a physical store, the buyer should get the product and pay before leaving. Just as you do in any store which accepts fiat.Quote from: She shining on July 26, 2023, 08:51:20 PMI'm well aware of the dangers that centralized exchange poses, but doesn't their access to customers data make it feel safer to run a business?
