  "content": "Generally, however, hate speech is any form of expression that discriminates against minorities by abusive or threatening speech. Although some countries define hate speech as speech or act that promotes violence. However everyone has the right to freedom of expression and opinion, although freedom of speech is limited for the promotion of peace because it causes harm and disunity. Hate speech can cause physical harm to its victims when violence is involved and can also cause disunity.The (CERD) committee on the elimination of racial discrimination was the first to address hate speech and the need to build regulation, prohibiting and provocative types of language. This committee intervene and yet hate speech still continue in our society today.Those who support (pro) bitcoin and those who are against bitcoin always have a clash in speech. Those who hate bitcoin see bitcoin as a scam and other crime scheme. So with their view on it they see bitcoin users as scapegoat, criminals and money laundering and some special advisers in the government see bitcoin from this perspective so they advised the government to ban bitcoin in their country. And this cause a social trauma between these two groups.Upon all these bitcoin is still gaining ground in the ecosystem. Therefore, hate speech cannot do anything to bitcoin again.Although we are free to say what we want but we should avoid expressing an idea that threatens or insults association (hate speech)",

Usually people who dont have that enough knowledge on what Bitcoin is are the ones who do really loves on throwing out those kind of negativity towards it.Some are already aware but they do fight and oppose justbecause it didnt really fit out into their interest and this is why its not really that new anymore that there would really be that kind of argumentation in regarding about it.There's always those people who do really hate up Bitcoin no matter how good it is but well we do really have that freedom of speech on which we could really be able to say and hear out neither positive or negative but sooner or later those words would really be that changing up on the time that they had realized something. Just bare in mind that if there would really be those people who would really be that negative or opposition then we might be seeing that almost full adoption and recognition now but we know that it cant really be possible as long that government exist.We do really know on what government do really prepare which it would really be totally going against with those things which are decentralized. There are even people who do much prefer on sticking with those traditional things instead.",

I agree with you, those people who hate Bitcoin aren't really aware of its features, and they're really doing the things which may indirectly help Bitcoin to reach to all those people who may adopt it in future after listening to the hatred speech about Bitcoin from those skeptical ones. We Bitcoiners have always kept a positive outlook at the situations and we will always be positive about anything that comes in the way of Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin is the only remedy to our current economical problems and when someone understands that thing then that person will try his/her best to invest in it, and adopt it as soon as possible. Those economists that expressed negative opinion about Bitcoin were lacking real knowledge about this amazing invention, they did that because they were having that so-called traditional finance mindset of the television era. This era is totally changed one and only the economists and finance specialists who have digital mindset will understand that how essential Bitcoin is to make things better in the world of finance. Governments will never accept the concept of Bitcoin even if they show in front of public that they're supporters of it. Internally they will always have negative plans to suppress the growth of Bitcoin. I believe the banking system has much more freedom when it comes to undercover transactions of the governmental money launderers because they all are part of the same system and they can fix the written documents and other necessary transcripts to hide the money laundering that they do. The darknet is something that's run by the criminal minded people and no one should blame Bitcoin because of the criminality of those criminals who sell all illegal things on those markets. I agree that they accept Bitcoin as a way for payment, and if someone blames Bitcoin for that reason then they should first blame internet for it.",

It's not a panacea; it's not growing on trees, nor is it free, is it? You can't acquire it yourself; mining is extremely expensive and requires great knowledge; thus, the only source is by purchasing. How can it be someone's remedy in a third-world country that barely gets by? By investing? How is he going to invest if someone's barely surviving? Bitcoin is for everyone in theory, but ultimately, it's not available for everyone for a variety of reasons, such as financial, social, and topographical. Just because we're lucky that we can afford to be involved in it doesn't mean that everyone else can either.Bitcoin is great for an average, knowledgeable person with a computer, internet access, and a job that at least provides him some sort of stability and, with some risk, is opening great opportunities for the distant future.",

Bitcoin is like a moving train, you can't stop it or try to bad mouth it because it's unstoppable. I would advise them to stop hating and get involved with the new innovation.",

This weakness is what is fueling some unnecessary arguments against Bitcoin. Some supposed experts will stop at nothing to discourage people from using Bitcoin. Similarly, you don't expect governments of the world to give up on their control of the global financial system so easily, they will do everything possible to discourage people from using Bitcoin, that takes away their power and influence.

      "body": "If there are people who hate Bitcoin, they are obviously the ones who are ignorant and naive of the good that it can give or bring to anyone who will have Bitcoin, whether it is an individual or a company that receives it. And we can't get rid of people in this industry who really don't understand Bitcoin.There are other people who will talk badly about Bitcoin because they have an agenda that, with their influence and power, they know will have an impact on the market, and when they succeed in their objective of dropping the value of Bitcoin, they will take advantage of the opportunity that they can buy a large amount of Bitcoin while holding it long-term. This is just my opinion and assessment that I can think of.",

      "body": "Quote from: Dobabe on September 22, 2023, 05:44:34 PMGenerally, however, hate speech is any form of expression that discriminates against minorities by abusive or threatening speech. Although some countries define hate speech as speech or act that promotes violence. However everyone has the right to freedom of expression and opinion, although freedom of speech is limited for the promotion of peace because it causes harm and disunity. Hate speech can cause physical harm to its victims when violence is involved and can also cause disunity.The (CERD) committee on the elimination of racial discrimination was the first to address hate speech and the need to build regulation, prohibiting and provocative types of language. This committee intervene and yet hate speech still continue in our society today.Those who support (pro) bitcoin and those who are against bitcoin always have a clash in speech. Those who hate bitcoin see bitcoin as a scam and other crime scheme. So with their view on it they see bitcoin users as scapegoat, criminals and money laundering and some special advisers in the government see bitcoin from this perspective so they advised the government to ban bitcoin in their country. And this cause a social trauma between these two groups.Upon all these bitcoin is still gaining ground in the ecosystem. Therefore, hate speech cannot do anything to bitcoin again.Although we are free to say what we want but we should avoid expressing an idea that threatens or insults association (hate speech) Good and bad opinions occur in every corner of the world and there are always two groups one is to support and the other is opposing it. However, in the case of Bitcoin a small group of people as compared to the world, believe in Bitcoin and want everyone to accept it as a global payment system only. But on the other hand, those who did the wrong things like corruption and those who have no Bitcoin or no knowledge about it say shits about it. As bitcoin is decentralized the record of your every transaction is clear and everyone can be seen so the people who are willing the corrupt have no opportunity to hide a big amount of money if bitcoin is legalized in their country. And yeah most of the illegal work was done in the fiat currency system so how they are right to say that Bitcoin promotes illegal activities? Corruption, money laundering, funding to terrorists, or any illegal work was done through the fait system in fact it would not be wrong to call it illegal. Bitcoin is a currency that makes you free from the centralized system, through this system certain people hold control over a large population and Satoshi doesn't want this and for that, he introduced this system to make people free and make them the owners of their assets.",
