  "content": "I have been having problems scanning QR codes generated from my new Foundation \"Passport\" air-gapped wallet on my PC (in order to pair the wallet with Sparrow on the desktop).I am running Linux Mint 21.1 and have an external USB web cam. Whenever I try to scan QR codes form the wallet they show up very bright, \"washed out\", and blurry. As a result, the scanning fails.https://imgbox.com/QTJUEynII have borrowed two other web cams from friends to test. The first of these web cams has the exact same problem, but the second does *not*. The second scans just fine as the QR codes are *not* bright, \"washed out\", and blurry.Can anyone give me some guidance on what is causing this issue for 2 of the 3 web cams? Is there anything I can do to fix it? If not, I will need to buy another web cam. Suggestions on what to look for?Thanks!",

There are programs out there that are able to de-blurry QR codes[1][2] and I honestly don't know if you have now voided the security of your device. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable with this hardware wallet could share some light on this? @n0nce @foundationdvcsAs for your question, it probably is related with your webcam than with the device itself. What are the MP of your device? And the other 2 you are using?[1]https://haraldf.github.io/qrsharpener/[2]https://cscarv.github.io/publication/kl-deblurring",

      "body": "It could be the webcams that have problems scanning QR codes, it has already happened to me in the past that those integrated in notebooks are not of high quality and therefore do not focus to process the image well.  Try other webcams with higher resolution or check if the firmware of the webcam is working fine.  Another test that you protest is to try it either with another linux distribution or with windows.",

I had the same problem but after pattern increasing the pairing proceeds virtually with  the speed of light. Read this post, it may help.P.S. The default is the largest size.",

      "body": "It looks like your webcam is simply not focusing properly, or is picking up a different object to focus on. Try obvious stuff like making sure the lens is clean or trying it in a different USB port. Then explore whether there are more up to date drivers you can install.Did you install any drivers at all or just plug it in and go?",

I think the main issue has to do with the brightness of the Passport screen overwhelming the camera. It's not handling it well. I may end up needing to buy another web cam.Quote from: RickDeckard on July 23, 2023, 09:51:24 PMI would delete the linked image immediately as you are providing a screenshot of your Foundation Device with a QR code in it.Thanks for the info. That's a very good point. In my case, though, I'm not concerned. I have every intention of doing a firmware reset and generating a new key from dice, so this seed -- even if it can be recovered from the image -- is throw-away. The wallet is empty.",

Alternatively, go in to the settings menu on your Passport and you should have an option there to adjust the screen brightness as well.What model of webcam is it and what drivers are you using? If it is simply too bright then proper drivers or configuration software should be able to fix this as well.",

If Passport's display is  exposed to direct light coming from outside then reflection from the glass which covers display's matrix will dazzle the camera. I have personally encountered this issue  when display of my Passport 2 was positioned directly  in the front of the window in the room where  I was seated.",

      "body": "I ended up buying another webcam, a \"Logitech 1080p Pro Stream\", and it works well. I have the set the Passport wallet to 5% screen brightness (which is still bright enough for my needs) and put it against a white background (rather than the darker background I was using before), and the webcam is able to focus on the QR code and pair with relative ease. (I again tested my original webcam under the same conditions and it is still completely unable to get a clear image.)https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Stream-Webcam-Streaming-Recording/dp/B07661NX9MSo I guess it all came down to this: I just needed a better webcam.Thanks again for the replies and suggestions!",
