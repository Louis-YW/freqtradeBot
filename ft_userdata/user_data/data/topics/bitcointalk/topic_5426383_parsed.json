Ukraine was chosen as a training ground, a battlefield (unfortunately for them), but in reality, it is a war between Russia and NATO/USA. without support from outside, Ukraine would certainly not have lasted this long.yes, you are right about the rest. Those countries that are further away from the real world are certainly faring much better in this conflict. Ukraine and Russia will be the biggest financial losers, while for example, the USA makes a profit from all this.Quote from: dansus021 on December 07, 2022, 10:48:01 AMWe Need at least $330 Billion to solve the world hunger problem by the end 2030 edit: if we talk about the distribution of money, just imagine, Elon Musk bought fucking Twitter for $44 billion",

Are you not concerned with yourself and your loved ones? Are you ready for it? How deep is your knowledge of world history and current issues? Although I can assume it somehow when you mentioned that Russia should only pick one either Europe, the UK, or the USA. Mate, if it is only Russia and Europe warring with each other, it is not a world war. World War I battles mostly happened in Europe only but most of the world are controlled by Europe hence it was called a World War. For thousands of years, war reset nations' and kingdoms' economies. Nowadays we have many countries armed with nuclear weapons that won't just reset our economies but are capable of destroying our whole planet.",

      "body": "Perhaps reset is all you are wanting to point out. But a war is different. Many people would be lost and think of how long will it take for a complete recovery given that many countries will again try to rebuild each of their 'system of governance', not to mention broken infrastructures. And also, we cannot control casualties during a world war. Think of how much money, time, hardwork, will it need for the world to be back on its feet. That would be a huge gamble wherein no assurance is there that things will be in proper again after that. So I guess this one won't work out well.Quote from: inthelongrun on December 07, 2022, 11:28:20 AMFor thousands of years, war reset nations' and kingdoms' economies.

The advancement in technology could be used to destroy almost everything if ever this thing would happen. I like the idea of thinking outside the box but this is way too much for a solution.",

After the war, European countries took considerable initiatives to enrich and strengthen their economies and as a result, we can see Europe established as a strong economic region, but this does not mean that another war is necessary. We already know that America The belligerent countries like to start World War III so that they can defeat and subdue Russia and China with their powerful armies will cause the whole world to suffer because all the power of the world will be concentrated in one country as it happened after World War II.Russia is relatively strong militarily compared to other countries but its weak economy is the biggest obstacle to establishing itself as a superpower. In collusion, they want to weaken Russia as much as possible temporarily because America's only rival in Europe is Russia, and through this, America is making substantial profits by selling billions of dollars of arms to Ukraine, which has boosted America's economy.",

I suggest you to read about the collapse of Ancient Egyptian civilization (1550 to 1070 B.C) and its connection to \"Sea Peoples\" that whiped out almost everyone Egypt was trading with. War means broken supply chains, social unrest, fear of investing and spending billions on fireworks. Nothing is booming by blowing things up. War does not save the economy and the value of money. War saves politicians who are they are not being punished for the destruction of the economy and money because there is someone/something to blame it on (war).",
