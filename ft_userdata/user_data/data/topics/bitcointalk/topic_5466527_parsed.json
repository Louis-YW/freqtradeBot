You left nothing to write for anyone else. Can I Give My Account As Collateral? Can I Give A Car?I don't think that your account is a valid collateral and if you want your car as collateral for a deal then your car must be more than $30k in value. Only those members may accept your car as collateral who live in your own country because it's a burdensome thing for out country lenders to accept car as a collateral due to many issues. If you really want to have that amount as loan then you must have to provide a valid collateral. In face I recommend you to sell your car directly and then use that money for your needs.",

You left nothing to write for anyone else. Can I Give My Account As Collateral? Can I Give A Car?Yes of course you can give a car as collateral!I think you can give a car if the guy that gonna lend the money is in area where it's possible for him to access it.I mean... when the loan is active, of course the car would be in his belongings and all paper should be signed that he is the owner of the car so you just can't take it back.But if you think anyone here will lend you the money just because you own a car is at least what I think impossible. If they don't live close to you and can get the car from you.For lets be honest here... Nobody would lend you money and still let you be in the possession of the car. Now I haven't been here for a very long time, but that's does it not impossible for me to read older posts/threads.And some people that want to lend money...... Yeah.. I don't find words for it actually.  But! if you actually got a car, google everything in your area if its possible, I think you can find someone that would do it!",
