TOS seems to tell it's fair. It would be best to send it back to the original address if I were the casino to deal with this situation. But can't you remove the self-exclusion and then see if it's credited?  And if gambling is still in mind, heck people understand it's a struggle to quit.",

There are some casinos that allows customers to withdraw their funds when they play at least a specific number of games. Since you said it was accidentally, then you might also leave it accidentally  , I said so because you were not supposed to deposit funds to the self excluded account, and the only persons who would have helped you out from this mess is the support team and you are saying that they are not allowing you to withdraw and if the support team told you that then I don't think you can do anything to withdraw you cash. Because no any other person has the direct access to the CEO of the company except the support team since it is an online stake.",

I think you just have to wait.If the casino is honest, they should return the money, especially since it was sent by accident.Quote from: Cryptomiles1 on January 30, 2023, 07:20:20 PMDid you read their terms and conditions carefully before making deposit??and did you read that he did it by accident?",

In this case, it was a self excluded account which means your funds are still safe and another, depends on the time at which the send excluded account will expire or elapse. So therefore, there is no cause for alarm as everything will be alright. I would advise you to contact there representative here onboard this platform so they could help you out with your funds when the time arrives but I believe before then there might be some things you might likely be required to do so as to scale through the process of getting your refund.

Next time be careful and don't deposit in the self-excused account of any casino. I don't think that will work as it is clearly stated on stake terms of service that deposit into such an account is prohibited and unrecoverable, so best ops just move on I don't waste more efforts on that since he self excluded himself from the casino. Unless there is an expiration for the self-exclusion if not the ethereum deposited is gone bro nothing support may do about that.",
