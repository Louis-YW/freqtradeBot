This is a typical web3 casino in which you will see the registration when you click the \"connect\" button. You will be prompted with a different option to register using metamask, email, and wallet connect. I just visit the casino and manage to connect my wallet. You're right that you can access to your Bitcoin wallet once you already have an account. Their Bitcoin wallet support native blockchain so I guess the casino is indeed good to launch their ANN thread here.Maybe anyone is interested in this casino's upcoming airdrop on April 27th.

Your website have a very bad rating on scamadviser.com and your domain is only a month old. Even though you may be a reputable casino, you still have a lot to learn about marketing.

For example is French roulette that let you bet on both side of either black or red. The only time the launderer lose is when zero win but he only lose half of his money when zero occur. The chance of zero to appear is very low while launderer can play this game slowly while achieving the casino VIP rewards such as rakeback to cover his loses. Casino has a money launderer that is why KYC and wagering requirements for deposit was implemented tomcounter this stuff.",

Thanks for your kind response.I'm still a bit skeptical about something I'd like to ask.As you said that LFI pool will be the last resort of insurance if any big bettor wins and you don't have enough to pay him, may I ask that except this LFI pool liquidity, do you have your own backup capital (I'm not asking about adding liquidity or something, but in other major crypto) in order to keep your end safe? I mean, is there some amount (I'm not interested in asking to disclose it) with you already that you'll use both in advertising/marketing as well as payments to gamblers should they play and win big at your place, or are the winnings completely dependent on the liquidity of players alone?As well, I'd like to know the type of bonuses you guys are providing on deposits (if any). I'd also suggest you to give some free spins to new players to try out your casino, this will help drive real traffic to your casino as well as may also convert them into permanent players of your casino if they like playing there. Last but not the least, as CryptSafe suggested, if you're looking for advertising and marketing, I don't think there's any better place but this forum that has thousands of gamblers available here whom you can hire through signature campaign and spread the word about your casino.",
