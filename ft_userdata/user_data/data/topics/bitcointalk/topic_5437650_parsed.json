      "body": "After the decision of FED hikes rates by 25bps, it seems that the upcoming meetings will be expected and therefore the market will calculate them, which means that we will not see real changes in the price.Also, the Fedâ€™s decisions are not considered market makers, and therefore they will not change prices in a way that makes monitoring them the basis, and they occur periodically and not daily or weekly, which means that we will consider waiting for 6 Weeks 6 Days 22 Hours 37 Minutes for the next meeting, which is a period beyond being monitored by this tool.In general, although it is a good tool, I do not see any benefit for it in cryptocurrency market.",

      "body": "The Fed meetings are important because they determine monetary policy and interest rates, which can have a significant impact on the economy and financial markets. The cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, can also be affected by changes in interest rates and monetary policy. When interest rates are low, it can increase the appeal of alternative investments such as cryptocurrencies, as investors seek higher returns. On the other hand, tighter monetary policy or rising interest rates can lead to a decrease in demand for cryptocurrencies, as they become less attractive compared to traditional investments. However, it's important to note that cryptocurrencies are still a relatively new and highly speculative asset class, and their reaction to changes in monetary policy can be difficult to predict.",
