Go for exchanges which gives you control over what you are doing.

Since Binance is always #1 with a perfect score. Are they trying to eliminate competition? etc.But to answer your question, it's difficult to say without knowing the exchange name, since bestchange has multiple exchanges and not only one, or are you talking about instant exchanges in general? But then, it also depends on your preferences, what is it that you want to trade? Just BTC and stablecoins? Do you care about going through KYC etc.",

If you only look at FTX or Bittrex this year, then it has developed very negative for both. There were a lot of people who trusted the exchanges. Currently Binance is not wanted by the SEC and in a few countries in Europe, recently they had to close their offer in Belgium, which is a massive loss of trust. In Germany it has been since the beginning bitcoin.de, and since a few months, the users of the trading place get mail from the tax, so it was data that have been released, also this is also a massive loss of trust for the exchange.",

Are they trying to eliminate competition? etc.Sometimes, Coingecko take down Binance from the first on the list. There was a time that I checked that Binance.US was even above Binance.com on Coingecko while Binance.us was not the first on the list. But Binance.com appears more as first on the list. https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchangesCoinmarketcap is owned by Binance. Binance bought it like 3 years ago which I think you knew about. That alone can make them partial.Quote from: Nwada001 on July 07, 2023, 07:20:27 AMCheck out the list below: Â  list of CEX and Dex exchanges  it comprises of both CEX and Dex on the decentralized exchange role you will see list of Decentralized exchange's. But I will highly recommendÂ  Bisq, as most members have recommended it in the past. Others in the list I don't know how updated they are now since their has not been update from the OP since. He should not depend on that link, it was posted in 2018 and there have been a lot of changes. There are some exchanges that are there but not recommended anymore. I will recommend https://kycnot.me/. But some of the exchanges like Kucoin are centralized, not decentralized but not require KYC. Because they are centralized, they can force any of their users to do KYC at anytime. Kucoin even now requireÂ  KYCÂ  He should use those with the score of at least 9.For decentralized exchange, I will recommend Bisq. But it has just few (not many) trading pairs but it is the best bitcoin decentralized exchange.For altcoins, he can decide to use those exchanges that you can connect directly to your altcoin wallet: https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/",

      "body": "Well, just as @MinoRaiola said, there's nothing like a most trusted Bitcoin exchange. Any exchange that's very trustworthy today may turn out to be the worst exchange in the future,so I suggest we only use a few that are recommended by some members on the forum. I don't mean that you should fully depend on those exchange or store your crypto asset in those CEX. Â  Â  Â Have you come across the Current list of exchanges without KYC? From that list, I have used OKX, Huobi, Lbank, Kucoin, and MEXC and I did not experience any difficulty in using those exchange.Well, I can say that Bisq and AgoraDesk are also good decentralised exchanges for Bitcoin.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",

In the end, if Binance fails, CMC will be sold, and the price may not be good if Binance needs liquidity or liquidation of its assets, and therefore we cannot rely on it as an independent source to confirm the extent of confidence in any platform, especially the numbers related to Binance and its competitors.I tried to make a list, but it needs constant updating, and one piece of news can turn a platform from highly reliable into a scam.
