  "content": "bitcoin naturally goes through cycles two being the bull and the bear cycles. these two cycles can't be any different: bull cycle are associated with price growth and influx of investors while bear cycle are associated with falling prices and overall loss of confidence from investors. due to bitcoin's volatility it is always expected for bear cycle to happen consequently after a bull cycle. for every bull cycle, someone is always expecting for the bear cycle to be stopped or to not happen anymore but that is only wishful thinking. bear cycle can't be stopped by anyone or anything but due to many countries taking interest in bitcoin recently particularly the usa is it now appropriate to think that bitcoin is in a supercycle which means it will most likely not follow the past cycles and continue to show high prices for the next few years?many are expecting that when trump orders bitcoin to be a reserve currency, bitcoin's bear cycles will stop. i personally do not believe this to happen at the very least we will see some changes of course like maybe the bear cycle would not show very low prices but to think that the price of bitcoin will never dip over the next few years is too optimistic in my opinion. what about you? do you also believe in this supercycle that bitcoin might be in? or do you think bitcoin will just continue to follow its previous cycles?",

Just like the name implies; bear season. A bear season is a period when there is a continuous drop in the price of bitcoin either within a short period of time or for a longer period of time depending on the factor that will prompt it's action. If Donald Trump makes bitcoin a strategic reserve currency, there will certainly be a bear season at some point but it won't last for so long again as it normally does in some bear season. This is because the value of bitcoin will increase and some investors who are hodlers will be looking for any DIP opportunity for them to buy and add to their portfolio so definitely, if the market is experiencing a downtrend for sometime, it will still return back again because their will be active investors who are ready to monitor the activities in the market just like normal traders does. The bear season is not gone but it will not be rational as it used to be but rather it will be irregular.",

      "body": "Gold is a reserve currency, and the value goes up and down. Long-term, it looks as if the value goes up, but that's just inflation on fiat currency which means gold more or less keeps it's value while the dollar and euro are forever dropping. Bitcoin is still increasing in value faster than inflation, and I expect that to continue for a while. Which, in my opinion, means Bitcoin's value is still going up, and it will probably take a few decades for it to reach an equilibrium like gold has had for centuries. After that, I still expect ups and downs, but in the long-run, Bitcoin will more or less reach a stable value where it's price will follow inflation. Kinda like gold now. But at a much higher price than it currently has.",

      "body": "While searching for the definition of a \"Bitcoin supercycle\", I tried to read this article that I saw, and here's a portion of it: LINKQuoteWhat could fuel this super cycle? Several factors align:Increased liquidity in the marketFavorable market and geopolitical conditionsStrong performance in traditional finance (TradFi) marketsRising demand for BTC and cryptoThese conditions set the stage for a powerful upward trend that could exceed expectations. With BTC moving into new highs, we may be witnessing the beginning of a super cycle, as favorable conditions make BTC a more attractive investment.I'll try to explain some of it (coming from not an expert one )1. Increased liquidity in the market - I can't say if there's an increase of liquidity in the market, but if there's anybody who can share some data here then that would be helpful, but if there's an increase in liquidity, that might be a factor towards a potential supercycle.2. Favorable market and geopolitical conditions - I guess there's no need to explain this one. Trump winning, which is a pro-crypto, him putting pro-crypto officials as well, and the market seems favorable as well.3. Strong performance in TradFi Markets - we've seen many traditional finance markets that are coming into crypto. There are many financial institutions coming into the crypto space already.4. Rising demand for BTC and crypto - Well, I guess we are seeing a rising demand with the institutions coming.Whatever the case is, we might see a Bitcoin supercycle in the future, or maybe we might see it in the next 2-3 years.",

There is no currency or volitile asset in the world that just keeps going up in price without any moment of pull backs and corrections, even if the USA declare in early 2025 declare that Bitcoin will be used as reserve currency for the country, the price of bitcoin will definitely jump on that news, people will become more confident in the future growth of bitcoin and want to invest heavily on it, but this does not mean that the price will never experience any form of decline anymore from time to time, remember that it's not only the US that is holding or will be holding bitcoin, there are several bodies and entities holding bitcoins too, and any of this bodies and or entities can decide to sell their position at any time, which may cause the price of bitcoin to go down a bit, depending on how large the position being sold is.So at the moment, I don't believe in anything known as a supercycle, bitcoin, as well as the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem have just two seasons, and that's the bull and bear seasons.",

That is true but not the only way to manipulate the market. Need I remind you of \"Shenanigans of Musk\"™? When bitcoin was rising, he basically started advertising it and contributed to that rise. Afterward when the rise stopped and the correction began, he took a U-turn and did the exact opposite and started spreading FUD and contributed to deepening the crash.He did that market manipulation by only moving his mouth and his fingers on keyboard without having to trade on a CEX.A couple of months ago when Trump was running his mouth, many people got hyped up and so many attribute the breaking of $70k resistance to his campaign promises.Do you really think Trump as the felon president in office and Musk as his \"sidekick\" would have less influence to manipulate the market?",
