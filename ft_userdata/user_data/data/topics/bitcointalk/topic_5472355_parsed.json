      "body": "You found your betting account; was it lost before?üòèüòè I guess what you meant was to fund your account. ¬†When someone is on board most times and you want to have fun through gambling, that $10 that you deposited should have been enough for you. Since you are going there for fun, you should have just been using the minimum amount required for a wager to place your bet. By so doing, you will be able to extend the duration of how that $10 will last for you.¬†The reason why you funded your account with another $10 was because you either enjoyed the game you were playing too much or were trying to chase the one that you had already lost, which can make you drop another deposit in order to create a chance of winning back your first deposit.¬†Over to your question: if you don't control yourself, this is exactly how it all gets started, provided you have money to use and fund your betting account at your disposal. If you don't control yourself, you will keep on funding your account until you spend everything that you have. That's why we are all advised to have a minimum budget and keep to that budget.",

No.It‚Äôs actually not gambling addiction since this is the first time something like this has happened to you. To me it just feels like you experienced a losing streak without having to even get a Berger feel of the games that day and because of that you were not satisfied and wanted to see if you would last longer if you try again but unfortunately you lost both of them.But I‚Äôll also advice that you don‚Äôt make it a habit to always go beyond what you had initially budgeted for; because the more you do it the more it becomes harder for you to stop and it will get to a time you‚Äôll be unable to properly manage the money going through your gambling account.",

No.To answer your question straight, Yes! It's a sign that you're becoming an addict. Depositing money to gamble is normal but losing money and then immediately depositing more money again is a sign that you are chasing your losses or perhaps you are losing control of your gambling behavior. You may not find it easy to admit that you might have a problem just like you are feeling now but I think you can correct that since you have recognize the signs. Gambling is supposed to be fun and entertaining but If it's starting to feel stressful or you're losing control of your spending then, it's time to take a step back.",

It means you have control over yourself and your decision while gambling. But you can enjoy gambling more, just use like $0.5 for each bet next time. This will make you have long time on the gambling site and you will not lose the whole $10 to $20 at money at once, you may even gain than loss.",

No.I believe what you experience was that feeling of wanting to win back your loss because it's like a session and when you are log in , you actually don't know what you doing because of the anxiousness you feel from actually losing the first money deposited. I can say you haven't really gotten to the addict stage but with you are explaining now, I think it's a working progress unless you probably contain it now when the habit is still controllable because once you lose control, another experience of deposit that you might have will be much more way than 20$",

It was the same with me when I first started gambling. In my opinion, we do not understand how it happens because of the defense mechanism of our brain. If a person's mind realizes that he has made a mistake, he blocks the memory at that moment. Don't worry, it doesn't mean you've become an addict. It means that your mind can't explain how this happened.",

No.I personally think you are not an addict but I strongly suggest you to keep your emotion straight and control your self in your gambling activities. Seeking a comebacks is what makes gambling fun as long as it is manageable. It's not that fun anymore if the loss you have will affect you and your daily life. Just be careful since repeating a habit like this will result you in being on a heavy loss or at worst became an addict that will try to recover your lost funds. Control yourself and do a budget on your gambling funds, that way you know what money to spend without really much affecting your daily life.",

No.Really may be the casino gave you a cash back as for your loss, ¬†this is a form of compensation to keep you motivated to play more and if possible make more deposits, or if you are lucky you can make a few winnings in between the line but then also you have to be aware of the fact that some of the winning that you may accrue from such money may be subject to some wager conditions before withdrawals. Then also you have to be at peace with whatever the outcome may be since you didn't deposit the funds in the first place so you be ready to go through whatever the casino may put up with.",

No.You can‚Äôt just use that to judge, maybe you are becoming addicted, maybe being lonely was the reason why you topped up your account after losing the $10 that was in the account. But I can say addiction also starts with that, but if, after you¬† deposited the second time, you were able to control yourself, then I won‚Äôt say you are getting addicted to gambling, and you said you are not a frequent gambler, if you gamble frequently, it will have been a different issue. But since you gamble once in a while, depositing money after using it is a normal thing, and you stop after losing the second amount you deposited.",

No.If this is the first time, then this is not a gambling addiction behavior. because a gambling addict can do worse than that, namely by continuing to deposit without any restrictions or real steps to prevent himself from this bad behavior. And a gambling addict can do worse than that, spending the contents of his account for the sake of gambling.Even though this is the first time, this is one of the signs that your gambling is getting out of control and if this behavior continues to be left unchecked like running water, then sooner or later this behavior can lead you to an addiction to gambling.And here I advise you to be more careful in gambling and don't forget to reorganize your gambling activities so that these activities remain under control. And one more thing, don't let just because loneliness struck make you behave carelessly.",

Not knowing the actual amount you deposited is something you actually need to sort out because it can get way worse than this if you are not careful enough.",
