We've heard and seen similar cases of such criminal behaviour all over the world in recent times. The majority of these are the result of poor upbringing in the family and peer groups. When a child is properly raised, he or she will continue to view crime as evil, regardless of the comfort they will derive from owning the wealth obtained through crime.",

Parents no longer care where their children got money to buy cars and houses because they have been blinded by the love of money. I have always advised my friends and family to be content with what they have because what they have now is better than what they haven't got. If you want to earn more, then learn more and work harder. I don't need to acquire much money to be happy because happiness is not a product of how much you have.

That is reducing excessive spending on things that are not important and always making a list of expenses for the basic needs that we consume every day so that spending money can be controlled very well because usually everyone is more aware of incoming money than spending money on any direction.",

We can't give it that much power over us. As long as you don't act like a complete dummy when investing in Bitcoin, it's a good alternative.

You have to be careful if you go in search of news every day because it will highlight a bunch of bad stuff going on, but the vast majority of people are living normal lives and following the laws. People generally have to work hard and be clever if they want to accumulate money over time (ignoring the lucky few who get it from things like inheritance or the lottery), so they pick up a lot of financial sense along the way. When you're younger unfortunately it is tougher to get money and sometimes criminality can be glamorized, so we must be vigilant and keep guiding them properly - while accepting we all made mistakes along the way and learned from them.",

In this time, apart from crimes, there are many other very regrettable decisions you could make because of too much love for money and when someone becomes too desperate to get it through any means. That should not be someone's plan on how to get money because planning to get money through any means is a decision that may lead you to money, but will not offer you the same peace and joy that getting money the right way offers.

An important fact that we need to know is that if we can give someone a job, then we have the potential to prevent them from committing crimes such as theft, robbery and others.",
