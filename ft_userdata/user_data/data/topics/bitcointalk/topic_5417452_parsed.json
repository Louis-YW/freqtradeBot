To make sure you have received the fund, you can search for your receiving address on a block explorer like blockchair.com and check the balance and transactions history there.",

      "body": "If you can't store 400 GB of data, you can enable pruning in bitcoin core. In this way, you don't have to store that large data. Note that even if you run a prune node, you still have to download the full blockchain.The other only solution is to export your private key(s) from Armory and export it into a SPV wallet like electrum.In SPV wallets, you don't have to download the blockchain. Warning:Download electrum only from its official website and do not forget to verify your download.The post has been edited. Sorry. As mentioned below by BitMaxz, Armory doesn't work if you download the blockchain in prune mode.",

And i've heard of that but doesn't it requires 400GB of space to download the full blockchain  Cause I dont have that much space on my pc.What explorer did you use that says it's completed? You might be talking about transaction history in Moonpay? You must check them on the right explorer like blockchain.com or blockchair.com and the status should be confirmed as the right term not \"completed\" and to make sure that you already receive the BTC.About the space problem Armory wallet won't work properly if your Bitcoin core is not fully sync. So the only solution for this is to export private the guide already posted above then use the sweep on Electrum for safety than importing private key in online device.",
