      "body": "Write out your recovery phrase on a paper, laminate it and make many backups, then put them in more than one or two locations, there is no other alternative that can be better than simply writing your recovery phrase on a paper, and it is cost effective too. If you are unsure about that, you can engrave your seed phrase on a metal steel, either by buying the steel from companies that sell them, or if you can make one for yourself, then you can go ahead and do so. But from my research: Never give somebody else your recovery phrase to help you engrave it into a metal steel, you must learn how to do it yourself if you must use it.Needless to add that in a natural disaster you may be worried about better things like your life, and that of your family than your bitcoin funds, and if you manage to save your life and lose your money, you should be happy .",

Laminating it might keep it longer than usual. Even the laminating paper washed out. I have laminated a National ID card because the original one has not came out, but after some months I discovered that the write on the ID card were fade and when I asked someone told me that the heat that is inside the paper did. That is when I came to understand that laminating is not the best option of a document safety. Since there is no best to secure paper wallet, you just have to duplicate it and keep it in different place like rooms and houses.",

This your method looks very risky and if we store our private keys in this form then we might lost it if our gadgets like phones or computer get hacked. We know that hacking of wallets is one of the ways many investors had lost there funds because of carelessness or lack of adequate info on how to protect there wallets from hackers. I have seen so many ways we can protect our private keys from getting destroyed either by water or fire in that eventually occurs. There are tools and gadgets that are water resistant we can store or write our keys on that could make it safer from natural disasters or hackers.",

Again, worst case - you won't be the first person to discover your seed. So in some way the ease of destruction is a feature. Or if your house is about to be raided by armed people - you can eat or burn a piece of paper, but you can't do anything to a steel plate.",

      "body": "Cloud backup sites tend to be secure, and therefore in some sense safer than storing them on your own local computer. That said, I would still recommend storing your important documents and sensitive information on a physical device instead of in the cloud. To be extra safe, you can keep multiple copies in different locations. That way, if something happens to your cloud storage provider or the server that holds your data, you won't lose everything. As with any online service, there is always a chance that the company could go out of business or be hacked. It is also worth noting that some online backup services are more secure than others. And, it is also important to note that sensitive data should never be stored in digital format unless it is encrypted. In the modern age, where people are so connected via the internet, it can sometimes be difficult to control who has access to your information and what they are able to do with it. Unfortunately, as is all too obvious from recent events, this also means that security becomes a key concern. The truth is that hackers are always looking for new ways to get data, and we all have to be cautious about protecting our sensitive information.",

At least, have two backups or three. The second or third can even be inside the wall of your house to be the last thing to do if the first seed phrase is lost. Another one can be inside your mattress in a way you can loose the mattress cloth, cut the mattress foam with a blade and insert the seed phrase paper backup, gum the mattress foam back with glue in a way the seed phrase is not affected and sole back the cloth. Another is a paper at your backyard buried under the sand in a very small metallic box. There are many ways you can think to backup seed phrase differently that it would be difficult for anyone to see it. But which may not resist natural disaster.",
