People not taking certain bills is not the root of the problem, but rather a symptom of a failed centralized system where trust is lost.If you can, move into crypto-currency or more stable FIAT until better times come.",

The labour cost of making coins is much higher than making paper money, but it can be use for years since coins since coins are stronger than paper which can lower the demand and supply. This can greatly affect the country because they may have more sufficient amount of money to support any problems in the country including poverty. It may takes years before you can feel the changes of the situation but its part of the process. I actually prefer paper before since its more convenient to carry but knowing the situation I considered coins better.",

This switch from physical fiat to online banking should have been gradual because many Nigerians are unbanked. Many businesses have collapsed because they don't have access to fiat and the banking channels are not reliable. Sometimes it takes up to four days for a fund transfer to reflect on the receiver's account. This has made many businesses insist on cash payments. Now Nigerian citizens have to buy money to purchase what they want. Fiat can cost up to 40% of the amount that is to be bought. This has brought untold hardship on the people because salaries and wages remain the same, while the cost of goods and services is increasing drastically.Nigeria is gradually turning into a banana republic where the Presidency and other government agencies don't respect court judgments even the orders issued by the Supreme Court. This currency policy needs to be reviewed to avoid the breakdown of law and order because people are suffering.",
