  "content": "Apparently, someone is not abandoning attempts to destabilize the oil market, and the world economy in general.Now another hotbed of hostilities may emerge before our eyes, the key goal of which is to destabilize oil production in the world.The reasons are banal - a neighboring country, Venezuela. And there on December 3, 2023 a referendum is scheduled in which Venezuelans must \"decide\" whether to take away 2/3 of the territory from the neighboring state. Why? There are a lot of \"reasons\" and \"explanations\". But we will discard the fairy tale options, let's return to reality. NEFT. Since 2015, 46 oil fields have been discovered in Guyana (4 of them in 2023). This state, at the moment, has the world's fourth largest oil reserves - 10 billion barrels. Thus, it becomes the largest owner of oil reserves per capita. And geological exploration in the country continues. The neighboring country is Venezuela. A country that made its choice in favor of a populist president who brought the country to economic collapse, wild inflation, and the status of almost a \"pariah country\", and exactly a country with sanctions on oil. It would seem - extract oil, get a huge income, make the country and its people rich and happy. But what to do if you are a populist to the bone !?? Right - you need to continue the show to distract the population from the real problems, and yourself to get away from the really difficult work. Especially after you yourself have driven the country into such a state. What's the solution? The classic - a small victorious war, with the capture of foreign territories, and especially if they contain large oil deposits. And especially if someone whispers behind your back \"go ahead, go ahead, take someone else's, I will support you, I have experience\"....I am interested in the opinion of the respected community ! In case of conflict development, or rather the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Venezuela in Guyana, what consequences await the world economy, namely the oil market?",

      "body": "It is very likely that a military conflict between Venezuela and Guyana will begin soon, or rather, it has already begun. And this conflict threatens to develop into a multilateral one, with the participation of many states. Information has already appeared that Venezuelan special operations forces have crossed the border with Guyana and are fighting in the Essequibo region with the defense forces of this country.Guyana is now trying to enlist the support of Brazil, the US and Britain to curb Venezuela's appetites. Brazil has already made it clear to Venezuela several times that it will intervene in the event of hostilities. Brazil's Defense Ministry, which is supporting Guyana in the conflict, has decided to send additional troops to guard its northern border amid tensions between Venezuela and Guyana over a territorial dispute. The Pentagon has sent some of the leadership of the US 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB) to Guyana.The Guyana Armed Forces (GDF) number 12 thousand people. At the same time, the total strength of the Venezuelan army, including the police, is over 300 thousand people. Dictator Maduro in Venezuela is supported by other dictatorships - Russia, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Belarus and China.Source:https://kp.ua/politics/a680699-vozmozhnaja-vojna-pod-bokom-u-ssha-venezuela-uhrozhaet-hajane-po-lekalam-putinaIt appears that someone is trying to divert the attention of the United States and the West from the war in Ukraine and weaken the assistance provided to it. The fighting has not yet subsided as a result of the Hamas attack on Israel, and suddenly there is a new source of military tension. And evil tongues say that “Wagnerites” have long settled in Venezuela. But everything secret sooner or later becomes clear.",

The inhabitants of the area should be allowed to determine their future. They shouldn't be forced to become Venezuelan citizens which might be against their will. If this referendum is done in Essequibo, I am sure that the majority of people living in the territory will prefer to remain Guyanese.Quote from: DrBeer on November 29, 2023, 07:46:30 PMI am interested in the opinion of the respected community ! In case of conflict development, or rather the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Venezuela in Guyana, what consequences await the world economy, namely the oil market? Guyana produces about 380,000 barrels per day (bpd)  which is not big enough to distort the global oil market. OPEC+ could just increase the supply quota of member states to cover up the shortages that might be caused by this conflict. I am sure that few oil producing nations can cover up these shortages without many problems which might lead to fewer economic consequences.Quote from: Hispo on December 03, 2023, 10:43:34 PMI personally I can assure you there has been people forced to vote today, under the threat of behind fired out their public jobs.If anyone here has a question, I will try to reply. Great to know that you are from Venezuela @Hispo. From the information I have gathered from the internet, I assume that many Venezuelans believe that Essequibo is their territory that has been part of the country until it was wrongfully taken away when the north-south border was plotted about a hundred years ago. Do you think the majority of Venezuelans have this perception? Now considering that the disputed territory is rich in mineral resources, don't you also think that the people of your country will support the memorandum because it might lead to an increase in revenue for the nation?",

I have heard specifically about the Exxon Mobile company  doing some exploration and drilling there on behalf of Guyana. I am not as well informed about the specific role of big oil companies with this political campaign, though.

Now considering that the disputed territory is rich in mineral resources, don't you also think that the people of your country will support the memorandum because it might lead to an increase in revenue for the nation?I emphasize, once again, 2 factors:1. There are universally recognized boundaries, and they cannot be violated. Whether one likes it or not2. Separatist referendums are a technology of the Kremlin, which in this way created a lot of cloaks (PMR, Abkhazia, DNR, LNR,...) that eventually became just festering infectious wounds on the body of other countries.The inviolability and integrity of borders is out of the question ! Otherwise you will be waiting for the same thing that Russia did in Ukraine. Believe me - in case of a full-fledged military conflict, on the side of Venezuela, you will see Russian troops or at least marginalized PMCs. Putin will support the same totalitarian and untalented ruler as himself, plus it may destabilize the oil market even more. In the Middle East, the Kremlin has failed to ignite a global crisis, but terror and destabilization is all that is left in Putin's hands. And oil is the last trump card.... Regarding production in Guyana. Now - yes, the amount you mentioned is being produced, but the proven reserves can significantly increase production. I suppose that's what triggered the sudden aggression. And to answer your question to the other participant \"don't you also think that the people of your country will support the memorandum because it might lead to an increase in revenue for the nation?\". - I'm very unsure that the people of Venezuela are receiving revenues from their natural wealth.... Please ask Mr. Hispo to provide information on how much of the revenues from natural resources go to the people of Venezuela ?  Quote from: Hispo on December 04, 2023, 04:30:57 PMThank you for your comments and I honestly hope your national situation gets solved, your country did nothing but minding their own businesses when Russia decided to attack.In my country's case we are very confident all this things were are seeing are just for show and as an strategy to manipulate the population through a imposed sentiment of patriotism.

It was most likely carried out to justify possible military actions against this country. Regardless of the actual results of this referendum, the announced results will reflect Maduro's plans for an attack on Guyana. That is, within a week we can find out whether Venezuela will attack Guyana. I think now Maduro is very carefully watching the reaction to these events from other states, and above all the United States. The question is whether Maduro will still decide to attack. Of course, he will be pushed to do this from the Kremlin, promising all kinds of support. It is very beneficial for Putin to divert the attention of the United States and NATO countries to other military conflicts from the war in Ukraine and especially by reducing the provision of military assistance to it. But Maduro is risking a lot and I hope he understands this.",

Protect the security of their companies from terrorist threats2. will provide significant assistance to Guyana, which objectively is much inferior in military power to Venezuela3. There will be a balance of power in the region, taking into account the presence of Russian military bases (or at least logistics hubs) on the territory of Venezuela. This means that terrorists like PMC Wagner or its analogues will highly likely arrive there under the guise of “help.”4. They will show that the United States will continue to help adhere to legal norms and help those who are under threat from unfriendly aggressive regimes.The only question is - does Maduro understand that starting this aggression, there is a very high probability of events developing in such a way that he will leave his post much earlier and with much worse consequences for HIMSELF than losing the elections!?",

So if a guy with AK comes to your door hands you some recruitment papers and orders you to march to free the motherland territory occupied by the evil capitalist, what are you going to do? Honest question, not joking, some thought in 2021 that was a joke, many are not able to laugh no more now.Quote from: Die_empty on December 04, 2023, 06:07:00 AMGuyana produces about 380,000 barrels per day (bpd)  which is not big enough to distort the global oil market. OPEC+ could just increase the supply quota of member states to cover up the shortages that might be caused by this conflict. I am sure that few oil producing nations can cover up these shortages without many problems which might lead to fewer economic consequences.Far more complicated that this:- That oil production is the current one, not what's expected to be in two there years- Venezuela doesn't have the technology to explore that oil, but if they take over now it's almost everything in place, they would nationalize everything and got brand new equipment ready to pump and drill- Venezuela just saw a window of opportunity that allowed them to sell oil as Russia was punished, now if another country with no real political problems can take that role, they are back to square one, so better get rid of this future problemAlso, politically trying to pull a Falkland, but we know how that ended.",

Oil market will be affected by a war depends on how big or small that war is and where it happens.Charted: The World’s Biggest Oil ProducersI think if that invasion happens, there will be some kind of effects on the oil market but not too big. Venezuela is not a too big nation in oil production.QuoteRank   Country   2022 Production(Thousand B/D)   YoY Change   Share ofWorld Supply1   🇺🇸 U.S.   17,770   +6.5%   18.9%2   🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia   12,136   +10.8%   12.9%3   🇷🇺 Russia   11,202   +1.8%   11.9%4   🇨🇦 Canada   5,576   +3.0%   5.9%5   🇮🇶 Iraq   4,520   +10.2%   4.8%6   🇨🇳 China   4,111   +2.9%   4.4%7   🇦🇪 UAE   4,020   +10.4%   4.3%....The point here is not how much is being mined now, but what the potential is. According to the data, the situation looks like this:“In total, proven reserves in Guyana for 2023 are estimated at 11 billion barrels, and oil production has reached 383,000 barrels per day.”Today the global picture is as follows:Place/Country/Oil reserves (billion barrels)1 Venezuela 303.82 Saudi Arabia 258.63 Iran 208.64 Canada 170.35 Iraq 1456 Kuwait 101.57 UAE 97.88 Russia 809 Libya 48.312 US 47.111 billion barrels, of course, not the TOP 10, but a good amount to create quality living conditions in the country.But my question concerned something slightly different - the war that Maduro plans to unleash could negatively affect the region, and in the same way, collapse production in Venezuela. And this is already a significant problem for the market.Understand, those who “pull the strings” of Maduro, they do not need oil in Guyana, they want a conflict, a war, and it would be desirable that because of this there would either be less oil on the market, or it would fall under their control..",

Perhaps the fear of responsibility to his people is so high, because he realizes how many crimes against the people of Venezuela he has committed, so the war, and the attempt to cover himself with it, is his choice. A cowardly and despicable choice.I know one thing - no totalitarian and criminal regime, itself did not leave the \"Olympus of power\", their departure was often accompanied by a sea of blood, and both his people and neighbors. In this case, Maduro turned out to be just a bargaining chip, which will be habitually \"dumped\" by those whom he considers his protector.  As history has shown, agreements and alliances with Russia are a path to degradation and destruction, and Russia is guaranteed not to fulfill its obligations, and will throw its partner into a \"pit of shit\" and will not pull him out of there, implementing its \"projects\". In this case, the goal of the \"project\" is to destabilize the region with the largest volumes of oil, which is guaranteed to affect the oil market, the oil that remains the only source of foreign exchange earnings for Russia. I wish the people of Venezuela to regain their country in their own hands, from the clutches of a totalitarian ruler, to live in prosperity, and in peace with neighbors, and no longer to have partnerships with degenerating and aggressive \"friends\".",

      "body": "It appears that the situation between Venezuela and Guyana continues to escalate and is rapidly heading towards war.On December 3, Venezuela held a controversial referendum in which, according to official data, allegedly 95 percent of citizens were in favor of incorporating Essequibo into their country. Guyanese President Irfaan Ali called the referendum a reason for Venezuela to annex the region.The head of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, following the results of a controversial referendum on the border with neighboring Guyana, declared the western part of this country - Essequibo - the 24th state of Venezuela. At a parliamentary meeting on Tuesday, December 5, he proposed introducing a corresponding bill. In addition, he called on the Venezuelan National Assembly to adopt a law to “protect the disputed territory.” Such actions are very reminiscent of Russia's actions before the invasion of Ukraine. Is it because Madura’s instructors and advisers are really from Russia?Maduro also ordered Venezuela's state oil conglomerate to immediately begin issuing licenses to develop oil, gas and other minerals in resource-rich Essequibo. He gave oil companies operating in the undivided sea three months to wind down operations.https://www.dw.com/ru/maduro-obavil-cast-territorii-gajany-provinciej-venesuely/a-67643745",

There are no roads from Venezuelan border to this region and the only route is through the ocean. This region is so remote, and the population density is less than 1 person per sq.km. Aircraft maybe used by Venezuela, but then with zero knowledge of the terrain it is going to be risky as well. In case of Russo-Ukraine war, Russian forces were able to conquer vast areas in quick time as there is good road connectivity. The situation in Guyana is much different.",
