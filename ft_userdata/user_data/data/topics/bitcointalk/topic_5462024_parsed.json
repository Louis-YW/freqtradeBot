  "content": "What would you do if one day you won the lottery? What are you planning to buy and who do you want to include in your success? There is a seller in the market who if you ask him, he will never be stingy with the money he will win. This is the reason why the luck with which he achieved success withered like a vegetable and disappeared like a bubble. This person is known as a helpful and caring person as he sells vegetables. And when he was making a profit from his sold vegetables, he never lost his mind to bet on the lottery every day for 10 years.yes, you're right after 10 years of patiently betting on the lottery he unexpectedly pulled out the numbers he always bet on the lottery worth around 600k$ more. The joy on his face is indescribable. Because this is an unusual event in his life. In his nature of being helpful and caring for his family, he did not forget to help and reach them with the amount he won in the lottery.After achieving this success, he bought his masion in their province, bought household items, fancy cars and jewelry. In addition to this, because this person has a big helpful heart, he fed the entire market where he used to sell vegetables and said goodbye to the barangay that covers it.But as they say, a kind person is often abused. Because of his kindness, many people came forward and borrowed money. Because he can't say no, he gives the help that is asked of him. And over the years these debts were not paid to him. This caused disappointment and regret in his heart. Although he has goodness in his heart and intentions that are good for others, And this caused him resentment and sadness towards those who did not keep their promises to him.In short, he became a victim of people who were arrogant towards others. And in an instant, his luck gradually disappeared as if he had become a withered vegetable, at the beginning he was happy with his success and the large amount of money he won. But with the passage of time and expenses careless decisions resulted in the loss of his wealth. he had expensive expenses such as buying a mansion house, cars and other properties.He also did not invest or plan properly for his future. Instead of having a proper management of his money he had fun and didn't think deeply. This slightly distressed story again shows importance and responsible handling of money. Winning the lottery is no reason to lose financial self-discipline and proper planning. It is important to have proper planning for the future to avoid. such situations.This is also a reminder that money should be valued, and planned wisely, the loss of his wealth is a lesson that no matter how much we receive can be used up if we do not keep and manage properly. Even though his money was exhausted, something opened his mind in the midst of the hardship he was facing, the remaining apartment he owned. Despite the trials, he had hope to get back up little by little by using his remaining property. Because of the rest of his property, he thought of allocating income and time to repair and rent it so he improved it. Because of his. determination, he gradually entered his rent. He did get sane and responsible tenants who were running a good profit fromin the apartment.These rents provided him with payments for his expenses and payments for his dues and daily needs. Through his apartment he got a source of his income and hope. This is what gave him the strength to persevere in getting up in life. He had a chance to start over and build a foundation for his future.",

Because for sure there will be free loader, all your families and relatives will be at your doorsteps every day. And if you refuse to help, they will say that you are arrogant and because of money, you have change a lot.On the other hand, if you give everyone, then what will be left of you? That's why it's better to just get out of that block and just disappear for good, just saying. Sometimes it is the curse of winning in lottery.QuoteBelieve it or not, statistics show 70% of lottery winners end up broke and a third go on to declare bankruptcy, according to the National Endowment for Financial Education.

      "body": "Sad story! Regardless of how much you earn if it is not well managed it will be mismanaged and become nothing. The first mistake he made was to announce his win to the entire community. Immediately after he did that, people will begin to devise means to defraud him. The next mistake he made was to spend his money on luxury, especially cars and jewelry. These items are not assets because they cannot generate income. The next mistake was to lend money to people without collateral or guarantees. People will feel that he still has more, so there was no need to repay the loan. The world is filled with dishonest people that don't keep their word. Quote from: Mr. Magkaisa on August 04, 2023, 05:48:46 AMThese rents provided him with payments for his expenses and payments for his dues and daily needs. Through his apartment he got a source of his income and hope. This is what gave him the strength to persevere in getting up in life. He had a chance to start over and build a foundation for his future.I appreciate his liberality. Feeding the poor is a good course and the community will always remember his kind gesture. He was also fortunate to own a house that he could rent and get some income to meet his daily needs. It seems real estate is a good business in your area. If he had bought more houses, he won't have lost most of his funds. I am sure he has learned his lessons. With his experience, he will not make the mistake he made before.",

At the very least, we have to prepare our children's lives so that they don't have the same difficulties as we do.The man in the story experiences a mistake by not properly preparing for his future even though he has won money from the lottery jackpot. And even though it's too late to realize his mistake, at least he wants to rise from his slump to be able to survive and start preparing everything for his future so he can be better.",

Seriously, if people had a better grasp on managing their finances, things would be so much smoother. I think the real problem from the start lies in the fact that a bunch of folks, who lack self-control and financial know-how, are the ones playing the lottery and buying most of the tickets. And let's face it, things take a wild turn when these same individuals end up winning big bucks they have no clue how to handle. It's a whole new ballgame then!",

I remember we had topic here when some grandpa was buying each Friday (or each day) a several bucks lottery ticket and selecting same lottery numbers for tens years, and finally hit jackpot. I believe that is not that hard to play lottery daily and use same numbers. The hardest thing is to resist temptation to select different numbers, for lottery company to live that long, and being able to find lottery tickets (in case a person moves on to other country).P.S. I would won 600k$, I would also buy a new house and the rest of the money invested in some kind of business.",

It's not like this, the last asset he had that was an apartment was his last resource to get back up and not go back to being poor. Nice story😊",

He doesn’t need that anymore since he doesn’t have source of income to sustain that kind of life. He can use the money to start his old businesses again but this time he can make it much bigger since he already have capital.
