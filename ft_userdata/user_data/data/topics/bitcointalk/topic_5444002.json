  "content": "Hello everyone.If for example i have 10k in BTC or ETH.I was thinking about this idea what it’s better choice to invest your crypto asset for long term?At this time i now just two options.1. Sell your actual asset for stableCoin or direct Crypto asset put in the staking.and  2. It’s to borrow against your asset StableCoin pay a small stability fee and after some time when you need some additional stableCoin just do Refinance if your asset was growing in price.What do you think about that or I’m completely wrong.For borrowing i want to go with this project.http://gwaysbc.apphttps://twitter.com/gwaysbc/status/1629440953122529280?s=46&t=S8hw9bZl-Lc6Yos0C0ztXghttps://t.me/GwaySBC_Channel_Official",

      "body": "1. It's sound like to good to be true where you will earn fixed amount return because the price of stable coin will stick with $1. But don't forget when you stake your stable coin, it's locked on a centralized pool or site where your coins can be compromised and there's a stable coin where the price didn't stick with $1 e.g. TerraUSD.2. There's no guarantee if BTC or ETH price will increase like your prediction, since Bitcoin super cycle happen for 4 years, you need to wait for 4 years and find a lender who agree to lend his money for 4 years. The conclusion is both of the choice isn't good and it's better if you get a job.",

That 10k worth could be worth 5x to 10x in the future, but if you convert it to stable and use staking youll get 3 to 5% which is below APY. Yes you could earn from it but the rate on which inflation is unbeatable with that. Both still risky since btc could go down and fly but staking stablecoin below inflation rate is like eating with an unimaginary foods.",
