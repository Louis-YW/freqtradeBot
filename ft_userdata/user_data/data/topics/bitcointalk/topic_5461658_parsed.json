I think Sei will give an airdrop to the testnet users as well. If you are checked their tokenomics, you will see there is a section called foundation. So the airdrop coming from that foundation part.

Cant really knew the potential value mate since it will be depend on the farmers budget or staking during launchpool. Maybe try to get in early to be able to join and farm earlier.",

Source : https://twitter.com/Sei_FND/status/1640855848120377344?t=L-U40boJKo3Z6vANPdOy9Q&s=19I wasn't aware of Cyber Connect but they did said about having more seasons. As for Sei, I'm glad about starting to farm them in Blocked.cc and have completed 16 of 18 missions (including Humanode). However, I am not sure if that includes being an officer or ambassador role on Discord though as I only have a Crew role there. Let's just hope that this would finally be worth our time in grinding these Sei missions in Blocked.",

Im staking atom so Im hoping they'll beg giving some nice rewards also for cosmos ecosystem.But now its a wild farming happening on binance. Feel free to stake your bnb and earn free sei tokens.I suggest that use binance earn vault to both farm cyber and sei tokens. But if you want to focus on one token then use the launchpool section.",

Well, I think I may give it a try, how much was your budget on Sei missions? I guess that still using transaction fees as part of the ongoing testnet and just hope it wouldn't have to hurt like the fee on ETH network. I'll wait for your response or maybe your strategy for being early on airdrops.",

Considering the launch price that could do x5 to x10 with the initial token salw of $1.8 each tokens. Possibly if you can farm like 10 to 20 tokens already good profit.

The Sei airdrop is finally confirmed for testnet participants!https://twitter.com/sei_fnd/status/1689722756521205760?s=61&t=6PFitUK4YQvupu3PxlJoIgThe mainnet was scheduled to launch on August 15. 3 big CEXs already confirmed listing the token which are Binance, Bybit and KuCoin. I bet that MEXC would be next.I am speculating that those who have participated in the Atlantic-1 and Atlantic-2 testnet events are eligible for the much-anticipated airdrop as well as those who participated in the incentivized testnet that are more on the developer side. I‚Äôve only participated in the Atlantic-2 but was too late in minting the Sunken Treasure NFT. However, I did grind in Edge Blocked missions and Sei Bridge event. If I only knew Sei back then, I could have maximized Atlantic-1 and may get even bigger rewards. Many Twitter (X) influencers are already speculating about the criteria and the estimated rewards that we get as early testnet participants. As for me I do not expect much rewards. Maybe 4 figures would do, but at least 3 figures in USD I‚Äôll still take it.As long I have participated and interacted before the snapshot, I‚Äôm fine with that and it‚Äôs free money anyways.",
