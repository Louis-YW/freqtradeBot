Obviously it's a wrong decision if anyone have one or two lands and he sell it to invest in Bitcoin. In this forum I have seen many people are investing in Bitcoin by selling Lands, jewelries, by taking bank loans . Always we have to remember that Bitcoin can't ensure you a safe investment every time. Because of its volatility it can go more down and if you invest your rest of all assets you may lose your hard earned funds. Always we should invest in Bitcoin how much we can afford to lose. But if you don't take risk you will not win. That doesn't mean that you invest all your assets in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is still a good investment as it's now much cheaper than it's ATH. So we should make some analysis and invest a decent amount that we can afford to lose.",

If you don't know enough about Bitcoin and are rushing to sell your assets merely to invest in Bitcoin, you're making the wrong decision since you're being dominated by your emotions. In my perspective, there is nothing wrong with selling properties, especially if you have a large number of them left. If you have proper knowledge and a plan, investing in cryptocurrency is a good move.",

Could be that you went far because there goes the what if but the bottom line here is whoever does this thing should carefully think of it before doing so. While you're in at good situation where you've got vast land. Some probably also did this but that's their very land and there's no other back up that they can source out if ever something goes wrong with this decision. IMO, there's nothing wrong into selling or properties or lands or anything you possess as long as you know what you are doing.",

But I personally still don't dare to do something like this because on the one hand I don't have more land to sell in order to make a bigger investment in Bitcoin. But for those who want to try this kind of thing, of course it's good enough if they have more unused or abandoned land.QuoteI am not trying to tell anyone to sell their properties to buy Butcoin, I have more lands that's why I am able to sell for Bitcoin, I think it's wrong having a land or two and sell because of Bitcoin, but if you have more, it's going to worth the risk, nothing grows insanely well like bitcoin does. I also believe that Bitcoin can provide faster growth to those who have bought it cheaply, and that is regardless of what assets they have sacrificed to fulfill their investment in Bitcoin. But as you said it is true that if someone doesn't have more land in their life, it is better not to try to do this kind of thing because the risk is too great if they are not lucky enough to get the return as before. And in this case you have really benefited from the investment you made.QuoteI am excited to see how 2024 and 2025 will play out, tell me, is anyone taking such risks with Bitcoin investment? Do you think I went too far selling something as valuable as lands? You don't go too far for the investment that you have done, because you only sell part of the land to get Bitcoin at a price that you think is very cheap at that time. So what you did was really not wrong because on the other hand you still have more land for you to use and you live there. But I still don't dare to take this kind of risk, especially after seeing Bitcoin which is already at $30K as it is now. And congratulations on achieving this extraordinary profit from Bitcoin in a time that may not be that long for you.",

Both the land and bitcoin when hold are good long term investments although bitcoin has potential to grow more in profit in a shorter period than land it is still a risky investment. Although you have multiple land but I would prefer holding on to land because this is an asset I wouldn’t be comfortable to lose, and the first rule of investing into bitcoin is using money that one can afford to lose. More over land doesn’t have any risk of losing compare to bitcoin.",

Wrong or right about your decision, I think it depends on the situation of the land you have, if the land has the potential to become a sustainable business area, I think it's better than selling.Seeing your situation that has a lot of land, certainly not a problem you sell it and then invest in bitcoin, but if there are people who have only a piece of land, and he lives on the land, I think selling it to invest in bitcoin is a stupid action, though Indeed, I realize Bitcoin has the potential for profit, but if you sacrifice assets for your life it is an action that I mentioned before.",

It all depends on the situation of the person.If you only have one property, you are the owner of it, and you aren't using it to earn money then the appreciation of it would be longer. On the other hand, if you have many properties, selling one, and reinvest it into different asset like Bitcoin for example isn't a wrong decision at all.

Do you think I went too far selling something as valuable as lands? Well, you said already that you have more lands, so I guess this is just a matter or diversifying your assets, and I don't see anything wrong with it.TBH, I don't see why people see it as a bad thing where in fact, OP just did a great job. Selling a part of his land, bought Bitcoin at near it's bottom, and now he nearly doubled his money already in just a matter of months. Some might be saying \"Ohhh land is more valuable than Bitcoin, and appreciates in the long run.\" Well, it doesn't matter because as an investor, you will think of a ways to earn money as quick as possible.To those who are against what OP did, he already said that he has more lands to use, so don't get affected, and say that it was a bad thing. Like what I said, it all depends on the person who did it. The main reason why you are investing is to gain profit, and that's what OP did.",
