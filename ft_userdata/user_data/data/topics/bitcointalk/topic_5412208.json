He is just assuming that Bitcoin will repeat the previous cycle growth percentage to the next year since Bitcoin has a pattern of growth for every 4 years if you will read the Bitcoin chart since day 1. It’s a joke for user that doesn’t understand how TA works and how to use it as guide for future price reference.The OP clearly emphasized the last 8 years data including the 2 cycles happened in every 4 years. It’s very easy to understand on how he come up to that price. This is not a nonsense speculation but rather a prediction based on previous data. There’s a chance that it might happened but there’s no guarantee.",

Aside from professional analysis, Bitcoin has a lot of obstacles to overcome, this is common sense which might take between 2023-2024 to overcome because this year is already gone and inflation is still plaguing it.And surely halving will help Bitcoin in 2024, yet we can't be certain on how much it would. Even if it helps it so much, Bitcoin will likely grow between the maximum of $70-$120K in 1.5 years. It will then slip into a major long-term correction or reversal that will take it another approximately 1.5 years since there is no smooth slope in the market. In view of this, I don't see the feasibility of $240K being hit at all in the next 4 years. This is not magic.Quote from: Lucius on September 03, 2022, 01:26:44 PMQuote from: Nrcewker on September 03, 2022, 01:09:42 PMThis isn’t a joke my friend.

We need more developments both technically and economically before we can know what might happen. At the moment, we see a strong bearish trend on the weekly and monthly charts, which means that there is no hope for any bullish reversal yet. Until these obstacles and more are cleared, especially next year, then we can begin to be more assured of any bullish speculations.",

It's true that the ROI is no longer what it was before, but that's completely understandable given that we are now x100 compared to 2015, which I personally remember well. Still, people expect Bitcoin to perform some new miracle and achieve at least x10 in the next bull run, which is close to what is in the OP - but I would be quite satisfied with x2 compared to the last ATH",

I think this kind of prediction can set a mind conditioning to all traders to extend there goal to that level before they feel fear on trading.You are somewhat correct on your other points. 15× is a quite reasonable expectation, but the goals of traders do not quite determine where the price is headed.
