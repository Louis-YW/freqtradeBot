I have also experience this situation last year, but I just blamed it on my internet service provider. It is Bitcointalk that caused this, as simple as that. You can see in the error image that your browser is working, the connector is working, but the site you are connect to is not working, which is this forum Bitcointalk. This error is common on forums, but Bitcointalk error time is not that long, it take only few minutes which I have experienced before some times on this forum, but not common.",

Yes. This time it was three hours and eight minutes (According to LoyceV) and many of us notice that because of the duration. I did not knew when last time it happened. I didn't knew it happened in April as well. Probably because I wasn't active when it went down. Since it was ~25 minutes (According to TryNinja), a few percentage of people notice that. But Yeah, I assume this is the biggest down in terms of duration.

The other thread is new and this one was created back in April. At first, I did not notice that too because it has only a few replies. So, I thought it was created today. I quoted TryNinja and said it was down for three hours  . He posted that a month ago and I quoted him without noticing the dateQuote from: TryNinja on May 19, 2023, 10:37:05 AMYou're quoting a post I made 1 month ago.This time the forum was down for 3h 30min: https://status.ninjastic.space Look how stupid I am.
