  "content": "I was going through the Services Child board and found that the Yo!Mix Bitcoin Mixer Signature Campaign was Open. As like everyone does I also went through it and found on the Campaign ANN a new initiative. This new initiative as per my knowledge has not be initiated by any other BM other than @Royse777. I think it is tricky but can get good results. Quoting what he wroteQuoteTo prevent AI domination effective from today we are introducing an incentive for forum users. Find AI written posts on this campaign and report to me either in public or in forum PM, please be sure you have enough reference to support the claim. For successful report the reporter will receive the weekly payment instead of the accused campaigner. The campaigner will be removed immediately. I created this thread to know what you guys think about it. Do you feel he/she as in Royse777 will be able to catch those Bounty hunters who are using AI chatbots to earn Bitcoin on a signature campaign managed by him? Will other BMs follow his initiative in the future? I think it is not impossible but can be made possible if someone knows how to find an AI script for a reply or a topic.",

I've read a thread where members were decrying the activities of Al in the forum, and now this action by a CM. Once the Al idea come up on the internet last year I knew there would be many who would want to explore the stuff for negative use.

If all managers make such decisions, everyone who is going to participate in their companies will think a hundred times about whether to trust their posts to ChatGPT or not. In the end, the decision on whether a post was written by a human or a robot will be made by the manager, and accordingly, the participants in his subscription company should make even more efforts, since today's detectors do not always correctly detect even the text written by a person.In any case, I see that ChatGPT can be discoverable, and Royse777's solution encourages everyone to not only write posts but also carefully read what others write.

A sensitive situation may arise when a manager mistakenly withdraws an award or kicks him out of a campaign. It seems that soon we will hear a sea of whining.  In general, this is a good initiative. If there is a ban on the use of AI, then this will stop participants from dishonest posting.

I know reporting is a thankless task, but we really do appreciate it. I know the end result might not be want you want, and there sometimes might be disagreement, and unfortunately a lot of users care a lot about their percentage going down, but I'd rather you get 50% of the reports you made handled, than none at all. Quote from: Lucius on February 11, 2023, 03:16:41 PMHere is the part of your post that one detector says is even 93% fake. For the most part; these detectors are awful, and can't be relied on. There's better one's out there, but still they're too inconsistent. Currently, I'm trying to wrap my own head around it, since I suspect this will continue to be a problem. I know chatGPT are coming out with their own version, which I'd assume will be much better at detecting it. However, I don't really want to rely on that if I can. Some of the texts are pretty easy to decipher, others can be difficult. Straight up identical copies as they're output from the AI itself, can be identified with a decent amount of certainty though. It's when they're changed it makes it difficult or sometimes the AI can be confused what you've asked it, and generate complete gibberish, those are obviously pretty easy to identify. At the moment, it's considering multiple factors, piecing those together, and then ultimately deciding whether it's AI generated or not.",

This is the same logic, since posting AI crap in signature campaigns is cheating, not just spam.Of course, it's harder to catch that with proper proof, hence the bigger the pay.I think though that just reporting the spam - AI generated or not - can have the same effect on long term (if people do report at sight) because mods can still remove those posts (hence the bounty/campaign participants won't get paid). Of course, then the reporters won't get paid. But we can't just have them all  However, indeed, not a bad move for the campaign manager!",
