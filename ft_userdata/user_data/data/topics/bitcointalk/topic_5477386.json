  "content": "Hey, as you all may have known Bitcointalk literally has been around here for over a full decade! That's crazy. With that, there's quite alot of history here. I've been exploring all of these ancient threads through small lists that people make. It's interesting to see how all of these old scam accusation threads were dealing with thousands of bitcoin, which are now millions of dollars, tens of millions, hundreds of millions even. Makes you wonder what happened to the money, and what the people involved with the situations back then think of it now.Now, for the question of this thread. What was the craziest event you have seen here at Bitcointalk or BTC in general? You can link a thread, or describe an event, etc. This can be from before you joined the community tooEdit: Maybe this should have been moved to Meta, looks more appropriate to be there. Anyone know how to do that?",

That's crazy. With that, there's quite alot of history here....The craziest event?Shortly after the peak of the first Bull market (after quickly going from under $1 to over $32.50!) the market was already heading lower, and our \"attackers\" picked the perfect time to strike. A group of people - coming from the site 4Chan - started a thread called \"THE PRICE OF BITCOINS IS CRASHING SELL SELL SELL\", and they were far from finished.As a team, they worked together to bump that thread repeatedly for several hours, and post similar negative topics designed to \"belong\" in quite a few sections of the forum. Every time someone clicked on the \"show unread posts\" list all they saw was a massive wall of negativity during the ~4 hours that Bitcoin was now crashing even harder. They temporarily had a huge influence on this forum, and it made the Bear move much worse that day. Oh well, many people do not ever learn \"Buy low, Sell high\", and back then most of the community was really young, so they were literally scared kids panicking. Did most of them ever \"grow up\" and stop panicking... ...lol?",

I always like the April fools event that's done yearly. It's once in a year and the concepts are always unique. There's always a year for theymos to think of new concepts that can be applied to that event.And, if you're into iconic threads.
