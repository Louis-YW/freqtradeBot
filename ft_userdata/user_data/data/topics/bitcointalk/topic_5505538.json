As of 2016, he said Bitcoin was dead and there was no future for it, well 8 years later here it is, still changing lives and growing strong so he was obviously wrong.He did raise some concerns like network fees and a few other things, but none of those things led to the fact that the \"experiment\" which is Bitcoin has failed. It's true that Bitcoin was created to be a decentralised currency which should be a global means of payment, but things have hindered it aside from network fees. Also, most of the reasons he gave as to why a person won't want to use Bitcoin as a means of payment are false.",

It could be argued that this was the motivation for Mike Hearn, who worked in enterprise blockchain development after quitting Bitcoin. Like Hearn’s scaling proposals for Bitcoin, enterprise blockchain turned out to be a failure.Hearn’s solution for scaling was to simply increase the blocksize, which wasn’t the most effective approach. It didn’t help that these big blockers embraced guys like Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre. The dysfunction and a lack of a competent scaling proposal is why that side failed to change Bitcoin.Currently there are proposals for covenants and rollups, which won’t be a permanent fix, but they do offer considerable improvements in scalability.",

Someday people will find out the hard way that there is on chain Bitcoin and then there is everything else. With a little luck, maybe the folks that support this fundamentally flawed L2 will not live long enough to see its destruction and the pain it causes. Exactly, due to LN developers have stopped seeking solutions on L1 to make it more scalable, right now even if LN was working the L1 congestion wouldn't allow it to function as it should.Bitcoin would be way more scalable if developers focused on L1 instead of promising LN will fix scalability and privacy issues.For proper L2, the L1 needs to be scalable to some degree as well. Bitcoin lacks foundation for proper solution.On top of that we have ordinal spam and devs are still arguing if they should fix the exploitable behavior of datacarriersize limit:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29187Some of them are not even devs but still put a fight against fixing this issue, what a joke.",

But everything is now focusing on investment aspect only. And I believed the policies and of the government is also affect the mass use of bitcoin in the commercial aspect. And I think as it is now. Bitcoin is a commercial commodity or a commercial asset for people to buy and sell. But the main purpose was to use bitcoin to buy things but the opposite is the cause right now, whereby fiat is used to buy bitcoin. And I think that is why Op is asking if bitcoin is for fiat gain. People leaving bitcoin is a people division and they are many factors that can lead to that. And anyone who has tested bitcoin and see the good part of it, will not leave it forever but they will still come back again.",
