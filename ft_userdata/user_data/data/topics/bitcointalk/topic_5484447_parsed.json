Bitcoin is the best investment anyone can put in his money now and be rest assured that in years to come, if he hodls, he has something to secure his future.Â Like I've said In somany other threads, Bitcoin is the only investment compared to any other where you don't need a huge amount of money to start. With as little as 5 to 10 dollars, you can start your investment and accumulate using the dollar cost average. This way, you are certain that no matter the condition of the market you will still invest your said amount.We shouldn't let any thing stop us from investing in Bitcoin as in time, when you see what you have profited from your investment, you will smile and say thank God I had invested.",

As there are a lot of factors and inherit risk.But if you master everything, or at least you have experience the ups and downs of the market itself, you will not regret the struggles early and then the reward of making profits in the future will be fulfilling and there will sense of satisfaction that you made the right decision.",

Even students could save some money from their daily spending and invest in Bitcoin.I think it's getting harder to build a bright future by investing small amount of money in bitcoins because price is already too high to experience exponential rise. Bitcoin was the best investment option for poor people when its price was very low, probably under 1K but another problem here is that those who were poor, didn't have access to the internet.I think that what you say is easier to do for those who live in EU or at least have access to universal healthcare because it will help them in critical situations and holders won't have a need to touch their Bitcoin savings.By the way, transaction fees are so high that it's even harder for poor people to invest right now. I would say that centralized exchanges give you flexibility to invest an euro or two every day and buy some satoshis but exchange withdrawal fees are so high that it's meaningless. You probably have to risk to leave your funds on exchange if you try to frequently buy small quantity of bitcoins.",

Many people, particularly those from low-income families, regret when we can't invest in Bitcoin. It's a pitty most people don't have the opportunity to invest in bitcoin due to poor family background. But I think poverty is not an excuse of not succeeding in life. But rather a challenge to pick up the mantle and do a better thing In life. Some rules need to be changed. Expecially when your parents dont have money, and you are also using it as an excuse. I am from a poor family and I have been striving to find a way to call off that poverty, so I tried many thing but all to no avail until I got the information of this forum and I joined and also learn many things about Bitcoin. Although the campaign I join is small one but the money I get from it I have been using it to invest in Bitcoin and also keeping some for reserve. With the hope I have with my little beginning I believe that my future will be bright someday.Quote from: The Cryptovator on February 07, 2024, 08:26:36 PMThough we can't solve this problem, we can struggle to achieve our goal.

Just as JJG will say it's important to to divide ones income into 3 part. 1 for DCA, 2 for feeding, 3 for reserve or emergency fund or for security purposes incase emergency occur",

One thing that is clear is that, nothing that will be beneficial to you comes that easy, you have to make some sacrifices (hard work, patience) before you can get to achieve your goals sometimes. Making yourself a bit uncomfortable to have an investment in bitcoin is not a bad idea if you look at the bigger picture and what you stand to benefit from it in the future.

The reasons being that; they canât be patient to wait for the long term to get a profit from the investment and some keep procrastinating that they want to buy until it is too late for them and others close to them that have invested will start benefiting from the investment. While many people struggle to invest in bitcoin, some people just donât have the patient or feel lazy to have an investment in bitcoin.",

Most people in my area are not earning enough to cover their basic needs, therefore saving is usually an impossible task. Such a person might consider searching for another high-paying job or getting an additional job so that they could save and invest. Many people have wasted the money they would have used to invest in Bitcoin on luxury materials. These set of people prefer to spend money rather than invest for the future. I always tell some young lads that it is what you invest today can buy you more than what you cannot afford today. They should not be carried away by current trends in fashion, phones, games, travel etc. Others are waiting to have large funds before they invest but they fail to understand that using DCA is one of the best means to invest in Bitcoin at your own pace. Â Although this medium is not very popular or easy, finding a job that pays with Bitcoin is another good means of accumulating Bitcoin. Learning a skill that is needed in the Bitcoin space and getting a Bitcoin-paying job can assist people from low-income families to accumulate.",

If people can start treating investment as a need for those that take their needs seriously, then they can spend more money on that, knowing fully well that not everything that they gather today is supposed to be spent on; some are meant for investment, and if investing in bitcoin can be treated the same way most people treat luxuries, then their lives might never be the same, or they might not go back to trenches as a result of mismanagement.",

Many are fixated and do not want to try harder so that in the end bitcoin is left alone because they feel that this cannot be achieved but with hard work in the end I think everything can still happen.Many of us today are small investors and can only invest from the spare money we use in supporting our daily lives but the fact is that it can still be done so in this case the problem of poverty conditions can indeed be a barrier but we must be able to change that with all the abilities we have because if in the end we do not move and only lament the fate we have then the future will not be able to change.",

This is going to save you a lot but for health concerns like a gym membership, I'd say that it's an important expense that you don't have to sacrifice because that's part of your health maintenance and someone has to allot money on it. And as we desire to invest, we have to adjust with our expenses and also with the wants that we can survive even without having the need of it.To those that struggles and thriving to make ends meet. You all have to keep on going and trying to determine your priorities. It's like spending a couple of bucks for your vices can be sacrificed and allot that into investing Bitcoin. Or, the much better preference as said is to increase and have a more solid source of income. With this, I think that you'll be able to allot with all of things without having the need to sacrifice any of those as long as you know how to budget and can do things accordingly with the budget that's left to you with the amount you earn.",
