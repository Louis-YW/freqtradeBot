It doesn't matter if the world cup gets an official coins they want to used as payment options or endorsed, if Bitcoin isn't receiving any attention, altcoins gets no attention as well or in the case of some hype flowing around then the hype will be short lived because the whole market is in deceasing trend. Assuming the world cup was happening in a bullish period then we would had seens some major pumps in the market especially with projects that are associated with sporting events like football but that's not happening.For now, I'll advise everyone to avoid all altcoins especially those created for just the world cup or associated with it because immediately the world cup ends, those projects will dump as people will no longer see the use of holding those tokens.",

They use the token for the World Cup but I don't see that token related to the World Cup but rather a casino token like the others.If you want to buy it, go ahead but we don't know whether the token will increase or not. But the casino token has to compete with other casino tokens that gamblers have started to recognize and it's not easy.",

      "body": "Why don't you just use the casino site itself that has already popular instead of using token issued by suspicious party that doesn't have good reputation? World cup token was just a shit scam token that will be useless token after world cup will be ended. Owned this piece of shit pretty much the same like you have been fooled by scammers. Why do you make yourself even more complicated with it? I never see any review about that site. Probably a site that has possibility to scam people. World cup token was just hype token that will be only exist for a month. It will not even more than it. It's caused by this token has no purpose rather than become money grabber by stupid people who bought it with their money. The world cup token was actually useless token. The is the truth. It offers nothing.",

Let me know your thoughts   Never heard of this token before and a quick google search doesn't bring a lot of extra information also. I mainly find something about Vega protocol but that seems another coin? I would be very careful investing in Vega Sport and it might boom because of the world cup but it could also do nothing.",

The World Cup will be over soon and this heap of garbage, in the form of fan tokens, will be useless again, especially now it is a very difficult time for cryptocurrency, and various dubious projects are rapidly losing their value. I still believe that fan tokens are needed only for short-term speculation and they have no future in portfolios of investors on longer timeframes. These tokens have no fundamentals, which means no powerful support and usage.",

Just remember that this is just seasonal toke and the world cup will end soon, hopefully by that time you already have profit and sold the token because it will be useless once the world cup is over. I’ve seen some token already made a good pump, maybe you can just look at those token. Personally, I don’t prefer to buy these kind of token, I’d rather place a bet on every games than to buy that token.",

I have no idea if OP and their staff and developers are aware of that.Before launching, there should be a test so that things and buttons will be checked if they're working so that it won't be looking that it's made too quick just to be launched and be on time just as the World Cup.",

Good point here if the token serves a specific purpose and its for event only, its too risky to buy it and hold for long term. You can play short or trade it but not to hold it for long term. There are tokens that are related to football already reached their peak, and I’m sure it will dump sooner or later so if you still have the chance to take profit, do it now. Take the risk if you can afford it, if not then better to place a bet and watch the games.",

The token will be dumped to the bottom once the world cup will have ended. People who bought this kind of tokens were not supporting the team from their nation but they are gambling with the volatility of token. It has low volume and big spread that makes the token become very volatile at this moment.",
