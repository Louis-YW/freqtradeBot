However, after a recent discussion with the OP on the local board, @alani123, there wasn't a thread regarding Greek football teams, except perhaps during nationals, where I remember seeing a few mentions, if I'm not mistaken. It's nice to see that the OP went ahead and created this thread; hopefully it may attract new people to the gambling section and is updated regularly with the new upcoming games.I'm hoping this thread gathers the attention the OP was hoping for, because I wasn't so optimistic about it.",

Truly it's a season of many upsets and the lesser known teams are putting in very good efforts. I think PAOK is bound to rise in the rankings though given how well they performed against Olympiakos.",

Truly it's a season of many upsets and the lesser known teams are putting in very good efforts. I think PAOK is bound to rise in the rankings though given how well they performed against Olympiakos. I was reading about Panathinaikos and doing some research, I dont know much about Greek soccer  .In 2023, they have slowed considerably, but they are still in the running for gold. The \"clover\" was in second place in the competition after 29 rounds, having lost to the first-place AEK in additional indications, while the third-place Olympiacos led by three points. Volos and \"double-headed eagles\" were the opponents in the first two \"dry\" world matches played by Ivan Jovanovich's side in the Champions group. The capital club then traveled to Thessaloniki, where it proved to be more formidable than Aris due to Andraj Sporar's lone precise shot in the 69th minute of play.Dimitris Kourbelis and his associates don't seem as assured as they were in 2022. It will undoubtedly be impossible for the Athens to defeat the \"union\" if they keep losing points. In order for the Clover to win the 21st championship title in team history, it is crucial that they pick up steam once more.Fun fact for me, they are known as \"Greens\"",

Just running from memory I remember OFI sporadically having huge outbursts of great performance, but overall we're just happy for the team to stay in the 1st league without delegation. Panseraikos has had a more adventurous history, being all the way down to league 4 in 2020 but have since reached successive promotions all the way to the first league for this season. Also it's obvious that OFI is having a strong season by the fact that they have won against PAOK, Aris, and AEK which are generally regarded as some of the best and most historical clubs in Greece. Only worrying result OFI had so far was losing to Asteras Tripolis 3 - 0, and Asteras isn't considered one of the best teams. But surely OFI is having a much better year than Panseraikos who will need to improve a lot if they want to remain out of relegation play outs with more certainty. So at these odds I think it's a no brainer to bet for OFI.",

This match day there's no Derby of the eternal enemies as it's called in Greece but we actually have some strong teams against ones lower in the standings.PAOK, AEK and Aris probably are in for easy wins. To me it's a miracle Volos is even int he 1st division.  The stars really had to align for this to happen given that they aren't really that strong of a team.So I like the odds betting on Aris to win here. Another bet I like is over 1.75 on OFI vs. Pas GianninaBoth teams have been investing a lot in offense but OFI especially judging from the last match even with my prediction above (lol) doesn't do well in defense lately! But also OFI had scored some wins against bigger teams earlier on so a score above 2 goals seems likely.",

The odds don't give a high return in these bets as a win for the bigger teams seems kinda predictable but hey, it's ok to go with some of the more secure bets from time to time. For those that would like some more rewarding odds:The match of Olympiacos going against Asteras Tripolis seems to be more rewarding. Of course I would be going for an Olympiacos win. But the odds seem favorable especially given that Olympiacos is narowly second in the league and generally considered the strongest team in the country. It's probably not the team's best season but they could surely win against Asteras Tripolis...",

Seems like this year's super league teams are investing a lot in offense and it's paying out for the bigger teams. The match between PAOK and Panetolikos surely was the most interesting as both teams scored. With Panetolikos even having scored first!For being a lesser known team Panetolikos surely put out a good match and it sure as hell was an interesting match with the smaller team scoring first only to lose later. With all goals being in the first half too! But in the end the expected result came so if anyone took the bet they would have won. I'd love to see if anyone caught that.   I hope you're enjoying the profits",

I expect at least some interesting play in the Aris - Panathinaikos match as it's probably the biggest match up in this particular match day. But the rest of the matches are not between two big teams. So perhaps most people would consider them predictable, unless an upset is to take place. I'm eager to see if anyone has some predictions to make. For now I'll only say that I'm rooting for my local team, OFI. OFI had some good wins this season against bigger clubs and is higher in the standings but hasn't been performing that well lately. The odds aren't bad though, I'd take this bet.

Already disappointing enough to see them not win, no need to lose money on it also. 🤣So let's see the matches for this match day that remain. I really believe Panathinaikos is favored to win today. Yes they lost some matches recently but I don't think this is representative of the Greek league as Aris overall this season isn't close to competing. The odds are very good so I think this is a good bet to go in hoping for a win. Good luck to all!!🤞",

Good call; it's tempting to make a bet myself too; all three matchups you pointed out are pretty uneven, and there's a decent chance you'll win. Olympiakos against Volos? It seems like a walk in the park, to be honest. PAOK, in opposition to Lamia, also seems like a sure win. Panathinaikos against OFI isn't as uneven as the other two, but still, the scales are tipping towards Panathinaikos for sure, even though, judging by your previous posts, you support OFI.

I mean yes, it's my team but when it comes to money you've gotta win sometimes  So judging by past performance, I'm really betting against my team now. As of Aris' matchup with AEK... Well it's a tough one. AEK is performing very well on the local league, but did not do so well in Europa League. That's pretty much also true for all Greek teams in Europa League also but the difference here is that Aris won their previous match against Panathinaikos, who currently ranks first! While that was surely an upset, Aris surely proved that they have some good underdog strength this season. They'd have their chances for a win against AEK maybe so it's not that certain of a bet when betting for a win for me.",

I was expecting a boring match with just a goal or two scored by Olympiacos but the end result was very different:Olympiacos even got 3 yellow cards... And managed to only end up in a tie even with Volos missing a penalty. Probably the game ended up in a tie just because Volos scored an own goal!? Olympiacos didn't even score for the entire match after 54'. To be fair though a goal of Olympiacos was canceled after a VAR. I wonder how different platforms would treat a canceled goal.
