We are in a period were there is inflation, high cost of power and fuel and everybody including manufacturers are also feeling the pains. The best thing to do for now is to seek for cheaper alternative of any product you consume. My children are now consuming locally produced food instead of expensive company manufactured baby-food/cereals.I had to move out of my bigger accommodation to a smaller place because I could no longer comfortably afford it.

Maybe a few of these merchants actually produces what they sell but, looking at the raw materials and the fact that, they've got to buy other products for them to use. They've got to get there price right and that means, selling at a profit that would allow them not just to refill but to he able to purchase other goods.At times you just don't blame them, there is inflation everywhere and this could be the work of bad governance. Buy what you can for a price that you gives you peace or go for an alternative.",

Limiting your expenses and living within a budget are more ideal, you should not spend beyond your means especially on a situation like this. We’re also renting and our landlord already gave some consideration with regards our terms.",

There’s no wrong actually if you ask for a lower price, but never ask from small stall owners or entrepreneurs because obviously, they are also feeling the inflation that you are feeling too. It’s okay for those big time business owners but for the small ones, it’s their only means for survival so always be reasonable enough. Ask for cheaper prices sometimes, but never do it all the time.",

The only way to fight inflation and this crisis is to create multiple source of income and live within your budget. Better not to buy any expensive things for now and just focus for your needs, worst recession is yet to come so be ready for that.",

I'm not saying haggling is bad, but you have to understand that those same owners are going through the same crisis as we are. If we buy a loaf for 2 dollars, they will also buy a loaf for 2 dollars, if everyone is asking for a discount like you, the seller will lose a lot. The solution in this inflationary period in my opinion is nothing better than trying to work part-time, save a part, don't spend unnecessary things and if possible find yourself an investment.",

It's not at all times that the merchant or businessman will grant your request for a bargain.There's a consideration for the cost of operation and capital for those products and services that they're offering.
