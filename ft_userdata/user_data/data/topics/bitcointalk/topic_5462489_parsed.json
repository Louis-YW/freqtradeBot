  "content": "Hello,I'd like to share my experience with the Website Flip.gg.Its a solana based crypto casino where you can open cases and such.I started to advertise for Flip.gg.I collected a total of 13 Referrals within the first 3 weeks. One of them actually deposited and played a bit (~5000$)Yesterday I was curious to see if there's any new referral but to my suprise I only had 12 Rerferrals left.The one who deposited was deleted...It means only one thing: The website is determed to fail.Conclusion:Do not advertise for Flip.gg, they will simply delete your good referrals.",

      "body": "I never knew there was some kind of referral system active on this web3 casino since there is no means of registration rather than the user being required to connect to the Casino using their preferred wallet under the supported chain, so on such a process, how do you even generate some referral links and refer your friends to join using the referral link you provided?If it was actually possible, then you can easily identify those you refer through block explorer, as there will be some valid transaction approval during their wager and withdrawal if they win of any kind, so you can contact their support and make sure to arrange all your valid proof that the said user actually registered and made some deposit.Â There could also be some possibility that the system detected that you referred yourself and made the $5,000 deposit in order to get the referral benefit. I can recall a similar case where the accuser was a victim of trying to cheat the referral system but was cut off in the act, as such actions could also lead to the referral being removed from your list of successful invitees.",

You're right, a completely transparent platform for referral program will provide a list of earnings per referral. On the other hand they have a series of eligibility requirements for you to get the referral bonus. I only fell on the suspicion that the OP's case was caused by a violation or ban on the referral side.If the OP wants to investigate further, the first question should be put to the deleted referral about \"what happened to his account\" instead of blaming the casino first.",

As long as the user gets paid for 12 Rerferrals and gets a new Rerferral, it is related to the referral account, not his account, or that the platform is scam.In general, I hope that we will get a detailed answer from him. It seems from his last reply that he is an expert in rerferrals, and therefore this case may be more complicated than we imagine but this is still far fro scamming according to current information.",

      "body": "As I've said I am a longterm advertiser for all kind of crypto casinos and I made 6 figures from affiliate commission so far.I got special deals with most of them, meaning I get more commission then a normal user would due to my referral numbers.The balant scam by deleting a referral who deposited is explained pretty simple:- I deposited 100$ on flip.gg to test the website (As I do with every website I list) and actually won 500$, was able to withdraw immidiately.- The referral who deposited came 2 days later and gave me ~3$ of commission from his 6000$ wager.- The admin of flip.gg then decided to delete that referral due to my winning earlier.I think that is the exact reason why the referral was deleted. The admin felt some kind of unfairness by me winning and collecting commission at the same time.The script they use doesn't have any mechanic nor detection of anything suspicious, hence why I dont think its a rule violation thing.You basically don't have any rules and there are no sportbets which can be abused of some sort, so you really cant violate anything.I even know the developer of the script and I've talked to him aswell.The only reason would be if the referral was me myself and I was giving myself commission.They had to open the database, search for my referrals and delete them manually from my affiliates.After all this I am not able to trust Flip.gg anymore - How can I know they not simply delete referrals from me again in the future?I simply can't. You have to have some sort of trust with the platform you advertise for.Thats why I also want to warn anyone else to not put any effort, time or money for advertisement into the platform mentioned above.",
