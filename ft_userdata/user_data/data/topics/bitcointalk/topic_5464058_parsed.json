Why would I post a topic about it if I had it?P2 and p3 result in different keys when added and subtracted with each other, but when we add p1 and p2, we get p3. In other words when we have 2 and 3, addition and subtraction has only 2 results, 2 + 3 = 5, or 2 - 3 = 1,  I have 2 and 3 but there are 3 answers/results, I wanna know what is it.
