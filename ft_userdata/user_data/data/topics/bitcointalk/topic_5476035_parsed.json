  "content": "For once this topic is not going to be a topic of a member complaining about a moderator, but of a moderator complaining about the members of his section.I could have written this topic in the Staff section, but fearing the lack of answers and finding the subject interesting to get as many opinions as possible, I'm posting it here.A few reminders :I'm too lazy to find the exact quote, but Theymos said \"the aim of this forum is to be as free as possible\".Free of speeeech.Voltaire: \"I don't agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for you to have the right to say it.\"I agree with all that. And I was trying to moderate as best I could with all these parameters.Current context :Since 7/10, the world has fallen further into madness. User A : a member who has become radicalized and is absolutely against immigration to Europe and can be described as islamophobic. Of course he's a supporter of Israel and its actions.User B : a negationist member who sees Jewish lobbies everywhere. Of course he's anti-Israel.User C : an openly zionist member who can't even write the word god (he would write g.d) User D : a troll alt account that only gives links to extreme right-wing sites that list violent acts committed by arabs or africans.Mix it all up and let them do for 28 pages in a single topic. Imagine the carnage. Because yes, I have decided not to moderate this topic, or very little. But this morning you wake up with your head up your ass and see :Quote from: User C[...]on october 7, the amalekites killed approximately 0.1% of the world's jews. to restore the balance, 0.1% of the world's mahometans must be killed.g.d's law is clear, the sources are multiple :exodus 21:23 to 25 : כְּוִיָּה֙ תַּ֣חַת כְּוִיָּ֔ה פֶּ֖צַע תַּ֣חַת פָּ֑צַע חַבּוּרָ֕ה תַּ֖חַת חַבּוּרָֽה עַ֚יִן תַּ֣חַת עַ֔יִן שֵׁ֖ן תַּ֣חַת שֵׁ֑ן יָ֚ד תַּ֣חַת יָ֔ד רֶ֖גֶל תַּ֥חַת רָֽגֶל וְאִם־אָסֹ֖ון יִהְיֶ֑ה וְנָתַתָּ֥ה נֶ֖פֶשׁ תַּ֥חַת נָֽפֶשׁleviticus 24:19 and 20 :  בֶר תַּ֣חַת שֶׁ֔בֶר עַ֚יִן תַּ֣חַת עַ֔יִן שֵׁ֖ן תַּ֣חַת שֵׁ֑ן כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר יִתֵּ֥ן מוּם֙ בָּֽאָדָ֔ם כֵּ֖ן יִנָּ֥תֶן בֹּֽו וְאִ֕ישׁ כִּֽי־יִתֵּ֥ן מ֖וּם בַּעֲמִיתֹ֑ו כַּאֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֔ה כֵּ֖ן יֵעָ֥שֶׂה לֹּֽוdeuteronomy 19:21 : וְלֹ֥א תָחֹ֖וס עֵינֶ֑ךָ נֶ֣פֶשׁ בְּנֶ֗פֶשׁ עַ֤יִן בְּעַ֙יִן֙ שֵׁ֣ן בְּשֵׁ֔ן יָ֥ד בְּיָ֖ד רֶ֥גֶל בְּרָֽגֶלI'll leave the calculations to those who are interested, but we're still a long way off.Quote from: User D[...]AnywayCollecting organs from palestinians is called recycling for the environment. It's good for the planet.I give you access to my account for 5 minutes. What would you do ?Are there no limits to everything, even here on Bitcointalk ? (To be clear, I'm not jewish or muslim. I don't believe in any god. I deeply believe that we would live better without religions, but that's not the debate of this topic.)Edit : I can't ban an account directly.The topic in question is already in the off-topic section.",

      "body": "I can be wrong but I think those posts are not necessarily deleted. Moving that thread to Off-topic and lock it.I think so because I see those posts are toxic but very general and moderators can handle those posts similarly like doxes. It is general and you can find it in many places on Internet but if it aims at a specific person, those posts must be deleted and those posters must be banned.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PMQ: What about deleting DOXes?A: Nope, we don't delete them either as long as they comply with the following rules: Quote from: theymos on August 05, 2016, 04:23:54 AM<...>1. Personal information must be confined to the new \"investigations\" board (under Scam Accusations), which is only visible to Members and above. Personal information is defined as anything which links a user's online identity (username, email, etc.) to their meatspace identity, excluding links that the person himself has posted. It is not allowed to post somebody's personal information in any other public place, including in signatures.2. It is not allowed to post someone's dox if it is especially obvious that you're just using the dox as a weapon. For example, if there are no remotely-plausible trade complaints, then the person can't be a scammer, and their dox should not be posted.3. As before, anything that the legacy insecure government/banking system requires to be secret is not allowed anywhere. This includes social security numbers, credit card numbers, and certain account numbers.<...>Why aren't they deleted? Because such doxing is just compiling information about a user already available publicly, often via search engines.",

Bitcointalk is an old-fashioned forum where the only people typing this kind of stuff are the ones who've already been raised like that.

This is disgusting and should be controlled by the mods regardless of what has been spoken by Theymos. There should line within that freedom that should not be crossed. Of course, everyone should be allowed to have a discussion but when it goes into the negative zone a limit should be applied to stop it from going further. I feel such discussions are way out of human morality and should not be allowed or encouraged in the forum. A mods job is to stop such kind of shit discussion before it reaches a stage when personalization or pointing fingers starts based on religion. I do feel being in a forum that was meant to uplift the lifestyle of those struggling financially the objective of discussion should not be hatred based on religion but on financial upliftment.",

You did the right thing, even if the forum has given us the freedom speech but we should not use that feature for spreading hate speech. World is full of religions, I am Muslim and religious person, I support Palestine. But still these words are so rude and harsh.I am not a moderator, I don't know the rules, and what rules you guys have to follow but what I know is you have the right to remove there topics or any topic that is spreading hatred, if any don't like my support for Palestine or like me as Muslim then I can't do anything with it and it is freedom of speech, but if I starts to talk shit about other party's childern and started to disrespect them then that's bad for me, we are human but things are just getting out of hands for everyone (not talking about me).
