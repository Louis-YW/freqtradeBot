  "content": "If you are interested in this sort of thing; particularly with smaller \"local\" books run by a group of people (ex. you have accounts, know someone who can get accounts, part of a group etc) then PM me.If the sites have a live framework that is even better.I do this already with several groups and we partner on the overall profit (I share in any losses from bets my apps / algos place). A lot of these group-run books use crypto so happy to pay/get paid that way.",

You may need to be more elaborate on your content so that we can easily understand you more confusing is the mentioned app.",

      "body": "Apologies; to be more specific:I develop bots that compare lines between books and place advantageous bets. This is more easily achieved with smaller books run by a group of individuals as the lines donâ€™t update as frequently but also possible with others. It is also possible with live betting and is something I specialize in. There is a platform called EZLive on a lot of these smaller books that is especially suited for this sort of thing. Anything more specific than that happy to provide just PM.As an example if someone here had an account with a local bookie with a website and wanted to get some advantageous bets (sharp) in then partnering with me would be an option.",
