  "content": "Since I've seen that everybody comes up \"knowing better\" what this forum may be needing, I'll try my shot too.I feel like the forum could use one more mod in the Dev&Tech sub. I have a feeling that the current mods, although highly technical, don't really have the time do \"house cleaning\".I know that in most of the cases there's not so much garbage there, I also know that global mods may look in there now and then, but lately I've noticed that at least this topic got derailed pretty bad and I guess that some \"kicks\" here and there would be useful.... or would somebody just take the patience and report a bunch of posts? Would be that enough?",

I disagree with @nullius opinion, but his post shouldn't be deleted, just the whole drama posts only should be deleted. I will report some of the posts that I think only discuss about a drama or attacking each other without adding substantial value to the @OP.",

Look at the mess of the Bitcoin Discussion, Project Development, Politics & Society boards. There's uncontrolled spam, especially in the last one.Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 04, 2022, 02:15:06 PM... or would somebody just take the patience and report a bunch of posts? Would be that enough?Reporting isn't enough. There have to be more people responsible for acting accordingly to the reports.

      "body": "The thread Op pointed to is a good one, started in a good fate, recieved good number of merits but was hijacked or derailed at the tail end. It is not peculiar to that topic on div board only, I have seen it happen in some threads and boards.In my opinion and if I were to be a moderator, I will not be so swift to lock a thread or delete posts in a such a thread. I will give time for every party to express their opinions and feelings before I would do what Achow101 did. I believe moderators most times deliberately allow things to play out in order to preserve liberty or freedom. Because if some arguments or trolls are interrupted, the aggrieved would find a way to re-start it in another thread thereby spreading the troll. It is therefore good to allow stirs exhaust and settle in the particular thread it originated from.If you grossly do not agree with someone's opinion, ignore them, but if you cannot, then tag them and maybe your matter would be brought to reputation to be judged, you may end up being removed from DT for trust abuse.",

Would be that enough?I'm not sure if this would take a rule change or not to try to get rid of those posts. Because it's highlighted in this case they might be removed but if they're reported normally i don't think mods would do anything since the topic is locked.It'd be worth a mod splitting the topic at the point it was derailed and just trashing the bit after the split imo (but to also do this to new topics after a mod has seen it).",

(Thank you @achow101)Imho one conclusion is that the forum may need some more mods get hired.And the main conclusion is that there's not much that will change. Well, it's like in all \"bitcointalk needs\" cases I guess I can lock this topic. Thank you all for the input.",
