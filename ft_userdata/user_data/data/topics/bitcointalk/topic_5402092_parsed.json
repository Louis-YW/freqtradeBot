If today we know the in-depth knowledge of bitcoin and its intrinsic property, there wouldn't be shitcoins on market cap, believe me, when I say this, it is the lack of knowledge they suffer from that's why you see them shouting Buy Shiba, Buy doge, Buy baby $h*t, and somebody will just use his paycheck to buy the nonsense tokens and think they have invested in the right projects.",

You don't need to be the next Einstein or even know the ins, and outs of it. You just need a good enough understanding to know why it'll be successful, how to use it, and how to secure it. Those things should be enough to convince you that even with blips in the road, you'll have the confidence that it will recover. I consider Bitcoin really unique, since it's the only investment I have absolute faith in. No other investment do I have the level of confidence in. That comes with its own risks, and ultimately I might be wrong. However, confidence really does help you when the market takes a downward trend. Now, don't get it wrong that confidence doesn't come from nothing, it comes from having enough knowledge to know why Bitcoin will be successful, and most blips will just be that, bumps in the road. Unless, something truly significant happened, Bitcoin should continue to rise in the near future. There's likely a ceiling, but no one truly knows what that might be. Also, depends on the technology, and concepts that come out in the next few years, we could see something that ultimately improves Bitcoin, whether or not that means it gets integrated or coincides with Bitcoin.",
