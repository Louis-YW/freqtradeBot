  "content": "Evolution — report for Q3 and the period from January to September 2023Q3 results (3 quarters of 2023):1. Operating revenue — +19.6% (452.6M EUR);2. EBITDA — +22.1% (318.6M EUR);3. Net profit for the period amounted to EUR 272.8M (Q2 — EUR 221.3M).Results from January to September 2023:1. Operating income +26.1% (1.3B EUR);2. EBITDA +27.6% (930.5B EUR);3. Net profit — EUR 788M (similar period last year EUR 619.9M).Evolution shows, maybe not spectacular, but quite stable results. The CEO of the company claims that in Q3 the company released more games than ever. At the same time, the most confident growth is shown by Live products. Also, according to him, the US online gambling market is still at an early stage of development, and the company will continue to invest a significant amount of funds in it in order to occupy a leading position there in a few years.I have question - how do they make that much money if their games are fair? Their profit per month is 73.7666667M, le'ts imagine this is 20% of total comission...And it's shocking. Don't they suppose to have negative months, or years? Like operators have? I mean, all of this videos of their rigged game shows, blackjacks...I'm about to think that all of them are true",

I mean, all of this videos of their rigged game shows, blackjacks...I'm about to think that all of them are trueThey are the most popular live casino and they are available in literally every sportsbook that exists. I'm sure, since the pandemic their revenue must have skyrocketed as its a lot more accessible than a real casino and anyways, most casino's were closed during the pandemic or had a very limited access. They don't really need to rig their games to profit as you know \"house always wins\". A lot of user funds are being liquidated into games at the same time. As they have commission for every game that exists, from about 5% to 20% or even more for slots?. As long as users stay active on the casino, they should theoritically always profit. Other than a few freak instances, for which, the casinos have failsafe(to an extent). If a user is winning a lot, most casinos will just shut doors to the user or even confiscate funds if they find anything even remotely fishy. Ofcourse, rigging games would help to profit much larger than what would be otherwise possible but if could get very obvious if the total amount gambled on the casino and their revenue are transparent to gaming commission.",

This. I fully agree, you don't have play unfair to earn lots of money in gambling. Besides, they are one of the leading live gaming stream providers I guess. And yes, the house always wins that's pure math, so I can't see the way they can record losses.",

      "body": "It's pretty easy to see why they make so much based off the games they offer. For example, go look at blackjack and their rules. They are not like a normal casino who checks the down card, hidden blackjack is possible. They also don't offer certain things that live casinos might like even money. If you have a BJ and the dealer is showing an A you can take even money instead of hoping the dealer doesn't have a 10 card down. Just all sort of little things that give the casino a huge advantage over the player, not to mention people play the game terribly. I sit and watch people stand on 14 and 15 vs a 10 all the time. All they are doing is saying, \"here, take my money\".Now look at games like crazy time. 8 betting options with different amounts of winning spaces per option. If someone sits back and just bets the bonuses every round, they will lose their ass so fast as when bonuses hit they normally pay trash. So I play 10 rounds betting $1 on 4 different bonuses. That's $4 per round and $40 over the 10 rounds. Let's say I hit coin flip and in the coin flip bonus we get a x10. I get $11 back and a net loss of $29. What it boils down to is gamblers are dumb as hell for choosing to play on evolution or at least some of the gambling options they offer. All the wheel games are a scam IMO. I have witnessed many times a player go on a hot streak in blackjack and walk away with a profit. It's just the odds are against you.",

The casino of cos, many people are not even thinking and that's a shame, you the gambler is the one at risk, placing bet on the future prediction, either in slots or sports bets, but what risk is there for the house? That you might win? Ok accepted, but do you know how many gamblers visits the casino per day? The number is big, and where there is large number of people is where real money can be made. A hundred thousand gambler risking $1 per day is still 100k in one day and it's impossible for all of them to win, like this is just natural, they are placing bets on something they can't see, this is why I consider gambling to be very risky. Tell me, how won't the casinos get rich? They will be rich in no time, this is the fastest way to get rich if you can do it right, casinos that failed lack so much or they never meant business thats why they failed, if you want to get rich build a casino and deliver the best service, you will see how money flows in, I don't doubt casinos, they make money.",

Casinos love to add their games on their sites and players also love to spend time on those live games. I don't think that they have any good competitors at this moment and that's why they are having a lot of profits each month. There is a competitor in market named as SuperSpade Games but they aren't as famous and as adopted by the casinos as Evolution gaming. However, I'm quite sure that in future they may have strong competitors which may reduce their revenue  but till then they will earn like kings and no-one will be able to stop them as most casinos are happy with their games.",

That's why it's very important to take a good look at the source of this data and how many reputable companies carried out audits on this company and what the final report was so we can know to what extent they are telling the truth. In my opinion I don't believe them until I see the sources of the data",

I was working in Evolution, formerly Evolution Gaming and I can confirm, none of their game is rigged. Absolutely every action is performed by humans, they hire shufflers that shuffle card in live and dealers deal with that card. Dealers also play roulette in life, they take ball, spin wheel and roll the ball. But their house edge is very high, think about it, that's why casinos profit and hire their tables. Dealer is the last one who makes choice, that's why they always win. If you lose and then dealer opens cards and she loses too, you hand is still lost.

Being moderator on one of the micro tasking site I can confirm that these numbers are easy to earn if you have proper planning, marketing road map and most importantly huge crowd to target. Any website that has embedding structure where their wall can be integrated with other sites has easy access to their clients. In this case it’s obvious that Evolution only have to target the premium entities that have good number of crowd. Crazy Money.",
