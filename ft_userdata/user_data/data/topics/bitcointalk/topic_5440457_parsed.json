If your card is 8 GB you can go ahead and mine ETHW+ZIL.I believe in ETHW as one of the main coins trying to substitute ETH (of course far from achieving it but it is a very new coin) and also ZIL is a great add on to add to your crypto portfolio.You won't be having the highest profitability as of yet but in the longer term this is the best that card can do,if you have a 4 GB card then you can't mine ETHW+ZIL as the DAG cache is over 5 GB right now but you can still mine ETC+ZIL which is the second best thing to do if you are in for the longer run.If you just want a quick buck follow the above advice of mining the most profitable coins for the moment.",
