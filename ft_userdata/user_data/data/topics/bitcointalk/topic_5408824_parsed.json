You have to create a proper cold wallet offline and send the funds from the hot wallet to the cold wallet.Edit: typo/correction",

It won't ever be called cold storage you should generate an offline wallet in the laptop/macbook that is no internet connection in the first place and only a master public key is what you need to bring outside from your cold storage and import it to a device that is connected to the internet to monitor your wallet balances and to create unsign raw transaction.",

I think it's the latter. But it doesn't change much since in both cases the wallet was created on an online device and you, simply, can't turn a hot wallet into a cold storage wallet.OP, is there any reason why you need to keep using the same seed/private keys? If. It's because you are expecting to receive more funds on the old wallet, then the only thing you can do is to contact all those who have your old addresses and update them with the new ones (from the cold wallet). In the meantime, keep monitoring your old wallet and manually transfer any coins it receives to the cold wallet.",

In the meantime, keep monitoring your old wallet and manually transfer any coins it receives to the cold wallet. OP can still keep backups of his old wallets. And as has been said many times in the past, there is no reason to delete and get rid of old wallets and seeds. You never know when someone might send some funds to such a wallet, but you destroyed its recovery phrase. OP can check his old wallet from time to time to see if there are any new incoming transactions. He can even create a watch-only wallet using the master public key from his old wallet and check what is going on on his phone or online machine.",
