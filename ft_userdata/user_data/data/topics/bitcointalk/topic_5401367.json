Maybe, he announced this to his close friends or colleagues first, so they mined those few days before publicly announcing this project. Anyway, the project is another meme coin. So it is up to the user if he will put some resources into this like mining this coin and hope that one day, it will get listed in at least 1 exchange. But if you want certainty, better go to established networks. We always have our option not to get involve, if you feel you are just wasting your time. This is the good thing in crypto, you can always choose the project you want to support with. And it is your own picking where you would want to divert your resources to.",
