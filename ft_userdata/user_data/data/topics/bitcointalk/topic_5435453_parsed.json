Do you see lengthy topics as valuable than non lengthy ones?This is a simple poll created and with the response gotten here, people that are in the habit of dropping this kind of  links  will stop because I hardly click it unless from a trusted user, else I'll first try to quote it to reveal the url.So, this topic is worth it, just like the topic asking how many bitcointalk users real name you know.",

I always check the links that users provide on the forum, either by quoting them so that the link becomes visible or by opening it in another browser that is not associated with the forum.By the way, just today there was a discussion about how you can steal browser passwords by clicking on a fake link. Is everyone sure where they clicked? https://www.doyler.net/security-not-included/xss-password-stealing",

When I am going to insert the link as reference, it looks fancy and reliable to see the whole URL especially, if I will get it in other website. When it comes to mentioning names or topic here in bitcointalk, I think it is better if we use the hidden url tag especially if we are using the link inside of the forum, they are all quiet similar with each other. Just like this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434579.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5433658.0It is more catchy to use hidden url tag. Since you know what you are clicking on. scammers use too much brain",

Simply because it's not very convenient to post it in other ways. Though, I must admit that even when I'm on PC, I post naked links without hidden url links because I'm just lazy...When it comes to reading, for me most convenient is hidden url links. Though, it have one downside that you don't know what's is behind it without clicking or quoting it.When it comes to [1], when I see it used on Bitcointalk I feel like reading Wikipedia or some scientific article from university.",
