  "content": "Some bullish news, BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink sees Bitcoin as a good opportunity and wants to \"democratize crypto\". After having their initial ETF application rejected (apparently for trivial reasons) they re-filed it recently.BlackRock Wants to Make It Cheaper to Trade Bitcoin, Larry Fink Sayshttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/blackrock-wants-to-make-it-cheaper-to-trade-bitcoin-fink-saysQuoteBlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink called Bitcoin an “international asset” and said the money manager wants to use its heft to make it less expensive and easier to invest in the cryptocurrency.“It costs a lot of money right now to transact Bitcoin,” Fink said Wednesday in an interview on Fox Business. “We hope our regulators look at these filings as a way to democratize crypto.”The money management giant filed paperwork last month to set up an exchange-traded fund that invests directly in Bitcoin, which prompted a flurry of similar applications from rival issuers and a rally in Bitcoin’s price to more than $30,000. Bitcoin rose more than 12% in June alone and is up more than 80% year-to-date....ps. they seemed to intend to subscribe-wall this article but I can read it fine, and hope you are too.",

So it makes sense that they will invest in one of the best financial breakthroughs in the last 20 years. Yes, Bitcoin investments are high risk, but if you have a diversified and balanced portfolio, then you can manage the risk. I think the SEC are stalling the decision to approve their application, because they want to see what happens in the next election.",

      "body": "It's definitely good news when you see a company like BlackRock (or even say, Vanguard) wanting to make it cheaper/easier for people to get BTC. BlackRock is one of the largest investment firms in the States and has their hands in EVERYTHING! If that kind of company could make trading cheaper and acquisition easier then they're big enough to bring in some very big investors (companies that spend massive amounts of money)..",

If that kind of company could make trading cheaper and acquisition easier then they're big enough to bring in some very big investors (companies that spend massive amounts of money)..BlackRock is not just \"one of the largest\", they're THE largest, and not only in the US, but in the world. Vanguard is the 2nd largest and is not very far behind.Both are absolute giants and the amounts of assets they manage each exceed the GDP of the vast majority of the countries.For that reason, many are concerned if it's indeed good news if they end up dominating Bitcoin market. But there's not much anyone can do about it anyway.",
