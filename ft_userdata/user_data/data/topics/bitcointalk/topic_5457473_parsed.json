  "content": "This fight is for the vacant IBF Middleweight title both fighters are undefeated but relatively not popular in the boxing community, but because this is a higher-level weight category whoever wins in this fight will become popular and may challenge those popular names and champions like Canelo This fight is a week away hopefully we can broadcast it here on a free live feed because when two undefeated boxers fight in the heavier category expect a lot of action and possible knockouts.I have Falcao winning by knockout because he is the one with the power having accumulated a 63% knockout ratio and Gualtieri never fought outside Germany.So who have you got in this fight?Esquiva Falcao vs Vincenzo Gualtieri vacant title fight set for July 1st in GermanyEsquiva Falcao boxing highlightsVincenzo Gualtieri boxing highlightImages from: box.live",

I just want to know if the odds for ML are good/even as one Gualteri will be fighting in his hometown but the better boxer is Falcao.",

I just want to know if the odds for ML are good/even as one Gualteri will be fighting in his hometown but the better boxer is Falcao.Yeah, just sad to say that this is not well known fighter at 160 lbs because Jermall Charlo has dominated his division for so long.Nevertheless he will be fighting Canelo so I guess the middleweight might be open again and this two boxers are going to get the vacant IBF belt.Unfortunately, I also check one of my favorite sport bookies and they haven't listed the fight as obviously as we have, not known fighters. But maybe as the fight gets closer, they will list this fight and hopefully even the ML might be worth to bet with.",

This fight will gonna get exciting since they won't be going to give up each other clean records easily. This kind of fight is what makes boxing interesting because from now on, they gonna need to work harder because whoever wins will face a more strong opponent and will gonna have more storm facing against him, and when he beats all of them, he will gonna be one of the legendary boxers.",

Initial odds are released on my favorites bookies but it's only the ML for now and the homeboy is the huge underdog in this match.What's interesting that i saw on the tale of the tape is that the \"pro-boxing rounds\" is almost even despite the disparity of their matches, i mean there's a 10 fight gap between the two, that's because Falcao got more knockouts but the thing is those boxing rounds might play a role and a factor that might work on Gualtieri advantage. For now, i will be waiting for more betting options as \"Gualtieri by decision\" might be juicy.",

The fight was close even with those two knockdowns and if not for those Falcao could have win this one so a rematch might be good to sealed the business.",

Yeah that I agree it should be held in the US, let's see if Gualtieri can hold up fighting in a foreign territory, I don't think Gualtieri can hold on to the title for a long time, the Middleweight is one challenging weight category, there are so many great fighters in that division.This guy is unrated and yet IBF has given him a chance to fight for the world title, this fight did not generate enough interest here because both fighters are unknown in the boxing world.",
