  "content": "The worst month and quarter since 2011 for Bitcoin come as Michael J. Burry warns U.S. stocks are only halfway done with their declines.Bitcoin (BTC) finished June 2022 just below $20,000 after a last-minute pump saw bulls escape 40% monthly losses.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD spiking higher into the monthly close, which came in at $19,924 on Bitstamp. Although the analyst said that BTC could stay \"boring\" for months, Coinbase Pro buyers step up with metric suggests.Among institutional investors, however, there was fresh evidence that BTC was a \"buy\" at $20,000. As noted by on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the so-called \"Coinbase Premium\" returned to positive territory for the first time in two months on June 30.The Premium is the difference between the BTC price on major exchange Binance and U.S. exchange Coinbase's institutional arm, Coinbase Pro.When positive, it means that investors are paying more on Coinbase Pro, suggesting heightened demand. The Premium stood at 0.217 as of June 30.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

      "body": "I guess we really don't need those analysis as this is still an obvious buy region. And maybe the worst is yet to come, there are predictions that we can even reach $13k as the lowest. That will be the golden opportunity to stack more bitcoin. Nevertheless, there's nothing wrong with purchasing right now, and just like the whales, continue to accumulate as much as you can in this bear market.",

      "body": "It's still WAY above the 2018 lows and the the 2020 lows. So looking at it from that perspective shows how far BTC has come. No matter what happens globally no matter what happens in the short term BTC always comes back.I know we are a small section on BTC enthusiasts here so we look at the day to day - week to week - month to month - and so on price a lot more then other people. But from the overall movements of the price a lot of people seem to keep buying and holding.-Dave",
