  "content": "I got to ponder on this quote by John Lyly \"all is fair in love and war\", and it got me thinking: with the recent news on the attempt of the Russians to forcefully dominate Ukraine, who happen to be neighbors, if not \"brothers\" and I asked is it truely fair? Are they deserving of this hostile treatment?  Ukraine's population of 41.46 million people represents 0.66% of the world's population and funny enough, there are between 11-12 million ethnic Russians plus an approximate of 1.5 million who live in the Crimea.  https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ab0b38.html Naturally, with this population increase in Crimea, making for greater of the population, one will say they should feel threatened and forcefully remove them or do something rash but rather there is peace.  Is Russia's behavior stemmed from an innate need to control or are they just being trouble makers?",

      "body": "Fairness depends entirely on one's perspective and in most cases, when faced with such difficult circumstances people often see it as unjust or unfair. Thus, the saying life is never fair. But if we look at it in a simpler sense, with winning as the goal, every thing indeed is fair. Only the winner can decide which is fair and which is not along with what actions/decisions were justified and not. In love though, it depends on how deeply intoxicated you are with your emotion and how experienced you are. You either deem your actions as fair because it is of love and passion or accept any treatments you never thought you could endure had you not been madly in love. You can also be both or not be in any of those. Most of our views in life depend on our own perspectives and willingness to understand the varying views of others.",
