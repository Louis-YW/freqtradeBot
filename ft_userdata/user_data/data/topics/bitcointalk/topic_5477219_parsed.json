If there's  seem to be no reviews  then ..... Maybe I shouldn't jump to conclusion  already . Also, I think there's  a bumb of a thread recently  in the board but I could still make use of personal  reviews Quote from: Charles-Tim on December 09, 2023, 09:13:19 PM16 Bitcoin Software Wallets, compared feature by featureThere are hardware wallet listed on the second link.
