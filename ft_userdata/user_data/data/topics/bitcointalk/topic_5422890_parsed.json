  "content": "10 years ago, blockchain was just the technology behind Bitcoin, a currency used by the Drug lords in illegal markets on the Dark Web.Today, the blockchain is seen as one of the technological wonders of our time. The way blockchain technology has been seen by society has been growing along the years. From the slums of the dark web to the hypothetical implementation of CBDCs, blockchain technology has been highly regarded as a technology that can be used by the government to help them with financial policies and a lot more.  In a few years, we will probably see the entry of CBDCs as state digital currencies supported by the blockchain technology, but this will not be something good. Rather than that, they will use it as a tool for control and monetary policy, so I do not think that what they want to do with it will benefit society. Much to the contrary, they already know what the potential of this technology actually is, and they will use it for something nefarious. How do you see governments making use of the blockchain technology in a few years?",

The big issue that governments are trying to address is the anonymity factor that is provided by the blockchain. Although it is \"open-book\", addresses are essentially anonymous unless there is a way to stake them somewhere. And even then, using a mixer and a new address it is almost impossible to track the people holding funds. I feel like if there was a way to use Blockchain technology which remains decentralised but gets rid of this anonymity factor and thus allowing investigators to track transactions and criminal activity, then governments and economic institutions would begin implementing Blockchain large-scale as this tech is quite obviously the future of the web. This is quintessential issue though is that getting rid of anonymity also means introducing a factor of centrality.",

Venezuela's attempt to rollout a CBDC cryptocurrency is our 1st indication of this. While blockchain can be useful for eliminating middle men in a trust capacity, translating to greater efficiency and lower labor costs. There isn't much incentive in government to implement cost cutting measures. Lack of competition and incentive to produce efficient solutions to problems, trends more towards bloat, waste and abuse. Than it does an idyllic arrangement where problems are solved with a minimum of cost.While blockchain is useful for other things, its best role could be validating transactions in assets like bitcoin. A better question might be how blockchain can be used to improve upon existing technologies like BTC. Satoshi did an outstanding job on the engineering and development side of things. The next step could be devising methods to protect inflation protected HODL assets like bitcoin from wild speculation and prevent it from being traded as if it were an equity.",

Do I think it's going to happen? Potentially, but I don't think we're quite there yet. It's far more likely that they adapt their current system, and bring more regulation to Bitcoin. Edward Bernay's basically said that if you want to control a population, you need to give them the illusion of choice, and if they strong armed you into only using their currency, effectively banning alternatives, then you'd likely have people rebelling. Giving people the illusion of choice, but requiring them to use fiat for certain benefits would probably be the way to go.Obviously, at the moment we aren't anywhere near the market share that would be required for the government to think about implementing something like this.",

Their CBDCs are totally centralized and if you don't believe in their fiat currencies or felt disappointed with their inflationary fiat currencies, you won't support their CBDCs.Anyway, if you skip Bitcoin and compare altcoins with CBDCs, I would like to choose CBDCs rather than altcoins especially newborn altcoins.
