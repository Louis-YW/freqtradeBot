I recommend using the xfce version only, no need to use a distro like Linux Mint because there are bugs in Linux. n",

Or any of the other flavors of Ubuntu.I didn't find Linux mint META as I thought it would be. Also the default package manager (flat hub) contained apps that were huge. Just telegram was 3GB in size due to flat hub installing all the required repositories. Later I changed my package manager to Snap Store. Still I think I'll change my distro again as I find Mint not of my likings. I'll give Ubuntu a try.Can you specify which flavor of Ubuntu can be best for me? I checked the official website of Ubuntu and found two versions of it. Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTSUbuntu 23.10",
