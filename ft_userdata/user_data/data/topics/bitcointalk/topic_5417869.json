  "content": "Ethereum Price Remains SupportedEthereum attempted a fresh increase above the $1,300 level, similar to bitcoin price. ETH struggled to gain pace for a move above the $1,320 level.The price traded as high as $1,310 and started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $1,300 support zone. It retested the $1,265 support zone. A low is formed near $1,270 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ether price is now trading below $1,310 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,290 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,310 swing high to $1,270 low.https://cryptonews.com.co/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-wont-go-down-quietly-risk-of-bounce-grows/",

It could be that you're right but it could also be that you're not right. We even saw it at its new lowest at $900 and that was the time that I missed buying a lot since of budget constraints. However, it's possible that it may be back there again since we're stepping to a probable long bear market again and who knows when it will end.",

There is no big movement, and there is chances of forward move reaching close to $19400 from bitcoin and at that stance ethereum will stay high above $1300. Bitcoin could drop down to $19k, if that happens surely the impact will be felt over ethereum and other altcoins. This is common with the market. In all circumstances the market bounces, all that required is the patience.",

It does not satisfy all people who engage in the market.Not all market participants have profits in bull market and not all of them have loses in bear market. Similar to bounces, dead-cat bounces along the bear market, there are winners and losers too.We always have buyers and sellers in any market, at any price. That means sellers take profit or cut loss and buyers take risk if they don't know what is their plan and what would likely be the trend of market; or buyer wisely buy and accumulate if they have solid plans and know roughly accurate about trend of market and capital flow in the market.",

I believe Ethereum can easily surge up to 10k per coin in a few more years, this project is not the same old Ethereum we all know. because people just stare at the ETH price after the merge and they get frustrated when it doesn't rise as they expected but they forget this. this is something most people don't see, the merge has significant implications and has a strong impact on ETH. it is deflation very well and this will have a huge impact on the development of ETH and its price in the future. take a look at how Binance pushed the price of BNB to an all-time high thanks to a constantly burning supply, people will continue to regret it if they don't buy it now",

We've seen in a few weeks or months about the movement of bitcoin that shows no signs of rising to the top and this is also what causes altcoins not to be able to go up and tend to have a sideways pattern, up and down like bitcoin.I'm worried that if the bitcoin price drops to a lower level and ethereum follows suit, will you still be able to hold on to bitcoin and ethereum because we still don't know where the prices will go? If bitcoin hits the $15k-$17k point, ethereum could hit below $1k and of course, it will create a temporary panic in the market.",

Don't just hope for the price to rise but forget that we are in a bear market, the market can continue to crash at any time.It is so obvious that it is a mystery why more people do not notice something as simple as this, altcoins occasionally present their own movements which are independent from bitcoin, but this is an exception.The biggest and most profitable movements in the altcoin market appear when bitcoin is moving as well, so while there was a lot of hype surrounding the merge and before it happened this helped to make the price of ETH to go up, we saw what happened after the merge took place, there was no positive movement for ETH at all and people were incredibly disappointed by this, but for those which knew about the correlation between bitcoin and ETH this was not surprising at all.",

The price keeps bouncing at that price level because it's a major support same like Bitcoin current price.

Only TA matters the most on crypto because it always start the trend except when there is an special event on altcoins which gives a strong buy pressure.",

They act as an alternative when eth experienced a problem in its fees. After that, many solutions have also came up. There are many alternatives like matic, sol, avax and many more.It's possible for eth to go down on its own. Eth move from pos because their devs think it will make eth even better, not mostly in price but people expect more that its price rise after this. Keep in mind guys that we are still in a bear.",
