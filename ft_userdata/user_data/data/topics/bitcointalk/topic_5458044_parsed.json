Quote from: CryptoHFs on June 29, 2023, 07:55:49 PMThe issue will remain in getting the private key to import the wallet into bluewallet, or it can pull out the btc address out of the trustwallet 12 words string?It's true that you can't export individual private keys from trustwallet, but you don't need to do so at all. The seed phrase generated by trustwallet is BIP39 and that's supported by bluewallet and many other wallets. On a side note, I recommend you to avoid any close-source wallet like trustwallet.",

The seed phrase generated by trustwallet is BIP39 and that's supported by bluewallet and many other wallets. Import your seed phrase into bluewallet. Is there any relation between closed source and open source wallet and only one of them is able to import the private keys or wallet with mnemonic phrases? I mean this option is also not available with the Mycelium wallet for iOS version. I am not sure what is wrong with that app but it's becoming very complicated over the time. Whenever I click on the New wallet addition it instantly creates new wallet, gives me new address and there is just no option at all where I can import external address. I remember though this used to happen previously a year before or something when I could just enter the private key and my external wallet was imported right away. I know I am little drifted from the main topic but since it was associated conversation thought to put it here instead of creating entire thread. Shed some light on this too please!",
