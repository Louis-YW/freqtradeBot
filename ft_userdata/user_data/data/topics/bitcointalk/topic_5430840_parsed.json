I think that the mempool size is too large and it would be difficult to share their mempool state, but maybe I'm wrong...Think about it that way - transaction could be unconfirmed (is stored in the mempool) or confirmed (kept in block chain). Each new transaction must be populated  and known to other nodes - otherwise miners would not be aware given transaction exists and will not be able to include it in their mined blocks.Why do you think mempool is 'too large' to be synchronised?",

If a transaction has a too small fee, it will be deleted from the mempool after some days, so the mempool will never be to big. What you maybe mean is the blockchain, that is a few hundred GB of data. This will indeed take some days to synchronies if you start your node for the first time.",

I think that the mempool size is too large and it would be difficult to share their mempool state, but maybe I'm wrong...A particular full node has its own subjective view regarding what to consider valid in the blockchain: it receives pieces of information from other nodes, verifies if everything is okay, and adds transactions to its local temporary storage of yet-to-be-confirmed financial transactions. Mempool is a completely optional feature: you, as an operator of your personal node, can decide whether to allocate memory for those unconfirmed transactions or not. The only drawback of you not having a mempool is that you can't tell other nodes about unconfirmed transactions, and you even can't see them until they get into the mined block. Some will say that without mempool, you will have an incomplete picture of the blockchain, and your node should no longer be considered \"full\" because you can't conduct full verification.",

      "body": "Nodes serves as gateway to the mempool[1] so there is a need for nodes to share their mempool with each other in order for other nodes (peers) to perform its own check for the validity of transactions. QuoteIf the transaction passes the node's checks, the transaction is added to the node's mempool. That node will also broadcast it to other nodes, called peers. Each of these peers will perform its own checks — adding valid transactions to its mempool and then broadcasting the transaction along to its peers.Here is a good presentation by Babypips about how mempool is shared by nodes[2]It was stated that every node on Bitcoin network share information about new transaction, since transaction is not directly added to the blockchain they are first collected and stored at mempool.  Then these nodes communicate with its peers to check the validity of transaction on after performing its own check and adds valid transaction to the mempool.  [1] https://www.blocknative.com/blog/mempool-nodes[2] https://www.babypips.com/crypto/learn/what-is-a-mempool#:~:text=Also%20known%20as%20%E2%80%9Cmempool%E2%80%9D%20for,to%20a%20newly%20created%20block.",

Thank you for the correction and I stand corrected, yeah they communicate exchange information about unconfirmed transaction, no excuses I messed up there  .I messed up this line QuoteEach Bitcoin node has its own mempool, where it stores the queue of transactions that it has checked and considers valid.In addition we can also see the difference of mempool and blockchain function in this quotation.QuoteThe memory pool holds “fresh” or unconfirmed transactions (stored as individual transactions).The blockchain holds “archived” or confirmed transactions  (packaged in “blocks”).",

While the Nodes is the computer that run the network software. Or in other terms it forms a network where information can be shared or transacted. Where the major function of Nodes are routing, storage, mining and wallet services.
