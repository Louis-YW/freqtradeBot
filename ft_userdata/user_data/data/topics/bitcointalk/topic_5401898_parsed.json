  "content": "On OKX exchange, I saw exchange and wallet, it got my attention today that the wallet aspect will mean normal wallet and not exchange, but I was thinking it wiukd be like Coinbase.com which are not noncustododial wallet. I clicked on wallet and I saw this image I haveBut it is indicated that the wallet is decentralized but I am not sure.Has anyone used this wallet before, is it truly decentralized and it will generate seed phrase? Or it is just centralized like Coinbase.com?",

I deleted it because I later got a link on OKX exchange to learn more about the wallet, immediately I saw seed phrase when I clicked on the link, I noticed it is a noncustododial wallet. I was about to report this list now to the moderator to delete it and I saw your reply, I highly appropriate your reply which is the reason I edited the post back to the original post. But I just know that it is not worth it to still use the wallet because OKX may be able to link the wallet to your identity if you are verified on the exchange.",

If you decide to use this wallet, just install the wallet extension in a separate browser (which never accesses the exchange's personal account).",

      "body": "Since the wallet is on their website when generating a wallet with seed it is still not safe to use unless if they can prove that it is safe and can be run offline or like the above said if it is open-source. There is no difference between this wallet with Metamask why not use Metamask instead? If your purpose is to use OKC mainnet then you can manually add the OKC mainnet to Metamask you can follow the guide from this link.",

      "body": "I think this is somehow similar to blockchain. I haven't used them nor have any intentions to use them. If not fully open-source whether they create a seed or not still I won't use it since there are more trusted wallets that exist. I am not saying they aren't legit, but I am expressing my thoughts. I have been using a hardware wallet which is safer than any other wallet software or extension. Just leave that and see the feedback those have been using.",

Or it is just centralized like Coinbase.com?With the increasing trend of NFT and metaverse, Okx launched their Web3 wallet, MetaX along with the whole portal for dApps and NFT, but weird that they branded it as 'wallet'.Yes, they generate client-side seed phrase and you can see it while doing back-up of the wallet. Also, they claim to be truly decentralized (100% client-side wallet) however, they failed to incorporate one important feature which somewhat loosens the claim. Most of the web-based non-custodial wallets (such as MetaMask) allow the users to generate seed and derive keys and addresses from it in the offline-mode. Only sending transactions requires network connection. However, OKX wallet requires the internet connection to initialize the wallet. This may be due to a poor app design which requires APIs to retrieve the price data before wallet could be loaded but is surely a big red alert.",
