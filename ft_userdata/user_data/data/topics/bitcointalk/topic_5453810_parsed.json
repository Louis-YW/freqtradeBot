Either big brands are flooded with individual that support this gender or are confused. They are destroying their own identity for a silly left propoganda. They might get permanently boycotted by some who hate this idea. You know what I mean! I am not opposed to those who are genuine and are suffering but I am opposed to those who represent the left and trying force wokeism within the society for their personal benefits.",

I best guess is that executives were aware of all of this in Target and they thought it was a good idea, because we are getting closer and closer to the month of June, or the pride month. Otherwise, it would imply that the advertisement department has even more power on the image of a brand than the executives and shareholders themselves, which sounds ridiculous and unreal.",

Boycotting a brand that is helping perpetrate the largest child abuse scandal the world has ever seen seems a little more serious than trying to destroy an individual’s career because they said, “all lives matter.” Cancelling people’s careers for saying common sense phrases everyone should agree with. Bad. Not shopping at a store for trying to get your 4 year old son to cut off his dick. Good. Is that simple enough for you to understand?",

Sometimes I wonder about the extent people will want to go just to promote their personal or group agenda. The promoters of LBGT rights like to go the extra mile to force their stands on people. It was alleged that a particular president of America ensured that a President of my country lost elections because our president rejected his orders to legalize gay marriage. His government ensured that our country suffers from economic blockage because we refused to do their bidding.Target has to carry out a damage control program because an apology will not repair the reputation damage this move would have caused them. If any company tries that in my country, they will go bankrupt because of the strong religious background of my country.",

Traditionally, brands did not have to worry about being boycotted because what they decided to do with their logos and ads, but it feels things are getting different after the budlight and Target cases. I assume most of the brands will ignore the opinions and protests and continue to have their pride campaigns going as usual every year. I still expect a lot of fighting on Twitter, though.",
