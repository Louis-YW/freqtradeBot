This is so the other hackers can't copy the code and leech from me, the original and top 1 hackzor. But seriously, you can check that 99% of the code is original from the forum itself. Looks like theymos tried to hide the code so no one could bypass it? Not enough to stop me, though. E.g: https://talkimg.com/images/2023/05/13/blob16369cc20b448e93.png",
