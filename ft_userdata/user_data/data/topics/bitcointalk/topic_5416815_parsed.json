Not to mention the storage wallet of Tron, you are right when talking about Tron token, nowadays it has become a useless token, there is no development in recent years, it can be said that without USDT Tron has long been forgotten. To me, Tron is now nothing more than a stable coin, holding it is not profitable. Tron was created by Justin Sun in 2017 and in 2018 it reached an ATH of $0.23, a market cap of 18 billion. But now it's like old coins that have not once been able to surpass the old ATH, what a pity for a blockchain as good as Tron.",

Don't say it's impossible that Tron's price will reach such a price in crypto. Because we used to say that Dogecoin was a trash coin, but when the price hit $0.7 a year ago, we said Dogecoin was great and adored it. Likewise with Tron. We shouldn't think of the current high supply as trash coins either. It's just a comparison so that we are not pessimistic about the current state of crypto. This is the basis that we cannot measure blockchain costs based on validator terms on the value of stable coins. Of course validators don't want to waste time on this if the transaction fees they get aren't worth it. But that's another matter.",
