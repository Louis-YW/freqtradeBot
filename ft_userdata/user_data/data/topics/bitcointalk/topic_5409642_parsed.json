  "content": "I have been gathering a significant amount of information and completing several forms and complaints through the FBI-IC3, CFTC, etc., however this crypt exchange will lure you in by showing you that you can make significant amount of money using short term delivery contracts, until you try to withdrawal you funds, they freeze your account and indicate you have to pay 20% of your balance in order to withdrawal, which is essentially thousands of dollars at this point, with no intention to actually release any funds. They call it, \"Damage Liquidity Fee,\" also \"Money Laundering Fee, (lol),\" they are based out of Singapore. Any information on what else I can do, it just takes quite a bit of time to communicate with entities that report that they can help. I'm not sure if you can recover your funds if you have victim of this one person or not, but it is just blind robbery. I've bet tracking the addresses. Also Telegram @hym1998 hym1998@gmail is either orchestrating this fraud or assists in the fraud. M.bitwallet.finance = m.bitprocorp.com. if anyone else has information has information let me know, may have better charces of catching them.",

Regardless of whatever that they're calling it, there's no reason for a \"legitimate\" platform to ask for more when they're already in possession of your funds!Here are a few other similar fake platforms:BitPor.org [archived]DeeplBit.com [archived]OMXMax.com [archived]Quote from: jmat2240 on August 12, 2022, 05:24:41 PMand if anyone can help me recover the funds please I would give up to half to you.If someone already sent you a private message that they can recover it, they're also 100% a scammer!Quote from: jmat2240 on August 12, 2022, 05:24:41 PMAny information on what else I can do, it just takes quite a bit of time to communicate with entities that report that they can help. ~Snipped~I'm really hoping I can recover the funds, I only deposited them on 8/7, 8/8, and 8/9.There are a few platforms that might come in handy with regard to tracing those funds but there are still some obstacles to intercepting their operations:e.g.If they try to sell it on the dark web, realistically there'll be little to no chance for you or anybody to recover those funds!If somehow it traces back to a specific exchange, you still need a court order to freeze those funds and I don't think it's going to be that simple!In other words, there are no shortcuts [don't get your hopes up]:Quote from: SFR10 on December 05, 2021, 10:21:06 AMHere you can find some of the third-party providers:Note: AFAIK, most of them aren't providing their services to individuals, but they might come in handy + I prefer to not vouch for their services [DYOR].ChainalysisCrystal BlockchainAML botCipherBladeElliptic",

      "body": "Hi,  Did you get your case resolved? I got scammed by the same website but I was lured by a girl that we met on an online dating app. She later tells me I can make lots of money with Crypto and convinces me to use the platform Bitpro. After several transactions and banking money I tried to take some money out only for it to be frozen. I filed also a complaint with the IC3 website.  Is there any way to recover these funds or track them? Thank you.",

Didn't you think it was weird that a \"girl\" on a dating app was giving you advice on how to invest? The dating app is supposed to be about dating and sex, not investing.",

Yes and bitprocorp is the same website as m.bitwallet.finance. I still have the whatsapp conversations and \"she\" got the same way, very defensive. Let me ask you...how was \"her\" written english? She originally said she was from Russia but then her english got really good. I was actually surprised, and I didn't say anything. We met in \"Tinder\" and I was surprised how much she knew about the economy, interest rates, ect. I have a feeling this person is in the US.  Have you taken any other steps to track your stolen funds? Or just reported to police and FBI?",
