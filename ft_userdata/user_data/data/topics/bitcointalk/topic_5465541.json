  "content": "Recently, there has been discussion on what will happen to the leftover fund?1. We all know whirlwind.money has left no path for a comeback. They aren't active for a long time now. But what they have left; $40k DAI in escrow with minerjones. MJ has already distributed more than half of the funds and is still holding ~$17k. What's going to happen to this? Who will be the owner of this fund if whirlwind never  comes back?2. ChipMixer has been seized and DarkStar_ said all the outstanding payment will be sent. Has he sent the outstanding payment? I can't see any update on the thread. Nevertheless, there was ~1.30 Bitcoin on the ChipMixer signature campaign escrow address which has been later sent to another address. Who has received the fund?What will happen to the leftover fund? Why do we really bother what will happen with the fund?In case of whirlwind, imagine that whirlwind has come back and processed all the withdrawals & asked minerjones to send their fund from escrow back. What if some of the members don't send the fund back? Will some of you compensate minerjones? I guess no. Then why we really should think the fate of the leftover fund? Let escrow decide what will happen.In case of ChipMixer, DarkStar_ announced of sending the outstanding & he should do that since he was in control of the fund in escrow. After that he has the right to do anything with the leftover fund. We don't have right to decide, do we?The purpose of this thread isn't to put some sauce on the issue. The issue has been in discussion randomly in ChipMixer ANN thread, in a thread in Meta. That's why I thought of creating a new thread so that users can discuss here instead of being off topic in other discussion.",

That is really in the hands of the escrow team to figure out. they probably have their own policies or guidelines to deal with these situations.",

      "body": "Quote from: RapTarX on September 03, 2023, 07:31:12 PMIn case of whirlwind...In case of ChipMixer...Cases are very different, so it should be viewed separately. In case of Whirlwind, funds were held in an Escrow by minerjones. Initially, funds were dedicated for Whirlwind's review campaign. Everything went as expected and funds were re-allocated by whirlwind to get an escrow fund to ensure trust as far as I know. There's been a statement from WhirlwindQuote from: whirlwindmoney on April 28, 2023, 04:03:50 AMThe 40,000 DAI are still in escrow with minerjones and we are able to send much more than that if the risk of us stealing the funds proves to be the problem, but at a certain point our users would have to trust us regardless until we completely decentralize the service so we are not sure it makes much sense to do that.So, in my opinion these funds are still valid for possible refunds of damaged customers but I would also say if a Bitcointalk community vote was held, funds could be spent otherwise. It's mainly public funds now. But not exclusively. In case of ChipMixer, funds were dedicated for weekly rewards of ChipMixer's Signature campaign. The funds served a defined purpose. In addition to that, last round of weekly rewards have been paid but interestingly, the transaction came from a different wallet than usually (usually it comes from 1Chip... wallet). Should be investigated where it came from, maybe there's more. And as far as I know, only DarkStar_ had access to the wallet, while the wallet was topped up every 5 or 6 weeks by ChipMixer. A reply from DarkStar_ to clarify where he / she sent the funds and why would be interesting. After all it's also public funds and the purpose of these funds should happen by a democratic decision of Bitcointalk's community. It's what happens to public funds. We would only need to decide who's eligible to vote in case of a decision: just campaign participants, in addition to campaign participants certain ranks (Hero / Legendary) or everyone above Member rank / xx Merit earned?  After all, it's essential to make a fair decision here. But I'm not the one to decide that, whole Bitcointalk community is.

Once again it's important to avoid mining up both cases. While for Whirlwind, the incident happened a few weeks ago and there are likely more customers to be refunded. That's why I'm in favor to keep the escrow fund where it is currently. It's serving a purpose. It's different for ChipMixer. ChipMixer isn't an escrow fund, it's for ChipMixer's Signature campaign. Considering these funds have been sent now, without any explanation and broader community consent is exactly what I believe is how these funds shouldn't be handled. We don't know why and where the 1.3 BTC were sent to. The issue: there are not any rules yet how such funds should be treated for the ChipMixer case. The community needs to define these rules or we will have this coming up again. Maybe not every year but maybe every 2 years. At least for the Whirlwind Escrow fund, the funds are serving a purpose currently.",

ChipMixer isn't an escrow fund, it's for ChipMixer's Signature campaign.It still was escrow fund by definition. The deal was between Campaign manager and the project owner, none of the campaigners get anything (or at least demand anything). Have you been paid for the week/weeks you wore the signature. The answer is yes. Case close for campaigners.If managing a marketing business was so easy, not required risking loss, only profit then I would not have to pay many times several thousands if not five figures already out of my own pocket in several campaigns. I don't think that time many members were too keen to accept a no payment (sometimes a few but it's not even 1% of the total).What I am saying is: loss, left, profit, whatever it is - it's the deal between two party.One > The campaign manager Two > The project owner.You, me and rest of us should have no concern. We are third party. Making a written contract like not claiming the money after x days/weeks/years will result xyz can be a good idea though. I have done it with few of my clients but it was more formal like - If the project end up with bad reputation and communication disconnected for x months then you (project owner) do not owe anything from the escrow fund.

ChipMixer isn't an escrow fund, it's for ChipMixer's Signature campaign.It still was escrow fund by definition. From what was stated publicly, it wasn't escrow for any refund, just Signature campaign weekly rewards. Completely different from Whirlwind. And when it's an escrow fund, it's even more controversial that the funds are getting sent now. Funds getting sent means ChipMixer came back? Address got hacked? Something else we dont know yet? For an Escrow fund it is essential to be handled properly, especially after things are unclear. A good example how an escrow fund can be managed professionally in a messy situation is whirlwind's Escrow fund managed by minerjones (and Hhampuz). If we don't fix any uncertainties, much more controversies will happen again. And I'm saying that as a supporter of escrow funds. Maybe every project doing a Signature campaign can provide an escrow fund and in case of an exit scam, losses could be covered. Most likely, such a procedure would reduce risks of exit scams, too.

The next step would be handing out negative feedback demanding answers, and think that would have happened already if the 2 accounts involved would have had a lesser reputation.QuoteDifference was the manager Hhampuz was not trusted by $40k DAI so they went with an independent third party escrow which was minerjones in this case.I'm pretty sure it was Hhampuz' own call to ask another escrow. He ran the campaign and avoided a conflict of interest this way.Quote from: Rikafip on September 04, 2023, 02:22:05 PMAh, so we were paid in the end for those last few days of the campaign, good to know.Up until now I assumed we weren't (and I even said that in another thread :p) because I don't really check my sig campaign wallet on the regular basis and few days ago when I checked the usual address from where sig campaign was paid, there were no transactions (except that latest one when funds were moved).I can't believe I have to say this, but: You know the only way to see if you've been paid Bitcoin is by checking your own address, right?

Not someone else's address?Lol of course I know, but as I said I haven't checked my address for some time and never really bothered to check whether I got paid for those few days or not (tbh I totally forgot about it and I got bunch of other sig payments there). Only the other day when someone mentioned that leftover funds moved, I saw that there were no transactions after March 15th that looked like signature payments, therefore I assumed that we weren't paid in the end.",
