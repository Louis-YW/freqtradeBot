Gox story into one narrative over multiple episodes. I already have lots of material to work from, but if there is anyone out there who was involved in Mt. Gox in any capacity who wouldn't mind chatting to me (Telegram, Whatsapp, voice chat etc) about their experience, I'd love to hear from you.Please reply/DM me if you are happy to talk about your side of the story, or you know someone who could help offer their experience.Thanks.",

I always saw it as a watershed moment for Japan. Culturally, there was a lot of guilt and shame and dishonour in what happened (despite it not really being Japan's fault) resulting in the push for fast-track legislation. I have a feeling there's a gold mine in there if you find someone from Japan's legal side to also interview. They're known to be very open, if not eager to tell their side of the story.",

Nothing is perfect of course, but it seemed to be somewhat carelessly thrown together, particularly as the fiat value of bitcoin increased over the years.  Even now, if one has to deal with an exchange (any of them - Coinbase or Gemini, you name it), one should put the fiat or bitcoin there and then move it elsewhere.  The exchanges certainly seem to be more robust and better designed today, but do you really want to trust your coins to someone else?",

Even when the exchange was down for weeks there were many people willing to bet on it coming back in just a few days. Yeah, exactly. We have to understand it from the perspective of a period in time when it simply wasn't easy to find a reputable entity to trade significant volumes of Bitcoin. It's like the Trust system here. Mt Gox had a lot of approval ratings from old forum users, Ver comes to mind -- he apologised later for recommending everyone to use Mt Gox but it's no different from me recommending users as escrows or services I'd use -- where there is no good decentralised/trustless alternative.And in some ways, the lengthy litigation at least attempts to make users whole -- unlike other exchanges that have folded.",

I don't see Roger being so much active in media or in forums like before, but he is back posting on twitter, so I am sure drbitcoinpod can contact him there @rogerkver.I don't agree with many things he did in the past, but he was right about some things and I always like to listen to other opinions about anything, not to live like closed in eco chamber.Maybe it's a good idea to watch some documentaries about MtGox and Mark Karpeles, like Bitcoin Big Bang (2018) for example.",

He was probably already talking to Mark Karpeles to help him withdraw his coins because he already knew what was going to happen to the exchange, WHILE telling the community that it's safe to hold your coins there. He didn't want everyone to panic to make withdrawal easy for him. Haha.",

I think it's a bit paranoid, but I do understand where they are coming from. People like OgNasty who were known to have funds and have no problem talking about it are one thing. Finding / getting the others will be difficult, and it's kind of bad about that because they probably have some good views. With that being said, yes I was using them, and I got everything out long before the implosion. No real reason other then luck, was going to be traveling a lot for work back then and figured I would never have time to do anything with the BTC that was there so I pulled everything out. Just a bit of luck on my part.-Dave",
