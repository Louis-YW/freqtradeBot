I personally do not think there will ever come such a time when human beings can become a wallet such as described by the OP, except the set of humans with this capabilities are going to be robots built for that and maybe other purposes as well.I've actually come across a news where some guy implanted a bitcoin lightening network chip into his hand, by which he can receive bitcoin payments by the sender scanning his hand with a bitcoin wallet built-in scanner.Though the above have been done by one person, but majority of people who saw this news condemned it and swore never to tear any part of their body to implant anything..So in conclusion, there will never a time when human beings will become crypto wallets, it will never happen.",

Interesting stuff! However, I'm not considering it myself yet as I have no idea about the security implications of the process. Not that interesting, pretty much useless since the chip is working the whole time so whoever knows that you have this can interact with the chip and copy your ID. In the current state of technology this is really bad and people who have cars that unlock in the presence of the key nearby have learned it the hard way. Thieves have frequency modulators that try random frequencies and it takes a few minutes before a car is unlocked without the need to touch it. You just stand near it with the device in your pocket, then if it unlocks you get in and drive away. I don't understand why someone would implant such chip if they could have it on a chain around their neck. The only valid reason to implant a chip is if you're afraid of kidnapping and want someone to be able to track you. Let's keep money in our pockets for now, not under our skin.",

True that, but a lot nicer idea is to use human brain as a storage for your wallet.dat. The only issue then would be an interface to use it as computers and terminals can't read mind. Voice/facial/iris recognition is unsafe and prone to forgery (photos, 3d models etc) so we need something else. I guess only fingerprints are truly unique.",

I imagine it won't be a nice experience.I don't really believe that this and related innovations will be welcomed by people. There is nothing attractive into it because current methods are very fast and efficient but of course the government wants to increase control over people and if that finally reaches sci-fi portray, then I imagine not only payment but absolutely every service will be served by automatically checking your identity that will include every info (passport info + wallet + work history, salary history, etc).That time may come, who knows? It's hard to say yes or no right now. Btw it's easy to say no at the moment because we may won't be able to imagine the advancement of technologies in future but if you'd ask a person some centuries ago if she could imagine seeing and speaking to someone from Greece to Italy, answer would be no and you would be deemed mentally ill.",

I have only learned about it last year, and I was quite surprised. To be honest,Â  I don't think it's a good idea, for many reasons.Â  One is that if someone decides to rob you, your body is literally needed to get the money, so it's an additional violence risk. Also, I've seen it on video of a guy with a chip that it can get buggy, not work from first try. I'd say it's nervous, and who's to say it won't stop working one day?
