  "content": "Hi there, I'm auctioning a 2014 Cryptonic Monero brass silver-plated physical coin. They are the first physical Monero coins ever produced and they are very rare, there are only a couple auctions of these coins (pure silver and silver plated) found on the internet. The only similar succesful trade that I know of is that someone bought a 2014 Cryptonic pure silver coin for $1700 in 2017. Because of this it's hard to estimate the value of the coin, if you think it's not worth it please refrain from posting in the thread.There are a couple small brown tarnish spots on the coin I haven't removed to keep the coin 100% authentic, if you want you can do it yourself.I am the original owner of this coin and can post the e-mail I received when I ordered the coin from Cryptonic, also the owner of Cryptonic posted in my reputation thread and trust page.Photos: upper ones made with normal lighting, bottom ones made with flash from my phone. These are older photos, if you want I can try to post better photos.Please limit posts to bids or comments/questions about the item for auction.STARTING BID: 0.049 BTCMINIMUM BID INCREMENT: 0.001 BTCBUY IT NOW: 0.1 BTCEND TIME: JULY 10TH, 2022, 23:59:59 Amsterdam timeESCROW: If you want we can use a trusted escrow on this site, I haven't been on here for a long time so I don't know who currently is a trusted escrow here.Payment due within 24 hours of auction end.SNIPE: Any bid made in last hour will extend the auction 15 minutes.If within that extended hour a new bid is made, 15 minutes will be added to the auction from the time of that bid.PAYMENT: Bitcoin BTC, can also accept ETH, XMR and USDT if that is fine with the potential escrow too, if you want to pay in another cryptocurrency we can discuss that.SHIPPING: Shipping fees included and based on location and preference",
