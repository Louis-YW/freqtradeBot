It don't mean I support Yabes's activity to scam @OP, but that's surely not a good idea considering about how much he scam and this would be a threat for anyone who had bought something from other users in this forum.As for your last sentence, there's no centralized exchange will share their customer's private information to a stranger.",

Sometimes people prepare for such a scam by taking a $50 loan at the beginning and gradually increasing their requests. According to the post history, it is clear that the user is interested in gambling and the collecting section, and he is also only interested in material gain. I would be suspicious of the players.I want me to be wrong and your losses to be returned.I frankly admire your endurance.

I strongly disagree with this.A borrower may take many loans as they wish before they decide to scam the lender on one final loan. The previous loans are often done to build trust in the community and this behavior is often found in the anonymous forums. One might argue that the borrower is a gambler and pays back as they win some from the win and rest from their salary, but from the perspective of the lender, they are nothing but a default.Like like 99% of defaulted loans, this one is not coming back.What yogg did in the collectibles section is a proof that you are responsible for your own money and how you deal with people on the internet.Flag supported.",

Personally, I don't trust a person who depends on loans every day or every week. If they can repay the loan after a short time, then what makes then borrow again after a couple of days? Can't they just wait for the money they earn and use it instead of acquire loans that even require interest on repayment weekly?I think it's a trick to build trust, increase the no collateral loan amounts and then finally pull off an exit scam when the time comes",

Sometimes before giving out loan always check to know if such person can afford to pay back the loan especially now that account sale is common on the forum, they may buy an account and used it to apply for a loan.Well I can't tell or knows accurate problems with the loan defaulter but I will suggest you try track down the local board him or she regularly post so you could reached out to some fellow if they knows the way about @Yabes, and again I would love to say that you should focused more on those that are more active on local board as I believe they must have a boss who introduced them to this forum.

The issue isn't about internal transaction but rather that after a month or so, the person acquired a loan from Shasan did not pay it back before or on the promised date.You can't just contact binance, and they give you a customer's details without involving lawyers and a court order. If that's what you are suggesting then he is going to have to spend way more than $400 for the legal process, which kind of doesn't make sense.",

It seems the borrower has long planned this exit scam purposely with the way I saw it. What makes it that easier is the fact that there is no collateral for the loan so it is easy for the borrower to do away with the loan. I see it was paid directly to the binance account of the borrower. I will suggest you write binance with the loan evidence and screenshot for a backup proof of your petition for them to see and possibly take actions against the borrower. If possible, they go help you out with details to help you recover back your money.",
