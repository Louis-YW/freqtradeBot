However, being an innovator alone is not enough to generate the amount of wealth necessary to reach the trillion-dollar mark.Most billionaires, in my opinion, are the product of a multitude of factors. The type of work they do and how they conduct their business. Some like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett were product of the education system they were born into. Others like Elon Musk were products of circumstance.The rest is really anybody's guess.",

If he were to amount wealth to surpass a trillion, there'd be relentless attacks on him to make sure he doesn't get to reap any benefits. Tesla would be regulated into the ground before they let Elon hit a trillion.After all, billionaires are alleged to be inherently evil. If that's the case. What's a trillionaire supposed to be?",

Trying to make gasoline go out of business with th aim of promoting only renewable electricity supply system simply means, you e got to ensure your products becomes affordable even below the middle class and that is being unrealistic with the price of a Tesla at the moment.It's important to know that, those little money do count. Aside from Elons view of free speech, I think this is one of the reason he went to acquire Tweeter and gets those cent or even less than per tweet. Communication is one vital part of our human existence and either we like it or not, humans must communicate but the means is were we've got some variations. That's some good business too and Elon sees this.Haven't said all that, we ought to realise one thing for sure and that is, Elon is sure getting to the trillionaire spot.
