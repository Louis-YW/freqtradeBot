This advice was only relevant like a decade ago when bitcoin was been seen with alot of skepticism. Some saw bitcoin as  gambling, some saw it as a ponze scheme while others saw it as a bubble the will burst.In today's bitcoin, we know that if you invest with your spare money you may never make any fortune from bitcoin. 2. Invest what you are able to lose;I have a question!Who has ever lost in bitcoin? I do not find this advice pleasant to bitcoin. Although, this is a kind of general advice for assets that are volatile. But with bitcoin having  proven that it can resuscitate after crash, the advice should be rephrased as Invest what you will not be needing in the next few years. It will not be advisable to use the money meant for your childrens school fees for bitcoin. Just have an investment budget from your income that will not negative alter your living state. Then, when you invest for 3yrs to 5yrs duration, there's no how bitcoin will fail you.Besides I have known people that put their retirement money into bitcoin AndI have also seen people that have all their savings in bitcoin. What do you have to tell them? 3. DYOR (Do your own research):This advice should be for altcoin investors. If I may ask, what kind of research is one, especially a newbie expected to make in bitcoin. Are they researching the road map of bitcoin or are they researching the developers behind it? The right thing is to know when to buy.

Same applies to one investing what they can afford to lose. Nothing is obsoleteQuoteIn today's bitcoin, we know that if you invest with your spare money you may never make any fortune from bitcoin. But Bitcoin can still go x2 to even x7 in a bull market. How many investment options can do that in 3-4 years?",

Although risk-tolerance is different from one person to another, if you want to be safe and not lose sleep whatever happens to your investment, invest only an amount that is not intended for something else and not big enough to give you stress when you lose. Whatever Bitcoin has proven in the past decade, it is never a guarantee of what is to come. It is never even a guarantee that Bitcoin will still be here 10 years from now. That Bitcoin's price grew thousands of fold in the past decade doesn't mean it will x5 in the next decade. To those people who put their retirement money into bitcoin, I hope they didn't go all-in. To those people who have all their savings in Bitcoin, you're probably doing it wrong. Quote 3. DYOR (Do your own research):This advice should be for altcoin investors. If I may ask, what kind of research is one, especially a newbie expected to make in bitcoin. Are they researching the road map of bitcoin or are they researching the developers behind it? The right thing is to know when to buy. Simply buy low and sell high.This classic advice won't age. It will always be relevant not only in terms of investment but also in terms of everything else in life. You should do your own research in choosing which to invest, who to marry, what kind of house to build, what brand of car to buy, what supplement to drink, and so on and so forth. In terms of Bitcoin, you shouldn't stop researching. News affect it. Government policies affect it. Economics affect it. A hardware wallet suddenly introduces cloud backup and KYC. A mixing service keeps sensitive information. You say buy low sell high, but how to do it without research?",

DYOR (Do your own research):IMO, these 3 advices still make sense to me1. Investing spare money doesn't necessarily mean the money you got after you meet all your monthly needs for survival, it is supposed to be the savings part from your total income which means you should save 20 to 30% of your salary and invest on to different assets to get returns in future.2. I can point hundreds of them who lost their money due to investing on Bitcoin because they invested in a wrong way. Someone saw the growth if bitcoin at the time if bull market so they took loan at high interest rate and bought bitcoin but after few months the price dropped more than half price than their purchase price now how will repay their debt?3. It's not only about potential growth, what if someone bought Bitcoin but deposited in a fake wallet so they lose all their assets in no time so its important to gain knowledge about bitcoin, how to store them secured for long term, where to buy it, how to avoid scammers while buying.",

You've got a point. But, it's not about making a fortune with Bitcoin but the risk appetite of most people that have seen it. Even if they won't invest with their spare money, this is like having a safe thought of investing in Bitcoin because they can bear the risk. Although no one stops people from investing not just with their spare money and even with their life savings. The whole point of this is to invest what they're willing to invest and that's it.Quote from: Zoomic on May 19, 2023, 10:57:28 PM2.

What do you have to tell them?2. I'll give you an example of who are those people that have lost investing in Bitcoin. Those people that have invested during the hype of it and it's full of positivities and then it seems like not dropping at all. There were few people that have sold their houses and other assets and even took loans of it and bought Bitcoin at the peak not knowingly that the bear market was about to come. And again, this will come back again to the risk appetite of people. That's why this advice should always be taken note that everyone should invest what they can afford to lose.Quote from: Zoomic on May 19, 2023, 10:57:28 PM 3.

Thus, they think that's more than enough to trust it and not to understand what volatility is. When you say DYOR for Bitcoin, it's not about the entirety of it but have some idea on how volatile it is and as well as the history of it.",

But, honestly, I still find those old rules very relevant in the Bitcoin community. The Bitcoin market is very volatile, and not everyone can patiently withstand the pressure of not selling during a bear market. When some people invest a large amount of money for the short term and perhaps the market did not see bullish movement as they may have speculated, they may forcefully sell and can sell at a loss. That is why the rule \"invest what you can afford to lose\" is still relevant. Also, some people are borrowing money to invest in Bitcoin; sometimes the market doesn't give them the profit they want at the right time, and they may be faced with the pressure of repaying their loan and interest. Which is why \"investing only spear money\" is also advised. There are many reasons for it. Investment is meant to be done wisely and not without knowledge of what someone is doing; that's why those common rules exist.",

DYOR (Do your own research):This advice should be for altcoin investors. If I may ask, what kind of research is one, especially a newbie expected to make in bitcoin. Are they researching the road map of bitcoin or are they researching the developers behind it? The right thing is to know when to buy. Simply buy low and sell high.These and some more are bothering me, I decided to let it out so that we will begin to appreciate bitcoin and not to continue seeing it as it was 10 years ago.Bitcoin market is not smooth sailing and do not continuously go up.  It goes in an up-and-down uptrend pattern and people need to know the reason behind that.  In an investment and in any form DYOR is very important to mitigate risk and assure ourselves that we do the right decision.  One can't have a diamond hand if he is not well-versed in the flow of the Bitcoin market.",
