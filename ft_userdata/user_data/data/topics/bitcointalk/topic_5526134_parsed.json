  "content": "Hey Bitcoiners, let’s pause the euphoria for a moment and talk about something important. Everyone’s buzzing about Bitcoin replacing gold, becoming a reserve asset for companies and countries, or even a way to save for your kids’ inheritance. It sounds amazing—but what if I told you there’s a major Achilles’ heel we’re overlooking? Something that could destroy Bitcoin as easily as a movie villain stealing the moon. Yes, I’m talking about a 51% attack. Let’s unpack this in simple terms.We all know Bitcoin’s security relies on mining—the computational power that keeps the network safe. Currently, the network’s hash rate is an eye-watering 700-800 EH/s (that’s 800 quintillion hashes per second). It sounds impenetrable, right? But here’s the kicker: to control 51% of the network and wreak havoc, you’d need a mining platform that costs around $20-30 billion. Expensive? Sure. Impossible? Not really.This cost estimate is based on today’s top-tier mining hardware, like the Antminer S21 Pro, which offers a hash rate of 150 TH/s at a price of around $4,000 per unit. To match 51% of the current hash rate (approximately 390 EH/s), you would need about 2.6 million of these machines. Add to this the infrastructure costs, such as data centers, cooling systems, and energy consumption, and the total climbs to the $20-30 billion range. This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation but provides a realistic ballpark figure.To put that in perspective, the cost of Elon Musk buying Twitter was $44 billion. Companies like OpenAI and xAI are building AI supercomputers costing tens of billions. Apple has over hundred billion in cash reserves. One determined billionaire or company with the resources and the motivation could theoretically destroy Bitcoin. That’s a chilling thought, isn’t it?You might say: “Who would spend billions just to destroy Bitcoin? It makes no sense!” True, it’s not logical to us Bitcoin believers. But do we want to rely on a “Proof-of-Clever-Guy” argument for security? Remember, logic doesn’t always stop bad actors. A rogue state, a rival financial system, or even an eccentric billionaire who just wants to watch the world burn could decide to make Bitcoin their target. Just because it’s irrational doesn’t mean it’s impossible.Let’s say this hypothetical villain executes the attack. What happens? The attacker could double-spend coins, invalidate transactions, or sow so much distrust that the Bitcoin economy collapses. People lose confidence, and what was once a “store of value” turns into chaos. The dream of Bitcoin as digital gold? Poof. Gone.So what’s the solution? One idea is to involve computational giants around the world in the network itself. Imagine a scenario where their vast computing power becomes part of the network. Of course, these companies wouldn’t just abandon their primary tasks to mine Bitcoin. They’d continue performing their usual computations but remain capable of contributing to the network’s security when needed. This is where something like a “Proof-of-Result” approach could play a role. If you’re curious about this concept, check out some of my other posts for more details.Bitcoin is an incredible innovation, but let’s not get so caught up in the hype that we ignore potential threats. If Bitcoin is to become the backbone of the global financial system, we must address these vulnerabilities. Otherwise, one bad actor (such as Vector from Despicable Me) might just come along and ruin it for everyone.Let’s discuss this—not out of fear, but because we care about Bitcoin’s future. What are your thoughts? Is this a real concern, or am I just being a pessimist?",

Car accidents are one of the most common causes of death, yet this risk alone is not a valid reason to reject the concept of cars, and go back to horses. Bitcoin, among many other things, is a technology that enables the existence of a completely free-market based money without central planners. It relies on a game theory. Other forms of money rely on different assumptions, assumptions that one could argue are more frequently undermined than those of bitcoin. You pick the one money that works best for you.",

That’s a chilling thought, isn’t it?firstlyif honest network is 800exa, then a malicious actor jumping in needs 808exa himself to then become 51% of new total.. not '390exa approx' the op suggestssecondlyif one agency was to use its disposable $60b+ to buy hardware. it wont find any hardware vendor able to meet its needs to supply such hardware in any short period of time. and most hardware vendors would not supply one entity with such amount even over time.. as they would see the threat(note: to have a fabricator to make own hardware costs ALOT more then billions, so they wouldnt spend $1t to get a fab to then make $60b of hardware in a shorter time to evade vendors issues)thirdly. the time it would take to mount up such millions of devices would incur a length of time where such entity would probably be running the small batches honestly, as a way to recoup some investment. by the time they reach an amount of hardware to 'flip the strategy' to then do an attack, they would realise they are then harming their own investment. shooting themselves in the foot(note: more profitable to be honest, no financial benefit being dishonest)fourthly a 51% attack means there is 50% hashrate in one controlling entity. but also the blocks are made 50% of the time by such entity. meaning the honest network still broadcasts blocks the other timenow if a dishonest entity wanted to edit the last block. in 2 blocks time the honest network sets the blocks straight again. thus the dishonest network is not really sealing an edited history into locked position, changing history forever.. but just temporarily messing with recent blocks. because to go back deep enough into history and then catch up and overtake the honest network enough to make old data edited and then locked for good requires alot more than 51% powerlastly by performing a 51%, they cant change the rules. they cant 'break' bitcoin. all they can do is mess around with the arrangement of just some recently confirmed transactions.. so a smart guy/gov with $60b spare hanging around wouldnt waste it on such a trivial thing that shoots themselves in the foot losing them $60b of funding which some chairmen or select committee or constituent would vote them out of their job if they tried",

This is primarily due to the diminishing mining rewards over time, which could reduce incentives for miners to invest in expanding their operations. Additionally, as older mining hardware becomes more accessible and affordable, it might lower the barrier for potential attackers to accumulate significant hashing power. This could make the feasibility of a 51% attack more realistic in the future, especially if the network’s total hash rate stagnates or declines.",
