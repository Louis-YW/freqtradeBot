Since you’re dealing with bitcoin and not fiat or other coins that has a centralized body that can freeze the funds of an account at any point in time, bitcoin is decentralized. The only thing you can hope for right now is to pray that the scammer link the transaction to a wallet address that is tied to a public profile (that might reveal his identity) but I doubt that’s ever going to happen.",

Unfortunately, the funds are under the control of a scammer right now, and you lost them forever. Unless you know the receiver in real life, you can't take action against him. Even if you file a case with a legal authority, if Bitcoin is legal in your country, it will cost you more. Just make sure you know where you are sending funds next time to avoid being scammed.",

Any way to recover my money?I do have the guys wallet ID and the transaction ID.Thankfully is was only 55.58663 mBTCI would like think that you actually know the person you sent the coins to in real life because if you don't it's quite foolish to send someone that certain amount of Bitcoin for the purchase of a physical item like a car. Well like other have already said, if the transaction is already confirmed then its impossible to recover back your funds because Bitcoin transaction are irreversible when the transaction has been confirmed but if it hasn't been yet then you can simply cancel the transaction because the coins would have not been picked up by a miner yet who are the ones responsible for processing a transaction when it has been broadcasted.",

Bitcoin is not a centralized asset that can be frozen when a complaint like this is made. But If the scammer sends the Bitcoin to a centralized exchange you can alert the exchange with proves that the owner scammed you during a business transactions. The cases where exchanges normally step in and freeze a scammer Bitcoin are mostly stolen or hacked Bitcoin that were traced to the exchange. I don't if you will have any luck recovering your bitcoin but you can still give it a try.",

Unless the person who scammed you sends the bitcoin back to you, The question is, how did he catch the dude?The story you gave is not very detailed, but as long as you were really scammed, there is usually nothing that the victims of the scammer recover, and the only thing you can do is accept and learn from the mistake you made in that matter. That transaction ID can't do anything either because it can only give you so much.",

Sure it looks convenient and the scammer convinced you it's safe, but trading with somebody you don't know and going first is just as risky as sending the cash to a post box.Once the transaction was confirmed there is not much you can do.Sure you can go to the police and file a report and maybe the scammer was stupid enough to cash out the btc at an exchange where he did KYC, but I doubt it.These people are professionals, who knows in which altcoin are what not your btc have already been exchanged or traded.Well, next time you know better I guess.

In addition, the person is a scammer, and con artists always act with their knowledge. He might even give you a wallet that he isn't using all that much because the wallet will just be used once or even make it so that you can't even trace it anywhere. I believe this will also be the last time you give a bitcoin to a fraudster. Before engaging in any exchange, be sure to research the people you'll be working with because many online are not to be trusted.I have seen someone scammed and they stole all his savings in his wallet, not even a single bitcoin is left there. If it is you, how will you feel? This thing tends to happen to newbies because some of them will not have experience sending someone who is capable of buying something with them. Therefore, we occasionally need to use caution online because there is always a high level of risk involved. However, if you exercise caution online, I don't think scammers will be able to take advantage of you as easily.",
