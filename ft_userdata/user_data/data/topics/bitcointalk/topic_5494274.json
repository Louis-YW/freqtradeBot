  "content": "https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2024/PSA240425Anyway, I would like to place my own \"alert\" here:Alert on Fiat Money Services BusinessesThe Legion of Bitcointalkers warn all Bitcoiners against using fiat money transmitting services that are not registered as Money Services Businesses (MSB) according to United States federal law (31 U.S.C. § 5330; 31 CFR §§ 1010; 1022) and claim to adhere to anti-money laundering requirements. A few simple steps can prevent intentional withholding of your funds. For example, avoid financial money institutions that collect know your customer (KYC) information from customers when not required.MSB REGISTRATIONThe FBI has scarcely conducted law enforcement operations against fiat money institutions which were insolvent in disccordance with federal law. People who use unlicensed fiat money institutions may encounter financial disruptions as a result of a lack of law enforcement actions, regardless of if their money is intermingled with funds obtained through illegal means.RISKY SERVICESFiat money transmitting services that purposely break the law or knowingly facilitate illegal transactions will not be investigated by law enforcement. Using a service that does not comply with its legal obligations may put you at risk of losing access to funds since law enforcement operations don't target those businesses.TIPS TO PROTECT YOURSELFBefore using a money transmitting service, check whether it is registered as an MSB with the US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). FinCEN provides a website where anyone can check whether a company is registered: https://www.fincen.gov/msb-state-selectorHowever, the inclusion of a business on the MSB Registrant Search web page is not a recommendation, certification of legitimacy, or endorsement of the business by any government agency.Beware of financial services that ask for KYC information including name, date of birth, address, and ID before allowing you to send or receive money or cryptocurrency.Understand that just because an app can be found in an app store does not necessarily mean it is an illegal service and is not complying with federal requirements.Avoid using services that advertise themselves for illegal purposes.Be cautious when using cryptocurrency services known to be used by criminals to launder their funds.The Legion of Bitcointalkers requests victims report fraudulent or suspicious activities to the Scam Accusations board at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0.Yes, I am taking the piss here, but do you really think these guys will let you use an exchange that is not an American public company like Coinbase and Kraken?",

Very unlikely There are many users here that wouldn't sacrifice their security and privacy for anything. KYC especially in centralized exchange beats the need for Bitcoin If we all going to do KYC, why still use something that promotes freedom and privacy. Coinbase is not registered in their SEC and am surprised Binance was even listed there.

I doubt it would anytime soon. The government are advocating for KYC with the reason to prevent money laundering Or terrorism funding. It would affect the market Big time if CEX falls It would be like breaking up from a toxic relationship Hurts in the time period but the best in the long run. But I would be Happy if decentralized platform becomes mainstay. Quote from: NotATether on April 26, 2024, 06:59:40 AMI find it quite ironic that USA is trying to put CZ in jail and then say that his exchange is safe, and non-KYC exchanges aren't. They playing the card of business as a legal entity Binance and CZ are separate entities that would be their argument. About Non KYC not been safe The government would never believe something they have no control or access to their data as been safe. Is like to them the citizens are not ready to be truly free.",

Government (whatever country) don't want us to be free, freedom = power, which means less power to them and all they want is more power to the point of us being nothing but obedient slaves.Let's not forget terrorists are a product of the government who decided to join wars and kill people in places far from their own.If your family was killed by US army or different army, wouldn't you seek revenge ? that's how terrorists are made, no one wakes up and while drinking morning coffee with his family decides to go to a different country and blow himself up.Government reminds of some firefighters who put fire when there is no fire just to stay relevant and earn money.It was never about our safety, it was always about power.",

Honestly, people shouldn't be using centralized exchanges to trade their BTC but it is a shame that only centralized exchanges have the required features, for traders especially.

Also, an announcement is more of a recommendation and a few threats (it's not legally binding).It's interesting that in the tips, they say that people should check whether a service is registered as an MSB, but then say that even if it is, it's \"not a recommendation\" and not \"certification of legitimacy\". They should get their tips right and sort things out before making announcements and writing tips.I agree with NotATether that the list is weird, and the logic is obscure (considering Binance).",
