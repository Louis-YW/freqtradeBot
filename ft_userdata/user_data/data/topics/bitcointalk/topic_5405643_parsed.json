  "content": "So for those who don't know, apparently, there's going to be another bitcoin conference in October of this year in Amsterdam.I understand the idea behind targeting more regions obviously but I just can't find anything about the speakers, the sponsors or the announcements on the official site. So I'm having some doubts about the quality of this event, especially after we had a similar one previously this year... do you think its worth attending? and with the lack of information, do you have any thoughts on what to expect?",

I don't feel like it's going to be a low quality event, although they haven't got any of the popular youtubers and twitter analysts. For those who didn't know, things like faketoshi being called a liar by Vitalik in the audience, or Trace Mayer laughed at for shilling an altcoin are what makes an event popular.",

Are you serious?Conferences that are serious about promoting bitcoin usage should be inviting speakers who have an actual stake in the crypto projects that are improving Bitcoin's position in the world, in order that they share what they are doing. [Eg. Bitmain, Lightning Labs, wallet developers, exchanges, policy makers, hedge fund managers with BTC portfolios, special action groups in local regions, etc.] not people who can only talk much and do nothing to help.",

I know that this is not common opinion because many people can afford them, but for my living standards, this is competly absurd! Onboarding for normies is difficult. If we charge prices of these magnitude we are just inviting the people already pilled with all colours. People that are still not receptive to the idea behing Bitcoin, aren't likely spending 250€, let alone 2990€ for entry tickets!This is the same as political parties parties. Only the ones already pilled by that same party will participate. It woul be the other way around so that others could listen what that party has to offer and try to bring voters from other parties to this party!I never attended these events due to the prices! And I've been promoting Bitcoin in my country in a pro bono mode, meaning I'm not charging anything. On the contrary, I always hope to get one more person than last time in the upcoming local events I may organize! If 1 more person shows up, it's a victory!",

I know that this is not common opinion because many people can afford them, but for my living standards, this is competly absurd! ~snip~The price may be too high, but considering that the venue is in Amsterdam, I believe that most people can afford to pay 250 EUR for three days, if we take into account that in the same city a pack of cigarettes costs around 8 EUR, which means that the average smoker smokes at least 50 + EUR per week if they smoke very moderately. Of course, from someone else's perspective, such prices seem absurdly overpriced, but the prices of some other things are not cheap either - for example, you won't be able to watch a live Champions League match for less than 70 EUR, not to mention the prices for the concerts of some popular singers.In addition, the organizers do not target those with shallow pockets - otherwise they would not have held such conferences in cities such as Miami or Amsterdam.",
