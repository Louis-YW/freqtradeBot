  "content": "This is a type of article that I love sharing about the blockchain and its adoption. It's filled with positivity and you can sense it already after reading the title itself. I mean there is one side of Europe or most of the developed nations there, crypto being humiliated with MiCA regulations and other restrictions on its usage. However, there are multiple institutions that are actually using the same technology on which Bitcoin runs that is Blockchain. Its adoption can be seen in the banking sector, digital securities, engineering sector, solar energy field, and investment institutes. If you take any sort of sector, blockchain can make those businesses prosper in some way or another. The article lists an example of well-known institutes or companies that have undertaken blockchain way more seriously as compared to other continents such as the USA which had a higher probability of using blockchain on a mass scale but they seemingly failed at it. Do you think such adoption is blissful for the progressive future of the blockchain and then cryptocurrencies along with them?QuoteFor a while now, European institutions have been showing signs of significant participation in the blockchain industry, demonstrating its range and impact on traditional finance.Banks and other major players have clearly paid attention to increased institutional demand for digital assets and built products accordingly. Blockchain’s potential to revolutionize the way the world does business is being recognized.European institutions are focusing on custody to digital finance strategy and tokenization — often outstripping the US for development and adoption.Below is a look at some initiatives by European financial institutions that demonstrate the blockchain space is maturing:Societe GeneraleFrance’s third biggest bank Societe Generale deployed the Ethereum contract for a euro-pegged stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), on April 20. The bank’s blockchain-focused subsidiary, Societe Generale-Forge said the new stablecoin will only be made available to institutional investors who are vetted through know your customer and anti-money laundering checks.EURCV will also be compliant with the Basel Committee’s prudential treatment of crypto asset exposures, which likely makes this offering robust in the eyes of European regulators.European Investment BankEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) launched its first sterling-denominated digital bond on Ethereum earlier this year.The EIB is the primary lender of the European Union, and its blockchain undertaking represents significant affirmation on behalf of the bloc.This move was followed by the EIB’s previous sales of euro-denominated digital bonds on Ethereum in 2021.Deutsche BörseGerman multinational Deutsche Börse in February chose Google Cloud to support its digital securities platform D7, which has an institutional-grade offering. It eventually intends to support “multiple blockchains and protocols.”SiemensGerman engineering titan Siemens in February issued a $65 million one-year bond on Polygon, in accordance with the country’s Electronic Securities Act.DekaBank, DZ Bank and Union Investment are among investors in the digital bond. ABN AMROIn January, Dutch bank ABN AMRO used the Stellar blockchain to issue a $492,000 bond on behalf of an aircraft parts company. The bank partnered with tokenization firm Bitbond and Fireblocks to facilitate custody.UBSWhile not a public blockchain, UBS issued a $370 million bond on the SIX Digital Exchange blockchain platform, geared towards regulated tokenized offerings. The bond was also sold on the Six Swiss exchange. The three-year bond carries a 2.33% coupon.Investors could choose to clear the bond on either SDX or on SIX.BNP ParibasIn July last year, BNP Paribas tokenized a bond to fund a solar energy project under French utility giant EDF using Ethereum.The move enabled investments of smaller amounts, enabling the development of smaller renewable energy projects.Banco SantanderIn Sept. 2019, Spanish bank Banco Santander issued itself a $20 million bond, which it said was the first end-to-end blockchain on the Ethereum mainnet. The bond matured in a year, paying 1.98% returns every quarter.More recently, the bank is reportedly testing a blockchain-based tokenization platform to transfer car ownership of used cars in Brazil.JPMorgan JPMorgan is not to be left behind. The US banking giant executed trials for foreign transactions in November, using Aave and Uniswap as directed by Singapore’s central bank.Although, the trial wasn’t technically for the benefit of the US. The trade was part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian pilot, which aims to explore DeFi applications.Real Examples of European Institutions Using Public Blockchains",

      "body": "So it seems that banks are talking shit about bitcoin on one side and on the other side, using the power of cryptocurrency for their own gain and convenience! That's quite interesting and this again proves that banking system is a double faced evil. I am surprised to see the name of JPMC here! Their CEO Jemie Dimon has maintained a very strong anti-crypto stance. So it's quite fascinating to see their name in the list. It's good that banks are slowly coming to realise the power of crypto and embracing it.",
