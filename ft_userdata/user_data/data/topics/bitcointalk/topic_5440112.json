  "content": "Within the last one year of my presence here on Bitcointalk and with the level of contributions and help I have gain in the last 10 months here in the forum, and just a few steps away from becoming a senior member, I deem it fit to drop my view and advise to newbies looking to grow the knowledge and financial stability through Bitcoin investment. 1: First newbies, please don't be deceived, bitcoin is not a     get rice scheme and at that the real riches of Bitcoin is     I'm your knowledge and not the amount you are aiming     to accumulate over time, so you may have the capital to     buy Bitcoin but if you don't have the right knowledge you     can still lose everything, you can see that from the     experience of those who stored their Bitcoin on     exchanges such as FTX and the rest of the other crashed     exchanges. 2:  Be ready to wait for God know how long, Bitcoin      shouldn't be taken as an ASAP investment allow time to      pass give your Bitcoin a long period of time, take your      lesson from those who bought Bitcoin in the early days      when Bitcoin price was in the range of cent and $1 and      locked the Bitcoin away for long and now they call     whales so they patience paid off give your Bitcoin a long    time-spacee to mature. 3:  Dont hold alternative cryptocurrencies for the long term      and if you must own them just know you are just      gambling with your money, because they can go      from100 to 0, so altcoin is worthless for the long term. 4: In your quest to make a few bulls from bitcoin trading    don't trade a bit of what you have not built knowledge and    trading skills because that is what will facilitate your    profits in trading. In conclusion, Newbies take this forum seriously and after you have read the rules of the forum, also take time to read about wallets and wallet securities don't trust anyone on the Internet. Bitcointalk is a free discussion forum made up of members with a wealth of knowledge and the only price you must pay to gain your freedom is to keep reading and comparing knowledge make your personal research and draw your conclusion in line with acceptable data and codes.",

The first rule of investment also says invest in those assets of which you have knowledge about or if not gain knowledge for them and then invest your money into it.Those people who ignore it invest in hope to earn some quick profits but when it's not happening they start panicking calling it scam or ponzi selling their coins which is a mistake.Secondly the biggest issue is keeping your funds on these CEX who are in actual possession of your keys through which they can easily spend your funds so you are not owning any bitcoins if they are on CEX so take it out and store them on hardware wallets or non custodial wallets like Electrum with safety of your seed phrases.Learn more about wallets hereQuote from: Ojima-ojo on February 16, 2023, 10:01:53 PM3:  Dont hold alternative cryptocurrencies for the long term      and if you must own them just know you are just      gambling with your money, because they can go      from100 to 0, so altcoin is worthless for the long term. On the contrary I would say if you are newbie then investing in shitcoins is the biggest mistake you will make in hope of diversifying your portfolio because bitcoin is the only best option for you while those altcoins are pump dump scheme to make profits for the whales only.You can check on CMC how top-10 have changed instead of bitcoin which remains always at the top.The main reason behind it there's no utility for these altcoins so no long term price surge but if you can trade it short term you can give it a shot but as newbie stay away from it.",

Learning from other people's mistake is something that doesn't happen often with new commers.Most of the people that leaves cryptocurrency space disappointed are people that were supposed to get rich quick within the few months of getting into Bitcoin.I always tell the newcomers that those who became super rich through bitcoin are few of them that adopted bitcoin when it was worth nothing.For now you cannot make big fortune through bitcoin unless you are ready to invest a huge amount of money and wait for the minimum of five years",

Never you store the seed phrase to your wallet carelessly because that's the key to your fund.This is important especially when it comes to assets, so they should be able to keep the seed phrase as a private key securely in place and only the only one who knows the safe friend is one more never save on an exchange because it is high risk it is better to store in a non-custodial wallet.Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on February 17, 2023, 05:05:05 PM2.

Of course, beginners have to learn a lot, of course, about how to improve in forums, especially in posting contributions. I'm sure they can do that as long as they really want to pursue it and implement it.There are many threads about how to rank up, of course accompanied by quality posts.",

Bitcoin is a top project in the market and it have high volatility which results to the massive dump and pump if the market. I'm holding bitcoin with my ultimate goal to allow it to make a bull run up to $100k. Patience is highly practiced when dealing with bitcoin, it's either you make profits or loss, each action will be triggered. Bitcoin can take up to a year before it pumps, there's more chances to pump when the bull season comes, but presently the bear market is everywhere.",

A big congratulation for your one year journey on this forum and for becoming a senior member on this forum. Hope you have learned a lot and will continue to learn throughout your journey here.Quote1: First newbies, please don't be deceived, bitcoin is not a     get rice scheme and at that the real riches of Bitcoin is     I'm your knowledge and not the amount you are aiming     to accumulate over time, so you may have the capital to     buy Bitcoin but if you don't have the right knowledge you     can still lose everything, you can see that from the     experience of those who stored their Bitcoin on     exchanges such as FTX and the rest of the other crashed     exchanges. The ultimate goal is not only to learn about bitcoin or cryptocurrency but also to learn how to keep them safe. In this time we have many cases where people lose their coins, the people who is losing their bitcoins are mostly aware of crypto but don't know how to deal with the security. Exchanges are not the safest place to store your assets, keep them in a private wallet to keep them safe. Quote2:  Be ready to wait for God know how long, Bitcoin      shouldn't be taken as an ASAP investment allow time to      pass give your Bitcoin a long period of time, take your      lesson from those who bought Bitcoin in the early days      when Bitcoin price was in the range of cent and $1 and      locked the Bitcoin away for long and now they call     whales so they patience paid off give your Bitcoin a long    time-spacee to mature. Most of the newbies in crypto things bitcoin is just a get rich quick scheme, but it is the opposite of this. Here, you need a lot of patient and holding power if want any kind of return. Although patient needs in any kind of investment to see the results you expected.",

Most of the tips for becoming a better trader in the cryptocurrency space have been seen and understood by those who have been here for a while. The market's ups and downs, as well as the crisis, have opened many people's eyes. Those who have learned and continue to be victims of such should be termed due to negligence and should be allowed to live by their own fate.

How to know a good trader and investor ,you will observe that from their start up point they would be more interested to know, keen to imbibe the knowledge about what they're about to go into. For them the knowledge in the beginning is the first and most important factor before anything else like wanting to trade because they feel by trading profit will yield immediately. It's only those newbies that put their minds on the bull run profit from their start up stage that end up vomiting the little they have to scammers cause they have no idea of what the industry is all about , who is who, like they wanna earn before they learn, what a wrong way to go.",
