It uses high interest rates to defraud your funds and sell transactions. The tokens were defrauded of your money. My friend went to the exchange’s discord to ask about the withdrawal because he was unable to withdraw money. After that, he was deleted and kicked out of the group. Please tell everyone not to be greedy and deceived when sharing publicity. Exchange website: https://www.bitxonex.com/     <----Scam exchange",

Exchange website: https://www.bitxonex.com/     <----Scam exchangeYeah the site seems to be a tricky scam exchange, that is one good move(like what other site does specially in gambling sites) that will let you deposit and withdraw small amount but when there is a big transaction then expect that you will never get money back and yes you will be doomed once you engage to this siteQuote from: yhangmhany22 on November 11, 2023, 02:30:17 PMIt's true. The goal of these schemes is to trick users into investing more money so they'll allow you to withdraw some small money to gain your trust. One of my readers reported this exchange to me so i ended up writing a review >>> https://www.earnmorecashtoday.com/bitxonex-review/ <<<good that you share reviews mate and you are also correct to let your friends know about this scamsite to never fall to the same trap ever.",
