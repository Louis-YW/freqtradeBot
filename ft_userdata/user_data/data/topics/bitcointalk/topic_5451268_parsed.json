More precisely this game is a merger between the game and gambling.",

It's just the question whether this sites can be trusted or not, because you have to create an account and deposit money and then play. But you have to check whether its provably fair or not, so that is the big question.And to be honest, it seems that the website is not professionally made, I don't know, maybe it's just me.So for those who are willing to take the risk, then it's up to you, just saying.",

I still rely mostly in gambling boards in the forum where legal gambling casinos are listed. Maybe if you can provide some screenshots of your winning results from those gaming sites, I can somehow consider myself taking risk on them.

That's the question, if they pay you for how long will it gonna take or they'll just be there for some time and if nothing uses them frequently anymore they'll just vanish out of thin air.

Although you need coins to play at these sites and you can redeem the winning coins into fiat money.First time I'm hearing of it. Kind of scared how the moment I looked it up, a bunch of sites offered its APK file version but seeing as a few others have said that their friends use it, I don't think it would go as a scam. I do reckon they just offer the same types of games though, simplified slots, dice, and stuff like that. I hardly doubt you can call them 'gaming sites', if you're definition was the same as mine (since I tend to separate clear-cut gambling games from \"games\" itself). I did find how orion stars (and probably a few others) are sweepstake games though, so I don't think it can be considered gambling (afaik the US technically doesn't count sweepstakes as gambling since it's free entry).",
