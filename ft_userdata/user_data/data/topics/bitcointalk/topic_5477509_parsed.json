  "content": "My country people, happy Christmas in advance. so far say our  LB don dey  use style take dey organized, and all thanks to our oga Dem like Agbe and co wey dey work together to make sure say our local make sense and free from spam.  So far, we know say many of us get other things wey we dey do for real life aside from crypto and many of dis things suppose need promotion. And these days, many people dey like case Dem business online dat na becos, na online business dey fit reach wider people and help bring more customers for business. So dis one con make me think say weather e no go dey important to get one thread wey we go fit dey show case our business. E go dey more like d service board. But since we no get dat kind board and Dem never still grant us d ones wey we dey ask for, We go just create am as one thread for we local board. For d thread, you gofit show case d service wey you dey offer and post am as reply for inside there. Any transactions or what so ever deal wey you get with person for forum here. You go need to post am. Dat wan go be for security reasons to avoid scam or theft.The major reason y I dey bring dis matter up na be say Christmas don reach, dis wan na season wey people dey need to sell Dem goods and since d forum no dey against services, then we supposed fit dey bring our business or service, post for we local board. Abeg watin Una think about this wan make una reason am. if e make scenes, make una do suggestion so we oga Dem go add an join we requested childboard or Dem go help create and moderate the thread.",

      "body": "Na good idea when you just bring so although for the introductory post when our snr bross @cryptoprenurebrainboss create, I see say most persons indicate their skill and the kind of jobs when them de do for real life and from their you go understand say we get plenty people for the forum when de do extremely well for different sectors for we country.If like say we get sub board like services, na him for sharp pass as e go de easier to fit put out some of the services when we fit render and some too when we fit hire some of our members to help run am for us. I think the advocacy for the child board already de ground and hopely when we get am, even if e no plenty, we fit see how we go make the best out of am but for now I believe say if you get serious thing when you feel say if you share with the board members e go de of benefit to all although e fit no too relate to Bitcoin, I doubt say the board no go accept am.",

If to say dem nor dey make, Dem for no dey do am, and WhatsApp  dey restricted to just your contact, then talk more of this forum wey na everybody go dey see your post. But wattin I get against this idea na be say, this forum almost everybody dey use guy name wey no be their real name, and that na one of the things wey dey make the forum dey anonymous. So what if person come carry your money run, there is no way wey you go fit  track that person. So e Dem go create that kind board make Dem put rules, wey go make people fear to scam other, like trade with caution, or make sure say una do physical transaction, or person wey scam go chop negative tag. So that we no go dey hear, I was scammed .",

At least any deal for here go get transparency and can easily be traced back in terms of unsuccessful full deal between two parties. At least we go even dey know members wey go fit dey trustedfor real life (off forum). You don bring d idea and na good one but make we hear oda people opinions, including d Oga’s dem here to hear their own side of the idea before dem go fit include am for our sub boards if dem come later approve am for us. Dis community dey bring better ideas and dis thing dey really give me joy wella. Make we keep up d good work here.",

I was thinking of market place thread where people will go there and buy or sell there goods but it must a payment on delivery to avoid scamming and other stories that touch the brain. Me anything I dey buy online I must see di thing before paying and if no see forget so if we can do like that then you can initiate the thread. Even if someone sells Bitcoin make the buy pay before releasing the coins and that is the international practice. And one thing we must know, personal information are not allowed here always be in anonymous. What you bring e dey okay. But be careful with buying and selling because we no know each other.",

Na beautiful idea OP bring so and if this idea go well, we go happy for that milestone. We get plenty companies wey I believe say go like advertise. We get big brands here in Nigeria such as Betway, Sportpesa, 22Bet amongst others who will be interested to sell their products and services here in the forum and this will be the best opportunity for them to actualise that dream. But I believe our bosses in the forum like BrainBoss, Igbebotz , etc must have thought of this before or probably pushed this idea earlier because I know they are wise men and are always looking for the best for us. I will be glad to see their comments on this thread to also know their opinion concerning this matter.",

      "body": "The idea de good because I don see say di forum no be only about Bitcoin, matter, e de accommodate oda discussions wey no concern cryptocurrency. I don even see for some boards wey some members de advertise dem work and people de show interest to patronize dem. Aldo e for good if OP tell us some kinds of businesses wey im feel say we fit run for di forum? Because I believe say na only service businesses na im we fit do for forum, I no know weda buying and selling go de possible, based on say na anonymous forum be dis. How we wan take supply goods wey the identity of di buyer no go reveal? So if we go get service thread, that wan go good, but I no go too support advert of physical goods, e go just be thread to advertise services wey you fit to share with customers or clients online. The most important aspect go be to get reputable members wey go fit do escrow services for di thread, or become our local trusted Marchant wey we go fit do p2p transactions with, instead of going to exchanges to change our coins to fiat.",
