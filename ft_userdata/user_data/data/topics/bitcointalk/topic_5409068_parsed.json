Churchill         The Russian army invaded Ukraine with the aim of denazification and demilitarization of the country, this is the official version of the Kremlin. Putin believes that the power in Ukraine is in the hands of the Nazis, who must be deprived of weapons and destroyed. If we take into account Putin’s opinion that Ukrainians as a people do not exist, because Ukrainians are Russians, that is, those who speak Russian and are the state-forming people of Russia, then by denazification I mean depriving Ukraine of Ukrainians as a nation. Before Putin, no one called Ukrainians fascists, and if Putin manages to achieve his goal, then there will be no more Ukrainians in Ukraine, and the population of the country will be Russian. If so, then the Ukrainian language, as the language of a non-existent people, must disappear, and in the schools of the former Ukraine all classes will be conducted in Russian. Ukraine as a country together with its people will become history. Dot.   This is the end result that Putin and the Russian people who support him wholeheartedly want, regardless of the very small percentage of the doubting part of Russian intellectuals, most of whom are on Putin's side. Strange as it may seem, but among my friends there are, by the way, Jews. For myself, I could not find an explanation for this phenomenon.     In the media, along with the definition of fascists, there is also a derivative - rashists, that is, Russian fascists, by analogy with German fascists. The question involuntarily arises, so which of them are actually fascists, Ukrainians, who are usually called neo-fascists in Russia, or rashists?     Naturally, the answer will have to be sought in comparison with the already well-known fascists from the Second World War. What are the signs of fascism?    First of all, totalitarianism and dictatorship. If we compare the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, then there is no reason to call Zelensky a dictator, he was recently elected to the presidency. Before him, there was Poroshenko, whom, it must be understood, Moscow also considers the leader of the fascist regime, because it was under Poroshenko that the Russian army invaded Ukraine in order to save the Russians from the fascists there, while capturing Crimea and Donbass. Putin, on the other hand, has been sitting in the Kremlin for the third decade, and during this time he rewrote the Constitution for himself in such a way that it cannot be called democratic, in fact, the country's Basic Law has become a guarantor of his sole power. So it’s not the Jew Zelensky who is more suitable for the role of modern Hitler, but Putin, who is called Putler behind his back. True, his horse tried to blurt out something about the connection of the Jews with Hitler, but as soon as Israel only had an eye on it, Putin hastened to apologize for ruining the air of the old horse.    Further, a characteristic feature of fascism is armed aggression against other countries. There is no fact that Ukraine has done something similar. But Russia managed to fight in Georgia and Syria, defending the bloody dictator Assad, and finally attacked Ukraine, whose cities are now indistinguishable from Stalingrad, destroyed during World War II. The traces of atrocities, vandalism and hatred left by the Russian soldier on Ukrainian soil do not differ, and perhaps even surpass in cruelty the signs characteristic of German fascism.    The fascist state is characterized by militarization. Before the Russian invasion, there is no sign of the militarization of Ukraine. On the contrary, the Ukrainians, as you know, transferred their nuclear weapons to Russia in exchange for a guarantee of their territorial integrity, moreover, for the sake of profit, the Ukrainians sold the conventional weapons available in the country, if possible, to anyone who was willing to pay for it. In other words, the idea that Ukraine was going to attack someone could hardly have occurred to anyone. In Russia, on the contrary, special attention is paid to militarization and the military-patriotic education of young people. A huge chunk of the budget is allocated to the creation of new types of weapons, which Putin has repeatedly demonstrated in the pictures, threatening America to use them if necessary. Instead of international sports competitions, from where Russia was expelled due to doping, the dictator organized military competitions in death machines, the so-called \"tank biathlon\". Comparing Russian preparations for war with Ukrainian slovenliness and disregard for the security of their country and at the same time accusing Kyiv of fascism can either be a fool or a liar and slanderer. To call the Ukrainian government, headed by the Jew Zelensky, fascist, the language does not turn, but the Putin regime, by all indications, cannot be distinguished from German fascism. It seems that Chekist Putin, being in the service in Berlin, communicated with the spirit of Hitler and was imbued with his ideas, in which the state is above human life (1), and today the granddaughters of Molotov, who concluded an agreement of friendship and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany with Hitler, accuses Ukraine in fascism, is this not the hypocrisy of the Empire of Lies? (2)   Through Putin's efforts, lies have become the calling card of modern Russia. However, there is nothing to be surprised here, the whole history of Russia is saturated with lies and this lie is carefully guarded by the Kremlin authorities. the feeling of this freedom, as Moscow did before World War II, which it unleashed together with fascist Germany, this is the reality that awaits the Ukrainian people if the so-called “special military operation” succeeds. It is a “special”, and not just a military operation, because its goal is to clean up the territory of Ukraine from Ukrainian, by Putin’s definition, fascists, that is, the Ukrainian nation, which Putin called quite accurately and in accordance with fascist ideology - denazification.    I want to summarize this with the words of a yard hooligan from St. Petersburg, which in this case is very out of place: \"Whoever calls names, that's what they call\"   Yet the great seer Winston Churchill was right.      1.
