      "body": "Sorry about duplicate announcements and posts. Its also been a while since i posted here and sometimes unsure where to put it or if in multiple diff areas is ok as it pertains to both. I do take constructive criticism and also the listens and worries of the people here. We have some really smart people here and veterans of the crypto world. Helping to garner trust, partnerships and the likes as this is a great forum and community as a whole.It is custodian free as the coins are in your wallet. We do not have any cold or hot wallets and do not store or keep your crypto. All transactions happen on the fly. The said exchanges and services support liquidity for the actual exchanges. Before you would even send your coins you would be alerted if more information such as KYC was needed. This is usually due to the IP//Location you are transacting from. The amount is quite excessive ect. An if you do not want to proceed you can simply back out as you did not send the appropriate funds still to complete the swap//transaction.Also this may pertain more to selling or purchasing tokens with a bank or credit card as for obvious fraud reasons ect. I have not seen any issues with simple cross chain swaps or from one coin to the other.",

Truth is, there are so many \"instant exchanges\" around here that use the same concept, but they come out clean about it and don't claim that they are custodian free. They are also clear about the KYC/AML policies because it's inevitable, at one point the exchange they are having a partnership may flag and block a transaction. This happens because some people actually think that an instant exchange can also be used to mix coins",

      "body": "Sorry for late response. All is true in what you are saying and also us. We are non-custodial as we never hold your coins. The exchanges are done through 3rd party liquidity providers similar to a DEX basically. Many larger exchanges provide this liquidity. The KYC with some of our partnerships even ourselves do not know. I have not see any issue from myself using the service nor of anyone else yet. We are still very new and looking to promote, brand and garner the trust which is not easy. We are not offering our service as some illegal mixer. An sure there are other exchanges and similar. We also grab news from some of the more major news outlets surrounding crypto, blockchain and NFTs ect. Most every exchange requires you to sign up. Sometimes you just want to trade or swap your BTC for ETH or ETH for BNB and dont feel like going through the process. More so some cryptos are not offered in users countries which i think is not fair. BNB being one of them. We just look to provide a service to all that it may help and make their life easier. We are not trying to be the next binance or coinbase. Competition is surely big but that is any online business. Sure there are a ton of news sites, porn sites, game sites ect but it dosent mean that one cannot be viable or useful to another user or member. I appreciate constructive criticism, ideas, help, marketing opportunities ect from all members.",

It is a changenow.io widget, only integrated on the site. I believe he's just taking some referral profit here.This is good to know if we look at trust from the side, changenow is still a better-known service. However, he is only an intermediary here and it can be very complicated and unsafe in some situations.",

      "body": "Don't claim that you are a non-custodial exchange because you aren't. ChangeNOW also makes such claims and calls themselves \"free of custody\" and similar terms. I was just playing around with the swap window to check the rates. To initiate a swap, I have to send my coins/tokens to an address displayed on screen. Where is the private key for that address? If you were non-custodial, I wouldn't have to ask you. If something goes wrong, I can't get to my coins by myself. I would have to get in touch with your customer support or perhaps one of your partner exchanges. And you would probably still not help me regain access to my crypto without KYC. That's not how a non-custodial service operates.",

      "body": "Appreciate the responses. Yes we work with changenow. Looking to build out on an API and future swapping procedures when i raise a bit of funding to hire a dev. The service is safe and we are non-custodial as we don't hold any funds. The address the funds are being sent to is for the exchange to happen. This is all routed via API and on chain. As far as KYC it is not needed unless the transaction is flagged as suspicious. What would be suspicious is up to the system and i cannot give much more on this. Although things like sanctioned countries such as North Korea were to try and swap then yes this may trigger a KYC and a hold. Where the coins would be held that is a good question so i can see the concern with it not being non-custodial. I know they tie into a few liquidity pools such as binance ect. We are here to be transparent. Thanks for the concerns.",
