I am trying to deal with a scammer myself that have scammed many people and still counting.I think yes. Contact the owner of Tether, and report the address, if there are several encounter and issues on that regarding scam maybe thry can take a look and investigate. Most likely being hold are those with big transactions and if caught right away. Tether has recorded to hold some wallet asset before, so its possible just needef some justification and evidence to that.",

Prove everything to them as what you're saying.",
