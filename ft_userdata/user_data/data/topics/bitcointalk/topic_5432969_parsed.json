Will this be acceptable by non Islamic users to also participate in using it as as a currency?2. Do you think this crypto falling under a religious covering will get all it takes to have the people's interest both Muslim and non Muslim?3. How reliable could this be from other shitcoins that are found to cease from existence after a fake project launch, isn't this just a title used to ensure people got persuaded under a religion?4. Is cryptocurrency allowed under the Islamic law?",

But am also very sure that the name Islamic coin may not have any relation with any believe or set of people but just a random name for a new coin.

Is cryptocurrency allowed under the Islamic law? The fact that the coin is bearing Islamic as a code name it doesn't mean it must follow all Islamic laws which is not achievable using blockchain, and as long as the coin get listed on the exchange everyone will have access to it, the purpose for coin development is to be used as medium of payment and exchange for goods and services.! Crypto coin cant be restricted to only a few segment of people.",

Besides that, just because someone created a cryptocurrency and told it's an \"Islamic Coin\", it doesn't mean every religious people will see this as legit, because even a non-believer can create a crypto and call it Islamic to generate hype and revenue for himself, just for financial purposes.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work because they aren't meant to a single religion, group or niche of society. It's for everyone, doesn't matter from where they are and on what they believe. So I think you should have that in mind when choosing where to invest your money in crypto universe. There is no reason for FOMO due to the crypto you mentioned. Investors aren't missing anything, to say the truth.",

There's that one day there will be a post that it isn't recognized by the religion and of course the value will go down instantly. It's not kind of a token that we all want to have in our portfolio.

And unsurprisingly it seems they do not have any kind of limit when it comes to the strings they are willing to pull so they can scam people.",

If I were you, I would pay no attention to such projects and stay focused on bitcoin. In addition, we have seen how such projects eventually fail and cause losses to investors.

I think, that this is just another crypto \"project\" that tries to create some attention by using a name that everyone knows. This have happened a lot of times before but most of such projects were just stupid meme-coins that did not really offer anything except a catchy name.If you name your project Islamic Coin then you probably do this because there are 1,8 Billion Muslims in the world and as far as i know the Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world.
