  "content": "I go to the local swim holes to \"work\" on physical rounds (hammering serial numbers/locations). Mainly just to be surrounded with good vibes and a peaceful environment. It gives me a chance to interact with others and spread the word. I use my latest brass pieces as barter. Recently I have made many trades involving the physical 10k Satoshi rounds. Tips for meals, ice cream for the family, chickens and farm animals ext. Today I made a nice trade that I'm proud of.   I found a guy deep in the Puerto Rico rainforest mountains that traded guanabana coconut pistachio moonshine for a 10k Sat CT brass piece holo #65, Stamped #15 PR.    He valued 1 pint between $20-$30usa. It was a good enough trade for me. I'm just happy the trade took place. I may make a deal with him if he can guarantee alcohol is between 40-50% in his batches. He manufactures the shine and we will add it to the Caribbean Treasures brand arsenal. As it too is an authentic Caribbean Treasure, made from our backyard of El Yunque. LFG!!!!Currently not for sale, but might be soon for bitcoin.  !!!",

These sell for around $35ea. funded. I'd guess these will be more collectable as they will be circulating physical bitcoin pieces for goods and services. Not just some shiny piece sitting in the safe never to be seen or held. My hope is they show signs of wear eventually.",

I do gold and silver every day too, but this was my favorite brass physical btc trade.  I have more stories if you'd like them. The funniest ones are when you are shut down and denied because they say it has no value.    Some people are still stuck in the system. I have removed myself from that shit as much as possible.",

Would the alcohol level be closer to 1005 proof as a moonshine though? Is it distilled like they do with potato moonshine?  Bottoms up mate! Thanks! I barter daily as a way of life. I enjoy it.  Guanabana is a large fruit that grows locally. My tree produces basketball size fruit once a year. The rest of the year it produces smaller fruit. I'd guess because we get more rain during that time. It has a white flesh that is very sweet and reminds me of cotton candy or something simular. High in fiber. Officially moonshine has to be 40% and can be as high as 90%. This one was about 50% Alc and to get the proof you just double the % ...so it would be 100 proof. I prefer 40-50% because it just taste better. I'm out here trying to enjoy myself, not kill myself and taste buds lol  .  The difference in volume needed to feel the effect is very minimal when comparing 40% to 90%. I go for the better taste. Also, the term moonshine can mean different things in different areas. Any alcoholic spirit (40%+) that is made without paying tax is my definition of a moonshine. So all that moonshine you see in the grocery store with a tax stamp, isn't real moonshine.",
