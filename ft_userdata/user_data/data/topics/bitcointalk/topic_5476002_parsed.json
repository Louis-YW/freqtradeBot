      "body": "I have filled out a survey form with several categories that the bc game provides via google docs, I like the experience of similar surveys even though it has only been a few, and purely from what I feel, a good and fast first impression. Happy to explore bc game. I think many users want to do surveys if they take the time, at most 5 minutes and the access in your web game is friendly to view. I hope I can join other bc game challenges in the future. don't hesitate if you want to send me a PM.",

But not withstanding, I attempted to register on your casino  through the email option but I think there is an issue somewhere as I got a response; you can see it on the uploaded picture. Just as Shasan has asked you, I will also ask you similar question. What is the guarantee that after taking the survey you will pay the $10 as you have promised without any other procedures involved and also without demanding for KYC since you are issuing the survey rewards on your casino platform.Lastly, will the $10 rewards be withdrawable from your casino without any issues or challenges because I know there are some people who would prefer making withdrawal after receiving the rewards.",

Maybe it's only 2 days of this event or still need time for other survey participants, but I'm optimistic that bc games are capable, because it's easy and unconditional, especially without minimum rank, or user stability.
