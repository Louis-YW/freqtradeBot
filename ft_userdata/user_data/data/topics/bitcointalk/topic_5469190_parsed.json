Hence for now they are just storing the coins in the wallet and not touching it. We might see ups and downs in the price of the coin during the last of November and December, as people are will try to accumulate more Bitcoins at that time for the bull run.",

Prices will never be at these prices again in future and one should simple start investing with DCA Strategy. We might see a huge weekly green dildo soon.",

Unfortunately for those who hope that Bitcoin will become less volatile over time, though, it doesn't look like a consistent trend yes, as 2020 and 2021 were more volatile than 2016, for instance. Moreover, while volatility is the lowest over the last decade, I wouldn't call these numbers \"extremely quiet\", as even 30-40% change of average value in one month is actually a lot.",

I think this is the result of the honest reviews by most of its investors because they are promoting it honestly without cherry-picking and also giving the people honest advice in case they want to start investing in bitcoins.",

Bitcoin is going to be useful to get rich slow, not to hit the jackpot, as in the first cycles. I've been thinking the same thing since we didn't go over $69K in this cycle, and I don't believe any of the predictions that give outlandish results for the next cycle.",

However, a sustained period of low volatility could prove challenging for Bitcoin as the probability of a significant movement will be less likely.Really? If it's going to lose the whole of its volatility, how can a long-term efficient accumulation be processed, how this market will grow in a cyclical order? How we will feel this excitement while spending time with BTC? I don't give a shit to those investors who are afraid of temporary pumps and dumps. I think more mature investors are gonna step into the market even with its volatility. I think this volatility is the beauty of the market.Anyway, It's really considerable that Bitcoin is not coming up with big moves but does that matter if Bitcoin hasn't shown up with such patterns for a small interval? Hmm as the market is growing in mature hands it really affecting the volatility. For the latest as you have a look here on the heat map, I think it would be interesting to see how the market behaves in this scenario.

More big names accepting crypto or news coming out that they are involved in investing in them, the more this stability consolidates.However dont take this as an indication of the future trend. We still have more than two months before the year ending. Sudden changes in crypto are not uncommon even though the yearly volatility usually remains under 15%.Overall, bitcoin is a good asset for long term investment, there is not doubt in this statement.",

In general, this may indicate that Bitcoin is increasingly perceived as an asset for long-term holding, and not just another speculation for trading on the exchange. This is also evidenced by data that the number of bitcoins in illiquid wallets continues to increase. At the moment it is more than 14,500,000 BTC:This will also serves as a reminder for those who have been passionate in knowing the track record of bitcoin volatility over the years, there have been both bear and bull season and the market has also been favourable for it investors who can hodl to experience a surge in the market price, people have chosen bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies because it's actions are irrevocable and trusted, when it falls, it rises again, also to others that have been creating unnecessary fear of missing out on bitcoin each time bthe market dips, this is also an explanation on why they can remain with bitcoin because of its long time consistency.",

And during the 2021 bull run followed by the bear market in 2022, the all-time low by that year was $16000 and that's just close to $15000 which was like 5 times more than the 2018 ATL. Everyone is seeing the need not to sell too early and we're all being serious and learned from the past years that these cycles happening on Bitcoin are real and backing it up with accurate data makes more sense. It's a no-brainer that many have learned the effect of halving and what it does to Bitcoin both in its technical and economic aspects.",

As the number of bitcoin holders grows, so does the number of bitcoins in those wallets, as individuals regard the currency as more of an asset than just currency for daily needs. As a result, the volatility has not made much of a pump or a dump this year even when hit with some negative news that could dump the market. This behaviour indicates that bitcoin will make significant gains in the approaching bull season, as no significant drops have occurred. If the market continues to rise in a bullish trend and rises by the percentage it usually does during a bull run, we will see a very high bull to signify a relatively high ATH that may double the current ATH.",

The price seems quite stable, and very rarely are we seeing high volatility. It's most probably because holders don't want to sell and there are fewer new buyers as well. That means buyers and sellers are almost the same; when there is a difference, we see a little volatility. But that isn't countable or volatile compared to other years. I will say it's not bad at all; it's more of a natural growth than a pump dump. People should realise holding Bitcoin is worthy now, and it's just not a pump-and-dump game.",

But if the weaker hands are fewer in number than people who actually believe in BTC and will hold it for a very long time, then volatility would surely be reduced and we'll get a certain level of stability in the price of BTC.Quote from: Poker Player on October 04, 2023, 02:33:37 PMI've been thinking the same thing since we didn't go over $69K in this cycle, and I don't believe any of the predictions that give outlandish results for the next cycle. You may be right, even though i do not have a strong opinion on this yet. I think many of these predictions are 'hanging' on the approval of BTC spot etf's in the U.S., so many believe that if there is an approval, the price would skyrocket. I don't know what is going to happen, neither am i so interested in BTC spot etf's because i believe in not your keys, not your coins, but very soon i think the sec would budge and approve at least one BTC spot etf application, it could very well be that of Blackrock, then we'll see what it does to the price.",
