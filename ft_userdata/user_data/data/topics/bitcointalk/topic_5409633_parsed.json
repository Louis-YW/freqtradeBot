You will like them even more now that they are getting their own military... 87,000 new IRS agents, many with assault rifles, and wearing police uniforms to scare people into obedience.EXCLUSIVE: IRS annual report shows heavily armed agents training to shoot PEOPLE-SHAPED TARGETS… IRS is building a massive paramilitary force armed with “weapons of war”Quote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-irs-annual-report-shows-heavily-armed-agents-training-to-shoot-people.html#The IRS Criminal Investigations annual report from 2021 touts photos of IRS rifle fire teams and IRS “police” shooters taking aim at rows of targets that represent American taxpayers.A close inspection of the targets reveals they are not circular rifle targets that might be used in rifle competitions. They are people-shaped targets that are used to desensitize federal agents to the shooting and killing of human beings.The human beings represented by these targets are, of course, American taxpayers.Even after the IRS collected a record $4.1 trillion in recent months, it’s never enough. The American taxpayer must be threatened at gunpoint, raided with rifle teams and terrorized with the hiring of 87,000 new IRS agents who will of course selectively target conservatives, Christians and Trump supporters.Here’s one of the IRS rifle teams practicing an armed assault on a taxpayer, wielding what Democrats call “weapons of war” that they claim don’t belong on the streets of America:...",

I think pretty much everybody wants to see this ridiculous waste of money reversed. The whole gun training thing is just the icing on the cake. Hard to believe it is even real. What a bad political decision.",

      "body": "^^^ I haven't looked at IRS paperwork for a long time. So I ask... Years ago the IRS said in many of their pamphlets that the income tax was voluntary. And they twisted voluntary compliance wording into all kinds of stuff to make it look like people had to pay. Is there still this voluntary compliance wording in their paperwork?Here is what all IRS payment is all about. If your next door neighbor says that you owe him $100,000 out of the blue, and he builds a case out of it over a period of months, and he takes you to court over it even though he has nothing more than talk to his claims, if you don't properly answer him, you just might wind up owing him, even though there was nothing behind the claims in the first place.The Constitution doesn't allow for the kind of tax that the IRS tax is. They get around it by getting you to sign an agreement of any kind with them. The Constitution allows agreements, and not even government can interfere with an agreement. Of course, the IRS doesn't tell you that you owe because of signed agreements.The trick is to use the right wording to defend yourself, without accidentally agreeing that the IRS has a legitimate agreement with you. It starts with not signing paperwork with them in the first place... or how you sign the paperwork when you do. The W-4 Form is IRS paperwork. And there are many others. The answer is to NOT give them your money and private life info, and to sign any IRS docs non-assumpsit... no contract or agreement.There is a lot more, and this isn't the place. You might start by listening to all the talks, here https://www.youtube.com/c/CraigLynch/videos that have anything to do with the IRS.",
