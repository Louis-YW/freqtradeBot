  "content": "Nigeria security and Exchange commission has just tagged the operation of Binance Nigeria exchange as illegal in the country. The countries subsidiary of the global Binance commission was deemed illegal because it has been operating and promoting its services in the country without registration and not under regulations. The SEC warns Nigeria investors of investing or trading on cryptocurrencies on unregulated platforms like Binance. This action by the SEC follows suit after the exchange subsidiary in US was also sued for lack of regulation last week.What the SEC Said Quote“The attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) has been drawn to the website operated by Binance Nigeria Limited, soliciting the Nigerian public to trade crypto assets on its various web and mobile-enabled platforms.” “Binance Nigeria Limited is neither registered nor regulated by the Commission and its operations in Nigeria are therefore illegal. Any member of the investing public dealing with the entity is doing so at his/her own risk. ““As the regulator with the statutory mandate of investor protection, the Commission urges Nigerians to be wary of investing in crypto-assets, and crypto-asset-related financial products and services if the service provider/its platform is not registered or regulated by the Commission”.“Nigerian investors are hereby warned that investing in crypto-assets is extremely risky and may result in total loss of their investment.”“By this circular, Binance Nigeria Limited is hereby directed to immediately stop soliciting Nigerian investors in any form whatsoever.” “The Commission shall provide updates on further regulatory actions concerning the activities of Binance Nigeria Limited, and other similar platforms and shall work with other regulators in Nigeria to provide further guidance on this matter.” nairametrics.comhow do think the market or Nigerian investors will react to this?",

The status of bitcoin has always been illegal to many Nigerians, it will not change and will not stop people in the country from using binance. The only time Nigerians will stop binance usage is if the exchange crumbles from the top.",

Or telling Binance not to provide its products and services to Nigeria anymore. See what happened recently in Canada as Binance, OKX and Bybit decided not to operate anymore to Canadians. Regulators can start in a way to make strict regulations to become effective in a way government will pass it in a bill.

The past government didn’t wanted anything to do with cryptocurrencies, so it didn’t even allow SEC to have anything connected with crypto. This news is coming after Binance listed BTC/NGN trading on their platform, but this is not convincing enough to be the reason that warranted this. This new government have showed interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency even during campaigns, they might want to regulate its use and also tax citizens for using it furthermore. If this is achievable with Binance, other exchanges will have no choice than to pay for their services here in Nigeria.

Yes many knowledgeable people will see this as just an exchange under pressure and since they have other international and local exchanges then they could easily trade there. But the less knowledgeable ones will definitely take this as a sign that the government is banning the entire crypto and some will spread this stereotype and it could lead to discouraging many people and possibly slow down adoption. The other thing is the government seems to be a little bit confused because around September last year they actually did a collaboration with binance to help spread or teach some selected citizens about blockchain. So why did this honeymoon didn’t last long between this two. Or is the Nigerian SEC seeing it is the right time to get binance regulated since even the US is have same issue with them?",

I guess the SEC is back in action after the recent controversy with the CBN Governor.   BTW, just because a CEX has naira trading pairs on their exchange does not make them taxable to the Nigerian government if they operate in other jurisdictions.",

There's a lot of money to be made here if SEC are able to tax most of these exchanges operating in Nigeria, not just Binance Nigeria alone. Nigeria has the highest number of crypto enthusiasts in Africa but the ban of cryptocurrency has kind of hampered SEC's effort to go after these crypto platforms. But with the recent turn of event, I think they are no more limited and will go all out to collect their own \"choppings\" from both local and foreign exchanges operating in Nigeria.Quote from: gabbie2010 on June 12, 2023, 06:28:25 AMI don't think there is any cause for alarm because of SEC warning against cryptos and tagging Binance as illegal from my own point of view SEC is just trying to copycat US SEC as you rightly said even Binance chart had recently included BTC/NGN on there trading platform that means we can easily buy Bitcoin with naira and from all indication SEC dey try to lure I don't expect them to say otherwise and the statement released by Binance Nigeria is to calm their users.

But Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao said the exchange do not have an office in Nigeria and said they have issued cease and desist notice to the scammer entity \"Binance Nigeria Limited\".https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1670369403223900160?s=20Quote from: sokani on June 12, 2023, 02:45:20 PMThere's a lot of money to be made here if SEC are able to tax most of these exchanges operating in Nigeria, not just Binance Nigeria alone.Most of the crypto exchanges that Nigerians are using do not have office in Nigeria. That is what SEC supposed to work towards, or the exchanges should be cut out of providing bitcoin and other crypto services to people in Nigeria. The exchanges are making huge amount of money from Africa this way, but African regulators have failed to realize this.Let us see what Nigeria SEC and other regulatory bodies are up to, or they will show us again that they are not competent to handle anything pertaining to crypto again.",
