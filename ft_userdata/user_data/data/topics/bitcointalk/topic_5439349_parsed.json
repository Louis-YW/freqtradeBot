First of all, No legit exchange will deduct you a 10% withdrawal fee because transaction fee usually just cost fixed minimal amount on crypto. Second you withdraw instantly your funds on unknown address that you didn’t provide the moment you click withdraw is red flag already.How much money you deposit in there?",

When you were registering didn't you enter your own BTC wallet address or didn't you create one on the platform? cos from your statement it does look like you don't know that wallet address and that is not a good sign.

This reduction essential meant I'm now below the magic number, now they have said 10% of the rest of the profits around about another $400, and then ill be able to withdraw. On exchanges, taker and maker fees are in percent but withdrawal fee usually is a fixed number like you can see there.Cryptowisser.com's Exchange ListIf they say they always get 10% of your withdrawal value, it sounds weird and more like scam. In addition, they intentionally asked you to deposit more to be eligible for withdrawal, it's a scam confirmation. It is a similar scam like that one: Beware of \"Pay original fine\" - a scam methodQuoteWhen i send the bitcoin it instantly transfers to bc1q8yja3gw33ngd8aunmfr4hj820adc9nlsv0syvz this wallet, can anyone shed light on this?It is not usually wrong. Exchanges nowadays don't store their funds and customer funds in hot wallets. So when customers make deposits, exchanges will have automatic tools to move it to their cold wallets.However, in your case, it is like scammers move it to another addresses.The address is reported for fraudulent attempts. Scam Alert: This address has been reported as fraudulent (4 times)",

That is the Kucoin hot wallet address based on the list of the addresses they control, see here (3rd row in the table). In conclusion, the scammer gives you a deposit address that is actually associated with the Kucoin account. Just hope that this scammer has KYCed and Kucoin support doesn't mind helping your problem, at least freeze the account.",
