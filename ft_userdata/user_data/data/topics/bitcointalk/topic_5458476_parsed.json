  "content": "Hey Everyone,Just want to start here by saying that within the past couple of months we have acquired an established earning site. We have overhauled the development of it by adding many new features and ways to earn some Crypto, since acquiring it we have paid out a ton of Crypto and want to pay out more! All of the sites earnings are generated by of course very minimal ads and also mined earnings that are dedicated to the life of the site.Now unlike many other faucets and earning sites out there we mine multiple coins which guarantees us the ability of paying our users. We are not looking to make money but rather help the community grow by introducing simple and fast methods of earning your share of the crypto empire.Signup is Simple, just visit our site https://www.cryptoclaim.click and get started. All earnings for the time being are paid directly through FaucetPay multiple times of the day. We will be adding more options in the near future.We ask that when visiting our site you disable your ad blocker. We do not believe in annoying popups or poorly placed ads. All of our ads have been placed to allow ease of use without interruption.We are always looking for your feedback, let us know what you think!Some Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: Why did we chosen TRX? A: The site was originally developed to pay out in BTC, with network costs being so high to move coins we have found that TRX was the more stable option to reduce costs of moving funds around.Q: How long to get paid out?A: On some occasions it could take minutes but all payments are sent out the same day. As we are still rapidly developing the system we manually verify all payments for accuracy. We will be offering an upgrade option in the near future to allow instant payouts.Q: Are VPN or Proxy's allowed?A: No! Due to the recent amount of fraudulent accounts and greedy people trying to cheat the system, we have included security measures to prevent this.Q: Can we use an ad blocker?A: No! Faucets and earnings sites rely on ads to help fund the project. We don't believe in annoying placement or popups, all of our ads are places to be less noticed and annoying.",
