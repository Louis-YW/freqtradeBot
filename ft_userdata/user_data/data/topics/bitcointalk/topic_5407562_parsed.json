      "body": "$1 worth of BNB should be more than enough for both smart contract approval of BRISE and the swap confirmation. I can't be precise because I don't have that token. Transaction fees (gas limit to be more specific) is different per token. It depends on how it's been coded.You'll get exact figure if you go to DEX like Pancakeswap > choose BRISE/BUSD pairing > click 'Enable'. Metamask will pop up after that asking for permission and show you the gas price. Next to that is the actual swapping.",

The price change actually depend on the how much liquidity that available in the pool.

If you get the right price when you make a swap, you should execute it as soon as possible. Because the more trades that occur, it will greatly affect the price (it can go up and down).",

The developers must have added more liquidity to make the slippage become even lower than before. The only problem is when you are facing a huge impact of slippage and you have no choice other than agreed to swap your token. It's better if you are using cex but im sure that if brise has enough liquidity to solve your problem. A small impact in the price means nothing for sure. Im sure that you are aware maybe the price may slightly change due to the liqudity",

If slippage is more than 10 you will be charged 1.5$ fee for approving and swapping. If less than 10 than 1$ is ok.Always disconnect wallet from Dex after swap because we approve sign in these Dex and hacker can steal our Bnb and other assets.",
