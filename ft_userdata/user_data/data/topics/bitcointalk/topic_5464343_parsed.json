A month ago crypto-currencies raised up with bitcoin, that's why market dumping now as cryptos always follows mother bitcoin. And still has possibility that we'll be eyewitness of many dump ahead before bull run as Bitcoin havling is near to happened. After that, we might be big pump in Crypto industry, in my opinion as this is just a prediction",

The recent bitcoin market plumb has made a lot of negative vibes within the entire cryptocurrency market even though the year 2024 was welcomed with alot of positive market recovery after the Bitcoin market suffered a long period market bearish period, but we are going into another phase of recovery since the price drop recently have placed another round of long embargo on the level of price recovery that we will witness in the incoming days, weeks and month of the year 2023 be for the most acclaimed big event booked for 2024.I speculate that Bitcoin is going to propel other coins into another phase of market recovery, but most of the coins that will be doing multiple price increases/recoveries will be projects that are within the new projects since the recovery in most altcoins is mostly impossible unless for a few old altcoins that can do that.",

We might not see the uptrend right now so better to focus on the current down trend which I can say is a good opportunity to fill up your holdings and buy good coins. Just try to analyze the price trend and I think we might see a cheaper market before it finally pumps. Recovery might takes time too, so make sure you plan ahead and if you do trading always gave your cut loss price. If you are a long term investor, then don’t be afraid of the dump, just buy more and keep holding until you reach your target price.",

Bitcoin recoves but altcoin is not. How can you say that if altcoins were gradually following bitcoin while, in fact, it's only moving a bit from its bottom price? I think that you shall try to take a look at the chart again. Altcoin is yet recovering from its bottom. It's still staying at bottom price.

It's hard to predict caused by anything can happen int he market. The price will not be fluctuated. It will be remain stable at the current price. You can expect nothing from the market right now.",

Don't get too excited with that.The time will come that the market will recover no matter what happens and whatever is the situation for most altcoins.You're right that we've seen a quick recovery but that's not enough as it dumps again. Just think of it that more dumps to come and you're likely to see more reds in the market. But it won't last longer as we approach to bitcoin's halving.",

Bitcoin:It is difficult to rally so soon after a hard fall, once the initial bounce up is over. $25,000 was the low last time, so $25,700 will be the bottom this time.  Altcoins: Yes, the ones that survived being down ~90% from their ATH will be way overdue to rally soon.",

There's no recovery at all for me, because what we experienced recently is just a correction, just remember how fast we go above $30,000 after we back $20,000 this year.So for me, the recent dump is a healthy price action of Bitcoin to continue it's bullish move upside.",

It is very early to say that the crypto market is recovering. At the moment the price gradually decreasing, and the chances are that it will decrease further in the coming months. We might see a sudden sharp dump in a couple of weeks. The market will probably recover in 2024 after BTC halving.",

If we look at the current situation, it is clear whether there will be some pump in the market in the future. Because Bitcoin price changes are some clear indications of a bull market.  And a bull run is more likely towards the end of the year.  But those who want to invest still have an opportunity to buy good coins. Until 2023 the market may remain in this situation but in 2024 we will definitely see a positive change in the market.",

It's likely we must wait until bitcoin will have done another halving before we will able to see another huge pump to come for bitcoin. The same scenario happened last year once people were massively talking about the big pump after bitcoin was only getting slightly recovery from the bottom price. It's very boring to see people are always talking about \"wen pump, wen pump\". I guess if the price of bitcoin will be stagnant. I expect the price of bitcoin to go back again to the 30k but this will not happen in a short time. Space x has been deciding to leave from crypto by selling its bitcoin asset. The market was greatly affecting by the decision from space x. The strategy is to hold off until a major investor with considerable capital decides to pour their money into the bitcoin market. It's unlikely to happen in a short time, but there was a miracle. No pump soon. I expect it to happen next years but not this year.",
