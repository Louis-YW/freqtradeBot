  "content": "Choosing limited number of players for each national team is a very difficult task but coaches have to do this, one way or another. They can not satisfy all players as well as all fans but it's important to have best players for a balanced team in the tournament. In addition, if possible it is better to assign on slot for a youth player in order to help him gets real experience in such big tournament.In the past, Ronaldo Nazario de Lima was chosen for the World Cup 1994 but did not have a single playing minute in that tournament. Two later World Cup, 1998 and 2002, he was a key player for Brazil especially World Cup 2002 in which Brazil are the winner with a outstanding performance from Ronado.We also have another case from Roberto Baggio in World Cup 1990. In that tournament, he played mainly as a substitute player but did more than Ronaldo by scoring two goals in that World Cup. 4 years later, he brought Italy to the final in World Cup 1994 but failed at the end.Kaka in World Cup 2002 at his 20 years-old with only 25 playing minutes in the match with Costa Rica.Some points from these casesIt gives these players a great opportunity to experience the air of World Cup; how players have to train and prepare for big tournaments; what are huge pressure from fans, social media, coach and themselves; lot of thingsIt is helpful and non-buyable experience for youth playersIt helps their career a lotI don't remember all cases and above are classic cases. Please leave a commenting post and let me know about other past cases.  Now it is time to discuss about cases for World Cup 2022 in Quatar.I would go first to share the case of Moukoko in Germany. He has a debut for Dortmund in December 2020 and he just was chosen for the Germany World Cup 2022 squad. He is too young for this tournament and I believe that Hansi Flick gives that youth player a chance like Ronaldo and Baggio.What do you think about Moukoko and this decision of Hansi Flick?Let share other cases in this tournament if you know them.  List of youth playersYoussoufa MoukokoYou are sharing itMissing casesEndrick Felipe",

      "body": "Not too much to remember about the history of young players who can excel in the World Cup. From every World Cup event, teams from Africa always produce good young players who eventually allow them to play in the big leagues after the world cup.Mario Gotze Germany's national player who scored the only goal in the 2014 world cup final in Brazil he is about 22 years old, as far as I remember he was only installed at the beginning of the tournament as a starting XI but then he was always a substitute including the Final.But during the extra time in final, his goal made Germany the champion for the 4th time. It's a very impressive match until now Many predict Argentina along with Lionel Messi will be champions but Germany looked stunning.One of the unforgettable matches was when they beat the hosts Brazil with a landslide score of 7-1",

      "body": "It's hard to go back to remembering the history of young players who excel in the world cup, where we have to remember the young players who have just started their careers in the world cup. Back then, we didn't have the technology as advanced as today, we didn't get much information from the many talented young players. we only get information from national tv media or sports newspapers. unlike today, all the information we want to get is easily available on the internet.However, based on what you posted in this thread.Our memories return to past memories of these two legendary figures. which both have different characteristics, Ronaldo has a unique haircut, as well as the ponytail, we have a nickname for Roberto Baggio. If we have to remember everything else, ah it's very difficult because there are a lot of young, talented players.However, did not have such an impressive record on their debut in the 1998 world cup. but there is one that I can remember, Michael Owen, where he made his debut with the England squad at the world cup in France in 1998 at the age of 18, and managed to become a player the best youth at that time. but unfortunately, he could not give the title of champion for England.Speaking of the German squad, currently Germany is in the process of renewing its players. almost mostly young players, one of them, Youssoufa Moukoko. he is one of the centre-forwards that the German squad has, he is only 17 years old.I'm not sure if he will be given much time to play with the German squad in the Qatar world cup later. maybe he was given the opportunity to play to replace Kai Harvertz, in the final minutes of the game.",

He debuted in Dortmund in 2010 and before that World Cup, Gotze already played more than 150 matches for Dortmund. Details.QuoteBut during the extra time in final, his goal made Germany the champion for the 4th time. It's a very impressive match until now He was no longer a potential player but actually a star player. Even so he did not get a good position in Germany squad but at the end of World Cup, he helped them to take the trophy.Quote from: rahmad2nd on November 11, 2022, 06:52:13 PMHowever, did not have such an impressive record on their debut in the 1998 world cup. but there is one that I can remember, Michael Owen, where he made his debut with the England squad at the world cup in France in 1998 at the age of 18, and managed to become a player the best youth at that time. but unfortunately, he could not give the title of champion for England.Owen is a similar case like Gotze as he already got a very good position in Liverpool before World Cup 1998. It is not like Ronaldo (Brazil), Baggio or Kaka, they were all too young players and not get good positions in big clubs like Gotze or Owen. In fact, Owen (details) is more impressive than Gotze because he already built up his position in 1997 - 1998 season and get a good position in England squad too.Their national coaches gave them opportunities to join World Cup tournaments because they wanted to give those players chance to learn and grow up. Those coaches knew that they will not use those young players in World Cups.",
