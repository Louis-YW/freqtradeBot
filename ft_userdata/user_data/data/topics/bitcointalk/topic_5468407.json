I mean there have been many existing \"decentralized\" alternatives to Youtube but their traffic hasn't been close. They may attract some big content creators but viewers don't necessarily follow them from one app to another.",

We all know when it comes to patience, those who support Bitcoin have the most of it.  About Artificial Intelligence. This is still being debated because there's a mass of people out there who are against it. Why? It could lead to people having fewer jobs which means more poverty in the lower sector. It will be successfully implemented but I doubt it will be a smooth one. There are always people who will be against the technology especially if it will affect their lives long term or short term.",

But it seems that we haven't seen that yet and it's integrated with crypto payments. And to be honest, with these blockchain based apps, they're having hard time to gain the traction as people don't want to try most of them. Maybe someone who's got really a big influence on this community would be helpful to do that if they ever start one. And if not, the team should be proactive and that's the toughest challenge for them to make.",

At this point in time the only question we have is not if there will be a bull run but how big it will be, and while we do not have an answer to that question, we do know that it is going to generate great profits for anyone that buys now, however many people out there which want to invest in this market know nothing about investing and they will only take the decision to do so once the market is already close to the top, a decision which will cause them to lose a great deal of their investment capital relatively quickly.",

If you’re into Bitcoin, you should be more proud about your investments and give it a year I’m sure you can have the profit by that time. Yes, halving will still be a big thing and the effect of that usually start after the actual halving, so next year is indeed a great year for the market.",

But I am afraid that despite that this is going to be what we are waiting these days, there would be not much hype anymore like what Elon Musk did for most of 2021. Even if those Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF applications are going to be approved by SEC, the price of Bitcoin realistically may not going to gain that much. Like XRP’s case for example. They’ve partially won against SEC, so the market pumped and BTC rose to as much as $31k+ before slowly correcting all the way back to $25k to $26k range. The bulls did not hold that price for long as there is not much noise or hype after that XRP and SEC news. So it would be really difficult to know about those narratives that may come out of nowhere to impact the market to go on a bull run, in which we do not know when will it happen as well.",
