That's how i do it... 2 users each running a full node: one user running a node on the main net, the other on the testnet.But still, yeah, you'll need an ASIC to mine on the testnet...If you want tBTC, you can use a tBTC faucet.",

But they said also it is not necessary. All you need is in bitcoin repository on Github. You have to run Bitcoin Core in regtest mode if you want to mine bitcoins yourself. Regtest coins are only visible to you.Simply add the --chain=regtest option to bitcoind and bitcoin-cli to start them both in regtest mode. This uses port 28332 (my bad, it is 18444), so you can run this alongside mainnet and testnet if you want.To mine a block, run bitcoin-cli --chain=regtest generate 1, that'll generate one block. Replace 1 with any number you want to mine that many blocks.",

I just want to run a regtest node while my full node is still syncing the original blockchain.Change the data directory to a folder that is not on a removable disk, because these usually have messed up permissions.Since you are using regtest there will be no monstorous network or disk usage, so you can add to the config file (the regtest part):Code:datadir=/home/<you>/.bitcoinor even set it to /tmp/<something> if you want - it doesn't really matter because regtest coins are worthless.",

      "body": "Last night i started thinking about this topic, and i realized we didn't start from the beginning and jumped right into trying to fix the problem you were posting.The initial question in this topic should have been: \"what are you trying to do?\". Why do you need to mine a block, are you going to setup a solo mining operation or do you just want to test out your setup on the testnet, or maybe your goal is something else?If it's the first case (you wanting to solo mine), do realize this is a difficult setup... I've set up solo mining operations on the testnet in the past, and it's quite hard to get things up and running, and keep them running over a longer time. There are solo mining pools that ask a very moderate mining fee, it might be a good first step to use them instead. Oh yeah, you'll need a recent ASIC, basic knowledge and dirt cheap electricity to pull this off...If it's the second case (you wanting to test your setup), you don't need to mine a block, you can just claim some tBTC from a couple tBTC faucets...If your goal is something else, i wonder if you'd be willing to share said goal...It's just that in numerous occasions, i've seen people coming to the forum asking a bunch of questions, but when they finally say what they want to accomplish, we immediately tell him he/she was taking the completely \"wrong\" approach to solving the problem in the first place.",

You can see doc/build-*.md for instructions on building the various elements.2. Run the unit and functional tests. Instructions on how to do that can be found here: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/README.md).3. Look at example_test.py in the functional test directory and try getting node 1 to mine another block, send it to node 2, and check that node 2 received it. In your response to this email, please include a link to a gist or code snippet that you used to complete this step.Then I thought, I do not want to extra compile cause I had in mind that I am setting up already a Raspiblitz. Therefore I had my thoughts on doing this task on my raspiblitz but like you said it is not possible. Just compiling was a bit difficult for me so I downloaded the pre compiled version on my mac so I am able to access the regtest mode. Nevertheless I do not want to have the initial blockchain download started if I am unpack the bitcoin application because of the much required data space. The remaining problem still exist: Solving this task via regtest mode without cluttering up my laptop with data and slowing down the performance of my device.",
