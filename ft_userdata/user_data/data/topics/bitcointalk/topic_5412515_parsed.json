  "content": "Hi, do you know any exchange to trade bitcoin without fees? I saw a video some time ago and I think it was mentioned that there were some exchanges without fees...but they were not very well known...for me it would be the difference between being profitable or not being profitable scalping...I would not mind that then I would be charged a significant amount when withdrawing money from the exchange...because once you get to be profitable you can earn enough money...so in my opinion it would be beneficial both for me and for the exchange....Anyway, I suppose that the liquidity of the exchange would also have to be taken into account...when choosing the exchange...any exchanges to trade bitcoin without fees?",

Exchanges do not use derivative market trading fee to joke, they are charging fee for it.For derivative market, use Binance perpetual BUSD pair, you will be able to trade with low fee. He's talking about trading bitcoin, probably pointing to buying and selling on spot market. not shorting or longing BitcoinOp, you might wanna look at the different spot trading tiers of different exchanges. Some exchanges offer 0 Market maker fees for holding a specified number of the exchange token like it is the case with Bybit - https://blog.bybit.com/post/major-benefits-of-the-bitdao-bit-holders-incentive-program-blt2d769d73fd57e5a6/",

I don't know if this is effective now or still in the plan, because I actually found the announcement on another news site.This offer usually only lasts a few days in the context of certain events.

      "body": "Indeed, since you're planning to do some scalping, liquidity should be the primary consideration. So I would probably prioritize liquidity over zero trading fee if the exchange has very low liquidity. Just go for exchanges with low fees. Please verify this, but I think KuCoin only charges up 0.10% for their taker/maker fees. It lowers down depending on your tier. But KuCoin is a decent exchange with decent volume and their low fees are not exclusive to certain pairs. So if you set a conservative target of 0.30% to 0.50% for your trades, it wouldn't hurt to pay 0.10% or lower.",
