  "content": "Here we go again. We haven't heard \"Bitcoin is bad for environment !!1!\" fud for a while. But it's back. This time from The Guardian (British left-leaning news portal).Bitcoin is terrible for the environment – can it ever go green?https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/26/bitcoin-mining-climate-crisis-environmental-impactQuoteCryptocurrency mining uses huge amounts of energy, but activists are urging for a change in its code to reduce its environmental impact...How could ‘changing the code’ mitigate environmental damage?The solution, Greenpeace argues, is simple: change the computer code that produces bitcoin in order to consume less electricity and reduce its carbon footprint.This code is open-source, meaning it is publicly accessible to anyone who wants to see or use it.Rather than a PoW verification process, which requires vast amounts of energy, climate activists are arguing for a less energy-intensive verification process that isn’t reliant on speed, such as “proof of stake” (PoS), used by ethereum – another cryptocurrency.",

The Automotive industry has one of the biggest carbon footprints out there but these guys are never heard,It's pretty annoying how they equate energy usage with carbon emissions, without considering the source of the energy for BTC mining and whether it's \"green\" or not.Quote from: Woodie on April 29, 2023, 10:25:35 PM and we have pools already on the green side and again they never report the positives that have happened so far...All i see are enemies of progress!! I think you mean mining farms not pools. In open pools, we don't really know the source of energy that each individual miner uses.On the positive side, WEF released some video praising some BTC mining company for using energy from recycled gas. Of course they've done it without a single mention of Bitcoin, but still.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450069.0",

      "body": "I don't know that why they can only see Bitcoin mining when it comes to climate change. There are many other processes that are causing huge carbon emissions that aren't even discussed by those professional journalists. Like Woodie mentioned that the carbon emission caused by automobile have reached alarming levels but still no body blames the role of those in climate change the way they attack the mining process of Bitcoin.Most of the carbon emissions are caused by burning of fossil fuels and they aren't burnt directly for Bitcoin mining as most of the mining farms are going with green energy which has almost no carbon footprint. The fossil fuels are burned in automobile transporting systems and almost all household activates that involve cooking for sometimes just to keep the places warm. Those should also be mentioned and should be controlled first before targeting Bitcoin mining.The simple agenda is to convert Bitcoin POW to POS, and they think that will help out to reduce the carbon emissions. I don't think so that only moving Bitcoin to POS will give any good results to those environmentalists related to carbon emissions. The other industries will still be emitting carbon into the atmosphere and they can't control those areas.",

They can be faced with the facts, like you posted here and they will simply ignore it, because they will cherry pick the data that will further their agenda. We should balance the scales with mass education of the public on a global scale, so that the people themselves can make an informed decision, when it comes to information like this.",

But I guess you may be fundamentally right.I do think, however, that Bitcoin's lobby is already there, even though no centralized company is pumping a huge chunck of their revenue directly into advertising. Since many more larger investment firms are involved, the urge to have a more positive / realistic perception of the facts surrounding Bitcoin has increased and will continue to do so.",

In the last year alone, hundreds of reporters have been killed or imprisoned for doing their jobs.
