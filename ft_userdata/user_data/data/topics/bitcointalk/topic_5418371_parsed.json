Try to type it manually and see if it's going to work. Quote from: frei.sein on October 26, 2022, 10:25:05 AMBut how do I assure the money comes from the seller and not from a third party?It's a P2P so basically, the seller will have the fund transferred to you. As long as the transaction will go through and you receive the fund, it's not a matter of concern whether they use a third party or not.",

Resetting the password is also not possible, because system is busy.When I try again to reset the password I cant even press the next button.Hindi ko sure bakit kung ano yung problema sa account mo, pero nung ni-try ko mag-reset password now, wala naman issue. Are you sure na tama yung ginagawa mo sa pagreset ng password?Quote from: frei.sein on October 26, 2022, 10:25:05 AMBut how do I assure the money comes from the seller and not from a third party?Yung Binance P2P ay person to person trading ng crypto like buy and sell so yung funds or cash na makukuha sa pagbebenta ng crypto ay manggagaling sa ibang tao at hindi mismo sa binance. Quote from: frei.sein on October 26, 2022, 07:49:32 AMAny Idea how to work safe with binance or do cash transaction?For safety reasons naman, try mo makipagtransact sa mga users na maraming trade history para ma-sure mo na hindi ka ma-scam. If any case naman, na concern ka sa \"black money\" or possible ma-involve sa mga kung ano-ano, pwede mo naman maipakita yung transaction history sa binance as proof na rin.  Hindi ako komportable mag-pure english sa Pilipinas board since pinoy naman tayo dito?",

If you are having problem with Binance, then you can try Huobi p2p.  It works like Binance p2p.

Sometimes the icon link is unresponsive if you are having a connection problem.",

Foreigner nga ni check ko ang posting history nya. Tingin ko baka nandito sa Pinas yan baka nag bakasyon o baka may pinuntahan dito at kailangan ng Peso para syempre gamitin dito.Eh mukhang hindi na sumagot eh, baka nakakuha na ng Peso dahil sa mga advise nyo sa taas. Binance at Bybit ang ginagamit ko ngayon, Huobi hindi pa pero masubukan nga kung maganda rin.",
