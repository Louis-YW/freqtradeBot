Even non-investors know that they have to accept some level of risk to get reward, but they turn the investment down if they can not handle the risk attached.Don't be frightened, @OP, but honestly, you don't need to continue creating short and very uninformative topics; you could just be seen as a spammer. If you want to make better topics, then think creatively and come up with a very productive idea, and you will be applauded and draw a better wave of discussion on your topic; otherwise, you can just keep reading and making quality comments on other users topics until you have a very good topic to create.Superb Bitcoin (BTC) it really helpsLess profitOP, believe me, you can do better than this if you become more attentive and learn from others.",

To be honest, you are only giving advice and what you have given is already known by many which means it is already a common advice that an expert would say. I didn't say that I am an expert but that's what I think they are going to say. You should also improve your posting ability because at the end of OP, I think what you are trying to say is you are always thinking about risk that you are willing to take and you also said it yourself that everyone knows that if there's risk there's a reward and I should say that there's also loss.",

Well, lesser risk because they don't have to put that much money to a young technology that they've just heard. Until it started to grow.Quote from: Tuclikk on December 09, 2023, 10:40:24 PMBut it always about risk and i do believe everyone knows whenever there's no risk no reward.Yes, there's no reward if you won't take any risk and that's why it is important for somebody who's starting out to understand this. The greater the risk, the higher reward that potentially might get. But it's not always with that ration, the best is to take the risk that you're okay to take no matter how long you'll have to wait for you to profit from it except with the total shitcoins.",

Other people making things look like easy or fruitful but in reality earning in bitcoin is not too easy of sometimes bitcoin or cryptocurrency itself is not for everyone, even risk, not everyone could take the risk the anxiety of thinking if you will earn that will sometimes hinders your decision making, but the thing is if an investor succeed of overcoming the risk, the anxiety the fear or anythiing else with investing in crypto currency, it will be a lot more easy and rewarding that's why OP is right without facing the risk and overcoming it you will never earn or get a reward, this field is not that easy in fact it is like a hell, if you don't know what you are doing, but that's the thing needed to be overcome to have the reward. So for anyone out there who's planning on investing in crypto currency, make sure you have the guts to take the risk.",

Look at what happened in 2022, it basically topped at $400 almost and bottomed out under $100. There was tons and tons of people who lost money. If you want risk free assets then you are limited to bonds pretty much, especially United States Government bonds. The USA Government will never default they will just print more money so you are safe there. Even real estate these days has its risks. So you need to understand that investing in Bitcoin is risky and only invest money you feel comfortable losing.",

The game is about risk and knowledge. The higher the risk and knowledge, the higher your rewards to come. The lower those are, the lower your chances of making it big in this space. I learned these the hard way after years of day-trading bitcoin. Finally settled for Copy Trading on Bitget sometime in August this year and devoted time to learning the strategy.

The risk is when you are trying to trade BTC on futures market because that's a risky thing and someone who does futures trading understand that risk is quite high when you set high leverage. Bitcoin investment isn't risky if you're planning to hold the investment for long term as we all know that in long term Bitcoin holders will make profits instead of losses and the returns on their investment will be very high if they are going to hold their investment for at least a decade.I agree with the notation that when there's no risk then there's no reward but when you know the risk is minimum and reward is high then I think you should go for it. In Bitcoin investment the risk isn't that high but the reward is pretty awesome and that's why I think one should go for it.Those who invested in Bitcoin during 2014-2016 have made enough profits from it within few years and I believe the ones who are going to invest in Bitcoin today will surely make a lot of profits in long-term. It's a safe investment but only for the ones who know the technical aspect of the things. The ones who store their Bitcoin on custodial wallets are surely at higher risk because they can lose their Bitcoin anytime. That's why I always recommend people to learn about the personal wallets and how to save ones private keys and seed phrases as that's most important for Bitcoin investors. I'm not sure about the ETF thing that what it would do with Bitcoin but if someone knows how to use software wallets and can create his/her own wallet and save his/her Bitcoin into that wallet then there is no risk in Bitcoin investment.",

This can also be applied to investment because if you don't leave your comfort zone to take a risk, you will regret it and won't be learning anything from the experience. Note that taking a risk should be done with knowledge and decided wisely cause if you risk impulsively lacking information and data, for sure it's just like you are throwing money straight out to the trash, there's a case that you can be lucky with investing with no knowledge but always remember that luck won't be always by your side that is why doing your own research before risking is a must.",
