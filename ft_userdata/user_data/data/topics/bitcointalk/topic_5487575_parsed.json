  "content": "I have come to understand and appreciate the saying that  \"little drops of water make a mighty ocean\", the DCA method of buying Bitcoin brought me to that understanding. I have had this poor mindset of making huge profits from trading thereafter, invest part of it into Bitcoin holding as a hedge to my trading. This mindset have held me moving round the same cycle of profits and losses for over two years with no progress despite the pains and psychological torture that comes with losing streak in trading. Little did I know that buying little by little would have made me achieve even bigger results than I was targeting through trading. It was when I started being active in this forum I noticed that there is something called Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) that enable someone buy Bitcoin even with small amount of money on a regular basis. I embraced it and it has changed my life!Today I am a proud Bitcoin investor, with a portfolio that I can call an achievement even though it may not be something too big for some people. I am not making this post because of Bitcoin is rising in price, my focus is on the quantity of Bitcoin and not necessarily the dollar value. Besides, the DCA method has molded me to appreciate bear markets because that is the opportunity to collect more Bitcoin at lower prices. I am sure there are many people with similar thing to say about the DCA method because I have engaged in many discussions where a good number of forum users confirmed to be using the DCA method, so I expect they will also be proud of what they have achieved through it. To those who really helped in sharing their wealth of knowledge free of charge in this forum like @JayJuanGee, @Wind_FURY, @tranthidung and many others, you are all highly appreciated.",

Important part is DCAing strategy is you can invest any amount without being affected. As Bitcoin goes higher it's also good to pile up enough Bitcoin and wait for the perfect time to sell. True, a drop of water might be able to make up an ocean because before you count to 100 you must start from 1. It is good for you to know that Bitcoin trading wasn't the quality way to get big profits, Bitcoin investment through DCAing strategy is the perfect way to get enough Bitcoin even if you don't gather full Bitcoin with the little you have gathered, it means you have tried you best. So congrats you know bitcoin investment is better than Bitcoin trading.",

Little did I know that buying little by little would have made me achieve even bigger results than I was targeting through trading.One place where people get it wrong is that, DCA doesn’t necessarily mean buying with the least or little money you’ve got. It might encompass that but, it’s well above that. DCA is basically concerned with you having to buy routinely or periodically without giving much interest in the amount you’re buying. You just make sure it’s an averaged value to what income you’re getting and allowed to utilize for investments as well as running your daily expenses.Sometimes you might invest with a very substantial amount and at other times, a low amount compared to what income you’re getting. In the end of the day, you bought Bitcoin periodically and you’re hodling it. That makes all the difference and your sure to be amazed of your accumulations in due time.",

I invested in altcoin due to the pump I always see in it, and after everything I discovered that it was a waste of time. Even some months ago, after listening to several warning from the forum members and also @jayjuanGee about not investing on shit and altcoin I still doubted and went ahead and invested In shit/altcoin and I was disappointed. that also made me to hold Bitcoin dearly because without btc I haven't seen any other coin that will do better in times of growth consistency. Although many coin might be consistent but the consistency I mean Is continuously maintaining its position for a long time. Because thousands of coin has emerged and and fell of, but bitcoin still hold its position as the top. Long live bitcoin and blessing to investors that HODL for long.",

The aim is to average either your gain when on the green side or your losses when on the red side. Although it is widely used by salary earners to invest passively such that they won't be financially stressed because of investment. In order words, someone who does not have a steady flow of income, weekly or monthly might not be able to maintain DCA. They will abuse it. DCA is all about consistency, no matter how little your amount of investment is. That is DCA based on weekly or monthly earnings. This is different from the DCA of he that has enough but is trying to play safe due to the volatility of the market. In this case they can go in with variable amounts at different intervals.",

But they don't know that if they can't buy with a lump sum, this is the best strategy for you to keep on the market and stay by not having a miss of every opportunity that you may have. Now, you have to be consistent doing that and if you've proven that to yourself, I'd say congratulations to you. You're just getting started and there's more things to come for you and to everyone who's DCAing. Because next time, the challenge is going to how you're going to start keep that. Some temptations may come to you and might push you to sell.I urge you to have a decent long term plan and don't put your efforts into waste.",

A lot of people try timing the market, but what happens is they can never do that and lose money on the long run.
