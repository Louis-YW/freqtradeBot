      "body": "Congratulations mate on your first Bitcoin purchase. it's indeed a bold step in the right direction. One most striking benefit of Bitcoin is it's divisibility which enables both the high and low income earners to buy the coin. Just keep increasing your coins based on your income, keep them in a safe wallet and wait patiently. Who knows, you might make so much profit in few years. It is also important to note that Bitcoin doesn't guarantee financial freedom but it could be part of your financial freedom plans. That's why it is important to diversify your income base. All the best bro.",

That's nice but, is it really something we should celebrate? Like why should we...? You bought your first bitcoin and then what?This is a trend that I have seen to go around one too many times and it's already polarised at my end. Do we have to see this sort of thread over and over again; i bought my first bitcoin,  i purchased goods with bitcoin, I started accepting bitcoin in my business and lots of those similar threads.This makes me see reason why mega threads are been put in place to house this sort of festivity. Do we have one? I think it hould be made elaborate and let's have all these directed there.Don't take this personal as its got nothing personal about it, am just not feeling the vibe no more for these trends.",

Is that a Binance P2P purchase on the picture? Did you leave your coins on Binance or did you withdraw them elsewhere?First of all, I would never advice anyone to hold coins on an exchange but (there is always a but) in your case, it makes more sense than withdrawing them. Let me explain why. You own 0.00027... BTC. Binance's withdrawal fee (I am assuming that is Binance on the image) over the real Bitcoin blockchain is 0.0002 BTC. Not only that, but you don't have enough for a withdrawal. But you have enough to withdraw fake bitcoins. Don't let Binance trick you into withdrawing bitcoin over some alternative networks like its native Smart Chain or as a BEP2 token. Those are centralized and pegged BTC tokens and not the real bitcoin.",

A little bit larger than mine at the first time purchase but we all start our bitcoin journey somewhere so I will just advice you keep holding on strong, and make sure you buy more so your chances of getting some profits will be high when the price pump up during the bull season. One thing that is always advice here is not to forget to move your coins off the exchange you use in buying and take it to a more safer environment which is a non custodial wallet like the electrum wallet and remember to always keep your seed phrase safe and saving it offline is more preferably as it will be free from any cyber attacks.",

The initiative taken earlier gives the best rewards. OP is from a country that have got good level of cryptocurrency acceptance amidst the government's policy. Even in our forum it is possible to see good number of members from Nigeria spreading the word of bitcoin through all sources available for them. Even small vendors around the country have begun to accept bitcoin into the business which is the best part. Congratulations and hope you make regular buying of bitcoin for your future.",

If you have the courage to invest then feel free to do so but if you are just carried away by the hype this industry is having, ease down and learn things first. Managing the risks won't be as easy as it may sound; the market price moves a lot and you have to prepare yourself on every decline of its value. Also, with FUDs which might affect your decisions as an investor to whether sell or continue holding. Bitcoin indeed has the biggest potential but along the way is a different story. Not because many people earned huge from this industry, you'd already assume that same thing would happen on your investment because there will always be underlying factors to affect every outcome, so be cautious of those things.",

There's a question above that I will repeat here OP because this is very important stuff to know, where did you store the Bitcoin that purchased? If that is on the centralized wallet which I think is based on the image you've shown, you're not safe because you didn't have full control over your coins, the golden rule that always to remember, \"Not your keys, not your coin\".  Just quickly move your Bitcoin to a safe wallet, Electrum would be the best for beginners because it is free to install. One thing that you must be always remembered, never to panic and sell and never sell under the price where you purchase, that's insane.",
