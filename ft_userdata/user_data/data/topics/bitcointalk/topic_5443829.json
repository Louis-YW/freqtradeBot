  "content": "Good evening dear Bitcoin community I need your help because I can't get any further with my setup at the moment.For Bitcoin I use Electrum + EPS as Watch Only Address and the whole thing is signed on a PC without any connection to the outside world.Can the whole thing also be done for USDC / USDT?Are there also reputable and secure desktop wallets for USDC / USDT that can be set up as a watch only address and can be signed on the PC where there is no internet connection?A big thank you that there is such a great community like you.",

      "body": "As for an ERC20-based wallet that can be handled on a PC when there is no internet connection, I don't know whether it exists or not. But you can try a number of ERC20 wallet models which are still very safe to use and from several sources I have seen, it turns out that Atomic Wallet is in first place for you to try before you try some of the others. Because in Atomic Wallet you can download the wallet you want and it's available for desktop too.I will share some of these resources here so that you can immediately access them and hopefully this can help your work which may be pending preparation at this time.https://atomicwallet.io/erc20-wallethttps://coindcx.com/blog/cryptocurrency/top-9-erc20-wallets-2022/https://elitemininginc.com/2022/05/05/6-of-the-best-erc-20-wallets/https://ripplecoinnews.com/best-erc20-wallets/",

OP just need to do some extra steps to make it work.Although I have never signed a transaction in an offline computer, myetherwallet has a nice tutorial article for downloading the MEW website offline and be able to send and sign a specific transaction on your airgapped device.Can't provide any more information about the nitty gritty of the process though.

For example, if you think about ERC20, it is enough to register on etherscan.io and enter the address or several addresses you want to track. from there you will receive a report on every change via email or telegram.There are also very good Telegram bots that will monitor changes in addresses and make it easier for you to follow them, regardless of the type of wallet or whether they are your addresses at all.",

There are several options if you look around the internet, some of them are:- https://support.token.im/hc/en-us/articles/360003147833-How-do-I-use-cold-wallet-formerly-watch-wallet-- https://support.mycrypto.com/how-to/sending/how-to-make-an-offline-transaction/- https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/6512619-using-mew-offline-current-mew-version-6 (already mentioned above)- https://airgap.it/offline-device/There is also Parity Signer for Polkadot but it is out of date and has a lot of issues according to recent reviews on Play Store. Most of these are developed for mobile devices so if you want to exclusively use your computers, I guess you need to run an emulator to do it. If that's a no-go for you, then you can use your phone for the online device while you run an emulator on your computer. Use the Android Studio app to run the app if you don't want to risk using a third-party emulator that is mainly developed for gaming such as Bluestack, etc. If that is still not good enough for you, I guess you're limited to MEW, AirGap, or MyCrypto for offline signing.Don't forget to do your own research. I personally use MEW and MyCrypto in the past but have no experience with the other two I linked above.",
