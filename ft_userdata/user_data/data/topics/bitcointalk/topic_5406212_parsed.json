I tried to search but it seems it's not yet available on the market even here https://www.zeusbtc.com/Integrated-Circuit/Better check the chip name carefully or make a screenshot or take a pic of that chip let me check if I could find more details about that chip. Or use the link above to find it but I'm not sure if you can easily find it there since the chip name you talking about seems different.",
