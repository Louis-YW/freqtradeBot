  "content": "Stacker news is a topics website where you get actuall bitcoins if you post good content or share useful links This is from the faq of the websiteWhat is Stacker News?Stacker News is a forum (like Reddit or Hacker News) where you can earn real money for creating or curating content. Rather than collecting “upvotes” that are not redeemable or transferable on Reddit or Hacker News, on Stacker News you can earn Bitcoin that can immediately be spent anywhere.‎Do I Need Bitcoin to Use Stacker News?[\\b]No. Every new stacker is able to post and comment for free (with limited visibility) while they stack their first few sats. After a stacker has started receiving zaps for their content, each post and comment requires a small fee to prevent spam and to encourage quality contributions. Many stackers have earned enough sats from their first few posts and comments to continue posting on the site indefinitely without ever depositing their own funds.Post and comment fees start at 1 sat.‎Why Is My Wallet Balance Going Up?When other stackers zap your posts and comments, those sats go to you. Stackers who have created valuable content are also given extra sats daily as a reward. These sats come from the revenue we generate from ~jobs, posting/commenting fees, and boost fees.Read the full faq here https://stacker.news/items/349/r/02b7622c79Every post in the website is ranked by how much sats people gived to you Its actually upvotes but with bitcoin ! so only the valuable content get more visible And its running over the lightning network so you can withdraw what you earned immediately to your wallet Here is some of the good posts from the website:Renting an apartment for bitcoin earned 22.6k sats (22600 satoshis) \\ 34 comments by @Monotonehttps://stacker.news/items/265707/r/02b7622c79The Lightning Network Grew by 1212% in 2 Years11.6k sats \\ 35 comments by @Rsync25  https://stacker.news/items/280061/r/02b7622c79Discussion on using Lightning as an alternative to CoinJoins9834 sats \\ 22 comments by @chungkingexpresshttps://stacker.news/items/256310/r/02b7622c79⚡️ Greenlight Is Now Open for Business 4179 sats \\ 100k boost \\ 24 comments by @blockstream_officialhttps://stacker.news/items/281568/r/02b7622c79you can also run your own ad on the website through boosts that will make your post rank high for a time periodSome pictures of the site:http://If you are interested im giving 50 sats for the first 10 people joining with this link and thos sats are actually from me not affilate or something i will give more if much more are interestedhttps://stacker.news/invites/clnq3rgu20001mzxpw7hsond9",

What differentiates this platform is only the system, which provides rewards to users and is crypto-based, but in general this platform has loopholes and can be manipulated just like mass media in general.and as far as i remember there is a similar project with a system like this called read.cash where people can boost posts and give rewards to their users. it is decentralized and based on bitcoin cash. but currently the platform is no longer active in providing rewards to its users, perhaps due to a lack of funds.",

What you need to note is the person giving merits, nowadays half of the sources are either corrupt or biased.Never base correctness of information on likes, merits etc.Regarding the spammers, scammers not knowing about that site, good news for them, bad news for us, they know about bitcointalk and already nested and infected every single place of this once great forum.This forum is also filled with manipulation, censor, discrimination, abuse, fraud, lies, the only difference is how they give you freedom to say whatever you want.(just don't say anything \"manipulators\" don't like).One advantage this new site has over bitcointalk, well there is no advantage, here people can scratch each others back or even their alt accounts to gain trust and status simply by transacting a few bucks back and forth, from right pocket to left pocket. In here we also have ring kissers, they do anything to please their masters.Now expand beyond this forum, go global and you'll see the same thing happening in all the governments.And the only solution is to burn them all to the ground, corruption has to burn from the roots.😉",
