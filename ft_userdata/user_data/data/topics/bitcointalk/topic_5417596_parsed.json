  "content": "Hello good morning everyone! I am having a great time now in my holidays in South-West England.I booked till the 31st of the current month, so my check-out will be that day, on Halloween 2022!Bitcoin was literally what is allowing me to survive and escape the terrible circumstances and injustice I was living on (EURONEWS). Today I did tell at the reception that I would like a face-to-face with the management to discuss the possibility of paying for another 440 nights, so till the 14th January 2024, for a whole bitcoin (at the current price, 18-19/October/2022). If rejected, I could always go for booking it the same way I did these 13 nights of... Peace.  I told them that I did not require that at all but that I was open for the press being invited to celebrate the deal and people like \"Nayib Bukele\" (President of 'El Salvador'), \"Pablo Iglesias\" (a great evangelist and advocate for Universal Unconditional Basic Income and the likes of bitcoiners and people like Ms Stacy Herbert and Max Keiser).Please may you receive an invitation too, if the deal happens and ends up being historical and celebrated.By the way, I am the creator of 'Cubic Postcode'. And I filled, in Great Britain, the patent GB2456000.And no, I am not rich. I am saving money to survive and thrive!>> - remotemass>> daniel 'at ' sweetanita_com",

Informing us of your location, booking a hotel for 440 nights with 1 Bitcoin or more, and the CEO of Cubic Postcode, I hope it's safe to do that.In my country it's not so safe to be too open because it may attract some frauders and criminals around you.However, your offer is good for the hotel, though, if it is considered. You will probably be in the hotel till 2024, which is the expected year for the next Bitcoin halving. Don't also hesitate to give feedback if your offer gets granted.",

I know how they work because we have an identical party in my country (they literally have the same name) and since they took over the capital, in a little over a year they managed to turn it into one big garbage dump.",

QuoteBut if the hotel can accept payment by bitcoin, they will probably allow it, but they may apply other rules because not many people want to stay at the hotel for long periods. For a hotel if someone wants to pay in front for a long stay it's even better because they'll have the money available for loan payments and investment right away.

It's not looking complex at all if the management knows how to do it.How much is one night accomodation there?

Regardless of how the price of Bitcoin fluctuates this is a big business deal. The hotel can even gain from this deal if they decide to keep Bitcoin until the bearish market emerge. Although it's up to the management to decide, having a hotel room booked for 440 days is uncommon. And OP's decision to celebrate this achievement is a great idea because Bitcoin needs all the publicity. Today I just got the news on this  thread  that Bitcoin is now in the Guinness World Record. This news might seem insignificant, but it has the tendency of attracting people to Bitcoin. I still have the expectation that more goodness about Bitcoin would keep occupying the media space.",
