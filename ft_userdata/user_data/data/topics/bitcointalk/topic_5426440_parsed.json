  "content": "Sad to say this, but given the fact that Theymos kept silent when I requested more sMerits I'm no longer going to be doing post history reviews on request.  I have a number of members who've been PMing me from months back, and those are the only folks I'm going to continue reviewing posts for.  So if you're not getting a bunch of merits from me in the near future, you didn't make the cut (through no fault of your own).I've simply had too many requests and too few sMerits.  I seriously considered quitting the merit source position as a FUCK YOU to Theymos, but that would just be an emotional reaction which ultimately wouldn't help the forum.  But I'd still like to state it, and I think I just did.I'll leave this thread open for a few hours if anyone wants to comment, but I'm not going to be answering questions about whether individual members are going to still have their posts reviewed, because as of right now I have to go back and check all my PMs.",

I have always thought that rewarding posts with merits should be done in a more natural way, and that is through normal browsing of the forum and spontaneous rewarding of posts that deserve it. I don't know how you review someone's post history, but sometimes even a seemingly good post in the context of the entire topic in which it is located may not deserve merit because it may just be a repetition of something that xx members wrote before. I'm not a merit source, so I don't have a problem with such things - but I try to reward posts that, according to my criteria, are useful and of high quality.Of course, everyone has their own criteria and I respect everyone who tries to contribute to the forum, especially if that contribution is not financially motivated.",

I have always thought that rewarding posts with merits should be done in a more natural way, and that is through normal browsing of the forum and spontaneous rewarding of posts that deserve it. When I was doing it by just meriting posts that I came across, I'd always wind up with a surplus of sMerits.  There are members here whose posts are being overlooked simply because of what section they're posted in or for whatever reason, and my goal was to try to help them out in the ranking up process.  When I can dump all of my sMerits each month I feel like I'm doing a much better job as a merit source, and I know I've helped at least a few members to rank up because of my offer.You have to understand how important I think the merit system is; that's why I probably seem emotional, likely angry.  And yes I'm just a wee bit pissed off that Theymos just keeps ignoring my requests for more sMerits--and that's in addition to his general silence about what he thinks of the state of the system, e.g., whether we need more merit sources and so forth.  I don't think my request was an unreasonable one, and if it was it'd be nice if I'd at least gotten a response one way or another.  I'm sure Theymos is hard at work developing the new obsolete forum software, but I know damn well he reads threads like the ones I've made, so that's the reason for my FU to him.  I calls 'em as I sees 'em.",

Is it personal preference, strongly agree with a statement, like the user, super good post, or some other reason that decides how many merits you give a person when you merit them? I try to give 1-2 merits to users when I merit them. The only time I normally give more than that is if I see someone close to a new rank. As a merit source, wouldn't you be able to stretch things a bit further by limiting the number you give to users?",

Your merit dumps were very motivating to me (especially when I was just starting out), and at least some of the forum improvement stuff that I occasionally spend/spent my time on (SMF patches, etc.) was due to feeling motivated/appreciated after one of your post history reviews. It even occurred to me (naive, I know) that theymos might be predisposed to granting me a favor after I send him the 2FA patch, and that I would ask him to give in on your name change request. With that all said, I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing if you have to become a little more selective in your merit giving. I hate to say it, but once in a while I do run into an objectively bad post that you've merited perhaps a bit too eagerly (just being honest; it doesn't happen often and I'll dig up an example if you like).Anyway, thanks for the hard work you've put into being such a diligent merit source, I'm sure there are more than a few members (like me) that really appreciate your efforts! P.S. I can't afford to be as generous as Mitchell, but I've left you a present, all the same.",

      "body": "I once had an interesting discussion with a member regarding the early implementation of the merit system and how him being an early merit source had an impact on his activity here. The feedback was quite sincere - being an early merit source means that he/she would feel the \"burden\" of the \"responsibility\" of making the best distribution of the new system. The first days/weeks of any new system being implemented are always critical to its success, and this would also be true for the merit system since the merit sources would be the \"barometer\" that would show the community which kind of posts are worthy to receive merit and thus promote more similar posts/threads in that nature. The first merit sources didn't had an easy task - they had to make a good distribution of merits, remain neutral, spend it all and distribute as widely and as wisely as that they could even if that meant browsing hundreds of posts only to find only 1 post being worthy of 1 or 2 merits (yeah it was that bad at the time).The same merit source also told me - and I think that this is relevant for you TP - that his/her job became easier when merit sources were gradually added as time moved on since he felt that he wasn't alone in this \"job\". I totally understand your struggle of wanting to promote good posts/threads that you feel that get lost within the numerous posts/threads that are generated here daily but I also don't want you to think that you're alone in this - you've got users like fillippone[1], ratimov[2], LoyceV[3] (and many more) that also go beyond their duties and actively promote our user base to send them posts that are indeed worthy (or at least that they think they are) so that they can also distribute their smerits. You also have merit sources that promote merit giveaways to our community by teaching them something of value in the process[4][5] (as an example), which is another great example of cross work. All of this to say that I totally understand what you're feeling TP - there isn't a worst feeling in the world that having the desire to do something only to be blocked by something that you can't possibly overcome - but don't forget that you're not alone in the \"merit squad\" - I'm sure that while you're unable to send smerits, there are a lot of merit sources that are working in parallel making the rightful distribution of them.Quite honestly I think that the community would lose a great member of the \"merit squid\" if you decided to leave but at the same time I think that it isn't a healthy feeling what you're feeling at the moment so I just hope that you end up choosing whatever decision you're most comfortable with.Better days will surely come TP.PS: While there isn't a full list of who is a merit source - rightfully so - I would say that there is a high probability that a good chunk of users are found in this list[6]...[1]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5412657[2]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5275032.0[3]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5093271.0[4]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5289839.0[5]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5300698.0[6]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;stats=topsendat",

However keeping the current stats in mind you will notice number of posts have declined significantly but merits have increased or at least stable round ~ 5000 merits weekly, based on Bitcointalk Merit Dashboard.
