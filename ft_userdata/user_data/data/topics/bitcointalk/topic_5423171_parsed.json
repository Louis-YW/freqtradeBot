  "content": "The FTX collapse, like MtGox, could have healthy consequences for the Bitcoin ecosystem. We have already seen people moving lots of coins from exchange wallets to their own, self-custodied wallets. That is a good first step, but we could go further, creating a post-FTX decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem.I hope the following technologies get a boost eventually:1) Decentralized exchanges.No, I don't mean these \"DEX\"es on Ethereum which trade one kind of transaction for another one . Instead, there are mainly two types:a) Crypto-to-Crypto:Atomic swaps should become the standard for these operations. This is a straightforward process which has very low risks (basically, the only disadvantage is that one party can always abandon the trade).Atomic swaps can be done on a (relatively) easy to use platform, like AtomicDEX. Or they can be created directly with a Bitcoin wallet. There is however seemingly still a lack of easy to use tools.One suggestion could be to add Atomic swap functionality to the most common wallet implementations. I don't know about Core, but Electrum could add this function. (The well-known Atomic Wallet unfortunately is not an ideal solution, as it uses also centralized services like changenow.io and thus even can lead to KYC/AML procedures.)b) Crypto-to-Fiat:Bisq is probably the best model to follow here, as it doesn't rely on a centralized web app like most other P2P exchanges. I have ignored it for a long time, but I looked into it recently and there are some interesting features to prevent fraud, like Account signing. Still, it's a bit slow and has high fees. So there's much margin of improvement.2) BitcoinScript/Taproot-based DeFi.DeFi is based on the concept to buy or sell risks between two or multiple parties. DeFi on Ethereum has almost always centralized components, as the contracts have an owner who can become a single point of failure in some situations.BitcoinScript based solutions can be instead completely decentralized. The counterparties create special kinds of transactions to exchange their risks and collaterals. For example, based on the Atomic Swap technology, there is possibly a way to create American options (see here and here).There is also the Discreet Log Contracs concept. There is RGB and Taro for tokens and other contracts, and some of these solutions even support Lightning.3) Payment processing/eCommerceMerchants should consider moving to self hosted solutions. Also, I hope OpenBazaar gets back on track, or an alternative can emerge.4) Integration of solutions.Many of the solutions I mentioned have low volume and aren't well known. They're scattered in several software packages of varying characteristics (e.g. command line/gui/browser/mobile) and maturity. You won't like to install dozens of apps to do all these nice things centralized providers like FTX offered inside a single interface.So my proposal here is to create common standards between all the mentioned apps. Create a software package which includes all functions to buy and sell Bitcoin for other crypto and fiat, sell/buy goods and services, and create tokens and DeFi contracts without centralized components.5) Education.The decentralized technologies I mentioned in this post have specific advantages, disadvantages and risks. Good documentation should be written for newbies to really be able to understand them, and to not get in danger to scammed.I appreciate feedback, other ideas and contributions!",

Especially if they are a day trader or just love to trade regularly for some reason. Even if Bisq becomes cheaper and faster, the majority will probably still use CEX. Not to say the number of users won't increase, I just don't believe most of them will learn and compromise with the negatives of P2P trades.  Your suggestion to build an all-in-one app sounds good but is probably costly in terms of development. Sometimes I do find one or two apps that promise something like this but in the end, they need KYC, closed source, etc.",

From now on, we should not be trusting anyone no matter how good they are in the eye of the public and the politicians. May this can be starting a good revolution so we can choose the best technologies, the best platforms and the best strategies that can be working for our own advantage.

The highest volume of crypto to crypto is BTC/XMR pair and BTC/BSQ pair, while the other is really low for the last 7 days volume. I would say the real usage of decentralized exchange is only for decentralized coin, as we know Ethereum and Binance smart chain is centralized, so it's pointless to use decentralized IMO.

Never had any problems with deposits, selling, withdrawing fiat. The money appears in my bank account within seconds. And the withdrawal fee for fiat is something like 0.5%. So why should I risk using dex and potentially get scammed, get problems with my banks for receiving p2p transactions, wait longer time, maybe even pay higher fees. I don't store any money on centralized exchange, so I won't be affected by a FTX-style collapse, unless I'm unlucky and it happens in the moment that I do my transaction.",

The goal of \"DeFi\" is originally to enable trading of distinct financial derivatives like options without any middlemen. Traditional Ethereum-based DeFi doesn't really allow this as there are \"contract owners\" and other centralized parties like bridges which can interfere.The idea thus is, like in Discreet Log Contracts, to allow the two counterparties of each derivative contract to arrange everything between themselves (in DLCs there is additionally an oracle but without any control over the contract).I think for daytrading all kinds of DeFi are problematic. So centralized platforms may stay for this use case.@franky1: This is only of interest for professional traders who move large amounts back and forth, and for those it should anyway not to be much of a problem if they notify their bank about their activity.Quote from: joniboiniYour suggestion to build an all-in-one app sounds good but is probably costly in terms of development.I think not really. For most solutions there are libraries or command line versions of their basic functions, which can be used independently of their original GUI, so an \"all-in-one-GUI\" shouldn't be that complicated to build. It would be even easier if the projects would before agree to use common API standards.This would be worthy a new thread in the Development forum. Maybe there is already such an initiative?Quote from: DespairoJust a heads up Bisq isn't only used for crypto to fiat only, you can trade crypto to cryptoThis is true, although for me atomic swap in this case is the better solution as it is near-completely trustless and doesn't need dispute resolution (which is easy in Bisq for crypto-crypto but can't probably be completely automated, as the automation solution would have to monitor all altcoin blockchains).Quote from: pooya87The problem I have with DEXes is that sometimes they don't have certain options like trading altcoins with USDT which I really hope Bisq adds on more chains (like Tron) with more liquidity on them.I would also very much in favour of Bisq adding direct altcoin-to-fiat trades. The reason are the unpredictable BTC transaction fees which can complicate trades if you just deposit at a time when Binance moves funds around or miners take an hour for a block ... In theory, if they keep rejecting this move, everybody can clone the Bisq code and create their own DAO.",

If it's open source and no entity owns the main contract then always a fork can be started in the case the developer team misbehaves or misuses its power.Bisq is a special case because of their DAO construction; if you want to fork it you also have to replicate the DAO. It's of course perfectly possible but it requires some more work than a simple software fork.

Of course features like payment detail hashing and account signing can enhance security, but they wouldn't change the decentralized character.But in the case of fiat-to-crypto things aren't so easy. You need some escrow/arbitration procedure, otherwise the scam potential is very high (due to chargeback risk and/or proof-of-payment faking).Quote from: franky1 on November 26, 2022, 05:38:11 PMdex should not be a central app or 1 service for al. there should be multiple dex offer noticeboards. Yup. But they could use a common API/standard so they could be integrated into a common GUI. That would not threaten their descentralization.@2stout: I'm not that pessimistic. With each of these incidents one generation of Bitcoin users learn about the \"NYKNYC\" approach. I think this will slowly, probably \"very\" slowly, drive the adoption of the decentralized solutions I mentioned.",
