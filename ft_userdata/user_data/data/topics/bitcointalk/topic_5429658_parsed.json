If you close your position before the 8th hour, funding rate won't affect your equity in the derivatives accountQuoteOr it is possible to see the funding fee added or deducted every 8 hours?Yes, it possible to see it under your trade history depending on the kind of exchange you are usingHere is an example of a trade history of my experimental BTCUSD open position sometime backQuote from: Oshosondy on December 17, 2022, 02:36:00 AMI noticed I can see the fee on Kucoin after the position is closed, but I can not see it on other exchanges that I am using.Never used Kucoin for trading derivatives.

Now, bitmex is too illiquid, and is not recommended too. However, it has got one advantage that the derivates maker fee is -0.01% which means you earn to open a limit trade (which most of the exchanges dont offer).

There are so many options out there.That is true, there are many other exchanges that offers derivative trading, I have used 4 exchanges for derivative trading before and not only Binance I am still using for now, I use others too. Even for BTC pair, I prefer to just use OKX for it most of the time which is the only pair I prefer while using OKX, although OKX has other pairs and it is a good exchange too. Only complain that I always talked about the exchanges is their mobile app, if you click on it to bring up coin trading pair list, it will take like 3 to 5 seconds to load, unlike many other exchanges that it would have loaded immediately because it has loaded underground immediately you visit the exchange with the app. On Binance, BUSD trading pairs are not zero fee, there are charges for it unless it is BTCBUSD. BTCUSDT and other bitcoin pairs are all of zero fee too.While trading derivative on Binance, their is discount for using BUSD though, but not zero fee.I am surprised that USDT is paired on OKX even for derivative trading just like USDT. Binance saying they automatically convert it to BUSD is just one of the centralization Binance is aiming and the exchange wish BUSD to overtake USDC with their BUSD is what I am thinking. Binance is a bad example if looking for exchanges that wants decentralization.",

First things first you need take a look the coin with high funding fee rate, and i see that you are using binance right? Go to this https://www.binance.com/en/futures/funding-history/0And then start to pick a coin with high funding rate whether at minus position or plus position usually trader use the funding rate to know the long and short ratio high (+) mean so much trader take a long position high (-) mean so much trader take a short position After u pick the high funding rate watch the candle and switch lower timeframe 1 minute or 5 minute if funding (+) whale will be take short position and the price will go down for about 30 minutes before countdown, you take short position and then usually you will get profit from your position and after that place stoploss @ the above initial price vice versa After countdown you will get funding fee @ history tab and the price will continue @ normal stage",
