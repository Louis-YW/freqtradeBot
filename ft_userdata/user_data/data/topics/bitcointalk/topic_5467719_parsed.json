There are some gambling sites that do not require KYC, people should know that losing the 2FA backup can lead to loss of their gambling site account that they enable it. But it helps against hackers. Setting stop loss can be good but some people prefer to use gambling budget instead. Once the budget has been spent, they wait until next week before they can continue to gamble.The one that I can add is that no one should buy a gambling account. Some people can buy gambling account if the gambling site they want to register with require KYC and they want to gamble on the gambling site. People should not buy gambling site account.",

Let me say as you do list about loss limit, yes as a gambler you could decide how much to gamble per week or months because we the gamblers don't always put this in consideration as we think constantly gambling bring us winning but partially we lost more when we try to chase lost to make a winning. And of course 2fa is one major important keys to safeguard our funds in the gambling site otherwise it could be stolen by other use who may have remote access to our account.",

Using 2FA doesn’t really depend on the type of currency you’re using whether you’re using crypto or fiat it will still provide the same security that you want, same for for the Stop limit, if you’re on crypto or fiat stop limit will help you maintain how you spend your money in your gambling account so it’s not unique to “cryptocurrency casino”.",

If there's a legitimate physical casino, it's better to go there or even travel to Las Vegas to gamble. KYC requirements can sometimes be used to exploit gamblers. As they say, casinos love losers but hate winners, especially when large sums of money are involved. I'm sure the gambler was very confident he would be able to withdraw since he deposited $100k, which is a significant amount. However, we don't have control over what a site might do to scam money from gamblers.Regarding the OP, I always use 2FA. I don't see the need for loss or win limits to be automated; I can manage those manually.",

      "body": "Ah, nice topic. I would like to add an indirect security measure that everyone must follow when registering on gambling sites. Now over a couple of months, I am continuously seeing an increased rate of accusations from the user's end where they are not like gambling sites asking for their KYC info because they have reached a certain limit of wagering. However, casinos have everything covered under the ToS. Now, if users do not do any KYC then they are going to lose the funds for nothing. So safety tip: If you are KYC phobic then just read all the terms and conditions of the casino before making any move. If the casino requires KYC then you have to submit the KYC, so make sure you are comfortable sharing your KYC and making your account KYC verified for the safety of your funds. This might look odd, but it's more than a mandatory requirement if you want your funds in your possession otherwise it's gone if no KYC is done after certain wagering.",

It is also important that we check the legitimacy of each casino that we will play with and we have to check if they're reputable and trusted. Checking their TOS is also necessary so we will not have regrets in the end as we will be able to comply and meet the requirements for KYC and other verification process.We must know the do's and don'ts of each casinos so we will know how to enjoy gambling without violating any of their rules. We have to do it so we will not put our funds into too much risks. So we will also not expect too much if we are already aware of their terms and conditions.",

If this is on the TOS then there is nothing to do except to comply, I know it may seem unfair but I agree with @Lucius here, gamblers should only engage on online gambling with funds they can clearly demonstrate where they came from, because even if the money you deposited comes from legal sources, if you were to get a big win you will have to pass a very intensive verification process and any failure on your part to comply will lead to the loss of that money.",
