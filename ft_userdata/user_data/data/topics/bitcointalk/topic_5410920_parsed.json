Russia has more than 17 million crypto owners, but there are zero monthly search volumes of cryptocurrency terms. Maybe there Russians are too afraid to search for cryptocurrency related stuff on the internet.USA has the most active crypto owners and the most crypto ATMs, but the amount of businesses accepting crypto payments is only 6. That doesn't make any sense to me. The guys at Merchant Machine will have to reveal their information sources.",

The top 10 includes mainly countries in Africa and South America.This is great for we Nigerians. Although the government isn't totally in support of cryptocurrency I love the way Nigerian are beginning to have more interest in cryptocurrency. If you look into the age of those investors the highest percentage of users are the youths which make the future brighter. I believe Nigeria can lead the entire African continent towards cryptocurrency acceptance.",

Having said that, when businesses around the world start accepting crypto for payment, it will be very pivotal to crypto adoption globally.Quote from: NdaMk on August 23, 2022, 11:18:19 AMThis is great for we Nigerians.

I believe Nigeria can lead the entire African continent towards cryptocurrency acceptance. You don't have to quote all of the OP mate, especially when it is a big one. Having said that, Nigeria has always been one of the leading countries in Africa that is involved in crypto, and mind you that government reluctance to embrace crypto isn't peculiar to Nigeria, it is somewhat the same way globally, though whatever they come up with is usually ineffective on decentralized crypto like Bitcoin, especially when we are considering long term effects.",

Looks to me like that Merchant Machine pulled those number out of their ass and not by conducting a serious study.Quote from: Ratimov on August 23, 2022, 10:59:29 AMThere are a lot of crypto users in Russia.Its one thing to have \" a lot of crypto users\", but according to that data one in eight Russians owns crypto. From your experience, do you really think that's the case? I have the same question for other members whose countries are on their list, like Nigeria where according to that list incredibly high 42% of total population own crypto, meaning 80 million people.If those numbers were true, BTC would be at six figure number years ago.",

IMO Coinmap, for example, isn't really accurate and often outdated. Brick and mortar merchants aren't also, in my opinion, the best metric to research \"adoption\", as BTC is much more prominent in e-commerce. And they considered only the capitals of the countries ... they really were lazy It's a pity, because the topic is important - we really need better studies in this area.",

And as for Bogotá, 86 sounds a bit over the top, that was why i asked in my earlier reply if they are that much of a crypto-friendly country as i've not heard or read too much about them. Having said that, it is difficult to know which of all these sort of data is accurate, if they prolly had more similarities than difference in them, or maybe just a slight difference, then we might consider its credibility, but when it's completely different, it is hard to tell.",

Lots of representation from Asian and African countries, another surprising standout is Columbia - I guess their internet infrastructure is well enough advanced and people are choosing to hold this currency instead of money in the local banking system.",
