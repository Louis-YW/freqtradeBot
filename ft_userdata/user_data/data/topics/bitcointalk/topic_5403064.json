  "content": "I know how to increase the bitcoin adoption by humanity by more than 10 times. There was a time when Facebook was little known. When the movie about Facebook \"The Social Network\" was released in 2010, then everyone found out about Facebook. It's time for everyone to find out about Bitcoin. It's time to make a movie about Bitcoin. Satoshi 's ElevenI want to make a film about how people who have never owned bitcoin suddenly receive 1 BTC as a gift, they try to cash them out and spend them on something useful for themselves and their family. In the process, they start a bitcoin wallet for the first time, choose which wallet suits them best, and learn about the importance of saving the Seed phrase. And importantly, they will find out how bitcoin easily turns into fiat money.The basic idea is as follows: In 2011, (when 1 bitcoin was worth 1 dollar), the main character accidentally discovers that there is such a thing as a cryptocurrency. The main character has eleven friends, to whom one by one he makes an offer to invest in bitcoin. But all of them refuse of this, motivating each with their own reasons. Eleven years later, he finds his old friends again and offers them to invest in bitcoin at the old price - 1 bitcoin for 1 dollar. But there is only a limited supply. Each friend will receive only 1 bitcoin. And then the person will tell and show what he will do with this pile of money that has just fallen on each of them.   The first of them has a critical life situation, he urgently needs brain surgery and therefore, he will spend 1 bitcoin to save his life.   The second friend decided to move from the province to the capital in order to realize himself as an actor. But real estate is expensive in the city, and he uses 1 bitcoin to improve his living conditions.   The third friend has everything. He has a good job, good health, a good wife. Since he is an IT specialist, he will put 1 bitcoin in hold, because he believes that bitcoin will grow in price even more.   The fourth friend, having received 1 bitcoin, will be able to realize his dream, to settle in an ecologically clean mountain place, with clean air and water, natural food, away from urban pollution.   The fifth friend wanted to travel around the country on a cool exclusive motorcycle and bitcoin will help him in this.   The sixth will invest the funds inherited from bitcoin in breeding fish on his plot on the riverbank, inherited from his grandma.   The seventh — a former trainer — left home land for a foreign country and cannot return due to financial difficulties, with the help of 1 bitcoin he will be back home and open a gym.   The eighth — a successful businessman — still does not believe in cryptocurrencies, nevertheless, after receiving 1 bitcoin, he will begin to invest in a monthly purchase for a fixed amount, as Jordan Belfort (The Wolf of Wall Street) advises.   The ninth is an experienced taxi driver who works hard every day to provide for his family. For 1 bitcoin, he will be able to buy several cars and rent them out to other taxi drivers, and he will go on a well-deserved rest.   The tenth with the help of 1 bitcoin will realize his two eternal passions: delicious food and beautiful girls — he will open his own small restaurant.   The eleventh wanted to make a movie all his life, after receiving 1 bitcoin, he will make a nonfiction movie about this amazing cryptocurrency.To implement this idea, you may make a donation at bitcoin address: 17rmkLNcezqisR9K2gro8ZmYb4V4ZJMk3aI need 25 BTC. From 25 BTC that you might donate to me, 11 BTC I will giveaway to each of the persons I told above (1 coin per 1 person , so they would make their dreams come true). I'll spend the rest on shooting equipment and other expenses.In fact, the screenplay of such a movie is based on true story. All 11 people are real people who were actually offered to invest in bitcoin when it was very cheap. But all of them refused of this, considering it a scam and a pyramid scheme. Including me too. I still have a bitcoin wallet distributive for Windows PC downloaded on February 11, 2011 (Bitcoin 0.3.19 BETA), where there was still a \"Generate Coins\" button.Such a movie will attract the attention a lot of people to increase the army of bitcoin adopters many times.[/font]",
