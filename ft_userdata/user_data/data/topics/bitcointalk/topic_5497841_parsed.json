Some others do exist that teach the subject of cryptocurrency and give users the opportunity to try out or test what they have learnt while gaining certification as a Certified Blockchain Professional (CBP) or certification as a Certified Blockchain Developer (CBD).Another finding led me to discover that the University of Nicosia offers an MSc in Blockchain and Digital Currency and is notably among the first institution with such academic degree in this field and in the world.*If the study of fish is called fishery, what is the study of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency in general and the study of Blockchain technology called?",

But if it is called cryptocurrencies, it is not bad either. I want to say that this topic does not belong to off-topic because cryptocurrencies is what that are discussed about and nothing else that should be moved to off-topic board.",

To be honest, I never took any cryptocurrency course, I read articles online from different websites, when I was joining bounties, I had to write articles, and to write articles I had to get some knowledge about things, so I started reading articles online, daily 2 to 5 max. And with time, when I used that knowledge in writing my article it got expanded. And afterward, I spent time on this forum, and added a little knowledge day by day, just like this course knowledge added today.Speaking of what we should call it on the fact that the study of fish is called fishery, it doesn't have to be that way, like the study of finding the cause of disease is known as Epidemiology while it should be diseasery according to you. The terms could be different like the ones you already mentioned above.",

I'm yet to know why it has to be Latin and Greek words, perhaps a little dive into the history of formal education might reveal the reason because they occupy a significant position in academics. In philosophy, Latin occupy a significant percent of the diction, same can be said of anthropology. Maybe the early scholars used Latin mostly.",

And I think I kind of agree to what Sir \"Stompix\" suggested to first find the Latin or greek word for Crypto/Bitcoin/Blockchain and slap an ology at the end.That is;1. Crypto in Greek = Kryptos, which means hidden). whereas if you are to slap an \"ology\" at the end, it gives us Kryptology. (I.e Cryptology, the study of Crypto)2. Bitcoin in Latin = \"Solidus electronicus quidam\", which means \"A certain electronic coin\"). whereas if you are to slap an \"ology\" at the end, it gives us Electronicus-quidamology (i.e the study of Bitcoin)3. Blockchain in Latin = \"Bibliotheca electronica quaedam\", which means a certain electronic library). whereas if you are to slap an \"ology\" at the end, it gives us Electronica-quaedamology (i.e the study of the Blockchain)But however, I also tried using a short cut with ChatGPT, and this is what I got üëáQuoteThe study of cryptocurrency is often referred to as \"cryptoeconomics.\" This field combines elements of cryptography, computer science, economics, and game theory to analyze and understand the incentives, behavior, and mechanisms behind cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.Credit: ChatGPT",
