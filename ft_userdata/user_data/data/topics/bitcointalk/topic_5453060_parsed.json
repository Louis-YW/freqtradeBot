The idea was enforced by the US afaik, and any sweepstakes claiming to be one that asks for an entry free would be illegal since it's at that point, called gambling.  I would differentiate between the two since sweepstakes involve (should involve anyway) no money, at all, in any form. You can compare it to a bonus so to speak in grocery stores or markets. It isn't illegal in the US, in fact, afaik it started from the US, or at least, the idea that sweepstake was a form of having a chance of winning something without having the need to spend money.",

It's like trying to put lipstick on a pig - it's still a pig, right? The core concept of risking something valuable and relying on chance doesn't change just because it's called a sweepstakes or has different terms.However, you've got it right! It can be quite confusing because sweepstakes and gambling regulations can vary from state to state in the US. In some places, sweepstakes are permitted under strict regulations, while gambling in general might be prohibited. So, it really depends on the specific laws of the state you're in, and it's probably best to check the local regulations or consult with legal experts who are familiar with that area.",

      "body": "Well by definition, anything that involves the use or the purchase of something in exchange for profit is gambling, but at the same time, these people from sweepstakes are getting around this by using technical loopholes, since when you play sweepstakes you don't necessarily put in money in order to join, sometimes you just need a ticket and to register and you're good to go. Which is why sweepstakes is not gambling. Now, I get why some of these bad actors are using this technical loophole to avoid the law but at the same time authorities are capable of conducting arrests if they think something awry is afoot. And since that has been the case since time immemorial, I think your country's issue with illegal gamblers getting away with their stuff by calling their business \"sweepstakes\" is not necessarily a problem with technicalities, but a problem with the police system not being vigilant enough to apprehended suspected perpetrators.",

Some are free but other sweepstakes also have some minimum requirements for entrants. Quote2. Is Sweepstakes gambling or not? Sweepstakes are not originally designed as gambling but when someone is given tickets after purchasing a product it now has some gambling features. Since you need to pay money to get social coins, it is now gambling. This is because there is a possibility that the company will use part of the money from the sales to finance the prizes. The bottom line is that we bought a coin because we want to win a prize, that's gambling.",

Raffles aren't a form of gambling mind you, and sweepstakes are a form of raffle, actually it is the main form of raffle, so I agree with you when it comes to where the confusion is coming from. But then again, authorities are there to set a clear distinction, and I don't think they'll allow the public confuse it for the other, or use said confusion as an alibi when caught red-handed if you know what I'm saying. So it still boils down to whether OP's government is vigilant enough to apprehend these suspected illegal gambling activities or are they just gonna let it slide all because \"the public doesn't know sweepstakes is not gambling\".

My answer to the second question is yes. Sweepstakes are generally considered a form of gambling, although they are distinguished from other types of gambling, such as lotteries or casinos, by certain criteria. Sweepstakes typically involve a prize or prizes being awarded to winners selected at random. To avoid being involved in illegal gambling like this, sweepstakes must meet specific legal requirements, such as providing a free method of entry and not requiring participants to make a purchase or provide consideration in exchange for a chance to win.",
