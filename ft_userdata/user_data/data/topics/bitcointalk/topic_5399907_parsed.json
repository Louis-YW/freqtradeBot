  "content": "The collateral unlocks in 28 days i will pay back 8.69ETH before the 28 day period is over. The pair is locked in team.finance and I will transfer over the ownership. Drop a DM if you would like to help out. I wont budge at all on this offer as its already very fair I am expecting to pay this back on day 14 ideally. Escrow will be used at your cost this is already a very sweet pot for someone who has a extra eth laying around to get a good potential return on defaulting.",
