  "content": "As you know bitcoin halving is a few months away (first quarter 2024) and then we may have bull season in 2024/2025. We are all excited about the bull season but no one prepares for it. People start buying Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies when the bull market is in progress and the prices are already high. Some even have the fear of missing out and buy at the top of the bull market. The result is that most people lose money in bull season too.So in order to have maximum benefits in the bull market, you should have a plan and start executing it unless it is too late.I have already accumulated bitcoin in my portfolio (70% of my portfolio is in bitcoin) which i will not sell until we are above the all time high again. Similarly, i have bought some major cap coins and a few others low cap too which i think will perform well in the bull season.Â  I have been doing this for the last 3 to 4 months, buying some at every dump. If the market dumps further, I will not panic and if I have more spare money, I may accumulate more bitcoin. I am confident that this bull season will be the best so far as it will be initiated by institutional investors.Also, to keep my bitcoin secure and to remain calm in times of dump, I have moved my bitcoins in cold storage so I never get tempted to sell on small profits like i won't be selling on 2x profit if bitcoin reaches 50,000$. My targets are clear and will sell in parts after bitcoin reaches new highs.",

My targets are clear and will sell in parts after bitcoin reaches new highs.I really liked the idea of storing funds in hardware wallets. Despite the fact that hardware wallets provide us with better security than software wallets, this unique benefit that you just mentioned is also a great one. Because most people holding funds on centralised exchanges sell quickly once they see some profits and try to book them, Even in a few of the past discussions, a member here said to me that he or she would sell his coin and at least book the profit, which would be equal to his capital investment.I also had this mindset about selling BTC once it made a new ATH. But someone said booking profit is better, but I still have the same mindset and will sell on ATH.I think it is better for everyone to not expose how much BTC they have accumulated because this forum is full of bad actors and they might try a series of phishing attacks, which they are already trying, but still, it is better to stay off the grid and at the same time talk about it.My plan is almost the same as yours, but I don't have any investments in Alts because my experience with them is not good and most of them brought huge losses. So I am just ignoring them.",

Many people are humble just to expect bitcoin to hit $100k, and they'll sell it at that price, but for me, I want to sell it over $170k - $200k, that's my goal for bitcoin in the upcoming bull season. Of course, when bitcoin achieves such unimaginable growth, many altcoins will have crazy hype beyond our imagination. But choosing altcoins is not easy, everyone should be careful when investing in altcoins for the next bull season.",

In this case, you will have a potential chance to make a good profit. Everything is not so clear.I can say that you should not focus your attention only on one Bitcoin.

That's contrary to bitcoin that is still above its previous ATH.-snip-+1 from meAs an investor perspective, I always have to smile when people refer to their altcoins as a \"portfolio\". In my opinion, there is no asset class in which there is such a centrally driven dependency - at most the currency market until a few years ago where even a weakening dollar could depress the pairs at least in the short term, but that never lasted. From an investor's point of view, altcoins are only suitable in the very short term for increasing the inventory of one's own bitcoins, as they definitely have the potential to achieve significantly higher percentage gains (and also regularly prove this in the bull runs). At the latest when the altcoin run cools down, however, it is appropriate to exchange back again, as can be seen here quite nicely in the loss against the ATH in the top 10 (ex. stable coins and Lidos ETH): Source",

Some even have the fear of missing out and buy at the top of the bull market. The result is that most people lose money in bull season too.Almost everyone who knows about the crypto currency market is well aware that after some time the bull season can begin. At this time, the prices of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies have dropped significantly. There are coins that have dropped more than 90%, but people are still not buying. I think we don't like cheap things and when the same things become expensive we start buying them. Then many blame the crypto currency market or Bitcoin that it is harmful to invest in it.Quote from: virasog on September 08, 2023, 03:20:33 AMAlso, to keep my bitcoin secure and to remain calm in times of dump, I have moved my bitcoins in cold storage so I never get tempted to sell on small profits like i won't be selling on 2x profit if bitcoin reaches 50,000$. My targets are clear and will sell in parts after bitcoin reaches new highs.Of course, if one invests for the long term, he should keep his assets in cold storage. Long term investment should not be kept in exchanges. Often times the market prices rise, in which case you are not tempted to make a small profit and you keep it for long term. Like you, most investors have set their own goals for selling their assets, in order to get a good profit. You have adopted the best strategy for the next bull season which is likely to bring you good profits.",

Bitcoin is a very good investment, and whether anyone likes it or not, it will not make you lose eventually but one should be careful at the striking price too so that you will not miss the opportunity of buying at lower prices.This is why I came up with the idea of buying any amount that I could spare instead of saving it in my bank account, and as the money came in I made the plans a reality. This has actually helped me to stop wasting money on frivolities and I'm surprised at the amount I've accumulated so far.",
