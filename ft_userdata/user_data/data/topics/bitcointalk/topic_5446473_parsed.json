      "body": "Yes, that fear of harm is not wrong at all. Currently, scientists are working on artificial intelligence and developing AI applications for a variety of purposes, from manufacturing automation to medical and financial services. Some are still concerned that artificial intelligence could become a threat to humans in the future. The scientists also studied and presented a number of scenarios about the potential consequences of the development of AI, including issues of cybersecurity, the replacement of jobs by robots. Remember that this change is not a barrier, but we are gradually entering a new era when people control work more effectively.",

He probably may be raising concerns about the jobs life like robots or humanoid robots do in place of human beings. These robots have in real time taken most employees out of job due to the growth in technology.IMO I feel that business minded men like Elon musk and Bill gates should not bother themselves on what they have really enjoyed the advantage of. They prefer AI and humanoid robots in place of human beings to use them to cut cost in their businesses including production cost and why complain on a creation that you have chosen over human beings and the effects of which include unemployment and drop in GDP whose result is poverty.",

We do we go from here?Let's just see if that's going to be a problem in the future. We have to remember that these AI are still programmed by human beings and I think we're just having too much of it based on the sci-fi futuristic movies where AIs became rebels and becomes dangerous to humanity.If they're made for an upgraded productivity then that should be the focused of it to help us catch up with how our lives become easier. But I guess I do understand the worry of it, because it might literally make our lives easier (dark side).",

I just say what I think, though.There's a proverb that says, \"An okra plant doesn't outgrow the person who plants it; no matter how tall it grows, when the owner wants to harvest it, they still bend the stems down and harvest the okra.\"If AI becomes a threat to humanity, the people who built it can destroy it.That's the video where Elon speaks about the AI threat: https://youtu.be/Qj-iz6MByZg",

That is not digestible. Because these things can improvise over time and there is no doubt about that and can think faster than the human mind as their processing speed is higher than humans. But the robot is a robot.As big icons of tech industries like Bill Gates have mentioned in there some interviews, now is the era of AI which will change the way of thinking, learning, doing work and jobs, etc. So coming back to your question, life will really change as I am so dependent on AI tools for my courses that whenever I face a problem I ask Ai tools. Some times i think how i lived these years without it. Yeah, then i realize i am depending on it which is not good for me. Overall, it will change the way we think, learn, act and perform along with harms to our minds. I dont understand if you taking the revolution of AI as dominant over humans like happens in sci-fi movies. \"No\" Robots will not rule the world (harm us) instead we will allow them to rules us. How? By depending on them so much that we cannot do any work without them. On other hand AI technologies can maximize the harm rate of pre-existing military weapons but that's another level of discussion we should avoid doin here.",

However, when going deeper, it is completely inaccurate and becomes fabricated, and the problem is to refer to the information, not treat it as a source of information. And when I got into the details of the ethics of AI, I received a response that left me both skeptical and fearful of the prospect of being dominated by machines. When in the development of AI, we all raise the issue of ethics in use, and I see not only this tool but every tool that helps people we need to uphold the ethical issue in our use.",
