It's buy and wait.If your strategy is to buy a little every month or occasionally, then now is a good time, as the value of BTC is at the same level as it was in 2020. And stay tuned, to buy again if it drops even more.By doing this, you will be able to lower your average purchase price and allow you to feel more secure in the future, despite the changes in value that may occur.",

I will continue to DCA but in recent weeks I have slowed down having gone from investing every week to every 2 weeks as the prices just keep falling. It's a good decision to hold until there's a new ATH will come but don't expect it will happen in a shorter time, there's no time frame for that so invest that you are willing to wait and the amount that you can afford. Usually, as per the past history of Bitcoin price, ATH will come after Bitcoin's next halving and it's expected that will occur after a year.  So possibly 12-18 months isn't enough and might you need to extend your patience until seeing there's a bull trend in the market. For now, full your bag, and continue purchasing Bitcoin in a DCA way.",

If you've been in the market for 10 months, this year will certainly be a bearish year that will make you lose a lot, but you have to remember that this situation is a good opportunity to enter the market. If you have spare money, buy it gradually and hold it. A portfolio decline of -36% is still very reasonable, I myself have even experienced a portfolio decline of around -90%, as long as you don't cut losses there will be no loss, you just need to be patient and wait for the bull market to come.",

Since all crypto coins have decreased their prices very significantly, it is your advantage to buy many coins as cheaply as possible. If you are a real investor, you should realize this opportunity and you must don't care about the current drop in your portfolio. Commonly, people will hold for around 3-4 years, they target to sell in the next bullrun (after BTC halving). So, if you have bought enough coins, you can keep them in your private wallets and forget them for around 3 years.",

I am hoping these very low prices last at least another 3 or 4 months so I can accumulate as much as I can.

However, technically that's a better time to get into crypto when the chips are down so you can buy in cheap. So many people who bought earlier are already caught up in this dwindling price and are regretting it now.QuoteI will continue to DCA but in recent weeks I have slowed down having gone from investing every week to every 2 weeks as the prices just keep falling.If as a newbie you already have this type of mindset I would say you're doing well.

I see you are investing in the right coin (Bitcoin) so I think 36% is not difficult if you are patient you will find more than 36% profit.and 12-18 months for me that's not a long time for bitcoin. look at the history of bitcoin for several years and always provide the best for long term investmentQuote from: JamesDaniel90 on November 21, 2022, 06:59:20 PMI am just wondering if those who have been involved with crypto for a few years at least could share their experience and offer any advice for those new like myself? Thanks The key to investing success is to be patient. if you are able to continue DCA and patiently wait for the next few years, you will find something extraordinary that bitcoin has in store for you.but it all comes back to you whether you are able to be patient holding your assets in a few years",
