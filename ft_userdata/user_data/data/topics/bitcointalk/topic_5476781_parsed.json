What is even more surprising is that after all those 20,000 successful transactions, there is not a single review about your exchange. Not a negative one, not a positive one.Someone is definitely lying here.",

He will try to promote the service in less strict forums and they do not care whether it is a scam or not, but it is difficult to believe that he will not create other accounts with other links.",
