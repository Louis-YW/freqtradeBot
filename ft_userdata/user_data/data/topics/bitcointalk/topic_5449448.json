I am unsure as each person has different conditions and life status so that your thinking is not true for everyone.The saying is \"Don't invest what you can not afford to lose\". If you use money that is needed for your life and your survival, it is super risky at beginning and you should not do this. Getting richer is attractive but what if you fail and consequently will die? Not good at all.",

No. When you invest with the money that you are to use for other important expenses,you will end up selling off you investment at a price that might be lower that what you bought because you are to invest on a long term investment to enjoy your profit.Quote from: Zanab247 on April 19, 2023, 01:53:23 PMI saw some message in the Bitcointalk.org where some users are trying to sell their account just to get what to eat not knowing that they can use that account to work to get a huge capital that will bring them out from poverty, and make food surplus in their home.

No way you will invest in BTC today and you will not have something good to eat because, investment is like a seed planted in a due season to expect something good in the future. Is it a good thing to invest or is good to continue looking for what to eat? What do you think.First of all, I think this topic should go to economics.Now you are just talking verbally, @OP, but remember the saying that goes, \"All fingers are not equal.\" Humans are faced with a lot of needs every day, owing to the inflation rate and devaluation of local currencies. A bitcoin investment is more of a future investment and not just an investment with sudden profits, although it depends on the market's trend and volatility as well as how much capital is invested. So normally one cannot forgo food, for health is wealth; you must eat to be alive and stay healthy; you must check your health and all other primary needs that usually arise.The inflation rate is high, and relying solely on one source of income is not really sustainable for some people, depending on their country of residence as well, so do you think they will survive? or you suggest they invest in Bitcoin, and maybe when they are seriously in need, they sell under pressure, which may result in a loss.Since I have been in this forum, I have come to notice that there are only a few reasons why people sell their account: First, either they have other accounts, so they just grow a different one and sell it off; secondly, maybe they are low-quality posters and don't have the opportunity to be accepted in any campaign, so they just need to sell it. So I would say that account owners sell their accounts for a variety of reasons; you can't just tell everyone that it's because of \"what to eat,\" because it's not always just that. Take, for example, someone who is in a well-paying campaign and does not need to sell their account for an unnecessary reason.",

However, it is important to be careful and avoid putting all of one's resources into an investment. On the other hand, it is considered necessary to consider one's current financial situation and prioritize meeting basic needs before making any investment decisions. Each individual's circumstances are unique, and not everyone has the same opportunities or resources available to them. Therefore, it is important to be realistic and make decisions based on one's individual circumstances.",

That's actually true there's a lot of opportunities here in the forum you can learn and earn but people doesn't afford to take their time as they already need money for their essential needs. You've already mentioned their needs of money due to poverty yet you encourage them to invest?
