By the way, sometimes certain information can actually be rather misleading. Take for example a good look at Coinmarketcapâ€™s entry for Sats. Displaying the info in manner they do makes it look rather much like any of these altcoins that sell their coins by the hundreds to the dollar â€¦: See: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/satoshi/",

I've encountered a number of such cases. They either didn't know they could buy fractions of Bitcoin or they were not used to buying fractions of an asset, so thought it's unprofitable, sort of like it would be unprofitable in the long run as they did not get a full stack. Such people would rather opt for assets which are dirt cheap, cause they see more potential for growth if the held millions of a token, compared to fractions of Bitcoin.",

The sequence of the satoshi if followed can help a bitcoin enthusiast to get to 1 btc over a period of time. The first step would be to find out in $ how much 1 or 1000 or 10,000 satoshi costs; Then figure out if your finances would cater for a daily, or weekly or monthly purchase of selected satoshi.Determine the time frame to become a btc ownerAccumulate satoshis according to your schedule.I believe this is what the table is trying to break down to help new investors. The bigger question is, is this achievable by anyone or do we have anyone who has tried out this similar methods before ?",

Still there are people who think they will have to buy a whole bitcoin. I don't know how the psychology works but when you talk about bitcoin to someone and tell them the price they usually ask that's lot of money. Then you need to give another lecture, you can buy any amount of bitcoin anytime. Somewhere I read by 2030 there will be 1 billion bitcoin user. It seems reasonable to me ðŸ˜‰",

With a world population of about 8 billion, I would say it's unlikely that about 12.5% of that number would hold Bitcoin in the next 8 years, that's a quantum leap and is not feasible imo.I think I also saw a post around the forum recently, discussing that topic; it would likely have involved all cryptocurrencies and with that would still be an optimistic claim.",
