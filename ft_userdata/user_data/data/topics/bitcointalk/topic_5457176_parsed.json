  "content": "Hello all.I didnt know where to put this so I thought maybe here.Long story short. I had a company install a panther X2 on my roof with a tall aerial. Originally I genuinely didnt know they were mining it was installed on the basis of it being a data sharing thing (yes I know)Anyway the arrangement was they paid x amount each month and to be fair it was quite welcome.They vanished last November and I am left with the thing on the roof. I planned to take it down after 6 months if nothing was heard from them and logged into the box which I understand to be a Panther X2.Based on that I looked into the whole mining thing.I looked into setting up my own account and it it now seems I have to register the panther on a system.I am now at the situation that it looks like I have to enable( or re-enable) the blue tooth connection on the panther. I cannot find any way to do this from the dashboard and it looks likely this can only be done by accessing the unit itself. The unit is inside a metal box fixed to my chimneyCan anyone advise if there is a hidden menu in the dashboard that I can useÂ  ?Any help at all will be greatly appreciated Best Wishes and thanks",
