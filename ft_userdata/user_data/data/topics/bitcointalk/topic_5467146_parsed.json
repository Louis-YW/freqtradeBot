  "content": "I already posted about this (here), but almost instantly regretted doing that (I like the pattern of creating a new topic for each SMF patch, so I'm not sure why I tried to do things differently this time). Anyway, this one came about from joker_josue pointing out that receiving PMs with no subject is annoying, and Loyce (effectively) nodding his head and saying \"patch time?\". It's not something that bugs me all that much (out of the 203 PMs I've received, 15 don't have a subject), but I can imagine it being really annoying for people with thousands of PMs in their inbox who find themselves looking back through them from time to time. Also, I've got some ideas for future patches that might allow for quickly isolating PMs by author, or subject, so phasing out (or, at least discouraging) PMs with \"(No subject)\" as their subject line, just seems like a good idea all-around to me.Currently, the subject line is pre-populated with the text \"(No subject)\", like this:To stop lazy MFs from just going with the default, this patch leaves the subject line empty:If you try to send (or preview) a PM without attempting to describe what you're about to bang on about, then you'll get an error, like this:Here's the diff for @theymos:Code:--- baseline/Sources/PersonalMessage.php 2011-02-07 16:45:09.000000000 +0000+++ modified/Sources/PersonalMessage.php 2023-09-16 00:58:49.000000000 +0000@@ -1224,33 +1224,33 @@     $request = db_query(\"     SELECT realName     FROM {$db_prefix}members     WHERE ID_MEMBER IN (\" . implode(', ', $_REQUEST['u']) . \")     LIMIT \" . count($_REQUEST['u']), __FILE__, __LINE__);    while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($request))     $membersTo[] = '&quot;' . $row['realName'] .

I think including a placeholder attribute on the third <input> element will do a good job of balancing the issue this patch is meant to address (PMs without subjects) against imitating the way it looked originally (that is, two empty <input> elements, followed by a third one with something already in it). That way, it looks similar, but PMs will still fail to send unless you actually type something in.Here's how it would look (I think the text I chose is short and to the point, but theymos can/should adjust it if he wants to):Note to theymos: This new diff doesn't replace the earlier one, and they should be merged as a pair (the first diff stops the subject from being pre-populated with \"(No subject)\", and the second diff adds the placeholder attribute explained above).",

This helps a lot in managing PMs.What joker_josue wants is that whatever is put in the title should be descriptive enough to categorise it, and you can't force people to do that no matter how many patches you put in. I can put 'Hey' as a title in all my emails no matter how varied the subject matter or '.....' as I said before. But well, if it doesn't cost anything to change it then fine, what I'm saying is that this shouldn't be a priority in the forum, because I'm sure there are many of us who don't give a damn whether there is a title or not, what happens is that we haven't opened a thread to say that we don't give a damn (as it's normal, people usually open threads to complain about what bothers them, not to not complain about what doesn't bother them).",

Most times it's not because I don't want to add a custom subject, but it's just that I forget most of the time. Sometimes when I open a new message to send to anyone, after spending several minutes trying to compose my message and finally concluding it, I don't usually remember to go to the up again, from the message body, as I don't think there is anything to do since when I send any one a PM I use their profile and use the direct send pm link, so I don't even type the receiver's username.So if I can get an error code or at least a warning message that states \"Are you sure you want to send this message without a subject\"? That alone can draw my attention to go and check back on what I have missed; this other option of not allowing the message to go at all until the subject box is filled is also a good idea.",

If a sender sends a PM without PM title, very likely the receiver will reply on it without any title, without any change in PM title.I agree that receiving such no-title PMs is annoying and I can be an old person to hate it, not only in Bitcointalk but also in emails. Emails without titles look very odds and shows the senders are lazy people. I also consider senders as disrespectful people against the receivers.Improve your email subject line. Those tips to write a catchy email subject line can be used for Bitcointalk PM title too. Actually we don't need catch title, but at least to inform receivers what are issues in the email for discussions. The PM title is important.",

I believe that most people who use email already do this. Why not do it in the PM too?The current term \"(No Subject)\" is the same for everyone, if no one changes the title that's always what appears. If a person needs to write something in this field, each person will write different things. Even if it's just \".\" or \"xpto\", is different from each other. Because some write \".\", others just \"abc\", others \"xpto\", etc. It will always be better than finding one message among 30, saying \"No Subject\".  In any case, this is not an urgent update, but it is still welcome.
