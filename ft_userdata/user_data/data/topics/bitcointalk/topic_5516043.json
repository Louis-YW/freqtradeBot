  "content": "This subject is very important for me, for multiple reasons.I think it worries many bitcoiners that, the fact that we have full custody of our hard money, makes it difficult to develop a good inheritance plan.Searching through the forum, I 've seen many topics around this subject (like this), but my purpose is to share some plans and (perhaps) construct a solid one together.Plan A:1. Construct a multi-signature wallet, that consists of 2 cosigners (2-of-2).2. Back up the 2 cosigners twice each. So you will have A1, A2, B1, B2, where A1 = A2 and B1 = B2.3. Store all the backups in 4 separate locations.4. Hold A1 yourself and give B1 to your inheritors. A2 and B2 will be stored in very safe places that you will determine. A1 and A2 will be known to you only. B2 will be known to the inheritors. So they will know where B1 and B2 backups are.5. In your will, you will give them the locations of A1, A2 and specific instructions on how to recover the wallet using one of the A1, A2 and one of the B1, B2. Obviously you can let them know about your plan and teach them what they will need to do beforehand. So in your will you need to specify the locations only. But a recovery plan written in the will is not redundant in my opinion.Advantages:1. Only you have access to the wallet during your lifetime, because the locations A1, A2 are not known.2. The inheritors have B1 and B2, which means that they will need to \"lose\" both of them to lose access to the wallet.3. The lawyers know where A1, A2 are stored, but even if they gained access to them, they can't do anything because they are ignorant about B1, B2.Disadvantages:1. Kind of hard for the inheritors? Perhaps...2. If the lawyer loses your will, then both locations A1 and A2 become unknown, so the wallet is non recoverable. To mitigate this, you can use 2 lawyers, one holding A1's location and one holding A2's location.Plan B:1. Generate a wallet (simple single-sig) and give it to your children. Also keep a backup somewhere safe (the children can know about it).2. Create a locktime transaction, setting the locktime to be X years from now. The receiving address will be one address from the wallet in step (1).3. Give the locktime transaction to your heirs, but also keep some backups in some places.4. When the time passes, the children can receive the funds.Advantages:1. Very easy. One broadcast and everything is good.Disadvantages:1. The fee needs to be planned ahead. Of course the children can use CPFP later, but this adds a little complexity.2. The years are limiting. You can update the locktime transaction of course, but you will need to update your whole setup again. May cause confusion to the inheritors.Please, share your ideas below and add your plans so we can have a discussion about them.More/New ideas:Any good plan that is shared in this discussion, I will add it to this post.",

I am leaning towards plan A, but I think that a few elements should be added to make it even more solid. The idea of building a multi-signature wallet is really good for ensuring security, but it would also be important to train the heirs so that they know how to manage these assets. In addition, having clear documentation on the steps to follow and the locations of the backups could really help avoid confusion. For example, we can establish a document that explains how to access the backups and how to use the keys to recover the wallet, while showing them how to do it step by step. This would ensure that, even if something happens, the heirs can easily access all of this. Basically, plan A is solid, but good communication and preparation of the heirs are essential for a successful transition.I appreciate you taking the time to comment on the subject, but I 've already made these comments myself in the OP.Quote from: apogio on October 29, 2024, 01:08:10 PM4. Hold A1 yourself and give B1 to your inheritors. A2 and B2 will be stored in very safe places that you will determine. A1 and A2 will be known to you only. B2 will be known to the inheritors. So they will know where B1 and B2 backups are.5. In your will, you will give them the locations of A1, A2 and specific instructions on how to recover the wallet using one of the A1, A2 and one of the B1, B2.

What I will do is probably use the two idea, timelock the funds and would definitely be spending it to a multi sig wallet, give the other recovery seed to the lawyer to give out in the day of will reading and back the Same seed up at a bank deposit, the both shouldn’t necessarily get lost, the other co-signer seed will be give to my Kin with him having to know the location of also another to backup of it too. I feel it might have its own flaws but we cannot simply defeats all the flaws in settings like this",

You can easily teach your spouse how to recover a wallet and other Bitcoin transaction processes. For people who are single and want to give their Bitcoin to their parents, it is a big problem. Most of the elderly don't have an interest in Bitcoin. So we would have to make recovering and accessing a wallet easy. Another problem with unmarried people is the issue of trust. Telling a sibling or relative that you have bitcoin might be risky. These days people do anything for money.",

      "body": "Quote from: apogio on October 29, 2024, 01:08:10 PM~\"Cryptoassets Inheritance Planing\" (by Pamela Morgan) is  the  good reading that could help your planning. It stresses that beside aspects relevant to technical details the inheritance plan should contain some legal part. Quote from: Pamela Morgan, \"Cryptoassets Inheritance Planing\"\"Cryptoassets will become part of your legal estate in most jurisdictions, and will be subject to local laws and taxes, whether or not you want them to be. This is the reality of our current jurisdiction-dependent judicial system. Your access plan alone won’t be enough to ensure your assets are passed to your chosen beneficiaries. Without a legal plan, the default laws of your jurisdiction will usually apply. In the next section, we’ll look at these default laws and ways to ensure you get to decide who gets what. We’ll also talk about taxes, what really happens in estates, and how to avoid the most common mistakes people make in estate planning.\" Will you do something in this direction to make legal the crypto-heritage  for your legatees? Regarding my plan:Quote from: satscraper on May 08, 2024, 08:27:23 AMIn my case, the relevant flash drives, PIN to HW pgp keys and detailed instruction will be handed over to heir by me in person,  while he will get the envelope with those physical pgp keys  from representatives of the legal service I have contracted with.More about all of those  stuff (like HW pgp keys, PINs to them  etc) is here. Flash drives are not mandatory, The transferred media may be in the form of  SD card. My last purchase is  Samsung Pro Endurance microSD (huge lifetime).",

Just like @Odusko has rightly said, these same people we are hodling these investments for might end up mismanaging the investment or become too careless to disclose some information to scammers which might lead them to losing everything you worked for in one day. All these will arise because they were not educated by the right person on what to do and what not to do with all the information about bitcoin. As a person with the intention of transferring my wealth to another person, I already know who I want to take over from me. I will make sure that person knows all I know about bitcoin so recoverying them when I'm no more will not be complicated. Except I don't trust anyone, then OP,s plan A will be an option.",
