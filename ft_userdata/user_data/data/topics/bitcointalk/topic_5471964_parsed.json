I don't know if Elon succeeded in ending the bot era, but earlier there were some active bot apps and sites where you just need to pay a few dollars and they will give you any number of followers you need. Currently, there are also some influencers that offer social media account boasting offers. They ask their followers to follow the account or run some free giveaways for those who ever follow a particular account. There are a lot more ways to get fake followers nowadays, but you can easily identify an account with fake followers by checking their tweet history. Judging by the number of engagements their posts attract, you can differentiate real followers from bot accounts.",

It would have been better for you, instead of paying $50 to an unknown account owner on X, who may have acquired their followers through an SMM website, it would have been better for you to focus on the quality of your account's content, use hashtags, and engage with influential individuals whose content relates to yours. This way, you can build a real audience rather than one that is uninterested in your content, most of whom are likely to be bots and fake accounts. Also, this time, you returned safely and weren't scammed. I hope that next time you will not trust anyone, no matter who is on X, and not pay him your money first because most of the users of X currently can pay a monthly subscription, put a blue checkmark, and buy followers, likes, etc. for just a few dollars, so it's not worth putting your money at risk for.",

Re \"blackmail,\" the first time around, I thought it was some kind of case of broken telephone, and I wanted to be the bigger man.Crypto has nothing to do with your case of blackmail, it was just chosen as a means of payment. Regardless of this case, I guess you should always have the money \"in your hands\" first, and only then negotiate any deal.
