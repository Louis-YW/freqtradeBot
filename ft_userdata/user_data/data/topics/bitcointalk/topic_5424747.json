Therefore, they do not know that this market is able to overcome its crises because it is practically not subject to any central authority. They also do not know that the crypto market is an emerging market and naturally it is an active field for scammers.",

Pulling out to get your ROI isn't anything bad as well for most of them.

We only think 2022 is the worst year because the bearish isn't over, while there are many cases to happen. But these cases give some big lessons to every people, we become smarter and more careful to manage our crypto assets. Also, because these cases lead to more drops in crypto prices, we can take advantage to buy at lower prices.

But I agree that crypto makes the government and every party improve the world finance system. Crypto is more transparent, faster in transactions, and has cheap transfer fees. These things become a reference for a better financial system in the future.IMO",

The deterioration in value of BTC over time, which is termed as the DIP, ain't happening for the first time, neither is it gonna stop happening.... This actually gives rookies some time to join the moving train, just so they could be carried along swiftly.... I Know how the pressure is when it gets to this point, so the bulls will just have to pull out whatever value the had innit and it keeps going down...but ofcourse as I said; it all happens in a stipulated time (it's not exact though) but the whole advancement(either ways) are predetermined by the increase in demand, availability and bull's logical antipathy.Sandra ðŸ§‘",

That should change given enough time, as Bitcoin has less block rewards, more people using it, and therefore the volatility not being so extreme. People will also tire from the constant inflation they're battling against, and the constant recessions so people will eventually be looking for an alternative, and Bitcoin being deflationary by design makes a lot of sense. In short though, when the volatility decreases, adoption will increase. While it remains volatile, we'll have a lot of speculative investors, and therefore a lot of panic, not a lot of adoption from the bigger businesses around the world.",
