If you address somebody well and don't give him the right support, it makes less sense. We should support does that are struggling with drugs by giving them the right counsel. They should not be treated like outcasts or nonentities. Some of them are suffering because of bad company or wrong decisions. Like in my country, substance users are classified as criminals. The physically challenged population is suffering from discrimination, and we must help to give them a sense of belonging. They must be treated equally and not be pushed aside because of their conditions.Recently a university student committed suicide due to the wrong treatment he suffered from other students. He was intimidated and ostracized because he misappropriated less than $120 of the student union fund. He killed himself because of how he was treated. My point is that we should move further from speaking rightly to acting rightly.",

My point is that we should move further from speaking rightly to acting rightly. you are very correct.Demeaning words can have a negative impact on people by causing feelings of hurt, anger, or insecurity. They can also contribute to a culture of discrimination and marginalization. Using derogatory words can harm an individual's mental and emotional well-being and can also lead to further discrimination and marginalization in larger social and cultural contexts. In addition, it can also affect the self-esteem, self-worth and the overall mental health of an individual. It is important to be mindful of the language we use and to avoid using demeaning words.",

When all these are put together and practice in the society, there will be less suicides and much love in the society.Words that we say to people due to their actions,knowingly and unknowingly can affect the person psychologically,which can either lead to the frustration of people or their happiness. Words can also kill not only weapons.",

A better replacement can be a “differently abled person”.Calling people disabled makes them looks inferior, and other people superior to them. That is not 100 percent correct. Some people who people call disable are even more hardworking and doing better at what they do than people with no disabilities. Calling people \"differently abled\" sounds better.",

      "body": "I don't agree with all this clap trap about using euphemisms to save the feeling of some people. A person who is addicted to drugs is a drug addict ( and that includes things like paracetamol). A person who is morbidly obese is obese and not \"big boned\", you serve them better by trying to wean them off sugar, seed oils and other damaging \"foods\", and getting them to exercise. If a person loses a leg, then he is handicapped whatever you call him. You will do more good by helping him to lead a full and fulfilling life, than by pretending he has grown another leg by changing the description.The euphemism that really annoys me is \" a person of colour\". That is incredibly elitist,  and implied that the person is a member of an inferior species. \"Black\" is a simple description of skin colour, and has no relevance to intelligence of social worth. In fact many \"white\" people seem to spend hours in the sun trying to become black.",

Every country has different differences as well as its culture. in my country, if i were a fat man, they would call me fat and that's fine. this is inversely proportional to western countries. there in the west, to ask someone when you get married, is an act of being offensive. in my country, it is commonplace. the question is not to hurt someone or offend them, but rather to motivate them. because in my country, marriage is an inseparable part of the culture.Even as you say in this thread, that fact of replacing it with more polite terms, it doesn't help them at all.  in fact, that is what happened. however, as humans who want to learn. I am of course very aware of cultural differences and I can learn from differences and place words not to offend or demean someone with terms like the example you gave.To be honest, it doesn't help them at all, but maybe it does more good than it hurts.",
