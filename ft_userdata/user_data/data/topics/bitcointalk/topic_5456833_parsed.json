It all started in 2019 and most probably it will be launched sometimes this year I guess and there is a huge buzz about its price. As for me it falls under the category of shitcoin. If KYC is compulsory then I would stay out of it. It it is not then it is worth a try.",

They have such a big following and they can easily make million after the lauch. I don't think that is their primary objective. As I have said earlier if they are forcing their user to pass KYC then I would stay away from such project. Do your own due investigation before being part of their project.",

The scale is much larger than any other previous KYC scams you have seen.From 2019 till now they have been able to maintain the hype of this project. That is really smart marketing strategy, the demand of this token to be added on a big exchange is now getting good traction. I recently saw few users on Binance telegram channel asking them to list it. If this is a scam and if  pi gets listed on a prominent exchange then it will become one of the biggest KYC scam.",

      "body": "Found this article that talks about mobile mining. What I found was that it is simply a waste of time. Considering the amount of time you waste mining a token that still does not have any value. Above all mining on smartphones or tablets is generally not recommended due to limitations such as limited processing power, battery drain, and network constraints. For a simple reason, the rewards from mining on a phone are low and not worth the potential costs of device damage. Another reason is KYC, why would any organization ask for KYC before delivering the product? They are still in the launching phase and since 2019 there have been a lot of users who might have fallen for this mining scam on mobile phones. They have waited for 4 years and now they want to cash out after listing. That might be the reason they asking for the pi token to be listed on prominent exchanges.  I might be wrong but I feel that this project won't be able to sustain its economy. Unless they come out with a solution, wherein they create a utility for this token. I doubt that will help them too as most of the followers on their social media channels are only active because they want to convert the pi token into local currency. This is a failed project from the day it was launched. Please stay away from it.",

As usual a lot free loaders will join them. What does AI has to do with mining ?I agree with @elevates with the point that mining on smartphone devices is not sustainable and will \"definitely\" destroy the smartphone at some point.The first and foremost fact the proves this point is the battery drainage. Mining on smartphone will drain the battery quickly because of the continuous usage of processor.Due to continuous usage the battery will consume more power and hence it will have to be charged frequently and repeated cycles of charging will make the battery dead after some point.Then comes the load of the processor. Smartphones are capable to handle high load these days but I don't think they will be able to handle continuous high load for a longer period of time.Unless you are building a mining rig out of smartphones I don't think mining on smartphone is a viable option.But at least we all agree that pi network sounds like a classic scam to us. Even I had heard about it and it's true that there is demand for it in the Indian crypto market.Few days ago one of my crypto friends was asking if someone is having the pi token because people were asking him to get those tokens.",

As I have said earlier if they are forcing their user to pass KYC then I would stay away from such project. Do your own due investigation before being part of their project. I think they don't have enough resources to conduct the project properly. As you said they are forcing their users to pass the KYC but I think that isn't totally correct. I have been mining pi from the start and I know someone who was mining before me. He passed the KYC and sold his pi. It was a big amount. One the other hand I am unable to do the kYC. I have been trying for more then years. Every time I try it says slot not available. Many users having KYC related problems, many user said their KYC was pending for more then a year. I actually don't know if it's a shitcoin or not. But I saw same changes in their apps, like they were developing them. In the early days, the apps would not work properly, and they didn't have much info or links to their sites. But recently if you go check it out you will see many changes.I am not saying Pi is bad or good. I too am confused. Nobody know whether they sell our KYC or will scam us. I think time will tell.p.s : Mining pi now won't be profitable anymore, those who were involved with Pi from the very beginning gained a profit. But if you were thinking of mining now it won't be any use.",

That's a huge risk and I am 100% sure that they are indeed harvesting your data in the background. Data is a comodity nowadays and sells in the market against a huge amount of cost. Everything was going well for them until they decide on their KYC policy which alerted a lot of people. It's best to delete the app from your mobile phone. It's just a wastage of time and hope.
