  "content": "\"The Man Who Changed Bitcoin Forever: Andreas Antonopoulos - Bitcoin’s Greatest Advocate!\"- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMwjKnQ05FsWhen I first learned about bitcoin back in 2014 I started to learn from many people here.  I got very lucky getting in with a great group of dudes who knew their shit (we hang out in collectibles).  Now they taught me a lot, but I didn't want to bug the shit out of all of them, especially the more advanced buddies of mine, they always made time for me, but it wasn't right to bug them, they are typically very busy guys.  Yogg, being the one exception, long story there smh.Anyways I turned to this man (Yogg was also a very big fan of his, as were all my buddies, hence how I heard of him).  I first read Mastering Bitcoin, his first book, good idea and a terrible idea lol.  It is not meant for people who dont understand coding.  I still learned a lot, but 75% of the book went right over my head.  I would read some pages 5 times and then just give up lol.  So I went to YouTube and watched his speeches and it completely changed everything for me.  Now again I'm far from an expert, not even close really, but I've learned a shit ton and when I have conversations with random people, rarely have I met anyone with more knowledge than I...people simply don't do their homework. I was on the beach in Mexico a few weeks ago trying to explain to a small gathering of people why they shouldn't leave their coins on an exchange, especially Conbase, err Coinbase (Brian Armstrong is a complete scamming pos and that exchange has screwed over thousand and thousands of users.  Among many other basics anyone who owns any btc should be aware of or have some knowledge of).So if you're still learning, no better place than here to chat, but no better person to listen speak about bitcoin than Andreas.  I am not saying his skill level is that of a Nick Szabo, Hal Finney or Greg Maxwell, among others, not that he's not \"up there \" but he is able to educate and speak in a manner that helped people understand very complex topics within the space  He's not as active as he once was, but his videos hold up - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWCJCWOxBYSi5DhCieLOLQWe all owe him an extreme debt of gratitude (Roger Ver talked shit to him online once when Andreas admitted he has almost no bitcoin.  Ver, the douchbag that he is, ripped in on him saying if you're so sold on bitcoin, and such and advocate, why don't you have bitcoin.  He replied that he had spent years traveling and doing many bitcoin related things for free, and that his bitcoin was sold to feed his family and keep a house over their heads.  The next morning he woke up to over a million dollars worth of btc in his wallet.  Word got out about the convo he had with Ver, and many like myself appreciated what he did for them and decided to help this man who had helped so many of us out.  It's an all time great story.  He's a true legend in the space.  Many regulars will know all this, but many I suspect wont, so thought a write up would be worthwhile after watching that guys new doc on him.Thank Andreas (he's got an account here like most cypherpunk legends, but is not active).",

His ability to break down complex terms and communicate them in a manner that a layman can understand makes him one of my favourites.

And up to this day, if some newbie will ask if they wanted to learn Bitcoin and who or what videos we might want to recommend then it could be Andreas Antonopoulos.And he has a lot of followers, and he was even once part of this great community: aantonop.",

He is a teacher who has mastered the subject area so well that he doesn't just know the theoretical parts, he understands the technical part quite a lot.His YouTube is a place where any beginner who doesn't like to read can watch his videos and get an equivalent of such knowledge as in his books.",

It's not click-bait, you guys are missing the point.  Perhaps you aren't native english speakers, I dont know.  Ross/Silk Road changed bitcoin..it doesn't technically have to mean he went in and created code protocols or something like that.  The point is he changed how many view it. He spent tireless efforts to educate people on how bitcoin works.  That'ts \"changing bitcoin\", but not in the literal sense.  Not sure how you guys aren't understanding that.",

He is so good at what he does that I was able to understand so many things even as a beginner with no knowledge as at then.I just went to check my old saved YouTube videos, and I can still find most of the Bitcoin related discussions that Andreas made. If I'm not mistaken, I might have downloaded more than 90% of all Bitcoin related videos that he was made by him. I think all newbies who wants to learn Bitcoin for the very first time will definitely come across his videos. I really learned alot from him. One thing is to have knowledge of something, while another is to be able to pass it down to others in a very simple manner, which not all Bitcoin enthusiast can do, but Andreas and others has been exceptional.And as for Roger, I only learned much about him in my early days, and since then, didn't follow up much on him. Maybe Andreas was just the perfect teacher to learn from.",

Often times, I see beginners give up or lose interest in bitcoin due to the overwhelming amount of information. Guilty, I was also one of those. I think bombarding people with information only stirs them away from really getting interested in bitcoin so it is best to find something they could start at where their knowledge and interest can be built at the same brick by brick. It might take a while but that is better than lose interest altogether.",

His contributions are huge and deserved to be recognized by Bitcoin community, but amplify it like this, I disagree.He has an account here, was appointed as a local moderator but left the forum because he felt it is too structural cumbersome.Quote from: aantonop on January 13, 2014, 06:43:03 PMYes, I have an account here, though I find the forum structure cumbersome and have not written here in a long time. Thank you for the support and kind words!Jesus christ shut the fuck up.  Click bait my nut sack.  I am so sick of you idiots saying this is click bait.  I don't mother fucking click bait, EVER.  Do I post to make money, sure as fuck do.  I don't hide this from theymos or cyrus or your mom (she says hello).  If you think it's click bait you're not a native English speaker or have a low IQ.  Because in the english language, not everything has to be taken as \"applied to the letter of law\"  That surely wont make sense if you're not a native english speaker.  Andreas did change bitcoin forever.  FACTS.  Where's @Tman when you need him ..I don't like being a prick, but that's been stated multiple times and I'm tired of hearing it.  I make my posts to make money (every single dollar every earned here has gone to charity, something Theymos/cyrus/your mom are well aware of, but I make sure to add value where I can, and it's very rare that I have a complete shit post and if I do, it's accidental.  Locking thread so I don't have to hear one more annoying \"click bait\" again.  I don't need to click bait you window licker (sorry mods, just annoyed as hell).Andreas, legend.  Watch his videos, read his books and look out for my next click bait post.",
