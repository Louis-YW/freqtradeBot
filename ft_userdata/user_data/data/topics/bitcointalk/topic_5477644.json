LN is useful but the developers need to Dig deeper to find out why people are not using it! LN has a long long way to go.",

Some keep complaining about LN and even trying to convince people to move away. FFS, let people decide on their own. People can think and decide by themselves. They don't need anyone to just trough a bunch of whining crap and say \"stay away\".LN, as any other technology needs time to evolve, to get liquidity and adoption. And that time is yet to come, yes it's true, but it's far from those claims about old tech and buggy and highly limited. This is just people trying to spread non-sense FUD about it. LN is now more needed than ever with the crap of Oridnals flooding mempools and increasing fees. But as with Bitcoin, adoption is hard to get, so it will take time! But the time will come!Don't just listen these people saying only crap about LN. Try it, learn it and you probably won't move away from it!",
