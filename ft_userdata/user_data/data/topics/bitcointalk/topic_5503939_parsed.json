      "body": "I wasn’t actually that aware of the golden visa program. Apparently European Union as well as Caribbean countries offer such programs. This is definitely a step to further adoption of bitcoin however please note that this golden visa program does not automatically grant you a citizenship.It still has further requirements and conditions that you need to meet so that they can officially grant you Portuguese citizenship. Since there is a minimum of bitcoin you need to hold, its volatility can be a challenge when applying for the program. Not to mention that it says you’d have to hold it indirectly. Not sure if many people would be so eager to not have their own coins in their own custody.",

In the best-case scenario, it'd take roughly seven to seven and a half years for someone to obtain their citizenship through this method [Golden Visa application (12-18 months) > Maintaining it for 5 years > Another year for getting the citizenship in question (source)].Quote from: Poker Player on July 24, 2024, 03:16:24 AMI would like to know what this company means by “indirectly” holding Bitcoin,They're referring to ETFs.",

      "body": "It's quite good to hear that European countries like Portugal are offering such Golden Visa to Bitcoin holders but the value of 500k Euro is pretty high for most people and only those who hold such high amount of Bitcoin will be eligible for such Visa. I hope they'll reduce the holding amount later but as of now most people will still not be able to acquire that Visa.",
