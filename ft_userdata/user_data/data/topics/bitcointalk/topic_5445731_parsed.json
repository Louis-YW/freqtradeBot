The US was behind this Ukrainian push all along.Ukraine forces shell Donetsk in attempt to turn up pressure on rebelshttps://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-forces-shell-donetsk-in-attempt-to-turn-up-pressure-on-rebelsDONETSK, Ukraine – A mortar hit a large hospital in the troubled Ukrainian city of Donetsk Thursday, killing at least one person, as government forces tighten their grip on the pro-Russian rebel stronghold.\"There was a sudden explosion, a mortar round flew through the window, all the equipment was destroyed,\" said Anna Kravtsova, a doctor at the Vishnevskiy Hospital. \"They killed one person, and one person was injured and taken away.\"Only the dentistry unit suffered damage, witnesses said, but it is one of Donetsk's larger hospitals, only 4 kilometers (less than 3 miles) from the city's main square, and has also provided treatment to civilian victims of the conflict.Kravtsova said that the person who was killed was a patient of the hospital. Donetsk city council spokesman Maxim Rovensky confirmed to the AP that one person had been killed, and said five were wounded.The incident follows a night of shelling in another central neighborhood. The city council said in a statement posted on its website that three people had been killed and five wounded, and several residential buildings destroyed....",

Why the Silence?https://uprootedpalestinians.wordpress.com/2014/10/18/kievs-war-crimes-are-not-in-doubt-why-the-silence/A day after winning the Nobel Peace Prize last Friday, Kailash Satyarthi, in an interview with RIA News, urged the Ukrainian government to protect Ukrainian citizens and especially children: “It is the responsibility of the Ukrainian government to save their citizens, particularly children. Safety of children will be their utmost priority. I will appeal to the Ukrainian government so as to ensure that such incidents against children will not occur in future.”According to the recent UN report as many as 3,660 people have been killed and over 8,756 have been wounded in Donbass since Kiev launched its military operation in April. Even though a ceasefire was announced on September 5th, more than 330 people have died since, including 20 children. UNICEF stated that at least 35 children have been killed in the Ukrainian conflict and 87 have been wounded....Human Rights Watch already called on Ukraine’s international supporters to “urge the Ukrainian government to strictly adhere to international humanitarian law, including by ending all use of Grad rockets in populated areas by Ukraine’s army”.Amnesty International also urged the Ukrainian government to “stop abuses and war crimes by volunteer battalions operating alongside regular Ukrainian armed forces”, such as Aidar. All these appeals, urges and calls are likely to remain voices in the wilderness.Firstly, Kiev repeatedly denies responsibility for war crimes, even when it’s proved by independent observers that the Ukrainian Army has carried out the atrocities, e.g. OSCE confirmed that on June 2nd the Ukrainian air force bombed a public building in Lugansk , killing 8 civilians – Kiev claimed separatists mishandled a portable anti-aircraft missile system....",

Constitutionally the US Government only has authority regarding State borders and certain aspects of State banking.Thirteen counties in Oregon are petitioning both, the government of Oregon, and the Federal government to drop their Oregon Statehood and become part of Idaho. And there are at least 3 more that are seriously thinking about it.Benefits to Oregon are that they would have a whole lot more money to play with, because these counties are draining certain State government funds. The benefits to the people of those counties are that the people think way more like the people of Idaho than they think like Western Oregon people. When the voice of the people becomes stronger, the change will happen.In other words, government is about two things:1. Serving their people;2. Serving themselves.Ukraine wanted to be free from Russia in the 1991 shutdown of the Soviet Union. Did they want to be free just so they could make slaves of their people? Or are they going to offer the same freedom of choice to their people that they received in 1991?Government is the rule of the few over the many. Ukraine is doing to many of its people just the same thing that the Soviet Union was doing to Ukraine. The difference this time is that the US is behind what Ukraine is doing to its people... slavery, not freedom.",
