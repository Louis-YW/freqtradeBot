Next time, you should  create a new wallet in your Guarda and then send the funds as you normally would do when sending to somebody else. Not sure what you mean by quit the wallet tho. Do you want them completely removed, or you want new wallets that don't have the same one as Guarda?",

      "body": "Bitcoin is stored on blockchain, not on wallet. If you import your seed phrase or private key on another wallet, your (new) wallet will synchronize with the blockchain and display you your coins which you can spend.Either you sweep the coins or you send it to a new wallet address. Generate new wallet (seed phrase, keys and addresses) and either sweep the coins or send it to an address or addresses on the newly generated wallet.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on August 31, 2023, 09:15:02 PMNot sure what you mean by quit the wallet tho. Do you want them completely removed, or you want new wallets that don't have the same one as Guarda? He does not want it anymore on blockchain.com, and also it does not want it anymore on Electrum as he is importing the seed phrase from one wallet to another.",

Your keys has been generated by blockchain.com which is close source and with importing your wallet in electrum, you didn't make it more secure. Note that with having the same keys in different wallets, you increase the risk of getting hacked.",

You can logout in the lowest-most part of the settings.Then proceed to create a brand new wallet as suggested by others, get a receiving address and send from the restored Electrum wallet using \"max\" amount.In Electrum, you can delete the wallet file from electrum data directory (location)It wont be deleted when you uninstall Electrum so manual removal is necessary if you really need to get rid of it.(Delete only after sending the funds)In Blockchain.com, your \"wallet.aes.json\" file is stored in their server so there's no way to actually delete your wallet.All you can do is to logout from their wallet and never log-in again. (try their support if it's possible, GL with that though)Take note that there's still a chance to recover deleted wallet/keys from your drive even after deletion, but that wont be much of a risk if you're still going to use your machine.Just make sure to \"Zero Fill\" the drive in time when you need to hand it over to others.",

So if you import your seed to different wallets you will see the same amount of bitcoin in each wallet. Also if you download many wallets on your system and  import the same seed on those wallets, it will increase your risk as all those wallets store the wallet (seed) information on your system.I would suggest that you make a new wallet and send your funds to that new wallet. Now all your previous wallets will have zero balance and you do not have to worry about those old wallets as even if they become compromised, they will be empty.",
