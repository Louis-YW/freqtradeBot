A sole-proprietorship can split into multiple businesses on paper for deductions and other tax-purposes.To fund the business I will get a personal loan under my name that will largely go towards a rental vehicle fleet, but will also cover licensing for the retail business and the rental property.The success and failure of the business largely depends on the size of the personal loan. The larger the better so more money can be invested into vehicles for the fleet. Once the loan is secured a progress report will be provided.The Businesses:Business One: A one-bedroom condominium that turned into a rental property.Business Two: Gig-jobs using only Uber, Uber Eats, and DoorDash.Business Three: A fleet of Turo vehicles.Business Four: An investment fund through a brokerage.Business Five: Self publishing articless, tutorials and fiction through Medium, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle Vella.Business Six: A retail store for merchandising and resale.Business Seven: Affiliate and associate marketing on various forums and other platforms.Current Status:A tenant already occupies the rental property, while I personally have moved back in with the family to focus on furthering my education, applying myself toward the business and spending more time with those I am closest to.The 2023 Volkswagen is my mode of transportation until the personal loan issue is resolved. At that point it will join the Turo fleet. As for me I will use some of the personal loan to purchase a motorcycle until winter rolls around. From there I will either flock south or, if business is doing well, buy myself my dream car. A 2005 pickup truck with just under 180,000 miles on it.As for the rest, all accounts have been created and connected to handle payments, post on forums and and other networking sites, sell merchandise and operate a fleet of vehicles.Baja YajaBitcoin Enthusiast//Aspiring Author:Twitter:https://twitter.com/Baja_YajaMedium Blog:https://medium.com/@bajayajaDALL-E Collection:https://labs.openai.com/sc/DZOfAx2Ht2aPGkrbEQyaI9n5Wallet of Choice:https://strike.me/baja_yaja/",
