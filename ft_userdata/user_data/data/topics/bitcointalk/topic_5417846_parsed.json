What gives?You should have them on the wallet if it is the same chain. It may be that you are watching the BEP 20 chain and the coins are on the BCH chain and your wallet is only setup to receive BEP 20. This already happen to me. If you are not using the app you used to create the wallet in question you should install it again and then import your funds by using your seed phrase and then set up a new password. After that you should add the BCH chain and thicker to the wallet and you should have your coins back. hope this helps",

The OP never said he uses MetaMask wallet or that this is some kind of shit token or wrapped BCH. The BCH ticker symbol stands for Bitcoin Cash, an altcoin that uses a different code base and network than Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and other EVM networks, and is not supported by the MetaMask wallet.",

Were the coins sent from those addresses to new addresses or does the total balance appear as 274bch? If the balance shows a lower number, it is a sync problem. Are you sure that the sync is done?It is rare that a scammer to steal half of the coins when they can steal all of them, so if a wrong balance appears there is a sync problem.",

What gives?Are you talking about bitcoin or bitcoin cash? Which one? Wallet.dat is for bitcoin and Bitcoin Core wallet specifically, not for Bitcoin Cash. Files backup can be opened in a note file, but you have to import your private key or seed phrase or the wallet file on a supported wallet. But to give you a very good answer to this, you will have to tell us the coin you are talking about, the wallet you use for it. Just to know if it is Bitcoin Core you are talking about or a Bitcoin cash seed phrase wallet.",

What gives?Sometimes this is a common mistake from wallet users that used crossed chain to recover their wallet, and sometimes the app will not function as it should and it may give inaccurate balance figures. I advised you since you said you used a different wallet app you should try using the same wallet app you used in storing the coins to be sure you have a verified recovered account that way you will know the true condition of your balance of my has been moved or not.",

If it shows there, then there's nothing to worry about as it seems that it's not just appearing on your balance and you can import that with another wallet.But if there's no more balance showing on the explorer then it only means that the remaining BCH that you've got is either moved by you or someone has moved it already and hopefully that is not a hacker.",
