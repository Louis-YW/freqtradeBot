Bitcoin is a currency, and it always had everything it needs to be a currency, it does not need smart contracts, because it's not trying to be a platform for decentralized applications.Also, decentralized applications are overrated, they don't have much use in real world. Almost all of them are just manipulations with tokens for the sake of speculation and pointless investing. They don't make lives better or easier.",

Just as Gavin Wood said when he coined the term: \"Web3 is really sort of an alternative vision of the web, where the services that we use are not hosted by a single service provider company, but rather they’re sort of purely algorithmic things that are, in some sense, hosted by everybody...\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3But these things have yet to actually happen, and the term is still just a marketing buzzword for now.",

Bitcoin is a crypto currency that people can use for making transactions. I guess web3 is just another web technology that people think is the future. The only characteristics they both have in common is decentralization, using the blockchain technology and giving people full freedom (not sure if that would be a good thing to give full freedom over the internet). And people might be using and integrating bitcoin to make web3 completely decentralized.",

Web 3.0 is closely related to crypto because of its decentralized nature, with this technology crypto projects can also offer token incentives to anyone who can help create, organize, contribute or improve any project. This protocol can provide various services, such as computing, bandwidth, storage, identification, hosting, and other online services previously provided by cloud providers.Similarly, Helium incentivizes consumers and small businesses to supply and confirm wireless coverage and send device data over the network using blockchain and tokens.",

Something decentralized should be censorship resistant, too.Yes, it's another big flaw. But even if we for the sake of argument imagine that they are decentralized, they are still useless, because they don't solve any real world problems. In 2016-2017 Vitalik was promising that companies would be selling electricity through decentralized smart contracts, and now in year 2022 the only thing being sold on Ethereum smart contract network is useless scam tokens.",

Btc and web3 are both decentralized so there is nothing to dwell about but I think btc can be used even without web3 while the one that interacts with the web3 technology are the altcoins and tokens.As you can see there is this web3 browser inside the altcoins/tokens wallet such as metamask and trustwallet.
