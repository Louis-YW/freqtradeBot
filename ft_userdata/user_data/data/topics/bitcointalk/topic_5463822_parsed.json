When I finally got the Satoshis I was waiting for, then I would usually increase the wager of each roll until I had lost enough to call it a day and withdraw.I am sure I am not the only one who has experienced something like this, specially among those who receive campaign payments in their casino accounts.  Also, if you really start gambling before even getting your breakfast, then I would try to correct that. One is supposed to gamble to feel entertained and comfortable. I don't think I could feel that way while I am hungry.",

But I was addicted with sport gambling and all matches would have ended around 1 to am if I use local time. So I sleep around that time.I noticed that if I win, I want to continue winning. If I lose I want to continue playing to win back the amount of money that I have most. What I always noticed are more loses. Everything ended when I was not addicted anymore.",

      "body": "Most often when you are losing, you'd be eager to get back with how much you have lost. In order to get that back again, a player would be needing to gamble but if that's not your day you'd just make the losses bigger. This instance simply shows how emotions could take over your cool as a gambler. Losing is indeed expected but since no one wants to, then frustrations would happen or take place, which could also be a root of addiction. But to some, they do manage to not be frustrated and to still have hopes for a better betting outcome the next day. And some are even playing with other gambling games to losen their emotion and frustrations.",

What ops described is similar to the experience of many of us,  it may be in different ways to similar to each of us since it is all about winning/losing vs human errors that lead to losses.",

No one bother's me and I get to stay outside using my laptop while smoking. It keeps me focused when I'm the only one alone and confidently free to open a browser with a casino on the page. It's really bothering when someone is behind watching your bet like they know how to play than you.",

When I finally got the Satoshis I was waiting for, then I would usually increase the wager of each roll until I had lost enough to call it a day and withdraw.I share same experience. The excitement of gambling while waiting the deposit to be confirmed is always my waterloo on gambling. I follow the same pattern as yours that I bet irregular amount just because I feel that I will be lucky due to my excitement.The end result is me chasing my losses by betting huge amount randomly until I lose everything on a very short period of time. It's very hard to maintain a controlled bet when on this kind of excitement playing. I always use high transaction fee whenever I'm gambling as a solution to this problem of mine.",

Just want to know how it happened? Withdrawals should always be allowed as long as it was done thru normal deposits even with new pending deposits.Because of that, I remember back then when participating a new player promotion. After reaching the wagering requirement, I still able to achieved several winnings but as always, there's a maximum withdrawal and a real deposit should be made first before the profits can be cashout.",

Do you have something like this?The timing of gambling matter less to me but playing without breakfast might lead to a lack of concentration which make one lose consistently. Someone badgering or disturbing me can also lead to a lack of concentration. Chasing losses is an easy way to lose more because you are no more playing in a relaxed or entertaining condition. Playing all night when you are feeling sleepy can lead to silly mistakes because you are already exhausted. When I am troubled due to work stress or family pressure, I tend to lose. When you see gamble as an escape root for problems you might lose control and gamble without restriction. In such a situation you keep gambling until you feel better. This is also a major cause of gambling addiction.",

Withdrawals should always be allowed as long as it was done thru normal deposits even with new pending deposits.It’s during the time when mempool become loaded with unconfirmed txid dir to the ordinals NFT. The transaction confirmation speed that time becomes very slow even with normal speed fee. I'm using a casino that credit instantly the deposit even its on unconfirmed status. I can play immediately right after I send transaction and recorded on blockchain as unconfirmed but I can't withdraw the funds including the profit untile my deposit reach 3 confirmation. This is the madness kicks in since confirmation that time took 2 to 3 days while my funds is stuck and my impatience grow day by day that result to gamble more to lose it all.",

Gambling could be our past time but we still have to be sure that we are emotionally and physically ready for it as it needs extreme focus. Also, our environment should also be a good place to play with whenever it's online of offline. If we're a type of person that couldn't focus on a noisy environment then we should choose a quiet place to be able to focus and attentive. If we're hungry or didn't get enough sleep, we better avoid gambling and try to catch enough rest first as our condition might affect our emotions which plays a vital role in our decision making.",

It's definitely stage by stage, we gamble and feel the relaxation or pressure from the system, negative or positive results. Discipline follows, it prevents us from major setbacks in the system, it's really imperative and personal we takes activities that involves gambling to our plans, I wouldn't afford to make streak losses in the system.",
