  "content": "Hi, I am a Newbie to Electrum & ElectrumX and would like to know the best path to take in order to achieve being able to make Bitcoin Queries and Transactions using ElectrumX and Python (starting off with a website running on Flask). Could someone help me because it is hard to find examples (tutorials) on the web and I don't know if they are safe (security wise)?Note:I'm an intermediate where Python and Flask is concerned.I understand the Bitcoin White Paper pretty well.I know that Flask is not for a production environment.I want to use ElectrumX so that the application can better serve concurrent users.I can handle the installation of the Ubuntu, Bitcoin Node, ElectrumX and the Python web App on a Testing PC.If possible, I would like a python example(s) that would help me to achieve anything that is in bold above.Thanks",
