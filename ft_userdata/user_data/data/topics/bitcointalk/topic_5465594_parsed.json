Don't be close to God when you're having problems.Quote from: promise444c5 on September 04, 2023, 09:44:05 AMHow to avoid emotions:-snip-When it comes to trading, it all depends on the type of coin you choose. If the coin you choose to trade doesn't have the potential to be profitable because of your ignorance, instead of reducing the emotional level that will appear, it can increase.Apart from the concept of take profit and stop loss. I am not forbidding people from trading, but it is better to avoid it if there is no knowledge about trading.",

      "body": "Some of your tips are just options to divert your mind to other activities, but that doesn't contain any point to emotions. When you trade high volatility pairs, there is a strong urge to constantly monitor the charts and even change order settings. Emotions should be trained slowly, for example choosing a pair of low volatility or leverage and a longer trading period.",

Emotions make people take wrong decisions so we must control emotions. There can be no acceptance of your emotions when it comes to your business. If you are very emotional then you need to control your emotions first when you can control your emotions then you will be involved in business. You should refrain from making business decisions at a time when you have a lot of emotions running through you. Emotions never make decisions. Decisions must be taken with a cool head and thought, so if you want to improve your business, you must control your emotions.",

You have to fix this all by yourself as well.QuoteHow to avoid emotions: set up  a TP(take profit) and SL(stop loss) for your trades  Stay away from the particular trade Get in some activity that will keep you busy  Do your hubby activities at that moment  set up hours interval to check your trade watch tvs and Go for walk All of the above are good precautions but still ways to try to manage emotion, and not to curb it in trading. You can add more doings to that but most people still find themselves being emotional. You can only fight this within before you can curb it. I've curbed mine. Did you know how? I became aggressively determined and disciplined in trading. This combo helps so well and I don't flinch anymore even if I check my trading platform regularly.",

Of the several methods that you have explained, there are only three methods that I could possibly use and that I really need to manage my emotions when trading or when carrying out certain trades. The rest is something I don't need, although it's not a bad thing if someone wants to do it, but to the point \"Get in some activity that will keep you busy\" it will actually make me unfocused when trading. Because I am busy with other activities, my focus can be lost and will not be very regular, because I usually trade in conditions that are much more relaxed so that I can get better focus.",

The solution is better not to trade, in my personal opinion. You don't want to involve feelings or rather you also don't want to involve instinct in trading. But the fact is that crypto trading will always involve many factors, be it feelings or sudden decisions. Even knowledge is tested to find out how much the probability of profit is if TP.",

Decide in advance how much you want to make (take profit) and how much you're willing to lose (stop loss). After making your trade, it's best not to stare at the price chart all the time. that's because if you watch too closely, the market can make sudden, small moves that might make you nervous. You might start thinking the market will go against your trade, and you'll change your mind and switch to the opposite side. This kind of reaction often leads to many trades that don't work out, and you end up paying fees for each trade, which can add up and cause you to lose money. So, it's better to stick to your plan and not let your emotions lead to hasty decisions.",
