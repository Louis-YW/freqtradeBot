It can be said that elrond's marketcap already below near and that's why looking for more profit from elrond still make sense compared with looking for profit from a coin with a greater marketcap compared with elrond. So, what will you choose? i have been answering your question.Â  Near is far popular compared with elrond.",

Maybe news like this 20 million JavaScript devs can now build applications on NEAR: KBW 2022 will give you a closure the possibilities of projects like near. The potential to grow will always be there as long as the devs are ready to keep working hard. It is a matter of time for such project to develop to their full potential.",

I know that elrond was good but i rarely hear that there are some popular dapps that from there. During the bullish market and it doesn't matter what kind of altcoin it is. The both have the same chance to grow as long as bitcoin was also growing as well.",

It's not easy for me to say whether Near or Elrond will be better because both projects are relatively new to crypto. If you want to find a coin that is cheaper and is in the top 25 list, Near is your choice. But that doesn't mean Elrond is not a good or expensive project and is in the #49 position because it will depend on how each team can maintain its performance.",

I meant the popularity makes near being choosen by so many people compared with elrond. In my opinion that if elrond has less potential compared with near in term of adoption. You must also remember if adoption is a key that was also pushing the price and marketcap to be even higher. I think you can take your own conclusion. It's quite easy to know which better from both.",

Upon looking at their website, I've known that they've got a lot of features to offer, not just for the token but for its use case and utility as a blockchain.They're helping to build people to become developers and as well as educators of their own blockchain. So, I think this is really a plus even if it's focused on their own blockchain but still gives a glimpse for the entire blockchain and cryptocurrencies.",
