They said I need to upgrade account to institutional account to get extra limit of trading, as they don’t allow this trading on individual account ( here comes the scam) so to upgrade I have to deposit 5000$ and agree to new terms, I deposited 5000$ then the upgrade requirement changed to 10,000$. I contacted them they said you have to deposit, I said I did but your requirement increased to 10k$ then they said we will check but there is no way you can access without 10k$ deposit now. I asked why it changed from 5k to 10k$ and now if I deposit 10k$ it will move upto 20k$ what will I do? They said no, now I have locked the requirement to 10k$ it will not increase. So yeah I got scammed. Then he said your funds will be frozen forever. They said we are registered exchange in London and I asked about company details all are fake.Following are the details they provided:BITYX DIGITAL SOLUTIONS LIMITEDCOMPANY NUMBER 14383536Company type: Private limited with share capitalBusiness activity (SIC) 64301 - Activities of investment trustsSo please big big mistake lesson learned 5100$ lost, lesson learnt.Please stay away from this exchange do not trust it.Screenshots attached for reference.https://postimg.cc/JHGS95bnhttps://postimg.cc/V5VxX28bhttps://postimg.cc/XrMtzFXjhttps://postimg.cc/8jfq4wpXhttps://postimg.cc/tsh8QTVhSTAY SAFE!!!",

But maybe you got excited too much also because the first and 2nd time around you profited lol and you want more. Normally new exchanges are not vouched for by users until they have tried them to confirm they are legit. You on the other hand tried your luck.  Sorry for your loss.",

Your trust in their business model increased to a level where you believed that depositing $5.000 is just a small investment compared to the profits you will generate in the future. And that's the scam. Once you deposited, $5k, they started asking for $10k. Maybe if you paid again, they would allow you to make a few trades above standard rates just to get you hooked and ask for another $5k or $10k to unlock additional trading capabilities. It's an endless loop.",

Actually have the same work with several ponzi website, when asking withdrawal we have upgrade account level and make another deposit.Some exchange market make us excited when looking for different several Bitcoin or altcoin price, we are trying to arbitrage by deposit fund and lately we can't withdraw again, have possibility with deposit only and fund credit all withdrawing close or suspend due their unacceptable reason.I don't know how easily you can trusted with this site because I checked current Bitcoin price above $18,500, seems impossible trough all global exchange market, Bitcoin price under $17,456.",

Still I only believe too exchanges and wallets like Trust wallet, Tokepocket wallet and also big exchanges like Binance, Bitmax, bybit etc. This https://bityx.com/en is looking like a scam from its adress. You should have search before putting such huge money. But we cannot think anything when a loss should have to happen.",
