Or you've quit from bitcoin as a result of ugly experience? Let's discuss Two, three to four years now can't recall the year at the moment.Yes, Bitcoin has been useful to me. Before I got involved in Bitcoin, I had a different perspective on things related to investments, specifically those sites that claim to give you HYIP without you doing anything. Bitcoin, and specifically bitcointalk, has changed my perspective on those things. As for the experience, I'd be lying if I said I'd been hitting big all the time I've been involved in Bitcoin. There are times when you lose and times when you profit, and that's just how it's been for me, but I believe my profits have far outweighed my losses, which is a good thing.",

Of course Bitcoin has been helpful and luckily i've not had any ugly experience (loss of funds) using Bitcoin, but mind you that's because i am a user in this forum and there is so much knowledge available here. As for achievements of using Bitcoin, it is a subjective thing, i myself understood early enough that Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme, so i was never expecting anything too much other than being my own bank and having the liberty to spend/hodl my funds as i deem fit.",

Let's discuss I am about two years in the Bitcoin environment so I don't have as much experience as the grandfathers and mothers in the forum. I started investing in Bitcoin this year and was always looking at my wallet during the bear and mini-bull run this year. But I am a more confident investor now and a believer in bitcoin. I have not achieved much since I am new but I have accumulated a few sats. I am hoping to keep adding until I gain my targeted profit. Bitcoin has instilled in me the habit of saving. I had to cut some expenses because I want to add to my investment. For now, no ugly experience, and I hope not to encounter one yet.",

And the exchange also doesn't allow me to register, because I don't have an ID card where the age must be 17 years and over. But, I still can earn and invest bitcoin from earning sat from the free faucet, the assets are still there, and I always add 1/2 from the salary signature campaign.

Let's discuss Almost everyone who is consistent with bitcoin gets much better financial benefits, but due to its anonymous nature people rarely publish what they have achieved. Bitcoin has helped increase my awareness to store the value of fiat currency, because when I invest the money I have in bitcoin does not depreciate at all in the long term, this advantage is what we don't get in other investments for now, even though gold is a close source like what I'm describing.Almost everyone has had a bad experience with bitcoin at first, but what needs to be underlined is that it happened because of the mistakes of each of us which was caused by a lack of knowledge, experience that teaches us how accuracy and strategy are needed when you try to invest in bitcoin, basic knowledge will lead us to the stage of minimizing risk.",
