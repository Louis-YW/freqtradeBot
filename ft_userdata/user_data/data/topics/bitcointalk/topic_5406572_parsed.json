Is it possible to simplify it with sweep?",

      "body": "Sweep and import are fundamentally the same operation, they both receive a private key and either check for all possible addresses derived from that key or let the user explicitly define the address type (like Electrum does), then fetch all the UTXOs from each address. Only the last step is different, in sweeping the wallet creates a transaction where it sends all the UTXOs to one of the addresses from your wallet but in importing it just creates an entry inside the wallet file.",

Generally speaking it is more convenient to have one deterministic wallet where you store a single seed phrase so that you can recover everything with that one.Also after 5 years there shouldn't be anybody left who doesn't accept a simple native SegWit address. But if you have no other choice it is best to keep things to a minimum, like 2 wallets one Nested SegWit and another Native SegWit. QuoteWith sweep, all UTXOs will be sent to a receiving address I type. Does it include dust UTXOs?Yes.If you are receiving payments you don't need to sweep the keys though. Just spend the coins whenever you need to. If you want to combine the outputs from your 2 wallets as I explained above and you are using Electrum, you could create a new wallet from private keys that contain those coins from each of those addresses and combine UTXOs that way. Although this is a privacy hazard as it would link your addresses.",

I can use import and has different address types for my receiving address in a same wallet file.Use one native segwit wallet (\"bc1\"), and a separate nested segwit (\"3\") wallet whenever someone is trying to pay you from an exchange [some exchanges do not have bech32 code and cannot send to bc1 addresses] and then sweep from the \"3\" wallet to the \"bc1\" wallet.QuoteWith sweep, all UTXOs will be sent to a receiving address I type. Does it include dust UTXOs?Absolutely. All UTXOs will be combined in a single transaction into a new output.",
