The account farmers being gone now (particularly in the main boards) is generally due to people not meriting any sub par posts and mods getting a bit more active too (imo they seem to be responding to more requests).",

They've been a member who was tracked down on this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5356476.0 he had made jest of the forum's merit system by giving merits out to his accounts and vice versa, just to boost his more than 61 accounts, yet not all his accounts were banned. It's quite difficult to trace these activities considering the hard work and time invested by @Ratimov to achieve this strenuous goal of investigating his victim. Though it's worth it for the cleanliness of the forum, but for such a forum like bitcointalk where it's not a strict rule not to farm account it's difficult to wipe out such people like you're suggesting. Considering that it's still feasible to farm account despite the merit system available that means before the merit system got introduced it was a league of spam",
