Now that economic palava has been the major talk as we witness rises in prices and charges, in order to avoid insult from lending from others who have little to spare, a revisit to using loans apps for survival now suffices.I hope the verification process or KYC process doesn't require the most intricate details or account statement, so as it proves difficult to borrow from them? Also,  how good can the customer service response be, incase of concerns that may arise?",
