And if you do the URL will have some phishing links.

Some traders can always win and able to gain profits and some also loses daily and even bigger losing. Market is also about analysis its not just about buy low and sell high. In any case this isnt what happening right? Cause some buy lows and sold much lower due to panic or what.",

If you're doing good with that trader and you're making lots of money funding that trader for 6 months.Then, I'd say that good luck to your relationship and make each of you rich through funding and trading as a partnership. Because for me, it's rare to hear with these types of stories so, then that's it.",

Of course you need to be patient and trade long term in crypto currency. And if you get frustrated after six months of trading, then you will not have much success, you must be patient.",

Our opinions are merely suggestions which might turn out to helpful or not at the end of the day. We just have to do what we think is right for everyone of us to earn significant profits in the system. Prop firm accounts are not some random accoubt one will easily pick because it does belong to these crypto for Forex related companies that have divided the aspect of trading to become more simple and easy for upcoming trades specifically the ones that doesn't stand in good chance of Possessing good capital.",

All I know is that almost everything that concerns cryptocurrency can be associated with scams, because it's mostly an unregulated industry where people can scam others and get away with it. I guess he's having a very good working relationship with his fund trader partnership that he's wondering about bad comments that he's hearing regarding other companies, I hope that comments on his topic has shown him that scams are real in crypto fund trading.",

Do not be fooled by his innocent looking query. He is probably looking for a way to shill his “prop firm” which I am sure is a scam. Here is one of the threads where he tried to advertise it. He even has lots of alternate accounts doing the scam thing.Check this - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5473652.msg63137495#msg63137495",
