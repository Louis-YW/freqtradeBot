  "content": "There was a recent report about aviation blackouts in US, Canada and the Philippines (https://www.npr.org/2023/01/12/1148633623/flights-were-grounded-across-the-u-s-as-the-faa-scrambled-to-fix-a-system-outage), though there has been some explanations to the likely cause of the outage, but this man's reason (https://t.me/TuckerFans/1090) seems to catch attention considering that the aviation is a critical infrastructure that must not be toyed with. He says that the outage is a possible cyber attack on the Government infrastructures, including Canada (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/canada-flights-system-outage-grounded-b2260500.html) and The Philippines (https://www.thenationalnews.com/travel/news/2023/01/01/philippines-closes-airspace-to-international-flights-due-to-technical-issues/) and it is possible ransom payment have been made in BTC. Could this be the reason for the recent spike in Bitcoin price?",

      "body": "The main reason IMO is the dollar index. Usually when the dollar goes up bitcoin and stocks go down. The USD pump in 2022 was overdone by the FED and the rest of the world saw it and started looking for alternatives. Many countries are nowadays exploring the option to add gold and bitcoin to their balance sheets and China with a few other countries is looking to substitute the dollar with another currency in foreign trade. Now the USD has been going down since October and you could see BTC starting to recover but we had the FTX situation that can be described as a black swan event in crypto. That dragged us down a bit and stopped the recovery that was due for many months. I'd say that the return to 20k is natural and healthy for BTC. It's not a pump. If we go to 30k next week it can be called a pump, but what you're seeing today is a return to the mean.",

Historically when the DXY retracts, sentiment for risk assets like Bitcoin increases.https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-todayI've seen a huge impact in the past few days where the value of dollars is too high, people are waiting for it to drop and started to make investments. The time has come and they are now on track. This also gives the chance for small investors to make a move and join crypto. Well, I'd see the growing business that offers and accept Bitcoin as a mode of payment as well.",
