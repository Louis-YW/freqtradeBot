  "content": "Recently I watched a video by Sabine Hossenfelder, where she showed a graph of the current speed of development on Quantum computing and a projection until when this techonology is estimated to probably crack current wide-spread encryption technology.(I did a quick search but did not find that particular video, you can check a new one on the topic here, though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBLVtCYHVO8)The projected date was between 2030 and 2040. The exact dates do not matter much imho, the important fact is, that current state-of-the-art-cryptography WILL become obsolete within the next 10 to 25 years.I don't want to go into detail, why this will probably not widely impact our current system(s) relying on these encryption-techs too much. Short version: All bigger companies, governments and institutions are aware that these techs need to be updated within rougly the next decade and current development already has quantum-proof solutions. These will (hopefully / most likely) be implemented in all critical infrastructure (banking, communications, accounting, any password-based stuff, severs, crypto, etcetc.) and ideally most end-users won't even notice much of a transition.HOWEVER: All funded crypto collectibles rely on this old, NON-QUANTUM-PROOF encryption (sha256 and whatnot to hash publickeys and addresses from the underlying private key), and therefore are doomed to securely hold funds longterm, as long as the public keys were exposed at any point in time. The main reason: A physical collectible cannot be upgraded to quantum-proof as it would be possible with any software.Yeah, it may still seem like a long shot, and there is a chance it will take (much) longer than currently be projected - but I don't think just hoping is the right approach as physical crypto collectors.tldr: Sooner or later we will have to peel all our funded collectibles to avoid getting quatum-swept by some powerful organasation or government.I didn't do a deep-dive into the topic (yet), these are just random thoughts I'd like to discuss here, happy to hear any insights and ideas on the topic from anyone that has something to say about it.",

[...]adding reference: https://codeburst.io/quantum-threat-to-blockchains-shors-and-grover-s-algorithms-9b01941bed01That's an interesting reference. It does indeed say, that SHA256 with current algos is unlikely to be broken. However it also clearly states quatum computing could be a real thread at some point.\"Using the most common encryption standard, it takes a classical computer 2128, that is to say 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 basic operations, to find the private key associated with a public key. On a quantum computer, it would take 1283(ie only 2,097,152) basic operations to find the private key associated with a public key.This is why conceptually the development of true quantum computing could pose a threat to today’s blockchain encryption. Of course, this threat is yet to materialize. Today, due to the lack of development in quantum computing, Shor’s Algorithm cannot be used in any serious way.\"Quote from: MoparMiningLLC on April 11, 2023, 07:13:51 AMwhile this sounds ominous - it is still very improbable and nearly impossible to do with the considerable lack of development being done in the quantum computing field.That's where I tend to disagree based on the info I currently have: There is clear trend of development in the quatum computing sector towards more and more working qbits every year, reaching the omnious 1M, as I stated in OP approx 2030 - 2040. Ofc it's true that quatum computing is hyped up in many ways, mostly for monetary incentives (funds from investors etc), but it misses the point of what effects it will have on cryptography at a certain point of development.History has shown: SHA-1 and previous algos were deemed extremely safe and uncrackable for quite a while and still have turned out unusable / flawed at some point. Who's to say SHA256 will not face a similar fate?I found the video I wanted to reference in the first place:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UrdExQW0csI highly suggest anyone interested in the topic to take a look.",

If we add 4 years to the date of the article, we still have 75% of Bitcoiners below age of 50, so unless facing any of the high-risk factors, most of them they should be alive for another 40+ years.

It's something that was discussed in length regarding Bitcoin itself.Again, my main concern are collectibles here. No way to update anything and funded items may become compromised with no chance to save their original state unless you are willing to lose the funds (and one could debate if that still counts as original state if the keys etc are still untouched below the holo but swept by a huge corp). Ofc its far out in the future but could/would eventually happen.Quote from: MoparMiningLLC on April 13, 2023, 03:03:08 AMthat is like saying you need Einstein to solve a math problem but have an infant instead.what is needed is leaps and bounds beyond what is currently available.

      "body": "Kryptowerk (OP)-For more information about linear dimensionality reductions in general, you may want to read up on matrix decompositions such as the spectral decomposition of normal operators, the polar decomposition, and the singular value decomposition. These decompositions also apply to infinite dimensional spaces, but it is sufficient to just look at these decompositions for finite dimensional spaces. From the singular value decomposition, one can get the nearest low rank matrix approximation to a higher rank matrix. Given a collection of vectors v_1,...,v_r in real Euclidean space, using principal component analysis, one can find an affine subspace of your vector space that closest approximates the vectors v_1,...,v_r. There are also non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms like UMAP and t-SNE, but I am more concerned with linear dimensionality reductions; the linear dimensionality reductions that I have mentioned have an important mathematical theory behind them.What I have done is however a dimensionality reduction for a collection of real, complex, or quaternionic matrices A_1,...,A_r. Basically, what I have done is constructed a (not necessarily orthogonal and not necessarily unique, and sometimes things go wrong) projection P so that PA_1P,...,PA_rP best approximates A_1,...,A_r in the sense that in the real case it maximizes \\rho(A_1\\otimes PA_1P+...+A_r\\otimes PA_rP)/\\rho(PA_1P\\otimes PA_1P+...+PA_rP\\otimes PA_rP)^(1/2) where \\rho denotes the spectral radius, and \\otimes refers to the tensor product. We maximize this quantity using gradient ascent. If we take the standard irreducible representation of the symmetry group, and then we use this standard irreducible representation to represent the round permutations of a block cipher as matrices, then we can perform a dimensionality reduction of these matrices, we can measure how well the reduced matrices correspond to the original matrices, and we can extract a specific real number or at least a distribution of real numbers (such a distribution has low entropy) that tells us the level of cryptographic security of a block cipher.Now, after performing a change of basis and scaling by a constant factor, from each collection of matrices A_1,...,A_r, we can obtain a quantum channel. By a quantum channel, I mean a completely positive and trace preserving superoperator that maps the matrix X to the matrix A_1XA_1^*+...+A_rXA_r^*. We can therefore use a quantum computer perform our dimensionality reduction for this quantum channel.I have so far posted much of the information about this dimensionality reduction and similar algorithms at circcashcore.org/blog, and I will continue to post more information about this in the future.I have not seen anyone else use spectral radii to investigate the cryptographic security of block ciphers this way. Other cryptographers have launched other attacks. And I designed my approach to give a specific number for the cryptographic security of block ciphers. There are some differences between measuring the cryptographic security of a block cipher and testing its cryptographic security by attacking it. I came up with the idea of using spectral radii for evaluating the security of block ciphers because it works well for Circcash's mining algorithm, and I need to further investigate the cryptographic security of Circcash's mining algorithm.Description of quantum algorithmWe shall let U,V,W denote complex Euclidean spaces. We can represent a collection of matrices as an isometry $A:V\\rightarrow V\\otimes W$. If dim(U)<dim(V), then we can try to represent the isometry $A$ as an isometry $X:U\\rightarrow W\\otimes U$ by maximizing the quantity $\\rho((1_V\\otimes X^*)(A\\otimes 1_U))$ and this can be done on a quantum computer. Of course, we will need to use physical quantum computers to test how well this process actually works. Even before quantum computation, I will need to do a lot more testing on this.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Creator of Circcash (the only cryptocurrency with a mining algorithm that is actually designed to advance science by solving a problem that is actually important while establishing decentralized consensus, but I realize that the cryptocurrency community is not interested in science at all. I am fucking tired of all the fucking hatred and evilness from all sides.)",
