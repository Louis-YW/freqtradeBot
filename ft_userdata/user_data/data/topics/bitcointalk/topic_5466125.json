  "content": "Who doesn't read the crypto news nowadays?, it is a good habit to be informed because that way we can generate better criteria for your next move with our cryptos. Reading the News with a nice coffee cup in the morning is the right way to start the day.And there are a lot of news sources, we have coindesk, cointelegraph, and others. That's why I decided to create a site where I can get the news from the main news sites all in one place. The site is simple, and I'm open to ideas and observations. https://cryptotalk.tech/What would you change or what would you add?Updates proposed by the community:dkbit98, Husires, ETFbitcoin, Lucius: Speed Improvement.For this propose I installed the next plugins: WP Super cache and Performance Lab. This tools, has increased the speed a lot, but not enough to open it with ToR, maybe for that I would have to hide the images from the home page as ETFbitcoin suggested, but I like to see the images in the main page, Is part of the experience.dkbit98, robelneo:Telegram LinkIs already fixed, I was doing it wrong by creating a group, i created a channel and now we have a descent link for it:https://t.me/cryptotalktechETFbitcoin: Hide Images on the home page.I really appreciate the feedback from an experienced user as ETFbitcoin, for sure hiding the images from the home page would make the site loads faster but is part of the experience, that' why i want to keep them.Bureau: Install WP Rocket pluginEven if the recommendation comes form a good source, the plugin is obsolete and isn't worth it. hugeblack: Adding a mechanism to display and arrange topics.When you click on any news just scroll down, when you reach the footer it will load another news of the same topic. ajiz138: Add in a telegram bot with notifications when you publish.You are a genius ajiz138, i didn't think it would be that easy. But now you can get the news on the telegram channel.robelneo: SEO optimizationI still have to work on the SEO tools... is on the list.",

So, getting 60 push notifications every 20 minutes could be a hell.And I already fixed the telegram link and installed a cache plugin, that way the site should work faster now.",

Which might be your biggest weakness.The $1 million dollar question, if your users keep seeing they are redirected to another website to read all the news, why would they keep coming to yours and not to the main source of the news and not be bothered to tap twice to get their content? Do you think once they go off your website and see the other is full of real content do you think they will tap or click back?  This is the main problem with news aggregators, there is always a better one and there is always a lack of original content, you might top a few of the other websites in some specific keywords because of the sheer amounts of related titles but you will never beat them due to the weight of the outgoing links.So the most important thing, far more than design and name, how do you plan on keeping your users?Because since everyone has already mentioend cryptotalk(.)org you've seen how once they stopped paying people everyone left!The selling point, which one is it?Quote from: robelneo on September 10, 2023, 04:12:54 PMThere's a possibility that it will relaunch again, but OP need not worry he is providing rich and SEO-optimized content than this forum, and he is using WordPress He can use a lot of SEO plugins If OP does a good SEO he can dominate the keywords Crypto talk and Cryptocurrency news or whatever keywords that you want to dominate its better to invest in good SEO plugins to configure your content to rank high.It's been years since Google didn't really care about the domain name anymore, without original content you have no chance of beating a website that doesn't even have a crypto-related name anymore.

Thanks for the recommendation Bureau, I just take a look to the WP Rocket Plugin, and it doesn't look good. it says:DeprecatedThis plugin is deprecated and will be removed in the future.It was coded back in 2019 when WpRocket did not have asynchronous support for CSS.Although this plugin operates at a lower level (main php buffer), which helps apply loadsCSS to ALL styles regardless of whether they conform to wp_enqueue or not, we recommend instead using WpRocket’sAnd about your question, this kind of website that works automatically is a nice option if the project is useful for you.

I mean, what is difference between your site and other news sites and whats new features added in your sites which are still not available in others..?? Will you blindly copy news from these sites and you will do yours own research on each news and what step you will take to do so?..I recommend to add telegram group with your channel si that if someone want to comment on each news then it will be easy for him to do and also if any news are false, users will write in telegram comment.",
