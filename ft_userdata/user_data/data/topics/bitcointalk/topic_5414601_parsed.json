  "content": "Alik Bakhshi   It's time to expel Russia from the UN       In 1939, the USSR was expelled from the League of Nations for the unleashed war with Finland. Then the Russians wanted to capture Finland, but they did not succeed, despite the colossal superiority both in the size of the army and in weapons. The small Finnish people turned out to be too tough for the impudent invaders. Russia undertook the same war in 1979, attacking Afghanistan, and again suffered a shameful crushing defeat. The Russians were unable to subdue the Afghan people, who, having no planes, no tanks, no artillery and other modern weapons, drove the Russians out of their land and, I think, for a long time discouraged them from coming back to them with a war.     The essence of the Russian Empire lies in the fact that for a long time it cannot live without war, and the fact that it came to Ukraine with a war is quite consistent with what has been said. The free world finally understood what Russia is, and after a period of indecision decided to help the Ukrainian people in the fight against the aggressor. The West, having defeated the Evil Empire in the Cold War, made a big mistake helping Russia in the hope that the Russian people will appreciate the advantage of democracy. However, the leaders of the free world did not take into account the mentality of the Russian people (1), which not only rejected democracy, but also tries to restore the Russian Empire within the borders of the Soviet Union, that is, to return the peoples who gained freedom as a result of the collapse of the USSR, again within the empire. (2) The Russian people are ready for any hardships for the sake of this goal, regardless of how the goal will be achieved. And today, the people of Ukraine, having embarked on a democratic path of development, are forced to resist the invading Russian invaders, defending their freedom and independence in a brutal war.    Thanks to the courage of the people and help in arming the countries of democracy, Ukraine holds back the onslaught of the Russian invaders and even successfully takes steps towards their expulsion, which causes concern in the Kremlin about this circumstance. The blitzkrieg that Putin had counted on turned into a blitzcrash. Putin is absolutely right when he says that defeat in the war is tantamount to the death of the empire, although he modestly kept silent that the same awaits him. Putin, announcing the mobilization, essentially admitted that the initial phase of the war, which he called special. the operation failed. Putin, as a standard of lies (3), stubbornly avoids calling the war with Ukraine a war. It turns out that for his special operations are required for cannon fodder for another 300,000 people. Having told a lie, Putin will not refuse it. Even if the war with Ukraine develops into the Third World War, for him it will remain special. operation.    Along with this, Putin once again intimidates and warns the West and Ukraine to use nuclear weapons if hostilities spill over into Russian territory. According to this, Putin hurried to hold referendums on joining Russia in the occupied part of Ukraine, thinking that this would stop Kyiv from intending to throw the invaders beyond the state border of Ukraine. Such referendums are a common method for the Kremlin to colonize peoples, if we recall the annexation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 1940. By the way, there was no talk of any protection of the Russian population in the Baltics, as Moscow is presenting it today in connection with the Ukrainian events, which shows how hypocritical and deceitful the policy of the Empire of Lies is. expressed a desire to become part of the USSR. Well, after successful referendums, all three peoples voluntarily move to Siberia at once, and in their place they instill Russians, who today make up 25% of the population in Estonia and Latvia and demand Moscow's protection from the fact that they are finally forced to know the language of the indigenous population.     As for the nuclear threat, in accordance with the Budapest Memorandum, Russia, Great Britain and the United States, in exchange for Ukraine's renunciation of nuclear weapons and their transfer to Russia, pledged to be guarantors of its independence and sovereignty, which is recorded in the first paragraph of the memorandum:1. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm to Ukraine their commitment, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the CSCE, to respect the independence, sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine.     Russia not only did not fulfill its obligation to defend Ukraine, it also attacked it. The fact that America and Great Britain began to fulfill the obligation in accordance with the first paragraph of the memorandum to protect Ukraine caused indignation in Russia and a threat in their direction.      I believe that the world community should exclude Russia from the UN and isolate it from the civilized world like a mad dog. It is useless and dangerous to deal with a state in which lies are the foundation of its functioning (5), including interstate relations.            1.

Some powerful nations sometimes refuse to abide by the charters and laws of the organizations. Some of these nations are uncontrollable and make key decisions without considering their effects on the weaker ones. In fact, it is the weaker nations that are always law-abiding, while richer and powerful nations are lawless. Recently Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki accused France and Germany of ignoring the voice of poorer or weaker European nations. He insisted that the suggestions of Germany and France count more than other nations. This is also the case of the United Nations, where the main financiers manipulate the decision of the body.Expelling Russia from the United Nations might be impossible for now because China is its ally, hence it could block such moves. But does it make any difference? Putin's Russia cannot be controlled by any organization including the UN.",

It exists to steal from the people, and to help countries steal from each other. The only reason Russia stays in the UN is, there might be a little advantage here or there.Russia is already forming their own grouping of international nations through BRICS. BRICS is stronger than the UN, because it is based on real property trade rather than the US debt currency trade. The only weakness BRICS might have is that it is not nearly as well known (propagandized about) as the UN.As our conversation wanders in this thread, some of it may seem to not be about the UN or Russia. But all of it exists to show that there isn't anything to the UN. So, as far as Russia goes, it doesn't matter if the UN kicks her out, or lets her stay. The simple sanctions against Russia are far more profound, and have far greater implications, than UN membership.Or don't you want to talk about the UN and Russia, even though that is the topic of this thread? If not, what are you aiming at here? Are you simply trying to slander Russia? If that's all this thread is about, it really isn't worth looking at. We both have our own UNs, and we don't really need each other.",
