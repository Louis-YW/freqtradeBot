They are planning to make Doge a Micro payment for twitter, that's what I've read before and now they can actually make it happen. Too bad for me, all of my twitter accounts are blocked due to all of my followers are crypto users and my retweets are from crypto pages.",

      "body": "Not always too late if you are checking the ATH of doge. But this is a highly speculative token related to Elon. Assure that if Twitter and any good news to Elon arrived. Dogecoin always on the close to run a green candle. But the reverse could also happen if there bad news that link Elon to anything.I might be more wary on the technical side if you are on a short to medium trader.",

I think another correction is waiting for everyone.(....)If Dogecoin is risky, then other shitcoins that copied dogecoin are much riskier. For me, the safest is the higher market which is Dogecoin and as you can see, there is a lot of copy cat of the Dogecoin project. For me, Dogecoin is the original and I don't find it is risky at all versus other meme coins that copied the original.",
