Also, I think that his only reason for saying such things is to become a little more famous and we hear his name on social media.",

People who are in a dilemma whether cryptocurrency is good or bad will dig deep. What is more required than stating a technology based product dead, just because the market drops.",

I still remember when Jemie Dimon attacked bitcoin, how badly the market reacted. But now we are immune to such attacks and it doesn't matter anymore who says what about cryptocurrency and blockchain. But such statement can only come from ignorance and lack of knowledge. Let people speak what they want while we will contine to enjoy a path braking innovation like bitcoin for our benefit.",

Obviously I'm not saying that all older people can't understand tech, but a huge majority of them are simply incapable.As for Nouriel — yea, I watched his Bitcoin-related debates and interviews religiously in the past when he was at peak publicity, and I can say with confidence that his arguments against Bitcoin are BS.As for crypto in general being a bubble though, there's a lot of truth in it. So much overpriced garbage in the markets. While we've already had a huge market cleansing months ago, it's still not enough for the amount of trash in this industry.As for crypto in general having a lot of scams, surprise? You give the people the authority to create whatever project they want; a huge amount of scams is expected.",

How come crypto can be a \"mother and father of scams and bubbles\"? Roubini is simply talking BS here.Saying that Bitcoin is an Excel sheet is like saying that paper cash is a useless piece of paper and gold is a useless metal.So far I've never seen anyone using paper cash money as toilet paper. Isn't paper cash useless? If creating a cryptocurrencies was as easy as creating an Excel sheet, why there aren't any good competitors of Bitcoin? Anyone can create a Google spreadsheet or Excel sheet, right?I guess that Nouriel Roubini doesn't know what \"double spending\" actually means.",

Why aren’t you guys highlighting those?It depends on a user to how to use the features.So we can conclude that cryptos need not to be blamed for the scams that has been happening here.
