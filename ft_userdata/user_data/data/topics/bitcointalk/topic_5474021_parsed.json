I do not do business of any kind outside this site using the name OgNasty so if you ever see someone on Telegram or anywhere else using that name, know they are a scammer. Be careful. Quote from: Personal MessagesCan you confirm that you are the one talking to me on telegram?",

Anyone that want to contact you on telegram or any other social place or media should first make sure that he talks with you here on this forum. It is you that supposed to tell them here to contact you on other social places. Even also here, if it is something related to business and money, something like signing a message with bitcoin old address on this forum should first be used to know that you are dealing with the real person and not a compromised account.",

      "body": "It's very easy for someone to change their username on telegram after scamming their targeted client but the authenticity is for them to get you inboxed over here to confirm if you are the one on telegram initiating business with them. I don't usually reply to any DM on telegram if I didn't give you my ID or discuss about anything, when I get any random messages I block such person straight to avoid long conversation to that would lead to issues.",
