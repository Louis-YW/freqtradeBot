All over the world, women live longer than men, that's a fact. And there are many reasons for that.

You're either a simp or an idiot to this point.Oh, another conspirologist who believes in a worldwide conspiracy  Are you saying it's a false statistic? What statistic is not false then? Well, drop a link and provide a NOT false statistic that you trust. Very interesting to see it. And we'll see which one of us is which.",
