Anti-inflation economic policy reduces the money supply, and with less money in circulation, the price of financial assets falls.

In the best case scenario, I think we would get close to $30k, but until after the next halving I don't expect much joy.",

The high inflation make them can't buy many thing and they don't have enough side money to buy Bitcoin or invest, since it's will be used for emergency funds. Moreover due to less demand that make Bitcoin price decrease, they're not confident to buy it. But I'm using this advantage to accumulate more Bitcoin since when the inflation already quite stable and the whole economy back to normal, it will increase money circulation and encourage people to invest their money.",

Some items may have gone up by 50 or 100%, but prices in general, no. My guess is that real inflation will be between 15 and 20%. Annual rate in the EU.If inflation now seems bad to you, you don't want to see a real hyperinflation scenario, which is a minimum of 50% monthly but can be much more.",

You can use the pre pandemic event result to Bitcoin as reference for your question. Bitcoin is on this kind of Psychological worse than this before when pandemic first hit and many people secure money in fiat because everyone is afraid for economic crisis but Bitcoin recover bounce back stronger up to the ATH after a couple of months when global market started to recover again. Bitcoin just need to hit a solid ground to create a footing for another cycle of price recovery. Bitcoin will never stay down because many user still believes and just wait for the perfect opportunity to buy. You can see that many user still posting interest of buying despite Bitcoin is dumping hard. This is a proof that Bitcoin can bounce back anytime when all crypto traders unite.",

I've watched some youtube videos and I will agree with them that we might see a stagnant market this year whether it will be stock market or crypto market. Now with regards to Bitcoin bouncing back at it's psychological level, it depends on what is your psychological level because I think that term is very broad and general and different investors have different psychological levels. Overall, I will just say that Bitcoin might be going sideways between $20,000 and $30,000 until the end of the year. Just don't expect that something good will happen with the crypto market because the Fed already said that they will continue to increase the interest rates until the end of the year and that means negative sentiment to the investors.",

That is the question no one can answer.The economic crisis that we experience now won't last forever and the government will also suffer if they don't resolve it soon. Let's also add that cryptocurrencies went parabolic last year so it's normal for them to make a correction after that happens. Usually this season where cryptos are down or what we call bear cycle last for few years and if you will based on bitcoin's price history, it will recover again before or after its halving on 2024.",

I don't see euros collapsing any time soon nor do most people. It's also probably true that 9 percent inflation isn't the ceiling either. When the energy crisis worsens in the winter time, businesses will collapse in on themselves and wage increases will be only a fraction of the inflation rate.

And when I google 'US Fed policy Bitcoin', I see nothing from the last couple of weeks, so I'm really not sure which policies and which impact on Bitcoin the op is referring to. In any case, I think that Bitcoin is safer than fiat because it's not directly a part of the global economy and isn't necessarily affected by fiat policies, trade restrictions, certainly not by fiat inflation. Bitcoin isn't doing great, but the price isn't going below $19-20k, so it's roughly the way it has been throughout the summer.",

But I have come to the great realization that bitcoin is well integrated in the economy. For the question of whether bitcoin will recover, I am so confident about that.

I hardly think this daily news about FED is impacting btc these days, earlier I used to think there is some effect of these things but trust me BTC has given exactly the opposite reaction on very same kind of policies and then people just keep on giving their rationals behind the price movement.

As per me there was a psychological level which is hardly relevant now which was 35k or the 200EMA basically, It's really a long way to go back there right now.",
