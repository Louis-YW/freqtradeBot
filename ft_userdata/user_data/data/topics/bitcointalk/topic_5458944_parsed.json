Really the way I'm looking at Pi is one of the big Ponzi projects, really the way it's spread and the people who come into contact with them are mostly people who don't have much knowledge of technology or economics, they simply have a certain amount of mined Pi on the device and are rumored to be priceless to create a hype.",

Then they're trying to sell the (Pi-Network) token peer-two-peer because they cannot withdraw it.They try to sell personally to other people, for scam them. It's already being used multiple-time for these scheme, not only don't understand about crypto they also try to starting older people because easy to be manipulated.",

It's been in existence for quite some time now, and I'm curious to know which top exchange it is currently trading on, considering its longevity. Additionally, I'm interested in learning about the influence or presence it has on social media. Unless we choose to deceive ourselves, it's clear that cryptocurrencies and social platforms go hand in hand.",

(Random speculation) Maybe for that reason the team denied the listing was not through their approval and what they really wanted was to build a bigger community foundation in anticipation of a big price drop.Whatever planning and development they have been doing for a long time, the actions of the Vietnamese authorities I think are beyond their expectations. And this is an early sign that Pi is likely to face more resistance in some other countries' regulations. I hope, their community is keeping an eye out for this to happen.",

Im not really sure if they are doing blockchain via phone. Obviously a big scam for me since how does mining works without chain?

It is not strange if in the end the developer of this project is investigated because of course there are many who suffer losses, but those who experience these losses will never get their money back. However, what the authorities in Vietnam are doing is a good step in order to reduce the activities of scammers.",

Yes, it seems that the Vietnamese government sees Pi as a big threat, actually I have used their application and exploited Pi before, but I find it funny that it is just a place for people to interact Tell the story of the future will be rich. I also got somewhere around 1000Pi and also sold out to some fomo people before when it started listing on houbi for $1, although I see they have bigoted hype about multi-level forms and The target group of teams is actually they have little knowledge to be easily fooled.",

They are not just greedy but simply did not comprehend the basic scam scheme, traditionally or even digitally, let alone what is cryptocurrency all about.Surely the one who endorses and preaches this coin can just spout out some technical or financial jargon that makes the other person dazzled.

It sounds like you are disappointed that you didnt get involved. What is there to lose? its free to mine.It has a massive user base -- one of the largest. Chances are that some large crypto company will buy them based on this fact alone. So even if they dont get their act together and launch -- they wont need to. This is the first project available to everyone with a level playing field. They have not launched and money grabbed. They are buliding community first.what are the drawback to users? Your statement is blank and aimless. Pi has unlimited potential for many reasons.
