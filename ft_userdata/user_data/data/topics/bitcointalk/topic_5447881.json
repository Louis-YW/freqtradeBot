So it is no chance for you or anyone to retrieve those coins for you.It is not related to Bitcoin tx accelerator so your question is confusing.If your problem is your transaction is stucked in mempool because you use low fee rate, you can use tx accelerator or you can bump the fee by using RBF opt-in and Bump the fee option in your wallet.Transactions (Compilation for newbies)Use this free tx accelerator: https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/Before using tx accelerator, check your fee rate and current mempools to know what a higher fee rate you should use when you bump the fee.Bitcoin Transaction Fees - Everything in oneTwo good sites to check mempoolshttps://mempool.space/https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),24h,weightGenerally the offer is scam.",

      "body": "Since your post doesn't make much sense, I have a few questions for you:1. First you say that you have $125k stuck but then you go on about putting $75k of your own money. Care to explain where exactly you put that money?2. Who is asking you to pay $15k? Share some links pls. This is just my guess based on your confusing post, but it looks like you are being scammed by one of those sites that ask you to send money in order to be able to withdraw.",

I have never used it, but my understanding is that its a non-custodial wallet (albeit crappy one imho) and not the web wallet where you don't have access to your keys like for example blockchain.com.",

      "body": "You have an unconfirmed transaction and you want to accelerate it using a service that charge you 15,000 dollars for that. Am I getting you right? Can you share your transaction ID here? (Note that with sharing your transaction ID, you may hurt your privacy, but it has nothing to do with your security.)If the transaction includes a change, you can accelerate it using CPFP method on your own without relying on any third party.

I doubt exodus makes RBF-enabled transactions.",

According to everything that can be read about them, it seems that it is a classic scam in which victims are tried to be induced to invest as much money as possible, and problems arise when the victim wants to make the first withdrawal.Obviously, one of the methods is the claim that the transaction is stuck and that some kind of \"acceleration\" should be paid. I hope the OP will tell us something more, but everything points to a scam.",

Your $70,000 investment was made to appear to be worth $125,000. You are not the first person to be asked to deposit additional funds when you want to withdraw a significant amount of money. Regardless, they are not able to scam you anymore for another $15,000 after you inquire here about the costs of speeding up bitcoin transactions. They do not cost hundreds of bucks and there are even free accelerators like viabtc.com.",
