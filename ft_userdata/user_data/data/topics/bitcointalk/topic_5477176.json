      "body": "OP you really know what is happening in this festive period because almost every one falls in this category of spending our savings money for an event that will just end in a day and afterwards we start feeling the pain of spending money extravagantly just to impress people around us like buy costly shoes, wear expensive clothes and put on luxurious jewelries just to feel proud and big when after the festive period every one return to square one. This has really been a major challenge in the society and I don't know why humans will just give a particular month not even a month, just a particular day as utmost priority that if you don't meet up like others it will look as if you're the worst person in the society therefore people spend all the whole savings they've made for the year just for Christmas, even when Christ himself didn't celebrate his birthday while he was on earth.After all the whole spending then from January people start suffering and finding it difficult to feed and do other necessities of life. The earlier people understand that there is life after Christmas, the better for them. Me I live my life not to impress anyone but myself that's why at a time when others are crying of how hard the economy is on them I just laugh and say that the economy isn't affecting me in any way Well, any Bitcoin investor will know that Bitcoin requires a long interval of time before your investment can mature then after which you can start using it to make transactions. Our focus for now is to buy and accumulate more Bitcoin as we can be able to afford. Anyone who is into Bitcoin investment should have an alternative means of getting money so that they won't tamper with the Bitcoin they have acquired so anyone that withdraw their Bitcoin just to impress people doesn't have the ability of an investor and such a person may run into series of problems because he can't save money for the future.",

BTC would continue to gain value, while the money he spent is lost and never coming back to him. Don't get me wrong having fun once in a while isn't wrong, but to weigh your decision is a very important thing in life. Just imagine the regret he would feel after selling a portion to enjoy, then the bull run comes , that's going to be really messy on his side.And after patience to aquire one needs to have self control not to use it for the wrong reasons.",
