  "content": "If you get paid in BTC address you have on an Electrum wallet, and you want to pay for someone that sells a good or service in exchange of BTC, but for obvious reasons you don't want to disclose how much BTC is your address holding to the person/entity that sells such good or service because they could easily look up your public address after you pay them on a blockchain explorer and see the funds... then how would you do this?For example, you get paid in address A which has 0.1 BTCYou don't want to disclose you own 0.1 BTC to this person/entity, so you want to spend 200 USD on this good or service, which are like 0.004855 BTC at current rate.How do you do this?Should one download some of these \"privacy wallets\", create an address there and make a transaction with the funds you want to spend (0.004855 in this case) and then pay from that wallet's address? but the wallet has to have Android support for handheld usage then since I will pay once I arrive on the spot, not in advance.Also, what about the fees? you lose money each time you send to the address that you want to spend from. This is problem. Also, exchange rate varies. You may send 0.004855 BTC to the new address you want to spend from, but this may be less than USD by the time you arrive (or more, but less imagine it's less)I just don't know how to go about this, too many moving parts.",

Through the explorer one can easily see the amounts of the first wallet also, this is just more like a waste of transaction fee for privacy seriously. Better still if you’re wary of privacy in public places like this I will advice payment using fiat paper money",

If you want privacy using Bitcoin as payment in a restaurant wouldn't work as expected because you have a lot of work to do before you can make a safe payment that can't be looked up. E.g Using mixers etc. and after mixing you will not have to move your coins back to the main wallet or the origin but a brand new wallet that will still require more expenses. So I will suggest you use other payment method for convenience than Bitcoin for $200 worth of food. Privacy is expensive and takes alot of carefulness and time to get maximum privacy so you have to choose between privacy and convenience.",

If yes then you need to do all the privacy stuff before you get to the place you want to buy your goods or you want to exchange your bitcoin for any service.Just as few others have suggested I will add to it by saying you will need to move some of those your bitcoin with extra fee to a non KYC exchange address where you can withdraw from this exchange to a different address were you can use later at any place were you will send directly to the place wallet. Or better still just use a mixing service and get the coin detach from your original wallet where only you and the mixer will know the new wallet and were the holdings are originally from.",

First of all, keep in mind that for protecting your privacy, you should connect your Electrum to Tor before you make/broadcast a transaction because, when you use a lightweight version of Electrum or any other wallet, you are connected to other nodes and for security and privacy reasons, you should assume that they log your IP when you make a transaction, i.e. they know that there was a transaction made via you via certain Bitcoin address.This is the basic step for your privacy when you use Electrum but as I see, the privacy that you want to achieve, is beyond Electrum's capabilities. For that, you should use Mixers or CoinJoin wallets but you still depend on how trustworthy mixer or coinjoin wallet developer is. Also, keep in mind that project being simply open-source doesn't mean it's 100% trustable, you should check the code or if you can't check the code, you have to rely on what other developers say.Overall, Monero is a currency that you need if you want to save on fees, don't rely on 3rd parties and to achieve a maximum privacy.",

In this way, the entity will see no link at all to the three larger outputs under your control.Or, if you prefer, you could use just the 0.0233 BTC output to fund the transaction, significantly reducing the visibility from the full 0.1 BTC to just 23% of your balance.Now, if you have only ever received a single transaction, and the amount of that single transaction was 0.1 BTC, then maintaining privacy of that balance will be more difficult.If you're willing to pay repeated transaction fees over many days/weeks/months/years to gain some privacy, one thing you could do to increase your privacy a bit would be to generate a random time and then after waiting that amount of time from receiving your initial transaction create a new transaction to split your balance by a random percentage and send each portion to a new addresses in your wallet. Then after another random time, chose one of the two outputs randomly, and split that to 2 new addresses. Then after another random amount of time, chose one of the three outputs in your wallet and split that to 2 new addresses, and so on until you have several random sized outputs all created at random different times from random earlier outputs.  This will make it much more difficult for the entity to distinguish between outputs that you still control.If you're only trying to maintain privacy from one particular entity, and you don't mind another entity knowing about your larger single UTXO, you could briefly send your 0.1 BTC to a popular entity that pools the bitcoins they receive (such as an exchange or a gambling website). As an example, let's assume you use Coinbase. Then you could withdraw random percentages of the 0.1 BTC, each to a separate address in your wallet. It would become extremely difficult for the entity you are trying to maintain privacy from to determine which of the many, many outputs Coinbase sent were sent to addresses of yours vs. addresses of other people.Another option might be to use an intermediary (friend?, family?, etc) that you aren't concerned about knowing how much BTC you have in the transaction you received.  You could make an arrangement for the intermediary to make the payment on your behalf, and then later you could send a payment amount to the intermediary at a new address compensating them for helping you.There are probably more options, but those are the few that come immediately to mind.Note: if the entity you are trying to maintain privacy from is a government entity, it's possible that some of these processes to hide the source of funds might be considered \"money laundering\" by some governments. This may be illegal in somme jurisdictions, and you may need to talk to a lawyer to make sure that you're not doing anything that could be charged as a crime.",

For instance, to pay for some online service like a VPN it's reasonable since you aren't doxed, but why risk it when you are paying IRL? This is why perhaps these coinjoin wallets are worth looking into if they deliver any informationThe non KYC exchange may be a solution tho. Do you know which ones are worth using?The thing is, you are just wasting a lot of money along the way with transactions.",

This is problem. Also, exchange rate varies. You may send 0.004855 BTC to the new address you want to spend from, but this may be less than USD by the time you arrive (or more, but less imagine it's less)I just don't know how to go about this, too many moving parts.Why should you pay him in bitcoin when you can pay him with other alternative altcoins? After all, you don't want other people to know your total bitcoin balance in the wallet address to be used, which can be seen in the blockchain explorer.It's impossible that you don't know that bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that can be paid to other people. I can understand you if Bitcoin is the only crypto in this industry. That's why there are many options like Ethereum, BnB, Matic, USDT, and others that can be paid online.",
