  "content": "Hi there. I'm curious about the public opinion on the following questions:1) How do you understand the \"data immutability\" in the context of blockchain networks? What description of this feature would you suggest?2) What does it mean to be a solution that ensures data immutability? What does it mean for data to be immutable?3) How do various blockchain solutions approach to data immutability?",

      "body": "I thought that data immutability was not a problem but rather a desirable feature of blockchains.Since we as cryptocurrency users expect the blockchain to offer unbiased and factual information for us all, if somehow the data was mutable or able to be changed, then wouldn't that imply there is a way to censor or alter information/transactions?I guess there are some cases one can find information our there that is one does not want to be public, though.",

The word \"problem\" projects a negative light on the subject. I'll edit my question and use the word \"feature\" instead. Quote from: o48o on February 27, 2023, 08:09:54 PMAnswer depends of the definition of your question and this could go in so many ways if i had to guess what you mean.Yes, you are right. That's what I'm looking for.",
