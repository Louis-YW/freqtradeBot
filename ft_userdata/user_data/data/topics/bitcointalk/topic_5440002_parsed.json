My impression about that site is it's like an advertisement site for newborn projects but most of altcoin projects are scam.If you spend your funds in those projects, firstly you would think you are genius by finding hidden gems but later you will learn hard lessons. Losing your funds easily with them.",

The rating itself is likely based on a vague metricts or else, a manual biased rating. Also, the important information doesn't merely come from those things you mentioned, it is way more complex than that. Lastly, one can know for sure without deeply researching with or without this kind of site that most of a new tokens are highly likely worthless.",

There might be some server issues but I can't verify it. If anyone needs to use a similar service there is also Unicrypt, Fluidefi, Poocoin, etc. Make sure to do your own research before you use them.The scoring system is quite arbitrary but at least they explain some key points in their analysis. Things as if a contract is verified or not, whether the contract ownership is renounced or not, etc. If anyone decides to use this tool, ignoring the scoring would be a better idea until they explain how the scoring works. You also need to be aware that the company behind this tool is famous for AML solutions so check their terms to see if they collect any personal data or not. Even if they said they don't collect personal info when somebody uses this, looking for open-source alternatives is a good idea.",

I tried with one token that I invested in and gives me a good analysis of the status of the token yes its a must to check the whitepaper and features of the token you're investing or will be investing but it will take you time and miss some point, you can use this tool and at the same time do a comparison with your own research and analysis, the tool has this disclaimer whenever they show the result on the token they analyzedQuoteThe audit score is a measure of how well the token meets the criteria for safety. Â Automated scanners like this one are not always completely accurate. Â A token with a high score may still have hidden malicious code. The score is not advice and should be considered along with other factors. Always do your own research and consult multiple sources of information. Â Results are regenerated every 10 minutes.",
