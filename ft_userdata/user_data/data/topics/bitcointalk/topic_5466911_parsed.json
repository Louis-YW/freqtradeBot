I do not want to mention their name but some members are ranking up with unusual pace and they are getting merits in their every post in local board when they can not get few merits from the global board. How they are doing exceptionally well only in local board? What do you think what is wrong with them?",

They were just sending their merits to a handful of members and it looks like most of their post is getting merit when those merit is circulating between a few of the members. I do not want to accuse anyone directly because I do not have expertise in identifying merit farming activity. I think what is happening there is wrong so brought this topic forward. It is not about only those two boards there are other local boards as well where this same thing is happening. A group of member is trying to abuse the system because of no moderation activity in some local board.",

How they are doing exceptionally well only in local board?Its nothing that we haven't seen before, that members of local boards sometimes tend to have a lower standards or are more generous when it comes to merit. Another thing is that its easier to express yourself in your own native language, so members of some boards that are not so fluent in English struggle to earn merit in general part of the forum, compared to their own local board. Then again, I also woulnd't exclude the possibility of good old merit abuse but that's something that is much harder to prove.Thing about merit is that last time theymos adjusted it there was more than 50% more posts being written and about the similar amount of active members. Less posts and active members means there's abundance of merit (speaking generally, there are still some part of the forum that are undermerited) so merits are being shared left and right to everything that is not a shitpost.",

The author is trying to draw attention to the fact that some users are promoted very strongly and quickly, rewarded with merit. This looks suspicious. Sometimes this also comes across my field of vision and I feel bewilderment and misunderstanding when a user receives stacks of merit from one source over and over again. Well, probably the whole point is that he saw legendary huge potential in the newcomer, which pushes him to quickly rise in the ranks.  You are right in the statement that it is impossible to objectively assess the situation using screenshots alone. If OP had provided links to these accounts, then it would have been possible to check the posts and then draw the appropriate conclusions.",

It took a few pages of browsing and matching the merit history from the screenshot shared by OP.It is probably due to the low number of active members in both local boards so the one who has merits is trying to encourage them to keep the upcoming members active and it's usually the case when the active members are fewer.Every local board has different source merit allocations from merit sources and every source has different meriting habits so you cann't get the same kind of treatment from your local board.I can't able to read those posts to determine the quality of posts but it's true that the members received most of the merits from local boards while they equally posted the number of posts in global sections.",

I think the potential for abuse of the merit system can occur on various local board - even on global boards. But to accuse someone without wanting to reveal evidence would not be good. OK you probably don't want to ruin someone's reputation because of your suspicions - so what's the point of this thread?Many users are encouraged to grow in their respective local board because they master the language well. Of course this can help them get the quality of posts they expect - but the limited circulation of merit to some users is not entirely considered abuse, but could also be because they have good interactions with each other.",
