  "content": "I am trying to confirm or disconfirm the statement you see here about a crypto named Bytecoin: \"Even if you buy on Gate.io, it is impossible to withdraw them. Most likely, the exchange is simply deceiving people by selling them air.\" unquoteCan anybody from their experience on gate.io confirm the above statement or disconfirm it?  Does gate.io not allow some cryptos to be withdrawn, like Bytecoin for example,   Thank you.Global Protection -  Canadian citizen living in Belize now",

The advanced person could leave tips here of how to set it up so that all people can learn. It seems that governments hate this coin because it is so private, therefore, computers have installed something to keep that desktop wallet from being easily set up. Their web wallet works, and that was one of the things the devs fixed some time ago.  There is another lower profile wallet that you can access on Telegram, but make sure you are getting the link from an official person there so you get the correct link.  Again, this coin is so private that it seems there is war going on to keep people from having it. But the web wallet and the one that is ultra private both work the last time I checked which was not long ago.I own only a little amount of this crypto, but may own more later after I watch it some more.Global Protection -  Canadian citizen living in Belize now",
