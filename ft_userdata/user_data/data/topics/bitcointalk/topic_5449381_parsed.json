This sub is missing a moderator since the great Benson Samuel decided to launch his own crypto startup and disappear from the forum. It is at least good to know that India was important enough in the forum to have a sub of its own. Can't say that we did a great job with it. If this has a moderator and @Theymos was around to fix things, could have been a different story. I am not updated on the latest yet as I have been away from the forum for sometime.",

I am not updated on the latest yet as I have been away from the forum for sometime.yeah..it didn't grow as much as they think it would i guess.but then the rules and laws changed and people went into hiding.nobody even thinks of trading on the forum now for they don't want to reveal their own identity.which is fair enough because u never know who is who.and i saw similar situations in exchanges as well.instead of having more and more traders as the time passed by they actually decreased.now even if ur neighbor is trading in bitcoin, s/he won't tell u about it.",
