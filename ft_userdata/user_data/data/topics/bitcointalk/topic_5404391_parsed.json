But if the resources are limited, there's really a need to thrive individually and an urge to push everyone to their respective desires for higher education.Education is the backbone of a nation.  And without an educated nation no country can ever prosper.  So you have to be educated from your own desire.  And African governments must also take appropriate measures to develop education.  Only then can progress be made.  If there are too many problems, assistance can be taken from other countries.",
