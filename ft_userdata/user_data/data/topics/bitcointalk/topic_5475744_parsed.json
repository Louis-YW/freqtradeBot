In this case I will not blame the gambling site because they give live cards. I started the game with just $20 but gradually I got addicted to it and wanted to gamble and win bigger amounts by depositing bigger amounts. I lost $1700 playing this way then I decided to play with a much bigger amount and recover all the losses then quit gambling for this I borrowed 270000 BDT ($2180) from the bank and deposited there. But unfortunately I lost them. Now I am financially so weak that it has become very difficult to meet my family expenses and I owe the bank $2180 which will take me a long time to pay off. Now it will take about 2 years for my financial situation to be normal again. Gambling addiction set back my normal life by 2 years. I am a victim of real experience and I am sharing my real experience with you.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  And never decide to gamble with a loan.

      "body": "Gambling with loan should be avoided. But not only that, also gambling with the amount of money that you can not afford to lose should be avoided. The reason I said this is because despite it is not advisable for gamblers to gamble with the amount they can not afford to lose, if they do, they are more likely to lose the money in their bank or wallet address and what they will look to is to get a loan if possible, so that they can continue to gamble. What will also still happen is that they will lose.",

I am a victim of real experience and I am sharing my real experience with you.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  And never decide to gamble with a loan. If you do, your situation may be similar to mine.It is sad to hear that you are now in debt because of a gambling disorder. I also give you kudos for coming out to discuss your struggles because many gambling addicts hide their disorder and it will gradually consume them because they refuse to seek help. Your main focus now should be to control your gambling activities to enable you to pay your debt. This is because if you don't control how you play bets, you might not be able to save enough to pay your debt. If quitting gambling for some time will help you save enough to pay your debt, you can consider it. You should also consider getting a side job that will help you make extra cash to pay up your debt faster. Gambling has destabilised your finances for two years but this is not the end of the world. With proper planning, self-control and diligence, you will be able to recover all you have lost and enjoy a good life with your family. This a lesson to all of us not to use money earmarked for family expenses to gamble. And taking a loan to gamble is going to the extreme because it could have a bad financial effect.      Quoteso beware of gambling  Beware of irresponsible gambling.",

He stated that he knew that it is against one of the gambling rules but he still just fall victim of it. I don't think op discovered anything early as you stated, we consider one to have discovered a potential issue early only of he or she finds out about the potential disaster of doing something, and then avoid doing that thing completely. But here, op knew or had some clue of the potential danger but still went ahead to engage in that same thing which he himself must have one or two, or even more times advised other gamblers not to engage themselves in.This can be linked to the story i shared on the bitcoin discussion board some weeks ago, about a guy who bought bitcoin in 2011 and even till recently was holding the bitcoins on his mobile wallet, and also saved the keys to the wallet online on one of this password manager sites, he has advised hundreds of thousands of people to buy a hardware wallet and store their cryptocurrencies there, but he himself doesn't have one, even while holding bitcoins that are worth almost a million dollars, unfortunately for him recently, he got hacked and all his bitcoins since 2011 was moved to another wallet he had no access to, or have a clue who owns it .This is what happens to people who teach others what themselves do not practice.",

I'm neither surprised nor shocked at all because is not everyone here that practice what they preach. Besides, you can be a victim and still be advising others so as not to fall victim and it's normal. The OP went to far from spending huge amount of money on gambling to the extent of taking loan and spend it on gambling. It's understandable if you are addicted gambler but you are using your own money to gamble and not with the loan taken from bank. The good thing here is that he's realized the mess he got himself into and probably learn the hard way. It however baffles me that people don't usually raise alarm when things are still in process in order to seek for help until it gets out of hand before they speak out when it's mostly not fixable.",

I'm not fan of borrowing money if it's for non important things like gambling. I also have loans but I used it for purchasing important things that helps me in my daily life. I'm a firm believer that once you use a loan money in gambling, it will bring you misfortune. Loaning money for gamble is not advisable because we are not sure if you win or lose the money, If you're going to lose money, think about where you're going to get the money to pay off your debt.",

It is about your own money and if it is a loan money, it's worse. Generally it is terrible to do trading or gambling with people who can not control themselves in emotion and psychology. If they feel themselves are uncontrollable in emotion and psychology, don't trade and don't gamble is the best.You do it but you are safe because you are good at control yourself and you can have expertise in gambling too. For other people, it is very risky and they should not do this.QuoteBased on your experience, I'd say that you make 2 mistakes here.
