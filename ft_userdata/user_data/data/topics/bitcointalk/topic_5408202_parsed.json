The lawsuit was launched in reaction to the social media company's legal case filed against Elon Musk for stepping away from the $44 billion Twitter transaction.Despite the fact that the lawsuit document was not officially accessible at the moment of writing, a revised version may be released publicly shortly under court order.Elon Musk registered a case only hours after Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery scheduled a five-day trial beginning October 17 to decide if he could walk away from the $44 billion contract. The court has set a five-day trial for the case.Source link: https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/elon-musk-backfires-twitter-with-countersuit-over-44-billion-dealDo you think is possible for Elon Musk to walk away?your contribution matters",

And this is what Twitter is seeking after it confirmed that Elon Musk was seeking to terminate the contract against the background of fake accounts. It is not clear whether Elon Musk will demand the billion dollars in compensation if it is discovered that the percentage of fake accounts exceeds 5 percent, as the company announced at the beginning of the deal.",

I mean, why offer to buy the entire shares of the company? I can't imagine Mr. Musk not knowing the true value of the company to offer a double amount.Don't forget that he sold part of Tesla's shares to fund the deal before he announced his abandonment of it.I began to align myself with the hypothesis that this man seeks to remain in the spotlight to satisfy psychological whims. This may cost him a lot of effort, time and money. But I do not really find convincing explanations for his actions.",

In recent weeks, as Ukrainian forces moved into territory previously controlled by Russian forces, the systems stopped working on multiple occasions. One senior Ukrainian official told the FT this led to a \"catastrophic\" loss of communication, including during \"pitched battles.\" Failures were \"widespread\" and \"prompted panicked calls from soldiers to helplines,\" said another official.Roman Sinitsin, who runs a nonprofit that directs Starlinks to the Ukrainian military, said the problem may have been due to Musk's SpaceX having a block on the signal in Russian-held areas.\"It is absolutely clear to me that this is being done by representatives of Starlink to prevent the usage of their technology by Russian occupation forces,\" Sinitsin told the FT, urging SpaceX to coordinate more closely with the Ukrainian military....",
