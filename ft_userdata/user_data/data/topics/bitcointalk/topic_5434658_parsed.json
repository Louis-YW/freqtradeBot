Am not an expert in the TA field but I can see some of the influencers and TA analysts on Twitter saying the bull market is back.

As is often the case in such cases, it would be necessary to rethink the \"trend\", which is a reconstruction of past events rather than a tool for predicting future events.",

By mid-year the direction of the market will become clearer and if price move high enough such that if eventually we face another attack either through crashing of more exchange or unfavorable regulation it won't push price below a certain threshold. Then we might have a bullish year but if price fails to move fast enough the coincidence might fail to repeat itself in 2023.",

But it's not exactly high either, and it's only up since autumn and a part of winter in that case, as we had higher numbers in summer 2022. So how should that be written down, and is it a particularly good year if Bitcoin doesn't reach more than $25k? Nobody can know what kind of year we're going to have, so we should brace for whatever comes instead of being hopeful and them disappointed, IMO.",

You should note that you get up and down from what criteria: Yearly closed price, Yearly Max price or Yearly Min price.Usually people use Yearly Closed price but to be honest, yearly growth of Bitcoin is presented better if you look at it in Yearly Min price chart. Min price means even at the worst day, worst price, year after year it still shows good growth.Generally you can use Yearly candlesWhen I have time, I will come back and give you a chart made by myself.",

Many major crypto companies hits bankruptcy and also institutional investors is already positioned on higher price point compared to the later year that no major whales holding the majority of the Bitcoin supply. You can add to the inflation on the US the might affect global market soon when this is not solved by increasing interest rate on US consumer.But relying on chart like this as pattern is good since it will give a positive atmosphere to all crypto holders to buy more crypto despite the current condition.",

It is still fresh of what happened year 2018 wherein many investors have lost huge mount of money because they did not expect a sudden downfall with its market price. Which is somehow worrying me a bit that the dump which occured late last year, could also last for more than 2years. Enduring it is possible but that's just hard to see if you are used of generating profit from investing. But actually, there's no such thing as pattern in this industry; inconsistent and never continuous. It will just be seeming to be continuously increasing across different price points over years but in reality it is not if you'd come deeper with the details.",
