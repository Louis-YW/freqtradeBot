Kind of left it at that until now, and believe Meta is appropriate at this point. . My issue..I promote the forum a good bit & one of the main places I do so is YouTube but the fcks and their censoring algorithm always delete my posts whether I type “bitcointalk” “bitcointalk.org” “physicalbitcoin.com” (this is currently down but used to link to collectibles) “bitcoin talk website” etc etc. I’m first curious if anyone knows why they censor the hell out of this site (yet don’t censor any bot scam posts). But mainly I’m curious if anyone has a work around?  I often try to help btc coin collectors I randomly find on there, I’ve tried to teach people how to redeem paper wallets etc.. but most of the time its too hard to fool the algorithm well enough to relay my message clearly.  (Curious if the bitcoin talk show faced any of these issues). My only idea was to try to create a “hidden” hyperlink like I do for work where I have a link in my email body that says “book an Appt with me” but directs to my scheduler site. Guessing the software would likely pick up the  underlying hyperlink?  Any suggestions appreciated.",

Google bot is fine to approve scammers adlink but when it's bitcointalk then they have panic LOL. It must be some strategic movement to create obstacle for Bitcoin. Anyway, have a custom domain and create a website, blog or service it does not matter. Promote that website and the website will be mainly referring to bitcointalk. It's gonna be a lot of work but once a hyperlink in banned then you have no other way except choosing the hard path.",

There's a reason why the likes of \"top 10 altcoins to buy this month!\" are the ones that gets a lot of attention, not the actual informative/educative videos.You might be surprised, but either way every bit of promotion helps.  Being an avid physical btc collector I will search for physical crypto videos every month or so. I’ve found a lot of videos of people who show their collections, I’ve seen quite a few videos of people who are asking how can they best sell thier Casascius coin, or how to redeem their Casascius coin etc.  I always reach out to these people and have gotten a few to sign up here, but then there’s others who don’t speak very good English who just can’t pick up on my hints trying to direct them here. Again, I think you might be surprised at how many people would be interested in this forum. YouTube , Twitter and Reddit are the number one places people go to for learning, and most have no clue at all who are actually legit educators. I mean there’s complete morons/scammers who have twice the followers of Andreas A, simply because he doesn’t do shit to promote like the others do.  At the very least you have to try imo.@everyone else, thanks for the comments / suggestions. I will try to do the hidden hyperlinks / link shortners and see how it goes. Of course if anyone else has any other ideas please let me know ! (And a link to sites to do so would be greatly appreciated)",
