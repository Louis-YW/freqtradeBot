You have the advantage of immediate response for your questions especially those questions that are new in cryptocurrency.  To add to this, I think you need to forget about merits and joining campaigns for now if you are here to learn a thing or two. And how to get acquainted with the rules. In general bitcointalk is a place where we all learn for free, all you have to do is to ask the right question but before asking use the search box to check maybe your question hasn't been asked before. Then you can ask the questions on the right board and trust me there experts here that help for free",

      "body": "Quote from: Juicy_D on August 26, 2022, 08:48:31 PM<...>Just to point out that the bounty campaign guide linked further above is partial, and focuses on what are generally known as bounty hunting tasks. Those kind of tasks basically consist of spamming the hell out of your contacts, or if you’ve made an alternate set of social accounts, spamming the hell out of accounts that, in turn, are created just to spam the hell out of whomever they can. Whilst many of us may have been there at some point, even for a brief encounter to test the waters, people that have the capability of engaging in conversations on the forum will rather go for signature campaigns (when and if their account reaches certain ranks generally required). Now this is quite different in nature from the former depicted in the first paragraph, and not all campaigns offer signature bearing in their campaign. Some of the more aspirational signature campaigns are traced on this thread, though they do require generally a mid-to-high rank amongst their requirements for postulants to their campaigns. Nevertheless, there are some altcoin campaigns that seek lower ranked members as participants. In order to bear a signature, you’d need to become a Jr. Member first (>=1 Merits; >=30 Activity), and the idea is to participate in the conversations on the forum whilst avoiding spamming (big difference with what tends to happen with the social media tasks).A good starting point to understanding signature campaigns would be this other thread, where I’d read through the OP, the included links to other threads, and the rest of the posts in the threads.",
