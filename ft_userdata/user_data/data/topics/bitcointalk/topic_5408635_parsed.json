And they don't read the feedback already existing here.And, from what I've heard, the casino has filled the internet with (fake?) positive reviews, so their real face is basically visible only here.",

Years ago when there were many cloud mining scams and there were threads all over the forum, every week you'd get someone asking if it's a good idea to put money in this or that site and all they needed to do is search the forum or google it. They were too lazy for it, but they weren't too lazy to make an account on a shady site promising 10% a month and send them their hard earned money. So I'll ask again. Why do you keep playing in shady casinos when there's so many legit ones. Your chances of wining at a legit one are probably 40% or less, why lower it to 0 by trusting scammers?",

This has been discussed here for many times, yet many people still fall for this scam site. If only there's a way to ban those 1xbit participants probably that's the best way to prevent any victim here but again, this forum is as good source of information, and if you are looking for more victims of this scam site, you can easily search it here.

But that you are running a signature campaign for a casino doesn't mean you shouldn't say the truth when you see it, because 1xbet is one casino I have known tagged to be a scam both in and outside the forum with bunch of unresolved scam accusations. Because most of the common issues I have got people complain about 1xbet is banning of an accounts after winning, which is literally unfair..And here is a proof of one of 1xbit complainthttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5267433.0",

The lesson learnt in this situation is that you should made some research if the site you want to gamble is legit and have good reputation. Don't trust review sites easily as some of the review site's review about the gambling site is biased or they are paid to give good review.",

It is a battle between information and desinformation.For example, they use legitimate services and webpages to advertise themselves, here is a thread about how they parasited trust people have in the hot wallet mycelium, to advertise themselves.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5350964.0Some unknowing victims might think that \"If mycelium promotes it, must be legit\", and only with that (false) assumption they jump onto the webpage with no previous research and this happens in a variety of ways: influencers, youtubers, pay review articles, signature campaigns, promotions... they even tried to censor places on the internet that pointed them out as scammers.So yes, it is responsability of the user to be informed and do their own research but 1xBit also moves mountains to keep the victims coming.",
