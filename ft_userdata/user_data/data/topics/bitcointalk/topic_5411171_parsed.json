I don't think the people here in my country would easily accept Bitcoin because they wouldn't understand what to do with it and probably reject its innovation and how it could help them in the long run. They would prefer the fiat way where paper money is king and probably not digital.Nevertheless, I hope it will increase adoption in other countries, and everyone will follow suit. I do hope that happens.",

Hope this creates awareness and increase of usage among Indians.I have no problem getting taxed because we are obliged in doing so as income earners to help with the economy. Crypto taxes aren't yet being structured in the Philippines despite it's generally considered to be taxable under realized income (crypto to fiat conversion). I would likely choose to pay taxes than getting banned in the country as regulation is definitely needed to increase more adoption.Same here in the Philippines where the acceptance has been increasing and it'll never stop. Recently, Binance will be partnering with Philippine universities to introduce Bitcoin and crypto related courses in the curriculum.",

It will change with time and will be skewed in legal side because more countries will accept Bitcoin. I don't think we will have a future with that more countries will not accept or ban Bitcoin. It is not the trend.Global adoption, legal tender will be the trend. It won't stop.",

What if you are breaking the law? What will be the punishment in this case? I say this because in my country it takes a very long time to decide the laws on the adoption or prohibition of cryptocurrencies. The government moves from plus to minus and vice versa. And as long as bitcoin is an unregulated coin, we will have to wait a very long time for things like accepting payment or buying with bitcoin.",

Not sure on how it proceeded but the fact that there are people accepting cryptocurrencies as payment to their services/products gives hope for its wide-scale implementation in the future.To be honest, there are other forum members who posted several threads introducing and implementing the payment of cryptocurrencies in their respective businesses. The more people post about it, the more businesses would accept cryptocurrency as a mode of alternative payment.",

Yup, Bangalore is metropolitan and highest IT people live there and definitely the chai or tea is favourite drink in the region. Many people are going to notice that tag, they gonna approach him, ask him about it and get involved with it. I am pretty sure he will make it into local news paper real soon. Hope he gets his goals achieved to collect as much bitcoins as he could and wait for it to boom. The taxes would be nothing in the later part anyways.",

It is just amazing how crypto related ideas are being raised for awareness to those who are not knowledgeable into it yet.I have a similar thought to be honest! usually a cup of tea costs around 10 - 15 INR and I broke my calculator while calculating the value of it in bitcoin! I will have to spend more in fees fi I really want to transact there. So it's not really a feasible payment method for small payments. But the awareness is the key here. Bengaluru is the IT hub of India and majority of the population is educated and well to do in life. Such kind of open advertisement would probably make some people intrigued about bitcoin and they will probably enquire about it and do some research on it. OP, if you are nearby, can you ask that fellow how many payments he has received in bitcoin till date?",

Even the person who haven't heard of it will try to find the answer for what is crypto. India being a country with the biggest population can be a game changer if people start using it. For now it looks like there is slow progress, and the same can make the government understand the need of cryptocurrency against the inflated currencies.",
