  "content": "Source: https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/27/taiwan-crypto-regulation-gets-going-with-first-reading-of-digital-asset-bill/It seems that Taiwan is making moves already in accelerating their efforts towards regulating digital assets like cryptocurrencies. Because of the FTX collapse where the platform itself is popular to Taiwanese enthusiasts, it is one of the big reasons that the lawmakers needed to pass this Virtual Asset Management Ordinance Draft bill.As of this moment, it's on the first reading to the Legislative Yuan and probably there will be second and final reading before enacting it into law. In the proposed digital asset bill, it includes not restricting of professional investors to engage into trading, no strong position towards stablecoins or derivatives, locally licensed exchanges only requiring separation of business funds and customer assets, etc.What are your initial thoughts and insights about this latest development by the lawmakers in passing this digital asset bill? Are you in favor of it? Or is there some adjustments needed to be done in the bill before it finally passes into law? Would like to hear from you guys about this. Thanks!",

Giving exchanges or other crypto firms free hands to operate can have some undesirable consequences. However, the proposed laws seem flexible and will attract more investors to Taiwan. I am a supporter of Proof of Reserves for centralized platforms but the draft is silent on that which I find challenging. However, the draft law gives room for periodic audits and control of their accounts by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).",

Almost everyone in Asia is still in the infancy stage of adapting crypto, some of them are still in the gray area, some enacted some form or regulations but it is a work in progress. So this could be the case for Taiwan as well as they are trying not to be left out by some of it's neighbouring countries as far as crypto regulation and adoption goes.So it's good that at least they are going on the right direction as opposing it. And then are obviously different from Mainland China and they wanted to give freedom to it's people and not oppress them. Not sure though about the Proof of Reserves, I mean not every exchange are Safu, but if it is going to be local exchange yeah, I do agree that it should be enforce. But for exchanges like Binance and others, it's going to be hard to force them but we all know that as per CZ they are SAFU.",

There is no benefit from it.What is the benefit of putting $10 million into SAFU when the total customer deposits are in the billions?Therefore, central banks are almost the only ones able to guarantee this with commercial banks, and it is better not to leave your coin in CEXs account after completing trading.",
