  "content": "Somebody has got to talk about this.For the past few months, a particular kind of ad has been popping on my youtube streams. It looks crazy legit, but notto someone who comes from an image manipulation background and is up to date with the latest A.I. voice cloning anddeepfake technologies. On top of that I also have nearly 4 years as an investor / trader in the crypto industry, so I know a scam when I see one.And trust me people, this IS a scam.\"Just Scan the QR code and it will direct you to a link where you can send us your ADA /LINK / XRP to be elegible \" ? C'mon now.But something has got to be said about the level of sophistication in these scams.You can actually see Charles Hoskinson,Brad Garlinghouse and Sergey Nazarov speaking to the camera and moving their lipswhile sounding exactly like the people mentioned. The scripted announcement is also extremely professional ( and clearly A.I. scripted )and would have anyone believe this is 100% legit.So with a combination of Chat GPT scripting, voice cloning and Deepfake ( or similar ), these scoundrels are robbing unsuspectingnewbies of millions. A good example of A.I. becoming a force for evil, rather than good.",

Although bad intentions appear, it cannot be denied that they have great potential to be applied to life and beyond. But changing too quickly also becomes risky because of adaptation. I think that inherently, the cyber environment also reflects the similar nature of life, the balance of good/bad. So how we choose to approach and deal with that, as well as spreading positive messages, will bring balance back. There are things that I saw on YT a long time ago about how to use AI labeled with crypto to navigate FOMO, but in reality it is only a small part of other complex problems.",

Sometimes they just show a completely different video and put a overlay to a fake giveaway where people get double or x10 money for every amount they send.And the most compelling part is the number of subscribers they have, it seems like a real account to most. Youtube takes them down after some reports but still many people are falling for it.The only way to stop them is realizing that there's no giving money to get more money.",

If maybe it was a gift from a certain influencer I don't think it would give such requirements, but how could it be, that people who are fomo for this kind of gift will voluntarily do any kind of requirement, the thing that needs to be applied is literacy so that you can read the opportunities and consequences of problems like this kind of fraud. In my area there are also many things like this, but not altcoin projects but things like that with the same scheme.",

As you can see, those are why it's so effective because of the \"free\" part and not so much the effort to earn the wins. You must know why you are joining and know that it's legitimate to whom it is targeted. A lot of hackers would use famous people to get people hooked and the addition of AI is going to be another problem.",

YT and other platforms with video sharing should be quick to address this.I agree with you, every day on Twitter messages containing information about giveaways and airdrops are sent en masse. All this is confirmed by screenshots and “Musk personally”. But with video things are more complicated. As they say DYOR. I myself recently reacted in the Discord channel to a chat message about token claiming (because this event was officially supposed to happen) and went to the site where I connected my wallet. And only when the wallet asked me to authorize a transaction for the entire amount of USDT, I realized that I was very mistaken. I was lucky and there was no ETH on my wallet to pay for the fee",

Yeah, they'll receive nothing in return after sending this and that money to their scam address.I've seen one like with Elon Musk video and these scammers use it with their fake giveaway, what we can do is to report them to YouTube, report the video.",

Normally I'll easily fall for these scams when I see a person that is concerned with a perticular project talking about it and I'll tend to believe everything said by the person, this is why I'm very grateful for threads like this that enlightens an average person like me. Best thing to do is to keep ignoring them or like OP, inform others so they don't fall for these scams, lastly is to be very careful about promises of free rewards on the social media.",
