  "content": "SENTINEL BITCOIN Update/Transparency PostHello, this is an update post on the status of Sentinel Bitcoin. I originally posted these pieces for sale as a fully completed art piece/functioning wallet for a small amount to grow in over time if the buyer wished to do so. After the post it was clear that the market was for DIY due to the safety of key creation. Maybe being a little too anxious I had already fully assembled all the wallets before listing them for sale. After the feedback I had made the decision to try to convert them back to DIY. The problem with this was that the majority of the attempts resulted in a chunk of glass in one of the corners that is extremely difficult to remove without fully damaging the piece. All these pieces are now unusable unless I find a solution. (See example pictures below). I would love to continue making these and offer different designs as DIY pieces only but I am at a standstill with this set for now. I don't think it will be possible to convert this set back to DIY so I plan to continue selling them as the fully completed version. If successful I will move forward with DIY pieces only. If anyone is interested in a completed version please PM me. These were created with safety as a top priority using open source code and offline devices.If anyone has advice or suggestions on anything in this post please PM me.With all that being said, I do have two pieces that were successfully converted back to a DIY option. The pictures below are of the actual pieces. If anyone is interested in them please PM me. Each piece will come with a piece of glass for the back, a fresh hologram sticker, a COA, a bag, and upon request I can print a QR code sticker for a buyer supplied public address.",

I could explore that a bit more but was mainly concerned about discoloration in the metal due to the flame or heat.",

Yes, I do have some still available but only the fully completed version. All the DIY ones I had have been sold. I will update if we come to a solution and can offer more DIY.As far as the growth it seems you’ve been feeding it well    Good luck with large Iguanas!",
