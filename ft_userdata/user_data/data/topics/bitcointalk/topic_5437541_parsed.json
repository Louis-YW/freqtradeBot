Where banking education is giving to the scholars and liberal education is going to Europe. Nigerian education system is bad because the government is bad. The only time African leaders will realize themselves and restructure Africa is the only time they would decline world bank policies in the continent. Public and Private Partnership (PPP) is one of the policies that is killing African economy and this has made many governors to sacked their workers before they are trying to reduce the work force. UBA (Universal Basic Education) is one of the policies from World Bank. If a country want to develop then they should work on the Education system then other departments will be fine and okay. Asuu case can only be solved with and educated and committed leaders",

Nigeria educational system is fvcked up and this is not even a problem the government are looking into as they are the ones even making life unbearable for its citizens. Imagine you going for a four year course in school then you later finished up in 7year times due to delay and strikes taken by the educational bodies. Nigerian are excelling elsewhere in the world in every sector of life and this is very bad for the growth of the nation, imagine the world today, most top doctors and nurses are from Nigeria but have chosen to go elsewhere to practice their work due to the fucked up system they have in the country.",

May God help us in this country.So here's the catch, dem dey pay this people wey dey for the head so much that they can afford to send their children to school outside the country and not care if things are been done right over here. I think so reduction in what the heads if this unions earn will go a long way in combating this fight against how the education sector is been treated in the country.Make dem elect normal citizens like schools teacher dem and normal university lectures and not making the whole thing a ground for people to lobby their way in to the top so dem fit dey chop the money meant to better the educational sectors. Too much glorification is given to this offices and they're now like political officers.We get a very long way to go, and until this people holding this offices are been affected by the decisions they take then we never ready to move forward for this country. Make dem make am a must say before you take any educational position, your pikin has to be schooling in the country or you forget about that position. If this is implemented, then dem go dey truely fight for the students and not this lies they spread everytime.",

My question is, can the educational system still function very fine after we change governance or have good leaders?Most at times we tends to pour out everything to poor governance but deep insidely the students are also another major problems to be talking thereof. Why because we have lazy students who don't want to be useful to their lives rather wanting an easy way schooling without going through due process of academic. How can a class of 200 students only 100 active and yet missing 100 are found to be graduating with distinction and first class, even with upper credits while those who burn candles day and night reading manage to come out with 2nd class and Pass. Do we still blame government or bad leaders at this point?Please I would love some advance people to answer my question.",

If  eventually she presents herself for further questioning, she should not be penalized alone, her accomplice should also be penalized because they knew it was against their professional ethics as lecturers and therefore should have known what to do as lecturers but they went ahead to eat the meat without caution and the reasoning that it was their student they are messing themselves up with all in the name of grade and cash.",
