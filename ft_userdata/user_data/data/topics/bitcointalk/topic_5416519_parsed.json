  "content": "Ok...so every so often as we can see from this thread here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416349.0 new collectors or seasoned alike stop by and ask what is the safest or what is the way we seasoned collectors have generated our keys etc etc etc. SO I figure lets make a thread for anyone to share their way of doing it in the hope others learn a safe way on generating their keys.Â  Â Â  Â  Â   This is the Cypher Hodl way of doing it...Â  Â  Â   Air Gapped computerÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â Buy a new laptop...remove the wifi card...disable Bluetooth and any access to any internet connection.. ports.etc etc.etc... place on airplane mode.Â  Â  Â  Â Key GenerationÂ  Â  Â  Â  I use a Mycelium Entropy device for all of my items.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  https://mycelium.com/mycelium-entropy.htmlÂ  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â  If you cannot find one....and they are impossible to find...do the following...Â  Â  Â  Â  Use a Trezor. Reset the device....get a new seed created and use that to place under the Holo and use the corresponding public address for the loading part.Â  Â  Â  Â You can then reset and do as many times as needed to get as many new addresses as you want made.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â    PrinterÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â I bought a laserprinter to use for printing these keys and nothing else. DO NOT CONNECT THE WIFI..or even better a printer with no wifi.Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â PaperÂ  Â  Â I use Terra water proof paper for all my private keys and as you can see from this test I have three different products and so far all three have withstood the test of timeÂ  Â https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5296179.0Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Just keep in mind their are malware/virus/programs out there seeking our keys and seeds ready to swoop in and sweep your precious satoshi away Â  Â  Â Â  Â  I also recommend if you use any other device instead of just a qr code for priv key also print a second one with the alphanumeric key as well. Just my two Satoshi...that's what i always do anyway. Â  Â  Hope that helps.Â  Â I am sure their are other who have their way of doing things that kind post as well.Â  Â As for being a physical bitcoin maker...not only willÂ  you need to generate your keys the safeway you will also need to be your trust.....our hobby is all built on how trustworthy the physical bitcoin maker is at the end of the day. So that is also a very big factor in the equation.********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************Information threads made byKrogothManhattanà¸¿BitBillsPhysical Bitcoin CreedCrypto Stamp WebsiteBitcoin Postage StampsCypher Hodl-TIMELINEKrogothmanhattan crypto shopBeware of Fake Casascius coins All about Coldkey cardsStorage for your collectablesMTGox yubi and MTGox OTP cardKrogothmanhattan escrow serviceBreached and Scam coin makers listHelp me name my new custom Bitcoin painting Private issue custom made Coldkey krogoth cards Past Collectable Auction or selling prices with links Introducing CYPHER STAMPS by CYPHER POSTAGEMaster Store list of Collectables section sales threadsStamps go digital-Collectable Blockchain postage stamp Free Daily Raffle Rules and posting of received free coins Unique, Rare and All Crypto Collectable Posting Thread with LINKS How to Generate a signed BTC transaction using Electrum and TrezorOffline signing your paper wallet using air gapped phone via ElectrumWanted to share my latest comissioned artwork - BITBILLS ORAMAWanted to share my new artwork called SILK ROAD by SATSLIFEWanted to share my latest comissioned artwork - CYPHER SATOSHI Testing- Submersing paper wallets printed on water proof papersKROGOTH HOLOMATIC-New invention to place hologram with precisionCollecting Community input needed>> Definitions used in our unique hobby CYPHER HODL-Experimenting with ideas for different physical bitcoin designsÂ  Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯",

      "body": "Very nice write up krogoth!Personally, I would recommend the QT wallets over any physical device as nearly every coin out there has a QT wallet so this also reduces the cost and reduces the amount of devices you have to manage.Â  It can be a pita to update them, but I do so via throw away usb sticks that are fairly cheap.I second the paper as well Terraslate is great, I personally use Revlar which is waterproof, tear-proof, grease-resistant, washable / cleanable, fade-resistant and recyclable. And if you can find a printer that has no memory buffer or at least a buffer you can clear. And if you do get one with wifi/bluetooth, remove the modules (would do that on the airgapped system as well) - there are ways of connecting to them directly vs having them connect to something. Couple that with a memory store on the printer and the keys are at risk.All in all - you can be careful as you want and there is still always a risk.",

So I am not worried about any wifi network restart...thats why it has to be dedicated striclty for this without the thought of using it online down the lineÂ  Â Ans yes a ledger can be used the same way as a Trezor, I just love my Trezors and use them exclusively even though I do have ledgers which I keep as part of my Bitcoin collection only never to load in any way.",
