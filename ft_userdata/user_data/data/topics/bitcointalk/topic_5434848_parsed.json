I somewhat agree with it being a close game. If i'm putting money between the two i'd go for the Cowboys since they look better on paper but it's tough to bet against Brady and the Bucs as it's not easy to count them out no matter what.My only confident bet for this game is for Dak to throw an INT because throughout the season he usually gets at least one.",

They have a terrible O line, can't run the ball and their D is average at best. Tom Brady is having a bad season by his high standards. I think the Cowboys will win this comfortably.",

The O line is so bad and they can't run the ball to save their lives. Tom Brady is the undisputed GOAT but I hope this is his last season.

From an outsider's perspective, it seems Tom Brady hasn't performed well since his divorce around november 2022. It is possible Tom Brady made an agreement with his wife to retire from the game prior to the 2022 NFL season. An agreement which Tom Brady broke, resulting in his wife divorcing him. This might be seen in Brady officially announcing his retirement from the game. Having a stable relationship and family life can have a significant impact on the performance of athletes. There are many professional athletes who were never the same after a break up or divorce. At the moment, I'm wondering if Brady might be one of those whose NFL career will never recover.Jacksonville making it past round 1 was a surprise. They have had a losing record for most of the years I've followed NFL.I'm hoping Josh Allen and the bills make it to the superbowl. I like his style of leaving it all on the field.",

MVP's, All-Pro teams, SuperBowls, money, health etc. He also signed a $400M contract with Fox to be their commentator. He doesn't have the same passion and the GOAT should retire.",

I don't blame you for taking the eagles.  They are a machine this year.  They can easily just blow out the giants.  But giants played them to a 1 score loss with our 2nd team on the field when eagles needed to win.  Beating the same team 3 times in a season is always tough.  Hoping for a tight game in the end just don't want to see a boring blowout.  Giants already exceeded my expectations for the year.",
