  "content": "So I noticed the telegram channel linked in one of their help articles is now a totally different channel The article:Quote from: https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/4417087800340-What-do-I-do-if-I-run-into-an-issue-on-the-Blockchain-com-Exchange-... Follow us on social mediaWe update our social media with relevant news, outages, and known issues our users are experiencing. To stay up to date, follow us here:TwitterTelegram [https://www.t.me/bcpit]TwitterInstagramSeeing how the group has a different name, my guess is blockchain.com's channel was deleted and someone took over the vanity invite link?Which means the channel is completely useless and people are just prone to scams since I suspect someone will for sure impersonate blockchain.com in there.Heads up.",

If you take a look all of the social media handles they have mentioned in that article have \"pit\" word on the last part as well. That tg name is a legit college group from that schools, we have best link college here too. And i dont think that kind of group will give crypto related content to scam or whatever.Edit: i accessed the tg group and it looks like people there are those who have problem regarding their blockchain.com account, looks like someone will or already pretends to be a support there and scam them.Edit2: i reported this one im not hoping that sus link will be removed too soon since knowing what kind of support they have.",

      "body": "The article seems outdated too. According to the page source, it was last edited last year in March. Kinda weird they failed to change the links since they decided to move all exchange-related stuff to their @Blockchain handle as mentioned here[1]. Their old Instagram was also deleted, so they probably decided to delete the old handle except for Twitter but forgot to change it on the article, and now scammers are using them.

      "body": "This is a detail that not everyone will see. That school is a legit one and these scammers are using it so it's like two names, blockchain.com and that school that they're using. Although there's nearly 100 members in total for that group, that's still not a good sign as people who have experiencing problems with blockchain.com wallet are also going there asking for solutions that they can give. And that's where the problem is when these scammers will take advantage of these victims that just want some help for their wallet concerns, even if this wallet isn't recommended by most. Hopefully that it will be figured out and that article will change the link of their official telegram channel.",

What I consider frustrating is that the article was written a year ago and no one has noticed it!Unfortunately, comments are disabled there, otherwise am sure someone would have brought it to their attention.Not sure, but I believe it's an innocent mistake and there is no intention to scam. I might be wrong, though.",

I might be wrong, though. I agree but the thing about telegram is scammers just need to join/view the group channel to impersonate the support team and see if some gullible would bite. While blockchain.com takes their sweet time to edit links, hopefully, someone would see this thread and know joining the group chat is pretty much useless.",
