  "content": "Christian Lindner the former finance minister of Germany made a speech yesterday in Bundestag where he mentioned that the Government have missed out on all the economic opportunities Bitcoin offers. His statement made users on X to bounce on his opinion with lots of questions why he didn't give Bitcoin a shot during his tenure 3 years ago. Politicians don't seize to amuse me with the switch of statements when a new financial development arises about bitcoin. Is he making fun of himself by slamming Olaf Scholz the Chancellor of Germany, when he did nothing about investing in Bitcoin? Also he made no clarifications about his negligence on btc while on sit as the minister of finance. Politicians are begining to use btc for campaigns because of the funds top BTC firms send out to help them win election, even when they didn't show regard to btc when in power and during the grass root days. On the other hand, Germany indeed lost over $2.5billion in profit when they sold 50,000 bitcoins seized by the public prosecutor's office in Saxony when the price was at 53k.

And maybe it's their government's policy to sell or auction those seized Bitcoin just like what US did before.So just to be fair, it's not that a big deal for them or the Finance Minister as he is doing his job. And if I'm not mistaken, they sold the Bitcoin because they are required by law to sell all assets confiscated in a criminal trial.Although they could have waited, but we don't know what the future bring.",

An X user mentioned the community need no politicians interested in BTC. Personally I am with those who most definitely think that some of us actually give too much relevance to these politicians view on bitcoin, if you could remember most of these so called politicians who are forcing up a fight now for bitcoin where those who had worked for it to not succeed in the past why now? Because it gets them the attention of the growing numbers of investors? Even now ask them about the use case of bitcoin and most of them wouldn’t be able to give a single reason has to why they want it other than it grows in profits. There is no denying the fact that their involvement will most surely increase adoption rate but I sincerely do not want too much political involvement. As for the German lost on bitcoin I still tell people there is no reason to actually bash them for selling early because it was a confiscated asset and as far as I know they can’t be held for that long. More so not only them with bitcoin price heavily increasing and will continue to do so everyone who sold even at $200k will one day think they missed the top and should have held more longer",

I would not say Germany lost any profit on this because this Bitcoin was seized and the government doesn't invest a single money on this.  At the same time, I believe the fund collected was already used somewhere else that will benefit the country.Quote from: Accardo on December 17, 2024, 08:05:53 PMWhat do you think?I indeed think that it is funny why the former finance minister states that Germany had missed out on the opportunity Bitcoin offer when he was once have the power to do so.  I do not think this former finance minister have the right to say such regrettable speech blaming the one who is currently sitting on his former position.I also agree that BTC does not need the kind of politician who just do the talking and nothing of action.  Although their speech stirs up the market somehow, I believe Bitcoin is already doing fine without them on the scene.",

But in the case of Germany and Christian Lindner they lost a golden opportunity and might never regain it. There was criticism from many Bitcoiners about the decision of the State of Saxony to sell its confiscated Bitcoin worth about $3 billion when most people knew that they could have made more money within a few months. When relatively unknown countries like El Salvador and Bhutan were busy investing in Bitcoin, Christian Lindner as finance minister would have been advising Germany never to invest in such an asset. Now like puppets, most of these politicians are advocating for a Bitcoin reserve because one man talked about it. One will begin to wonder if the US is their puppet master. Bitcoin will still be what it is destined to be without hypocrites.",

      "body": "The part of his speech where he mentions Bitcoin was too short to really draw conclusions from. It's basically only a criticism of the German Parliament and the government regarding possible missed opportunities. He didn't mention, for example, the concept of a \"strategic reserve\", but instead hints to a \"crypto-friendly policy\".One can only speculate what he means. Germany seems to be relatively crypto-friendly in some aspects (e.g. that you don't pay taxes if you hodl Bitcoin and other cryptos [1] for more than one year). In the German subforum however one can read some complaints about the difficulty to get crypto exchange licenses in Germany and to generally start Bitcoin related businesses. This, however, is afaik now been harmonized with other EU countries due to the MiCa regulation.So due to the lack of detail, it's likely that Lindner's Bitcoin mention is simply part of the electoral campaign (\"he mentioned BTC!! he's pro crypto, so Bitcoiners should vote him!!\"). However this is not really surprising, other FDP members, above all Frank Schäffler, are pro-crypto since a decade already, and it's also not surprising for a classical liberal party. Lindner recently also has mentioned Javier Milei and Elon Musk as examples to follow, at least in some aspects. It's interesting that in the video you hear some other Parliament members shout something (seems to be criticism) but then also he gets some applause.[1] originally, there was a dispute if PoS currencies can also benefit from that rule, but it seems recently there is consensus among crypto accountants that they can.",

With DCA strategy, there is no pressure like buying now or you miss the great opportunity forever.I believe that they will look at some classic and biggest examples that are successful DCA strategy, Micro Strategy, El Salvador, Bhutan with first two are examples for DCA. Bhutan collect bitcoin mainly from Bitcoin mining and every country can allocate their national energy for Bitcoin mining if they want. Nothing is harmful for their nations if they use renewable energy for Bitcoin mining and try to deploy zero-net emission for their Bitcoin mining farms.Debunking the \"Bitcoin is an environmental disaster\" argument",
