In fact, these advanced applications are helping users in their investments and daily purposes with extensive use of crypto and NFTs.

      "body": "What I am worried about is: DAO will push the overall Altcoins industry into centralization, it would mean that one industry might be in the control of loads of Altcoins and can influence the market, for example look at Elon Musk, what he was doing with the Dogecoins as well but it would be much bigger, but then again we do need something to represent cryptocurrencies so that the law system is unbiased. But as long as it's Unbiased it can help so many people to find better options and not get conned as well, since I have seen people buy weird NFT's off the internet and then regretting it. I think I am still 50-50 about this project, they can definitely be helpful but they can also move towards biases in the industry.",
