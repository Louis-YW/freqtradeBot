  "content": "Introduction\"Empowering the Future of Transactions and Communication\"We're thrilled to unveil a new and exciting coin in our community: Reaction Coin! Reaction (RTC) is an innovative cryptocurrency designed to capture the diverse reactions of the world to various events, while simultaneously serving as a powerful example of how a chain reaction can unfold in the cryptocurrency market. RTC not only stands for \"Reaction,\" but also for \"Revolutionizing Token Currency,\" as it represents a revolutionary approach to how a simple idea can evolve into a significant success within the cryptocurrency universe.First, FAIR LAUNCH FOR ALL!STEP 1: Mining to block 720 with reward 4 to strengthen the network.STEP 2: From block 721 the reward is 5000.STEP 3: Launching Smartnodes.EXCHANGEShttps://safe.trade/trading/rtcusdthttps://nonkyc.io/market/RTC_USDThttps://financex.trade/trading/rtcusdthttps://xeggex.com/market/RTC_USDTAGGREGATORShttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/reactionhttps://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/Reaction-_____RTChttps://miningpoolstats.stream/reactionhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465993.0https://coincodex.com/crypto/reaction/https://coinpaprika.com/coin/rtc-reaction/https://coincheckup.com/coins/reaction/https://dropstab.com/coins/reactionhttps://coincost.net/en/currency/reactionhttps://beincrypto.com/price/reaction/https://coindataflow.com/en/currency/reactionhttps://coinmonitor.nl/currency/reactionhttps://coinstats.app/en/coins/reactionhttps://coindar.org/en/coin/reactionPoolshttps://miningpoolstats.stream/reactionhttps://pool.rplant.xyz/http://zergpool.com/https://zpool.ca/SOCIALTwitter: https://twitter.com/Reaction_coreDiscord: https://discord.gg/UTpJgqPNJdGithub: https://github.com/ReactionChainTelegram: https://t.me/reaction_coreBLOCKCHAINName: ReactionSymbol: RTCLogo: https://i.postimg.cc/50gW8Tdp/rtc.pngMAX SUPPLY21 BillionExplorer: https://explorer.reaction.network/Website: https://reaction.network/MINING & DISTRIBUTIONA secure anti ASIC/FPGA PoW Cryptocurreny building for Asset creation, Futures, and Smart Contract, while remaining Resistant to 51%/Double Spend AttacksCPU mining, no ICO, no pre-mineBlock Reward: 5000Algorithm: Ghostrider by Raptoreum Team.Blocktime: 120 secondshttps://reaction.network/img/image2.pngCORE CONCEPTThe idea behind Reaction (RTC) is to leverage the way people, markets, and news react to specific events to enhance the value of the cryptocurrency.RTC acts as a digital representation of real-world reactions, whether they stem from political events, technological breakthroughs, or cultural trends. This concept is not only understood as a theoretical concept, but also as a functional element integrated into the RTC blockchain.VISION / GOALThe Vision: Reaction (RTC) aspires to be more than just a cryptocurrency; it aims to be a vibrant platform for the exchange of thoughts, ideas, and reactions to global events.By acting as a conduit for the world's reactions, RTC establishes a novel connection between the digital and real worlds. Reaction's vision is to unite a broad community of individuals actively shaping and developing the cryptocurrency, thereby initiating a sustainable and dynamic chain reaction of progress.Of course, everyone wants to be one of the great ones, but our personal goal is the ReactionChain reward system. We want to react to the worldwide events and actively take action with our ReactionChain. How do we want to organize this? With the help of artificial intelligence, mathematical formulas & you as a community!It remains to vote whether we use an entire pool (public) to send partial amounts to these wallets also automatically based on a scale.Scale in the sense of severity & personal assessment, as well as assessment of future rules not yet defined. https://reaction.network/img/image4.pngUPDATESThe main net will launch August 31, 2023Aug 09, 2023 : Genesis Block DateAug 31, 2023 : Release of Landing Page: https://reaction.network/Aug 31, 2023 : Release of Explorer: https://explorer.reaction.network/Aug 31, 2023 : Release of Pool: https://pool.reaction.network/Aug 31, 2023 : Reaction Core First release of Mainnet - version 1.1.15.0 https://github.com/ReactionChain/ReactionCore/releasesSep 07, 2023 : Listed on Rplan, cojin, cminer and many other.Sep 07, 2023 : Adding more trustable Nodes Sep 07, 2023 : Updating Website and ExplorerSep 08, 2023 : Listed on safe.tradeSep 08, 2023 : Listed on miningpoolstats",

After all, RTC is not some kind of shitcoin, but an innovative, necessary, cool, super-wow coin. This is such a super-wow coin (nope) that the creator skimp on the server and therefore failed to launch his pool.By the way, leave the idea with your pool. Rplant has listed the coin and now no one needs your pool.",

How is this a fair launch?Pardon, the first 720 Blocks gives a reward of 4.In the test time, our Clients has mined exactly 200 blocks to strenghten the network, too. 200 * 4, are 800 RTC.After Block 720 the reward is 5000 RTC. We've got 16% of only one block for ourselfe. I think this is fair enough.the initial coins are not that much. but as a new alt, it is too difficult to survive in this market. what do you think will give you solid back-up why your project will survive in the trading market? without massive use case, the existence of any alt is endanger.",
