  "content": "We as a community are aware & frustrated with the way Banks conduct business. But, what makes them so worst is listed below in these 5 points. As a community member, you might relate to it and would be frustrated about it, since I am from the day I opened my account with them. BTW, We cannot tolerate them but we still need them as they control all necessities to make us happy.1. They think they are SuperiorThis is quite common that their staff treat us as shit most of the time. As most of them think we are poor and are asking for some money to lend us. No matter what we are looking for as everything depends on our account number.2. Bank HolidaysThe network is so glitched or congested that we cannot ask for the money we were expecting to be in our account and the same happens when someone requested money from us. Furthermore, it takes 3 days or some time more to get your own money.3. Charges or FeesThe amount of charges these banks apply for a simple transaction, issuing a debit/ credit card, deposit fee, and more is unsubstantial. I mean who would think a fee of $10 when you transfer $200( I just quoted an example)?4. HolidaysJust imagine you are in a medical situation and you want a family member to transfer some money ( as you do not have any other option) but since it is a bank holiday, the money gets stuck within the network for 3 to 7 days resulting in delays and escalated bills.5. Government ControlCurrency devaluation has been occurring since the COVID-19 pandemic in most countries. Just imagine you went on your holiday and suddenly your budget increased due to devaluation. The booking amount is now less than what you booked for and the holiday packer is asking for more. I do not think it happens but what about food prices getting higher than expected and it destroys your calculated monthly/weekly expenditureI hope you realize the benefits that Bitcoin can give you in such a scenario. Although LN is still in the early stages it can seriously disrupt banking infrastructure.",

I have know idea how it happens but sometimes I think the bank did it. lol! I am sure many here would agree! but how many of you think in the same manner? just quote and reply if you agree!",

But, what makes them so worst is listed below in these 5 points. Actually, 3 of them are flawed since they depend on where you live.Interbank transfers here are instant during the weekdays and take 6 hours till clearing during the weekend, I have no card fees, no ATM withdrawals fees, and no fees for sending money to another national bank, all I pay is 1E a month for a few more features in the app (like sms alerts on top of push notifications), it used to be 2E for just the app now the basic version is free with the account as long as you wire your wage to it.For the \"superiority,\"  that's not the bank's fault, it's not the bank who is talking to you like that, it's the people,  and do please tell me if your childhood friend will go work in a bank and you arrive at the desk, who's fault would be if he treats you like garbage? The bank? Do you have friends that now work in banks? Are they all like that?You actually missed the most important thing of all, the worst thing about banks is that aside the state insurance fund you have no guarantee you could access those funds at all, also fact that they can freeze your account, they can restrict it, and can even have clerks stealing from your account by falsifying your documents.In my opinion, those are far worse than the attitude of a customer service person.",

They think they are SuperiorPeople have already become used to culture of banking and it now looks like something that society cannot function without. The banks know that people consider them very important, so there will be tendency to let it get to their head. When banks become replaced and begin to go out of fashion and use, these banks will become more humble and polite in their dealings.Quote from: elevates on January 28, 2023, 02:59:10 PM3. Charges or FeesThis is a reason I agree with, bank charges are annoying, the annoying thing is that even if you do not make a transaction, money will still be deducted from your account for charges.",

They are trained to be polite while talking to a customer, they don't look down on any customer, they are trained and retrained on customer care services.2 charges or feeI'm not really standing brief for any bank, but one thing I want you to understand is that, the bank is a financial institution, they make their money through charges on deposit, withdrawal and loans facilities they give out to customers, they don't have an exceptional source of income.",

Although LN is still in the early stages it can seriously disrupt banking infrastructure.As I understand it, you are new to the crypto community and therefore your comparison of bitcoin with traditional banks is not entirely correct. It all depends on which bank you use. I have not encountered such restrictions, using the mobile application I do not have to contact bank employees directly and gives me the opportunity to use it seven days a week at any time convenient for me. As for bitcoin, there is no such opportunity in my country to buy the goods and services I need using BTC.",

And for most people that problem is not big enough to convince them to switch to Bitcoin with all its inconveniences.  Yes, I would agree to that. Despite of the negative impressions we had on banks, I cannot say that they’re all totally sucks. At least, in some banks here, they offer good customer services which will make the customers keep coming back. But when it comes to being centralized, that thing alone always discourage me from trusting banks. The fact they will always rely in the government as banks are government controlled, so there are high possibility that all our transactions too are monitored by the government, and whatever we do against them, we can always be traceable. That’s the biggest reason why I start loving the idea of bitcoin and hate banks instead.",
