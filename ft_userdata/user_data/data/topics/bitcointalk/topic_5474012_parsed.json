  "content": "https://currentaffairs.adda247.com/boycott-israel-products-list-2023/There are many organizations and people in Asia are boycotting Israel's product because they're stand with Palestine. But I see it's really wrong because they mixed up both Western brands and Israel brands as they boycotting brands like: McDonald, Fanta, Garnier, Nestea, Starbucks etc. I'm not sure what's their reason to do that, but I take McDonald as the example, they boycotting McDonald because McDonald's franchise in Israel is supporting Israel.https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/mcdonalds-owners-fight-over-support-for-israel/ar-AA1jgQREThey forget if it's a franchise, it's not the McDonald's headquarter is supporting Israel. The franchise in other country has no relation with Israel, yet people boycott them. This can give effect to their own economy because the franchise will not make money to pay the employees, resulting salary cut or get fired, unemployment rate will increase.AFAIK there's only one brand, that clearly supporting Israel, after all it's your choice to boycott them or not.It's really not make sense to boycott franchise's product, if you want to boycott Israel's product, here are their brands https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Israeli_brandsIf you want to support Palestine, find the trusted charity in your respective country and make a donation on there. Think smarter, don't ruin the economy in your country because of sUppOrTInG PaLEStinE by doing that.",

Also, there's nothing wrong with mistakenly boycotting a company, that just makes them speak on the issue so the boycotts will stop, if McDonald's want to stop the boycotts, they just got to take sides.Quote from: NotATether on November 14, 2023, 07:35:52 AMLOL.

It is dangerous when people get into a boycott culture without doing research. Almost all western companies are multinational corporations and they usually work with local producers.The important point here is that societies that are dependent on western products do not realize that they are actually negatively affecting their own economic situation while boycotting. For those living in countries that do not have a production-based economy and are import substituting, boycotting has negative consequences. Boycotting is about raising awareness, but the economic situation of the country should be taken into account when deciding to boycott.",

But in general the boycotting is also happening in my country, and this boycott push McD Indonesia to send aids to Palestine. The people here is also divided between the ones who understand the concept franchising and the other who doesn't just like OP said.Tho in my opinion, on the other side this is a good time for a local brand to raise and proof that they can be an alternative for those big brands.",

I personally may not have participated in boycotts or anything like this. but here too many people have carried out the boycott. And I think everyone is free to make a choice. So being on any side is every individual's right.Initially, this boycott was not widely discussed. But in the last week it seems that this boycott has become more serious. So when I see a product at the Super Market, it usually always has a lot of interest. It turns out that a few days ago I saw that this product was rarely interested in it. There are even several shops that have also stopped providing the boycotted products. At first I thought this only happened in the country where I work. But i thought is happen too in another country. What is certain is that I also hope that peace can return and the war can end as soon as possible.",

This will cause a huge impact on the economy of the country and these businesses will have no other choice but to move elsewhere but do you think the Israeli government will be bothered about it? Don't you think they may have prepared for such an impact because if we should take an example from Russia, I'm certain they would have thought of a better way to avoid these situation in the first place.Because of this war, more companies are being targeted and I read somewhere that Netflix is being pressured as a result. The US have also being criticized over the issue of encouraging boycott during Russia's invasion but are not doing same with Israel. I just feel that the more American companies are being boycotted, it will send a message to what is happening in Israel.",

Boycotting the producers should help prevent them from contributing more problems to the conflict.

Maybe \"brotherly nations\" will help them, with money, housing, jobs... ? ? Like Israel helped by giving more than 150,000 jobs to the people of Gaza. By the way, since November 1947 Palestine had the same chances for development as Israel. But then Egypt, Syria and Jordan ... seized the land of Palestine and did nothing.  Nothing good. Why didn't they help, build houses, water supply, factories and plants? And why seize it? Calling not to buy Israeli goods, let's also remember how neighboring Arab countries have been categorically refusing to accept refugees from Gaza for many years. Can you tell me why? I'll give you a hint. Jordan, 1970. And of course, let's not buy Israeli goods, because when Hamas leaders were asked whether you want to help the population of the Gaza Strip with money, food, medicine, the answer was very simple - it's their problem, and we are at war with Israel.So boycotting Israeli brands will definitely help the Palestinian people?",

Because this is an opportunity for local products to compete. Incidentally, in my country there are many local products that cannot compete with Israeli products. With the presence of Baikot actions like this, many MSMEs are taking advantage of this momentum to work hard productively with products native to their own country with innovation and creativity.

From a health perspective, it would be better if there were no fast food chains or carbonated drinks, so if someone in support of the civilians in Palestine stops buying such food and drinks, it will do good for their health. In addition, the people who work as ordinary workers in all these companies are certainly not happy with their jobs and their salaries. My personal position is that I will never support anyone who kills civilians in such a reckless and barbaric way, whether it is Hamas, Israel or Russia - a crime is a crime and there is no need to look for justifications for why someone did it.",

This is very much unfortunate but looking at Israel's mood, it's not going to stop anytime soon. If Iran tries to become the big daddy of the Middle East, they will be screwed by US. Such kind of product boycott will keep on happening. But the majority of the world stands with Israel. So I do not see a big impact here.

Plus, if it is peoples own money, as long as they do not disturb others, they can boycott and not purchase from those places. In my nation there are tons of boycotts too, and if you do not want to buy from certain company, you are free to do that, in Turkey most of these companies are owned by Qatar, not Israel, but the headquarters still send money to Israel so boycotting makes sense. Do not bother others who does use it, that's all I ask, if you do not want to purchase there, then that's fine, but let the ones who want to still continue purchasing do that, unfortunately there has been some distasteful boycott scenes where boycotters ended up trashing peoples purchases, that's evil, don't do that, but if you do not want to purchase, its your own money, you can decide who to buy from and who to not buy from, its your own decision.",
