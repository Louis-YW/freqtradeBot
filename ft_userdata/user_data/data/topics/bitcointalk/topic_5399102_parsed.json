  "content": "Hopefully this is the correct way to get an answer. I’m mining XMR at Mining Pool Hub Pool, and I have no complaints what so ever, actually not even much of a question. But I have my payment threshold to payout around 0.0525 but after 3 days of mining the XMR Payout Estimate never goes over 0.00019000, then it actually goes down to the .00018s, then goes back up to the 00019s then back down. I was just wondering why that is? I’ve mined XMR several times in the past and never had this issue and I was perhaps just wondering if it was something maybe someone else might be noticing to?Anyway, that’s my only questionThanks!",

      "body": "it's a good idea to ask the room that discusses all about mining, hopefully they have the right answer for you, if you write here, it's not unanswered, sometimes only a small part knows about mining and other things about mining, but if there all will know your problem, if you look for data about you in other places, I think, even if there is an answer, it is not correct, in my personal opinion, experience is better than theory, once again I say on the mining board for sure you have the solution, here is the link:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=160.0",
