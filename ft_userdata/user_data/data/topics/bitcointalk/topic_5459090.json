Perhaps you could invest it in some familiar project or investment. It mustn’t be crypto or crypto related but should you be needing a crypto investment, you could as well buy bitcoin and hodl.

Both of your option is not actually good, its your own money your risking so it should be your own decision wether you make a call in Bitcoin. You wouldn't gain anything from the two, you'll have to invest at yourself first by studying and gaining knowledge then you could start by small amount first so you can slowly be familiar on the system in the Bitcoin. Trust me relying into someone or bot is not a good idea. Just do your own research, and don't invest money that you can't afford to lose.",

But you are very lucky to have $4k for initial investment and you are in the right market moment to believe in bitcoin investment for long term. IMOI recommend that you learn the basics of investing in crypto assets before planning to use the funds for long-term trading or investing. So, don't rush to choose a bot or copy trading if you don't have market analysis skills because you will make the wrong decision regarding your investment. Remember that Copy trading or bot providers do not risk your losses.",

There are so many scam accounts and fake traders who claim to be successful from crypto trading, they guarantee their trading bot is 100% efficient and has no risk, which is false btw. Why entrust your money to someone else to trade for you, you could learn how to trade from a professional with the money you’re about to spend on a bot. Have you considered simply hodling your 4k bitcoins? It’s a much safer and better option than what you have in mind. This strategy will not work if you’re looking for something more fast paced and quick results. Bad idea to reveal such information, you will be fine as there is no connection with your identity to your forum account but expect scammers to slide in your dms with investment opportunities.",

When using a bot for trading offers automation and the potential for more precise execution of trades, these bots can be programmed with specific strategies and algorithms to make decisions based on market conditions.  This option is suitable if you have deep knowledge and skills in trading strategies and want to maintain more control over your investments. But, there's a big but that I mentioned ahead, it requires technical knowledge to set up and monitor the bot effectively.If you're new to crypto and have zero knowledge, I would prefer to hold your Bitcoin as your investment for a long period of time.
