I also tried it on several browsers and it was working fine. You might add a statement somewhere that says ...\" Site is working the best with XXX browser\" after you tested it.",

When we click on \"Search your coin\" text box, it should allow us to write in the same text box. It looks strange that a new text box of white color pops up above it, as shown in below screenshot.Anyways overall your site has a good use case as now we can automatically calculate the market cap and do not have to do it manually. I will surely bookmark this site.",

But the point is when I click on news/articles that are in that section it doesn't give results like the news in the news board above.I don't know why this happened, either maybe my device has a problem or maybe there are some things that need to be fixed on the web that you created.",

If I already bought the coin would this help?I also think giving a marketcap number in a vacuum is not a good idea, especially if there is no clear distinction between fully diluted marketcap or just the latest token/coin in circulation marketcap. It also assumes that there are no other metrics to determine or show how far a coin needs to reach that marketcap. For example, if a coin currently has a billion marketcap but a very low trading volume, it might take a shorter/longer time to reach the specific marketcap depending on the circumstances.That being said, if a user knows how to interpret the data, I can still see the website being used as an instant calculator as long as they regularly update the data feed. Other indicators that OP can add are probably trading volume, market depth, buy/sell pressure, and so on. I believe if OP adds that, the site will see more visits since it is kinda unique as a trading helper.",

The contact tab says to get in touch with you if I have any inquiries, but how when there is no email address or contact form?- I noticed that you have some news articles at the bottom of the page. It would be a good idea to also add a tab or a button at the top that takes you directly to the news section.- A useful feature would be to show the users who searched for certain coins news articles specifically concerning those assets. So if I performed a search on Monero, for example, I could see recent news about it.",

Yes that's right, that's what I meant, just giving numbers will not help traders if there are no other helpful data like you mentioned \"Trading Volume, Market Depth and Buy/Sell Pressure\".Traders need more information so that they can make the right decision (sell/buy/hold).So I support your suggestion to add this data to the site because it will give it more value and be really helpful.",

We've made searching easier, added a blog, more news articles, a crypto growth calculator and even a crypto game. Still looking for more input on updates we can do and add more features. Please take a look and let me know what",
