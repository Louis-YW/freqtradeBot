      "body": "Elon Musk allowed Tesla payment with bitcoin. Later he said rubbish, discontinue bitcoin as one of the Tesla payment option. Later he said he will only accept the coin that uses 1% of bitcoin energy. Later he accepted doge which was what we thought about. Elon Musk manipulation in the past can make people to link him to what that draged bitcoin downside.As for me, I have been predicting that bitcoin price may fall, we posted about it on the speculation board. $30000 has been the resistance and the market was very less volatile. After long less volatility, the market will later become more volatile in one direction. Bitcoin was going down to $29000, $28500. That was when we expected more volatility, but bitcoin went up instead and $30000 was the support again. It decreased back to $29400. Very boring market. As it decreased below $28500 again, people should guess that bitcoin price may fall. $26000 was predicted to be the resistance but if bitcoin go down to $23000/24000 and stay there for like three days, the price may fall to or below $20000.They were just speculations from analyses and it happened. There are a lot of things that may cause the fall, it is indicating already that such a thing may happen. I will not link this to Elon Musk, but kind of linking to it which may not be 100% but you what some holders and traders can do when the heard that people like Elon Mush sold huge amount of bitcoin. They will sell and the price will fall.I do not care about if Elon Musk did anything, but I know that as bitcoin fall in price, I have more bitcoin to buy with the same amount of fiat that I can use to buy at higher price. What a greater opportunity.",

      "body": "Hmm, I do agree that the initial fabricated news and the Dip were quite expected by some of the factors that increased the total impact of the crash, after Ellon Musk's fabricated news I did find another reason for the market crash which I found quite unrelatable but after reviewing their impact on the crypto market time I did realized it also can be a reason Ever-Grande. Also, a point to be considered here is that we ignored in the initial stage that as Spacex news spread after the crash, not this news caused the panic market well, whatever it was it seems like this caused as much damage as the FTX crisis in the market. There were other reasons as well which can say and consider but the event passed now what to get from it. Except for Ellon Musk was not responsible haha. In WO or somewhere I think I had already read that at the time when everyone was blaming the SpaceX someone said it's not him.Rest the case  and Buy some in cheap and enjoy.",

Right???  I mean it was a combo of things. The price did drop from like $27k to $25k or something right after the market found out Musk dumped all of SpaceX's bitcoin. But of course it had already dropped from $29k to $27k leading up to that. It was a combo or negative real estate / interest rate news (not bad for bitcoin but just bad for global economy), liquidations, and SpaceX, and Coinbase futures also got accepted and I wouldn't be surprised if people sold on that news as well as futures generally are looked at as a negative thing since it just allows more shorting of the market and no upside (no actual buying of bitcoin). All this stuff happened at once basically. But yeah, SpaceX news definitely dropped the market a good bit on its own cuz that's exactly when the crash to $25k happened, but it was multiple things all happening within 24 hours or so that caused the several thousand dollar drop.",

Instead, we all know the markets were in less volatility which you are calling flat and illiquid too but in such conditions a piece of bad news and some influence must have triggered the dominoes effect but much good news came up why that news did not put the positive trend in the BTC price while the unofficial selling of BTC by SpaceX triggered this Flat and Illiquid state of Market which influenced BTC price to make high volatility outcomes. The point is, if the Devaluation of the Chinese Yuan, High Yield Bonds, High-Interest rates are just minor factors then something must have triggered the domino effect for the flat market.",

But never!!!! past history is reproduced in the future accurately, none of those TA have in them anything like- CB interest rates charge (future and past)- bonds interest- inflation- positive or negative laws being enactedYou can't just look at charts and say tomorrow will be like this because MACD or RSI when tomorrow the FED might slap you with a 100-point interest rise that will turn everything upside down. Charts are great when you have zero events in the past and zero events waiting for in the future and everyone is doing exactly as predicted and no one is missing any budget or profit or revenue. But no chart can predict or take into account an invasion of Taiwan or CZ dying in a hotel with all the cold wallet keys hidden somewhere nobody knows where.So in short, no!
