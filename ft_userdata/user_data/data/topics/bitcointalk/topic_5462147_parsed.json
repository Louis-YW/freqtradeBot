So if they understand fiat money is nothing but a paper created by banks and which has unlimited supply.Then you can explain the concept of decentralization which is about resistance to censorship and eliminate the intermediaries like banking institutions and finally we have full access to our money so we can spent as how we want to. And if still they don't think decentralization is not for them then its safe to say they won't hear anything further whether its blockchain, transparency, trustless monetary system, irreversible transactions...",

Is it right to say that if anyone doesn't like decentralization they can never like Bitcoin? With today's pragmatic life, money is always a top priority. Even if we invest in bitcoin and what we care most about is the profit it brings. So in my opinion, it is not wise to emphasize decentralization for people when recommending bitcoin to them. Just like when you sell to others, do you sell what you have or do you sell what they need? They need money, and you introduce decentralization to them, they will ignore you is understandable.Decentralization, privacy...all for nothing if you don't have money. Only people who already have a lot of money they care about those things to protect their assets. But for those who have no money, privacy for what?",

What we are curious is that how bitcoin can make us money or even rich. Because that's the first thing that we will hear in youtube and facebook and other social media.

Those who don't care about privacy or what it means to use digital, central-bank controlled money, will not care to hear about the alternative solutions available. Maybe, some do care about privacy or sovereignty over their money, but think that Bitcoin is a speculative asset and the risk it poses to their capital in the short term is something that stops them from trying it as a solution. Some will take the Bitcoin route to achieve these goals, or they will shy away from the opportunity. Decentralization might interest those who are interested in Bitcoin already, though otherwise, creature-comfort will cause most people to stick with how their life is at the moment, fearful of the risk involved with an alternative way. Even if you reason the risk vs. reward to them, it will not matter. This is the result of such a long time of using a scam money system, and unfortunately they will be victims if anything seriously wrong were to happen with fiat money.",

Itâs their loss so let them be for now I believe in future they will regret why they didnât join the train earlier.
