I couldn't find any in my records.To quote myself:Quote from: LoyceV on January 25, 2019, 10:12:36 PMThe format doesn't make it easy to copy someone else's complete Trust list. This is intentional.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on April 15, 2023, 05:29:18 AMAs for the reason for asking, is because trust list for some board, for example, Collectibles board members gives more accurate results than default trust list or my customized trust because they deal with these members, and therefore their feedbacks in that board should be more useful even if they are not DT1/2 members.I thing many users of the Collectibles board use the Trust system incorrectly. They leave feedback and include people based on transactions that didn't involve any risk and couldn't have resulted in them getting scammed.But by all means, if you thing someone leaves good feedback, just include them on your Trust list. You may want to read my Beginners guide to correct use of the Trust system before doing so.",

Trust list is meant to be left to someone whose judgment you trusted. If user A has a positive experience dealing with B, C, and D, they should leave each other a positive feedback instead of put each other on their trust list. If user A has a good record on pointing out that user E and F is a scammer, user G is to be trusted, or user H is one of the best escrow, then you put user A on your trust list.Back to your case, as what you're looking for is actually the \"positive feedback\", then the method needed to know how trustworthy someone you're about to deal with is, is already catered by the forum. The \"show ratings\" button below \"these ratings are from people who are not in your trust network. They may be totally inaccurate\" will show you feedback given by any members to the said user regardless of their DT status",
