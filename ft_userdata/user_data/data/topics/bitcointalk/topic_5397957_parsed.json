It looks more like a message app using PGP to encrypt communication.",

      "body": "If you're looking for software to manage GPG on Android, i only could recommend OpenKeychain[1]. Another option for Android is either no longer maintenance (such as GnuPG[2]), not popular enough (such as KeyManager[3]) or only meant for email encryption[4]. But as @pooya87 said, you'll need to download and install APK manually from Electrum official website rather than install from play store to perform verification.[1] https://www.openkeychain.org/[2] https://guardianproject.info/archive/gnupg/[3] https://github.com/Yash-Garg/KeyManager[4] https://pep.software/android/",

We regularly see people losing all their coins because they've downloaded a fake wallet from some app store which is disguised to look like the genuine article.

It's not worth their time. >99% of users do not even know what verifying is, let alone have the desire to do it, and the ones who are interested in doing it can do it trivially be other means. Further, a good proportion of people who are verifying software probably wouldn't want to download it from the app store anyway, along with whatever trackers or other trash they bundle in to your download.Given that Google can't even spend 30 seconds to remove obvious and provably scams from their app store or their search results, no way they care enough about protecting their users' security to implement something like this. I also wouldn't trust any signature that Google shows me - given how trivial it is to get them accept actual malware on to their platforms, I'm sure it would be equally trivial to get them to accept the wrong PGP key as belonging to one of the devs. So anyone who doesn't really understand what they are doing and just verifies the signature Google shows them against the key Google provides would achieve very little.",

      "body": "I was asked to respond to another thread about checking the PGP signature on Android, but a lot has been said here so far, so I'll just add my opinion.Unfortunately, I don't think there is a secure way of verifying PGP signatures on an Android.I checked the OpenPGP site for Android apps, and only found email encryption clients.  A quick glance at the GnuPG downloads page does list an Android package that was developed by the Guardian Project.  If you follow that link you'll be directed to a page indicating the project is no longer supported, and directing you to the OpenKeychain project.At first glance the OpneKeychain project looks promising; lots of downloads and decent reviews, but the only way I've found to get the software is from google's app store or an alternate app store.  It is open-source, so I can download the source code from from github, and build my own .apk after verifying it as safe (assuming I know how to do that.)  But I have not found a developer provided, gpg signed .apk binary.  Strange.Then while reading OpneKeychain FAQs something caught my eye; they recommend sharing your secret keys between devices by transferring them via cloud services.  Okay, it's an encrypted backup, but come on, what's wrong with a USB cable?  Maybe it's just me, I do have trust issues.  Including issues trusting app stores for reasons already discussed, and so it should be obvious I'm not alone.  The reason we're all here is to keep ourselves as safe and secure as possible.  More links added to the chain of trust only contribute to additional risk.  So I think I'll stick to side-loading the Electrum .apk after verifying it on a PC with a trusted PGP client.  But don't get me wrong, I'm not always a security Nazi.  I've been known to use the google app store to load electrum, but only after verifying the .apk file found the release directory, following the link from the Electrum's downloads page to the google play store.  There are obvious risks to this method, but everybody needs to assess their own risks accordingly.  I've often said about (hot) mobile wallets that they should never contain more money than your fiat/cash wallet.  I understand that many people don't have PCs these days, and can only access their bitcoin on a phone; to those people I suggest you invest in a hardware wallet that works with your phone.  Consider it a very affordable insurance policy.",
