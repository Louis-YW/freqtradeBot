  "content": "Maya is a decentralized way to move native assets, but not only that, It has a really revolutionary model for liquidity nodes and liquidity providers, based on the classic pure bond model implemented by projects like THORchain, creating a more capital efficient platform without compromising security.I'm keeping my eye out for Maya since there are no complex IDOs, Maya will launch with its own Liquidity Auction model, planning for a fair launch.Maya’s liquidity nodes are something i'm really excited for as a liquidity provider, and  their twist to the pure bond model have me getting my hopes up for the project.Any thoughts?",
