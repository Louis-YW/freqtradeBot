  "content": "A few hours ago I transferred a small amount of btc from my Jaxx Liberty wallet (source) to my Exodus wallet (target). The Jaxx wallet still says 'pending' but the funds arrived in my Exodus wallet only a few minutes after I sent them. Can I assume the funds are safely in my Exodus wallet? Any way to check that the funds are safely in my Exodus wallet?Let me know if you need any other details. Thx.",

That's probably why your Jaxx wallet is still showing pending.You should check the TXID in a block explorer to see if the transaction has been confirmed or not. If it is, then you're good, you should be able to spend these funds.",

If unconfirmed, still do not accept the transaction until it is confirmed. Or use blockchain explorer to check the transaction using its txid to know if it is already confirmed or not.If the transaction is anonymous or you are maintaining privacy, you can use Tor with the blockchain explorer.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on January 12, 2023, 03:55:55 PMSome wallets require a certain number of confirmations before marking the transaction as \"complete\".

Maybe Exodus works like Electrum in a way that unconfirmed transactions appear on balance even if the transaction if not yet confirmed.",

Maybe Exodus works like Electrum in a way that unconfirmed transactions appear on balance even if the transaction if not yet confirmed. To expand on what OmegaStarScream said, this is how it works on Ledger:- When you send/receive bitcoin, the status you see in the client is pending and unconfirmed.- When the transaction gets it's first confirmation, Ledger doesn't change the status and still keeps it unconfirmed but mentioning it has 1 confirmation.- After the 2nd confirmation the status changes to confirmed. This is the default setting, but it can be changed. You can bring it down to 1 confirmation. In that case, as soon as your transaction gets into the first block, Ledger Live will mark the transaction as confirmed. Or you can adjust it upwards to consider everything below 6 number of confirmations, for example, as unconfirmed.From what I have seen on Trezor and Trezor Suite, the 1st confirmation immediately changes the transaction's status to confirmed. So it depends on the software you use. Maybe Ledgers' 2 confirmation default is because of the possibility of your transaction landing in a stale block. So, if you see 1 confirmation, you might get the wrong impression that it's already confirmed while it might in fact change to unconfirmed soon after.",
