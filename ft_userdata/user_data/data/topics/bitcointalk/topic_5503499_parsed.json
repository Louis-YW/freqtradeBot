The number of bitcoins headed toward former customers is still not certain and could range from 65,000 to as much as 140,000, worth nearly $9 billion at the upper end.No evidence that many among the voters are among the people.",

That bottom price will never be seen in 2024 and 2025 and Bitcoin might never look back that price area.Each new market cycle, new bull run, price will make a new ATH but more than that, it sets up a new solid bottom, support area as foundation for a next cycle. Now in 2024, if you tell me Bitcoin will fall to $1,000, I will laugh but this is fear in the market in 2019, 2020 years.Quote from: Rikafip on July 19, 2024, 02:21:13 PMSince poll is completely anonymous, we have no idea how many of those who voted actually have money there.

They just collect a sample from the population and engage in analysis. 400 responses might give a glimpse of how other respondents might also behave. Anyway, I don't trust OP's survey because its validity might be flawed. QuoteIt’s good to see that many answer to the poll that they will hold but let’s see what will be the actual impact since decision making of Bitcoin holders always varies if they hold already the Bitcoin while the price keeps rising or dumping.Many of these Mt. Gox creditors have experienced many bull runs. They have experienced how thier worth of their Bitcoin increased over the years. So I can assume that many of them are aware that if they keep their coins for a few months or years they might make more profit.",

It's like a public secret, or non-verbal agreement. Everyone who is near selling are saying that they hodl, because they have zero reason to admit they would dump.It works both ways. If you want to hold, you don't care what option you choose. There's no reward for being honest in the poll and no way to check if you actually are. Many people troll in the Internet and choose the most ridiculous answers. If I wanted to buy more, or hold, I could still choose the \"sell immediately\" option just to make fun of people who are scared of dumps. Also, there's no way to confirm that people who vote there will receive any coins from Gox. QuoteAsk yourself, what would you say if you would get that btc and you were ready to sell? Would you create fear by admitting that everyone is probably selling or telling that you gonna have diamond hands.I would never dump it all. This is plain stupid. There are only 2 smart options for real Gox victims who want to sell. 1. Sell their claims. By doing so they would have received the cash years ago and have the liquidity to do whatever they please, start a business, pay for education and so on. 2. Slowly sell when demand arises. For instance now we're in a bull market and 2024- early 2025 should be the bull market years. Historically this is the best time to own bitcoin in a 4 year cycle. Even if I needed to sell I'd do it slow, 10% a month or even less.

Good for them because they waited so long to get their bitcoin back and good for us because if the market reacts negatively to this, it will create more opportunities for us to buy cheap bitcoin. No matter what scenario happens, I don't see anything too bad if we have optimistic thoughts.Bitcoin's volatility is inevitable because bitcoin cannot increase forever nor decrease forever, whether bitcoin's volatility is good or bad will depend on how we view it. If you want to buy more bitcoin at a cheaper price then I don't think the Mt.gox event is a bad thing for you.",

I don't know how many people are going to get their compensations in the Mt. Gox case, but I've seen estimates of 24,000 victims. It's possible to get a representative poll with around 500 votes to understand the opinion of 24,000 people, but random polling on Reddit is not the way to do it. After all, it's possible that people who vote for any of those options are not even among the victims.",

Marketcap is just the combined value of all coins.The depth of the dip depends on the depth of liquidity on the buy walls and the speed of the dumping matters too, because we don't know how fast markets can absorb the dump.If buy wall is thin, and if other people would join because of the speculation. It can dip fast and who knows where the main buy support of market markers is. Shorters are also most likely trying to make money too when it happens, so before the squeeze happens, things can look pretty dark. If market makers set up huge walls up high, we might not dip at all.",

But to say that Mt.gox's $9 billion won't impact the market is not true. The German government sold just over 50kBTC worth $3 billion and caused bitcoin to drop 15%, while Mt.gox owns 142kBTC, I don't think it will have a smaller impact.
