      "body": "That's not going to happen especially if you look at the current play to earn games economy and how poor their gameplay was which are unsustainable in the long run.On my radar, Axie is the only NFT that is still generating some noise online, and yet their playerbase continues to decline as a result of the token inflation issue that has not been rectified and the band-aid fixes they have previously implemented in the past. Don't get me wrong, because I am still an AXS holder and owned a handful of teams of axies which until today I didn't sold. And yeah, I'm still holding out some tiny bit of hope that Axie will eventually make a full recovery.",

To me it looks like something that will never be possible in the next ten years and also many play to earn games will be abandoned in the end.P2E games keep popping up and it looks like they will be popular for a long time to come. I think this niche is still young and so it might be good to keep an eye on these projects as they might be useful in the long run. Of course, real gamers are more concerned about the game's story and graphics and therefore P2E games with excellent graphics and a great story will be promising.",

Year's ago no one knew that COD will take over the best multiplayer game on the planet, for gaming its just the beginning, hype is not everything and they are temporally.",

This project is always decreasing even deeper. The game is not even launched for public. People are very boring just waiting for the game to be released. The only problem is about how can those play to earn project can sustain while there are bunch of new projects that were always doing the same thing like releasing more and more play to earn project?",

I'd say on 2023 or 2024 there's no one will discuss about P2E again except for nostalgia.Actually right now the hype have slowed down so I think it won't take 2 years before they finally come to rest. Ico are rare now but I think there are still ieo, ido and then defi. Maybe that's because they are better than ico and some of the projects under these are still useful up until now.Those who remain are genuine and it's not the hype which drives them anymore. You are right that the memories will remain especially if they are really good like we have been a part of it or we have earn something on that project before they have turned bad. Not only some of the p2e but even the late ico's are still being talked about here sometimes.",
