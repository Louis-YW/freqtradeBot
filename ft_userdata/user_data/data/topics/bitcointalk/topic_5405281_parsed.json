      "body": "Quizzes are deemed very effective and one can always look at their results and take care of them better in the future, there are certain things that one can do if they are a problem gambler : 1. Free online services available for gamblers 2. Get medications for addiction 3. Work on yourself and check your environmental impact as well. Other than that I do think that there are other things as well : a person who is not a problem gambler and knows it does not have to actually take the quiz. It's all able controlling your urges and it's all about having or no having them in the first place.",

Gambler should really be more responsible, don’t make this as your bad habit and stay on a good course.",

You’re conscious of how often you’re playing and how much you’re spending, without letting it negatively impact your daily life.I answer the question with straight never LOL.  I wonder what will be the result if I answer different things, gonna play around a bit more and will update this post once done.  Now, this raises some concerns about the reliability of the survey on how accurate their interpretation is, answering with a straight I don't know will result in the same category as the one who answered never. Answering with straight sometimes was interpreted as QuoteHigh-Risk GamblerIf you scored in this range, you may be experiencing a significant amount of gambling-related problems. Even if you’re just starting to notice your gambling becoming an issue, there are steps you can take to get help – and you’ve already started. Just taking this quiz is a huge step. The next step is talking to someone. You can even do so anonymously and free of charge. You don’t need to feel alone.Straight sometimes has the same result as straight most of the time.",

The question on the survey is quite interesting because it ask the most common feelings and hobbits when playing gambling especially those part that you play on other day just to recover yesterday loss. I'm guilty to this feeling and I always think about my previous losses even I win on that particular day and hoping I can recover all of them on my next game which always leads me to more losses.Probably you answered 3 or more questions with \"sometimes\" .Same here, answered 3 with \"sometimes\" then I got moderate risk gambler result.  It is a good thing that the survey recommend some help depending on the severity of the result.  Well, I never knew that I have a somehow alarming level of risk of being a problem gambler, must put this one down to to low-risk gambler.",
