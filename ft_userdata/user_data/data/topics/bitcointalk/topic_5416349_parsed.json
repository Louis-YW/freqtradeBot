If vanity - install samr7 vanity gen - again use air-gapped systemAdding link: https://github.com/samr7/vanitygenThere are other ways and I am sure a few other key makers will add to this.",

Reset the device....get a new seed created and use that to place under the Holo and use the corresponding public address for the loading part.   You can then reset and do as many times as needed to get as many new addresses as you want made.  And it goes without saying...use the following as well .   Air gapped computer   Air gapped printer   Water proof paper   https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5296179.0   I also recommend if you use any other device instead of just a qr code for priv key also print a second one with the alphanumeric key as well.

Any advice from those with experience with this would be much appreciated.Thanks,Krispy   First off, don't use a website to generate keys.  Ever.  That's ridiculous. I would be curious what you will be using the address for.  You mention DIY coins, but do you need 1 or 2 addresses or hundreds of addresses?  Do they need to be vanity addresses or will any old address work?  The easiest way is probably to use something like Electrum or Bitcoin Core on an offline computer.  Slightly more difficult would be to use a vanity generator program, but that would give you more addresses quickly and you could also specify the beginning of your addresses.  Anything else would probably take a little bit of knowledge.",

How can you be sure that they are a \"trustable\" source and have followed all the steps to generate safe keys?I suggest you take a look at this site / project https://glacierprotocol.org/ which explains in detail how to create a wallet in an absolutely secure way (state-of-the-art).Some steps can be really laborious/not easy at all if you're not confident with these arguments, but anyway you will find details about all possible risks associated to keys creation and how to avoid them.",
