What's the point of this, not that it will not help you get more investors for doing this, I should know I worked with marketing people all my life, but also it will hurt your chances instead. So what OP is doing, is literally making this project be hated even more, that's not what shilling should be about, shilling should be about getting interest from people and this is not the way to do that.",

But the way I'm observing this new project in the crypto market, I think it will take a long years before investors will begin to see small income to achieve from this new project because their teams is not too strong like other potential projects team in the community. I will advice you to invest your money in Ethereum and binance in this bearish season and hold till next year when the price hit higher in the market before you can sell to achieve your incomes from the market.",

If you will go with altcoins, I always say Ethereum because out of all the altcoins out there, Ethereum is the safest to invest though I'm not saying that you can get guaranteed profits by investing into it.Quote from: legendaryracers on August 09, 2023, 05:59:59 AM~3 Billion Supply, developer's pictures are just like AI generated logos. I guess these alone are already red flags (at least for me).You will use our funds so that you can develop EV's? Why we need to invest into your project where in fact, there are many companies who are doing it already, and there might be some who already made some EV's. \"Designed to be profitable\". This phrase is almost the same as the word \"guaranteed\", and that word is what most of the scammers are using. What do you mean designed to be profitable? So there's no chance for an investor to lose their investment because it's programmed to be profitable for us investors? It's a red flag if my understanding is right. Can't even spell the word \"Panel\" correctly. Newbie account, advertising a new project in their thread. I've seen this many times already, and all of them didn't even become successful.",

Qizon coin and what the fak is it? Why don't this shit coin just try to do their own research and introduce their proposal to the some biggest players in the automotive like ducadi, mercedez benz, etc? Your coin was offering something bullshit. I will trust it if your project's proposal gonna be approved by one of biggest players in the automotive. Stop fooling people with your shit. People were not stupid enough. Any project that doesn't related to the crypto has more than 98% probability to turn out to be scam project. I saw that your project has very big chance to be a scam project. Complete your RnD and send your result to the one of big company to whether it's worth to invest on it or not. It doesn't even related to the cryptocurrency.",

Although, I did expect something good about them because the project looks really promising after it end up dead, it became a lesson for me to never help market a project that promotes anything in the vehicle industry.If there are promising altcoins in the market, they are already out there being used, still kicking, and their demand is never-ending.",
