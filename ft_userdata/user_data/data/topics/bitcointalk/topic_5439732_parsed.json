  "content": "I have some USDT and USDC in my portfolio that I'd want to stake in a \"De-Fi\" dApp without worrying about it in a long time. There are liquidity pools in Uniswap with attractive stake rates, but there's also Compound.Finance with its lending services. Both of these platforms are built on the ETH blockchain, so gas fees would be astronomically high. I've read about some platforms being compatible with Polygon (MATIC), but I'd have yet to see if it's worth the shot (especially in terms of security/reliability).Do you know the safest way to stake stablecoins without breaking the bank? Also, do you think it's worth it? Or should I consider other options? Any suggestions and/or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

I've seen that they might provide 10-15% API or more, and that sounds really dangerous, it's too high for low risk. I use stablecoins for transactions, I don't see any reasons to hold and stack them.",

The pools there are created exclusively for stablecoin, and there are pools not only with liquidity allocation between 2 assets, but also more exotic ones with 8 or 10 assets, as far as I remember. Although I can't say that Curve offers great rates on stablecoin staking, but when it comes to platform reliability, percentages shouldn't be the deciding factor when choosing a platform for staking.",

Binance warns users that they may completely lose what they deposit through this section's defi option. Although I think Binance picks safer options.",

It's passive income when the going is good. However, the experience of losing one's assets on staked site isn't something anyone with a high blood pressure should witness. I staked thousands of KCLP and Kroots on the kclp site, believing doing it there would guarantee safety more than on any other site since it's their token, and then one day the rugged thing happened. Everything just disappeared into thin air. My only consolation whenever I remember what happened now is that the prices of those tokens dipped weeks before that incident so much that the quantities I had weren't worth that much again.",

Just my thoughts What's wrong with these auditing firms is that they're not even accurate at all. I remember news from Binance that they've been audited and somehow it tends to be an inaccurate audit. Well, with all of these news and hacks from De-Fi, I don't really give an interest on them and that's why when someone thinks of investing or wanting to take their share there and talks to me how optimistic they are, I'm telling them already the disadvantage of it.",

We do have our own investment strategy in the first place. Most of the people here would go to a more profitable one despite of the bigger risk involved simply because they are not into long term investment. Problem with investing or staking stable coins is that it will require year/s of holding to earn a small percentage of increase. So if you could deal with that more than tackling the risk on more volatile asset which could generate bigger rate of increase and profit for a shorter period of time, then that would be just fine.",
