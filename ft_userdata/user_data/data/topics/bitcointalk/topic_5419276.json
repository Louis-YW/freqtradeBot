The BBB story can be found here via https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bbb-crypto-scams-are-now-the-second-deadliest-scams/On today's news it was brought to my notice on Marketwatch about Mazini, A popular influencers, who amassed over 1 million followers on Instagram using crypto and other medium of BlockChain, to steal and scam investors off their hard earn money. For the past few months we've watch videos of him, how he go about doing good, helping the poor, in the process he becomes the talk of the town. he's been mostly loved by Undergraduate and people from the less privilege homes. only to be investigated and found out he's involved in over $8 million scam, from thousands of people through a Ponzi scheme and crypto scam. as things stand he has pleaded guilty to stealing, using Crypto as a tools. this is a bad omen and I expect everyone out there to learn this lesson of being involved, because an Influencers is promoting a promoting a project, or intiatives doesn't makes it Scam free. the news can be found here via https://www.marketwatch.com/story/instagram-influencer-jay-mazini-pleads-guilty-to-running-8-million-ponzi-scheme-and-crypto-scam-11667414900Now my advice to everyone reading this, Do not allowed your self to be massively influences by those influencers you followed on social media, one needs to be extremely careful on how you get involved in those touting project, Influencers don't care about you as long as they get paid for paid promotion, That's why you see a lot of project Scammer's exploring influencers weakness, by capturing the heart of it's followers and ends up on the losing side.Always do your own personal research, Be sure you're satisfied with the information gotten so far by you. not what an influencers said, take it up as a task, to do your own research and come up with your own personal results and strategies to determine if it's a good push to get involved in by yourself, to be sure you're up for what you're doing. This is just my piece of advice to you, Please feel free to contribute, Newbies planning to go into investment please, try as much as possible to avoid be influence and manipulated into investment on a project.",

      "body": "It's actually sentimental to see news outlets or blogs tagging ever scam done by individuals on cryptocurrency. Were some of these scams not/still done before involving fiat money. Was local banks actually not involved why was there no headlines stating them?Its no longer news to tell people to do DYOR but some people (mostly new investors) see cryptocurrency as quick get rich scheme and the greed leads them to falling for this schemes.I feel government should but more laws holding these celebrities accountable for every ponzi schemes they promote. But since it concerns cryptocurrency I don't see them doing anything but rather will be happy to have it on the bad side of the news.",

So far i have restricted social media to entertainment and societal, economic, geographical and religious news. When it involves investment i read from the project's official websites and draw my conclusion from there so i don't let any influencer decide what happens to my funds.QuoteAlways do your own personal research, Be sure you're satisfied with the information gotten so far by you. not what an influencers said, take it up as a task, to do your own research and come up with your own personal results and strategies to determine if it's a good push to get involved in by yourself, to be sure you're up for what you're doing.

This is the reality of trusting influencers as they don't care about their followers emptying their pockets but rather securing their own. That is somewhat disappointing but guess what, even how many times we heard this and people read/hear it, whether to agree with me or not, many people are still doing this. I don't believe in learning from experience because these many people still don't learn anything from the past but they believe in the 2nd chance.",

We are familiar with the bounty board as a bard in which, we've got over 90% of projects undergoing promotions to be scams from history and still we've got a thousand more still being promoted.Sm times, these promoters are a victims too as much as those who invest in the project with hopes that it would turn out to be some gainful investment or something important I'm the crypto industry.Whats there to understand is that, you can never be too smart on your investments in the crypto industry. Some times you win and at other times you lose. Let the wins be a worthy compensation on the loses you would encounter on your journey and be good to accept which one comes.",

Most importantly know what to do in crypto. About the percentage of wins and losses, of course, you have to think about, making sure the average profit is greater than the loss. This can be overcome with a good strategy and the right analysis, indeed there will be no 100% correct analysis, but it is better than just using feelings.

An investor must be able to do good analysis before making decision so that they will not regret it in the future.Look at how many percentages of profits investors have received so far who are really able to analyze the market and bitcoin potential. They are actually not all know and clever, but their financial strength has sometimes brought them closer to big profits. I can't imagine how early adopters profited last year to be exact on November ATH, it was something that was completely beyond their expectations in bitcoin's early years.",
