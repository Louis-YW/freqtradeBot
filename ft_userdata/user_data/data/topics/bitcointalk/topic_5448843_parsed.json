Thank you for sharing this update, I never knew Binance do change their deposit address because I once spoke with their customer service and they were asking me some questions upon questions why I wanted to change my address so I had to stop. I believe they are doing some technical maintenance and that might be the cause. Is this a general stiff or just for a single user? Because I didn't receive any email from them concerning the expiration of wallet address.",

      "body": "Well, thanks, OP, for this information; it's very useful. I must admit that some people who are too lazy to go on to BN and copy a fresh address can fall victim to this challenge. Likewise, any time I want to send bitcoin to my Binance account, I just copy the address from the beneficiary address in my self-controlled wallet. I usually see it as double stress to go over BINANCE and copy a fresh address.In the past, I have mistakenly sent BUSD to a friend's old address without confirming if he is still using it; this is just a similar case because that address is no longer in use. I just urge every person sending out tokens to also make sure and cross-check if it is the correct address they are sending to.",

We strongly encourage you to update all records of where you have stored your previous address as soon as possible.If anyone still use the old addresses and no longer receive their deposited coins, they can just do it manually.
