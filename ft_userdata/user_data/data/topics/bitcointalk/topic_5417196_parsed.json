  "content": "Hacking is big business online. There are two big reasons why people get hacked: Flaws in software and flaws in human behaviour. You cannot do much about coding vulnerabilities, but you can change your own behaviour and bad habits.“Computers are just like guns back in the olden days,” says hacker Jayson E Street. “Criminals used guns because it was easy to commit a crime. Well, computers have made it really easy to commit crimes.”Here are the steps you can take to protect yourself online:Keep track of the latest cybercrime techniques so that you’re aware of them when browsing.Another way to avoid being the victim of cybercrime is to install anti-virus software and keep software up to date, as updates generally upgrade security and remove bugs.Hardware should also be kept up to date to support software security upgrades.Never open suspicious emails or links.Stay off public networks and disable Bluetooth when not in use.Passwords should be regularly updated.Enable two-factor authentication on online accounts wherever possible.Hacking happens at many levels and takes various forms, from personal attacks using common phishing scams to breaches of government software security using sophisticated coding.\"Humans are clearly cybersecurity’s weakest link,\" says Hofmann. \"Every person can be hacked. Sometimes it's not a matter of education. It's sometimes a matter of awareness or attention in the moment.\" Disclaimer: I'm not the original owner of the text above, I only copied it because I thought it might be useful to some users.

If your device hasn't be compromised, just create a strong password and have it backed up, but the best option is to use a password manager, one that is open source, e.g KeePass to create random passwords for yourself and have it safely stored.",

It's good to think of the safety of others but still, one step where I find fault is in the updates. It doesn't always help at all times as, some updates actually comes with bugs.

You need to understand how a hacker can install malicious software on your computer or phone. By understanding how to prevent this, you will always be protected from it. I'm not sure what you meant about administrators, but it is dangerous to trust anyone who is not your acquaintance in our time. Anyone who could be a friend yesterday can change today. Some scammers take a very long time to prepare the victim. Unfortunately, in our time, even offline, all moral principles are lost, to say nothing of strangers on the Internet. Having said that, I agree that it is necessary to monitor the news about fraudulent schemes. Once upon a time, many also did not know about phishing. It is likely that in our time, something has appeared that can also harm the user.",
