Watch out for this NEW TransferFrom Zero Transfer Scam!I got scammed out of 100000 dollars by fake 0 dollars withdrawal on BSCThanks for clarifying what happened. So in short, it's transferFrom function with Zero amount to any address and thus doesn't need pvtKey.It is strange that scams evolve like this, but it is better to send an email to Exodus developers to fix such *bug*. All they need is to hide transactions with zero balance, just as explorers should do, so why wasn't such a solution implemented?!",

I don't call it a bug. As you said, it's the problem with how transferFrom function work. Such transactions are valid, according to those altcoins rules and explorers show them. In bitcoin, we have a dust limit which doesn't allow broadcasting zero transactions even if you own the private key, but that's not how those shitcoins work and therefore, that's not explorers or wallet providers fault.",

OP can't have his coins stolen in that way. Think about it: If a hacker/scammer had access to your wallet and could steal your coins, would they take everything you have, or would they make silly 0-value transactions? I am sure you know the answer to that question. The scammers create similar looking addresses. They match in the first and last couple of characters. The idea is to trick the person into copying the wrong address from their transaction history instead of going about it the correct way. If you use the send/addresses/receive tabs the way they were intended, and not copy addresses from transaction histories or block explorers you would have nothing to worry about.",

Shit, looks like this is a need to fix on those shitty smart contracts where zero amount transfer should not be allowed. I just checked the USDC and USDT smart contract on its previous' transfers[1][2] after reading this thread and there are lot of them transactions with zero amount with a label of Fake_PhishingXXXX[1] https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48[2] https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",

Don't copy anything from your transaction history when you are sending and receiving crypto. Congratulations! You have just upgraded your security.

Sadly not every wallet has it, and not everyone uses it either. I don't know why but I found some users still copy-paste addresses from their transaction history or blockchain explorer. I don't think it's convenient at all unless their wallet is really terrible and has no built-in feature for copying addresses.

Improving blockchain explorer sounds good but I would rather stop using a network that allows a bug like this to exist in the first place.",

I have no idea what they are planning. It's a bug or actually a feature of a network smart contract. Once such a contract is released, I don't think it can be taken offline. Tron isn't decentralized like Bitcoin, but you still shouldn't expect that someone out there would/should have the possibility to remove certain network capabilities they don't like. Fraudsters are using those zero-value transactions as scam attempts, but there are surely other genuine reasons and use cases why such an option exists. Changing it could affect people who aren't abusing it. This is just guesswork btw.",
