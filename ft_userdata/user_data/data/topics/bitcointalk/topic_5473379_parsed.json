ThanksNever follow others always do your own research because this $1500 is yours, but if I have to assume that this money is mine and I have been given the opportunity to make holdings from it then I will definitely go into alts because alts can give me some good profit but you (reader) might be wondering why I did not choose BTC because these $1500 are given to me to make money by holdings. And even if I will lose this money in Alts I will not regret it as the money is not mine.But If I would care about money, then I would go for BTC, and at the current market, I would not go all on BTC because the market is showing like it is bullish which it is but I don't know why the feelings in my mind tell me that it will come down to $30k at least. So, for that, I will keep some funds aside to buy at dip, some funds for emergency, and the remaining one will be invested in BTC.",

You can use an exchange which is the easiest however you need to make sure you use a unique email, password, and don't use 2FA with SMS. This is pretty basic and unless the exchange goes bankrupt your crypto is safe.2) Use a hardware wallet. These cost like $100 or so and you use it to sign transactions.3) Cold storage. This is free, just need an old computer that is never connected to the internet which you will use just to sign the transaction.",

ThanksInvest it into Bitcoin because it's the safest option for you. I won't recommend you the altcoins because they aren't as reliable as Bitcoin and any of them can go zero in value. If still you want to go with altcoins then I recommend you to do your research and choose among the old and well-known altcoins like Monero, Dogecoin, LTC and a few others which have been doing good for many years.Never ever invest your money into newly launched tokens because they are very risky and you can lose everything. I have personally invested in some of the newly launched coins and lost a lot of money and that's why I recommend you to be careful from those newly launched coins. The old altcoins are still okay as investment but I still prefer Bitcoin investment.",

ThanksSince you made a public thread to seek advice on where to invest your 1500k,  you have to know that if you looking for to invest that money in cryptocurrency then you have to understand the risk involved and how you must avoid it,  at some point,  if you believe that you want to invest that amount in crypto then you can invest by holding less volatile assets. But much more also you have to consider Bitcoin but on a long-term basis so you have to be ready to wait for a while to see your investment grow with significant profits since your amount in the capital is such a small amount at this point which will translate into longer waiting time let say the 1-year cycle of time frame for your investment to mature.",

ThanksOf course bitcoin is the best and investing in bitcoin is the best choice. Bitcoin is trusted and has a price history of always reaching a new ATH after the halving. The halving momentum will occur soon and many members believe that Bitcoin will touch a new ATH again.Investing in altcoins is too risky, if we are lucky maybe we will find a good altcoin and have a fantastic price increase, but the price of the altcoin can run out and it can be delisted from the market.",

ThanksBetter investment plans often works when we have some better investment,  the more you have investment the more you can earn but there is one thing which should be taken care and that is the risk factor involved in each trade we are taking. But risks should be minimized by changing strategies with time to time. For your investment plan,  I have opinion to invest that in bnb if you are really having investment plans for the long term. Also you can invest this in Ethereum but it will give you a less profit if it pumps,  but Bnb in price is low as compared to other coins like Btc and Ethereum. If your investment was good then I would definitely gave you an idea about the btc.",

ThanksIf I were you I'd invest in Bitcoin rather than an altcoin. I'll try and highlight few reasons why you should go for Bitcoin. Some altcoins lack use cases and they fade away as they come but bitcoin is still here. More so, there are more than 15,000 altcoins, so you'll be faced with dilemma in choosing the right coin to invest but there's only one Bitcoin with a proven track record. It's over to you to make a choice, but if you're going to invest in Bitcoin, you better hurry, buy and hodl because the ship is about to sail.",

ThanksAre you a beginner, the best advice is to invest all of it in Bitcoin and see how the market will wave Bitcoin and you'll have the idea how everything moves just as it all depends on it. If you heard out newbies made a lot of money with altcoins, they're just as lucky as they start out. The trend has been in their favor and they have never expected that to happen. Usually, people who have made a lot of money from altcoins, it's either they've known that project for so long or they all suddenly invested in it just because the trend was seen on those. For you as a beginner and don't have any idea yet, it's always best to go along which is the market mover and that's Bitcoin.Maybe someday in the future, you'll explore with altcoins when you have already seen how the market moves and how more volatile the altcoins are and understands that they're all following Bitcoin.",

ThanksI think majority here, if we have that kind of money will invest on BTC. I mean it's the safe best, at least from my experience point of view. I had invested on alts before, but it didn't turn out good in my end. Maybe I was carried by the altcoin market hype before, and might have push for some meme or shit coins.But to avoid that kind of FOMO and of course, not losing money, it will be better to go with BTC all in. This is not a investment advise though, you still have to make the final decision.However, I think majority here might agree with me that Bitcoin is better than anything else.",

ThanksI would say to invest that money in BTC if you are planning on holding it, because it is the best in terms of risk and volatility. If you are planning to hold for 2 or more years, then I hope you can make 2x or 3x on your investment. There is no doubt that if you invest this same money in alts with proper calculations, you might make 2x or 3x in one day, but that will depend on the trading you are wanting to do.At the current market price, I can say there are many decent alts in the market that can make more than 2x or 3x on your holdings if you hold them for 2 or more years, but the difference between both is risk. You and I don't get to know when those assets we have invested in will go under the earth, and we don't know whether they can make us twice as much after 2 years or if they can make us twice as much before that period, and that would be our only chance to book profit. Which means we have to be active in the market while dealing with alts.Holding in BTC becomes less risky, and based on your newbie account, I would suggest you hold your funds by buying BTC and do not buy all at once; instead, buy in parts. Recent news of an ETF is coming, and if that spreads up, we might see BTC reach $40,000 in the next week.",

ThanksWhy you are comparing BTC to alt, no there is no comparison between BTC and alt. Of course, you can go towards BTC if you want to invest and then hold. For holding btc is the best one. Yesterday a person posted I think in the beggainer and help section who is telling about the Bitcoin holding that he invested in BTC sometime ago and recently he made a big profit from it and used it for the profits in his marriage expenses. If you hold it in the BTC and wait until the bullish phase comes then it will return huge profits. But the fund is yours and we don't force you to do what we are saying we are just giving the suggestions the last decision will be yours to either invest it in the BTC or alts.",
