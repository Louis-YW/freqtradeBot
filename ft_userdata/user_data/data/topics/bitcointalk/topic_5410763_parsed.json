  "content": "This thread is born out of the passion I have for trading and regardless of my previous experience on a similar thread on the forum. It would always speak my view about the direction of Bitcoin with chart representations on the 4H, 1D and 1W only. I'm dedicating just one out of the many trading systems I know for this purpose.One of the reasons I opened this topic is that I discovered that many users of the forum are just quoting the values of Bitcoin randomly without knowing the reason why they do so or what is exactly happening in the market, a lot of assumptions everywhere. Trading and gambling are not the same, such people might learn much through this thread if they are patient enough rather than attacking, being unconstructive or claiming superiority in trading.I did not open this thread to claim I am better than anyone, and I will try my best to dedicate my precious time to it daily. No one is perfect, any speculation could be right or wrong, so please note that it is my view on Bitcoin and anyone using it to trade is doing so at their own risk, though it might help many to earn massively. \"Plan and manage your risks all by yourself.\" Also, be informed that it is not a must for any targets to be hit, no one controls the market.Again, please, note that this is my own opinion on Bitcoin, you might have yours, no problem, but let your replies and questions be constructive and wise.Thank you!Bitcoin is bearish in trend on the weekly chart, the whole outlook on the chart attests to that as the market has a bearish price action that wants to continue the selling witnessed last week. However, the major technical levels to watch out for are the peak of last week at 25214.61 (resistance), which doubles as a double-top level and the low of June at 17784.96 (support), which is the low of 2022.A break above 25214.61 will launch a bullish attach on the trendline resistance at 26337.38, and if further broken, it would be a major breakthrough for the cryptocurrency as it might reverse higher in long-term disposition for a test of 48189.83 and the all-time high of 68999.99 in extension.At the moment, the trend of Bitcoin is bearish and it aims to test the low of June at 17784.96 provided it maintains a bearish candlestick for this week and holds below 25214.61. A break below this level would further weaken the market as the Stochastic Oscillator points lower and MACD is negative.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

      "body": "Yesterday's analysis was a broader picture of Bitcoin, and the long-term bias remains bearish. Yet, one should be careful of any adverse development in the market within the bearish trend, which makes me use both the 4H and daily charts today.As the market holds within the mentioned technical levels of 25214.61 and 17784.96 waiting for a breakout, further developments are happening within the levels. The daily chart validates a bearish trend but has been forming short candlesticks. This suggests the lack of interest by the sellers due to the oversold condition of the Stochastic oscillator on the chart. Bitcoin needs a break below yesterday's low of 20890.19 to resume its selling for the test of the low of June at 17784.96. Therefore, caution in selling this market is advised today. If Bitcoin closes positive today, it might then start a short-term bullish journey that might reach the trendline resistance at 24492.73, and a break of that level would announce 31599.68.Also on the 4H chart, caution is advised as the market has been channelling (sideways) for days. It needs a successful breakout from either the peak or the bottom on this channel before a definitive short-term trend could be ascertained. However, the Stochastic oscillator is pointing higher on the chart, which suggests traders might prefer a bullish path today. A break of the trendline resistance at 22347.76 will further confirm it. Tomorrow should guide further on the market development.Quote from: adaseb on August 22, 2022, 10:50:50 PMYes it does seem bearish. If you look on the weekly you can see that we got front run on the previous weekly support.Yes, the overall trend of the market is bearish, yet one should be cautious of the long-term scope only. A minor bullish pattern is forming already, patience is advised. I would update you on this tomorrow.Quote from: Dave1 on August 23, 2022, 03:15:31 AMSo I will concur as well with the OP that the market is bearish short term or at least up to the end of 2022.The truth remains that Bitcoin is bearish. Instead of gauging it by the year-end, it's clear to me that it will fully become bullish only above 25214.61, which is the August 2022 high, and above 26337.38, which is a weekly chart trendline resistance. Don't just assume, let the technical analysis gauge you.",

Still a good improvement as compare to those predictions like $18k. or lower.",

      "body": "Bitcoin puts up a good fight yesterday as expected but could not break the confirming trendline resistance at 21927.87. At this point, I am slightly in favour of the bulls and any downside movement today will be treated as a mere correction that would create more earning advantage for the buyers.And as you can see on the 4H chart below, the determining/confirming trendline resistance has shifted lower, which is a better opportunity that would disregard the sideways movement of the market by principle. Therefore, a break above the current trendline resistance at 21677 would confirm a short-term bullish trend that might see the market hitting 24440.42 and 25208.78.Quote from: adaseb on August 23, 2022, 05:31:15 PMNow it seems that Bitcoin is going down due to US dollar rising, bond yields are going higher, oil is creeping up and there is hints that the fed might not stop hiking. No idea why.Seems inflation now is not the problem but the tight labor market. Unless productivity increases and unemployment goes up, it will do little for combating inflation. So all eyes are now at the economic data which will correlation with bitcoins macro moves in the medium future ahead.Bitcoin is truly bearish in the long-term view, but should we disregard the intraday developments? The answer is No. I know how to accurately read the fundamental and technical analysis, and I know their strengths and weaknesses.This makes me prefer the technical analysis because nothing is hidden in its sight, unlike the fundamental analysis that 10 traders could contradict themselves with their conclusions. The clarity of the technical analysis is there and true to its principles, and it is always working for me. All I need is patience most times! Anyone reading my daily speculations would not only gain but also learn if read insightfully.Quote from: Dave1 on August 25, 2022, 03:51:14 AMRight, sketchy and very tricky as well, we are looking for the sideway pattern right now, but still it can go either direction and hopefully it will not be on the negative side again.The market can go either way truly, yet the bias will always shift to a side for us to take decisions (long or short term). For now, the bias is more bullish and the technical developments and levels being broken should be our further guide.",

We will have to see that $35k-$40k, we just have 4 months to accomplishment that huge jump with how the outlook of the market right now.",

The market is still moving in a tight bound on the chart, so caution is needed. Yesterday's market ended negative and created a Doji on the daily chart. This suggests a negative bias today as a reversal is possible within the sideways movement still seen with the last 7 candlesticks formed on the chart.Regardless of that, the price action of the last two candlesticks is bearish, which makes me believe that Bitcoin might sell today. But this is provided it stays below 21690.67 (today's opening price) and breaks below 21310.16 (yesterday's low).

My analysis of yesterday remains valid today but everyone should be careful of the oversold condition on the lower charts. The market might continue selling or wants to first retrace higher before continuing the selling, so be careful. The major supports in sight are at 18910.72 and 17625.00, which is the low of June 2022.",

I expect the retracement to halt at or below the trendline support at 21280.65 and bring about the fall resumption that might make it continue its bearish journey towards 17625.00.
