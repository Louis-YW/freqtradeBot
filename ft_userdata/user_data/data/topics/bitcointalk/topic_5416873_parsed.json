This kind of situation is currently going on with the war in Ukraine and Ukrainian children will be the one facing this inhuman action because the Russian invading them. Children are to be guided and protected but in war time they are vulnerable to all kind of attacks. There is little that the mother can do but the children suffer more. This is how children suffer in any war going on. This is sad reading this.",

      "body": "Unlike traditional wars (army versus army), all the wars that armies fight in cities and in the so-called street wars, the main victims of them are civilians, specifically women and children who are subject to indiscriminate bombing of homes where they hide or are easy to sustain as human shields in Street wars due to their weak physical abilities.And even in conventional wars, they are victims in an indirect way, because parents die in confrontations, leaving their children victims in the face of hunger and poverty.Wars are a very cruel thing and humanity is still in the stage of primitive backwardness as long as it cannot get rid of this brutality. Even in nature, few of the same species are killed.",

Sometimes I wonder if God really cares at all. Well, animals have fights too, but I don't think it goes to a large scale as humans. It's usually between males that want to dominate the territory or maybe when they are fighting for prey.",

      "body": "It has been estimated that more than 14,000 people have been killed by this needless war. Sometimes I consider the number of orphans that this war would create. Children would suddenly lose the care and love they once enjoyed from their parents and most of them would be sent to orphanages where they sometimes would be maltreated and molested. Most of them would have to go through a lifetime of suffering from Post-traumatic stress disorder due to the horrible war experience. War also gives children uncontrolled access to arms such as guns. In the future, they might become violent because of this early exposure to the ordnance. It's quite unfortunate that the world is turning these harmless wonderful creatures into monsters.",

This is how children suffer in any war going on. This is sad reading this.This is the very reason the international humanitarian law to safeguard children during times of war was implemented. The protection of children who have been impacted by conflict in terms of food, clothing, medical, education, and family reunification is covered under the Geneva Conventions and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. They also aim to shield kids from being enlisted in the military and ethnic cleansing. However, these regulations are not often followed, particularly when it comes to enlisting young people in the military.",

NATO is merely escalating the conflict in Ukraine. NATO cannot attack Russia directly; if they do, everyone involved in the situation should be ready for a global conflict. It will be better for Ukrainians if President Zelensky realizes that the US is using him to destroy Ukraine as soon as possible. With their current strategy, the US or NATO cannot stop the invasion. I pray for peace between Ukraine and Russia, and NATO should keep away.",
