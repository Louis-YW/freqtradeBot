  "content": "If you guys don't know then let me say currently in my region Bangladesh the situation is unrest with the Quota Protest. And this protest became massive only because of internet and social media. And for this, our Dictators shut down the Internet Connection of the entire country for 5 days to turn the situation towards them. To say that these five days our Bangladeshi people were completely isolated from the Internet or the world. You can visit this thread to know more details - Attacks on quota movement studentsNow I come to the real point, most of us who are here have investment in cryptocurrency or bitcoin or selling services which is very related to bitcoin.What will Bitcoiners do with their transactions/trades in this situation? Can a Satelite Internet connection can be only the way ?Are bitcoiner really have the decentralized system, which can't be controlled? Because at the end of the day, I'm seeing that we are hostage to the government. It appears that all control is in the hands of the government i.e. to the ruler party.Now I want to know if there is ever such a situation in your country then what should be the pre-preparation? Let's discuss-",

Now it's getting to our knowledge that the governments are basically having full control over our lives which is a reason bitcoin stands against, with the internet related outage we can be short out as bitcoiners or crypto related dealers. since this is a new experience I believe there will be a need for a solution outside the governmental reach but what could that be? because basically everything even the private satellite needs the general service of the internet to be launched. At this point we might be stuck in the hands of the government. For bitcoin, it can't be controlled by the governments but the use is obviously being controlled. No doubt",

It's not something I think there is any other option than to accept it that way, or better yet, if the person can't bear it, it's just to leave that country for the main time.",

If this happens, surely a lot of companies and freelancers will certainly be in trouble, even accessing our crypto investments will never be possible. However, it cannot be denied that if the government will demand for an internet shutdown even for a couple of days, it will definitely happen but they should also face all those complaints and address them properly as much as possible. Government without those big companies that are paying them taxes will considered be incapable and invaluable.",

Can a Satelite Internet connection can be only the way ?There is nothing they can do, because to carry out transactions requires internet access, how can anyone carry out their transactions when they cannot connect to the Bitcoin network? However, a satellite internet network could be a solution to this, but as far as I know, the satellite internet network providers that are most easily accessible to people, such as Starlink, are not yet available in Bangladesh. But there is another problem, even when you have access to a private satellite internet network, you may be faced with signal jammers which are usually used by the government to block signals in certain areas, but this can be overcome if we go out of range.QuoteAre bitcoiner really have the decentralized system, which can't be controlled?

Freelancers in this country were most troubled due to lack of internet along with us.If a country does not have internet Access, it may affect Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is a virtual currency. Which can be transacted online only. Moreover, internet is also required for Bitcoin transactions to be successful. These are not possible if the internet service is interrupted.",

People who are into online jobs and who stay in the cities solely because of faster internet are now beginning to go home thanks to Starlink. So, this is somehow a solution to the concern of the internet being under the control of the government. As far as the situation in Bangladesh is concerned, it seems to me the decision of the government to implement an internet blackout is suicide. It was an extremely poor decision on their part. As if it prevents the people all over the country from communicating with each other. As if it addresses the main issue. Whoever made the decision was poorly advised. I'm not in any way preparing for this scenario. After all, an internet blackout sounds ludicruos to me. If my country plans to implement something like this in the middle of some chaos, there will certainly be a lot of opposition that it won't push through. In the first place, such decision hurts them more than everybody else.",

I don't foresee a quick and easy solution to circumvent this. In areas where internet is restricted, I would think that regulations would prohibit any of these sorts of tech.
