The scenario is like this- I contact him in \"Discord\" and we have the deal.- Then, he requested me to join his discord group.- Shady things is happening, I can't on \"verification\" bots (probably) his scam device (I can't be verified to join his group).- Then, today my discord got hacked (I get kicked out on his discord group + he deleted all the chats).He looking someone who are working in group. My advice don't apply on this.Proof Picture, I'm joining with my dummy account for the proof:1. His Discord Channel:2. Link Verification going to MEE6 Fake (.app) domain:3. I just check, the direction from the fake MEE6 to Discord, It's requested \"Token\" to bypass my account without 2FA:The @OP of that hiring is also a wake up account could be a hacked account as well.",

It's best to trust servers and others with verification modes to have that entire thing in Discord, and if it leads to a link, definitely a red flag already. Might be a token or authorization thing from them and exploited something?",

The case is after contacted with you and the only direct message who are getting deleted is only a message with you.It's clear just check your discord channel listed a fake \"MEE6\" link for verification based on picture number 2 and number 3 it's requested token ID.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on March 29, 2023, 07:10:00 AM-snip-Well based on the instruction it's a captcha but to be verified he put a link for verification ask me to redirect link somewhere else, for prove me a human. There is no captcha number or letter, it's ask us to verified on website.- Listed \"URL\" to somewhere else pretend for verification. The embed link post is real by MEE6 bots but the link redirect is fake MEE6.- Pretended to be MEE6 by bookmarking the drag me (Verification) to my browser.- Then the instruction is to go back into verification with discord browser, and click the link by bookmark.You can verified MEE6 Official Link: https://mee6.xyz/en and on picture number 2 he put a fake MEE6 feel free to match the domain it's different. My bad not checking this, I check after discovering how my account getting hacked and after contact with him.This is the fake MEE6 listed to be used for verification on his discord channel, verification is directing to web.

It's a nice new method of phishing attach and working well for the scammer. What is he going to do with the discord account? I suspect he has bigger plan. What if he installed a keylogger and taking every keystrokes you are hitting? I suggest you to install a fresh copy of the operating system or at least use a virus scanner and scan the device. Safe is to reinstall the operating system and start from a fresh system. If keylogger is installed then by now he already have a lot of details that you have entered in different sites. You may also want to change the account passwords once you have the fresh copy installed in the device.I am going to tag the person.Good luck brother",

It is worth noting that the scammer can create a bot similar to a popular bot on his server or a site similar to a popular bot site, such as MEE6 or CaptchaBot.. etc. Therefore, there are many scammers, so we must be careful before applying for a job with an unknown person with a small rank account.",
