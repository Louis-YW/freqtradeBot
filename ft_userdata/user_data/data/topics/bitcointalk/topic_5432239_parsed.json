      "body": "Maybe. We cant comprehend the capabilities of a platform once we see its potential for adoption. Best example is frienster which are overtaken by facebook with their cool and good system for socials. Who knows if Hive can overtake leading competitors in the field of gaming, nft and other related application of their blockchain.",

      "body": "Nothing seems underrated in the crypto space unless and until it is called for it. HIVE is nothing new and as it is just forked project it’s literally Mirror copy of steemit and nothing more. I don’t understand why it is that way considering steemit was already in place, it was doing great for the bloggers and they paid handsome money. They even invented the upvote bots, whole community was chasing those stems. So the counter question is what Hive is doing about it? What’s really changed in this form that should interest everyone.",

That token is on Coinmarketcap too.They provide a platform for free lancers from many areas and you should check it. I consider that platform is better than the hyve blog you shared.",

This platform is 6 years old, I was testing it like 4 years ago and it was unknown at that moment and its even more unknown now for majority of crypto community. Not even talking about normal people. I doubt it will ever take off.",

      "body": "IMO yes.Did you know how many things of blockchain currently? but most of the time we only know the popular chain (ETH, BSC, Polygon) and some top 100/200 token. Meanwhile other chain who are really under that rank, even they have more better transaction speed still can't be recognize.Better technology doesn't mean can be beat the old tech.",
