  "content": "https://imgur.com/a/7bgh5PbThat's more than one months PM sent list from my account. I removed one of them because I do not want anyone to know about it. It's very personal between the user and me.@ moderator/admin (Theymos/Cyrus), Please investigate the sent message. You have my permission.Most of the message were 2 way communication between users and me in different subjects. Some of them were sent to invite them in any of my campaign which I noticed many campaign manager do. Treatment should be the same for me and others. I believe it's the same.Hardly one or maximum two from the messages (apology if the number is more or less because I did not check the number of messages on the screenshots even who to sent them except the personal one), I sent to project ower/s asking them to fix any error on their ANN or any post, with that I offered them my service.I have full respect to the moderation body of the forum, I believe banning me for past 7 days was not a mistake, they must have a very good reason for it. But with due respect I would like to know specifically which message was reported and resulted me to be banned from the forum. I would not mind if you PM me, in-fact please PM me with the information because I do not want others to see him bad.I need to know the information because as a campaign manager I communicate with many members in the forum, on public or on private. I have my well wishers with haters. For my safety and to conduct my business safely, I need to know who don't stand along with me and need to be careful about them not sending PM again.I also want to know is there any scoring system for banning like, x number of report to reach x points and the system automatically issue a certain days or months of ban to a user. (This can be answered public)Cheers,",

      "body": "@Royse777 hardly anyone will give information on who made the denouncements. What you have to do is be more careful in the PMs you send, in order to avoid them being too similar to each other.That said, I think that a ban, especially users who have been on the forum for a long time, should not be evaluated in the same way.A user with a long history of good reputation (generally speaking), can even commit a lapse, but this should not serve to simply be banned. It should be avoided that personal disagreements jeopardize the work done to build a good reputation here on the forum. Something that is not easy and takes a long time.Therefore, evaluating a possible banning of a newbie should be different from a legendary one. It is not a question of being biased, but rather a more careful analysis of the situation. Banning cannot be based on a simple rule of two reports equals seven days. It should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, especially with experienced users. One question, before being banned is the user informed? If it isn't, it should. I think there should always be the opportunity for the user to defend himself.Either way, I understand that sometimes this isn't easy, in such a huge forum with thousands of users. But, I think that in cases of banning, one should always analyze more carefully, especially with many years of forum.",

Mods Hilarious is just being nice for giving a warning message on some case like this but what was done is really sufficient for ban or else it will be lifted immediately if the decision is not right.The OP and even the majority here doesn’t know about this rule. This is a lesson learned for the existing rules towards it which is a 2 PM report is sufficient for the temp ban. What kind of further evaluation needed if the user who submit the PM report really didn’t like the PM he received without his consent?",

I guess logically, a user will be banned if he is the one who goes first with DMs to other members with kind of spam, scam, incentivized contents.If you want attack someone and use 100 accounts to DM that one, it does not make any sense and the receiver won't be banned. You won't be banned because you're answering others.Who goes first is most important if the procedure is solid.",
