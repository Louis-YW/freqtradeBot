      "body": "For cases like this, it is best and easiest to use some JSON library that would create the string itself instead of trying to hardcode it yourself. In that case you just create your \"array\" with the addresses and amounts and simply call the ToString method to get the result you want to pass to the commandline. That should take care of all the quotes, brackets, etc. needed for a correct value.",
