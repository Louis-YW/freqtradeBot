Although bitcoin already isn’t manipulatable because it is already in decentralized circulation but aside this if it wasn’t the big portfolio will still have the manipulating power. For example an investors who DCA by buying $1k of bitcoin weekly would still need close to a year to Match the manipulating power someone who buys like 1btc will definitely have a bigger market manipulation power",

And I'm not sure if it will reduce some kind of monopoly or control by entities.Bitcoin is too big right now to be controlled by anyone, not by government and certainly by whales. Just used DCA as you see fit and obviously, it's more of the most effective strategy that we can used here as a investors. You don't have to overthink that manipulation, just go simply invest at your own phase. If there is manipulation, it's not going to last in this market.",

Recently, price movements are institution-led. The entry of financial products offered by traditional institutions changed the playing field. Indeed, DCA somehow tempers the degree of monopsony in the market. Furthermore, the DCA approach somehow makes retail investors perpetual buyers, but what's $10, $20, $50 compared to hundreds of millions, even more than a billion, of a single purchase by institutions?",

In terms of buying Bitcoin, although their weekly purchase amount is higher between $20 and $100 in the case of regular DCA method, but those who make big investments and have institutions buy Bitcoin for a long time and invest in Bitcoin. Maybe they buy Bitcoin two to three times in their holdings and invest. And among those who follow the DCA method and are buying Bitcoin regularly, you can notice El Salvador because they buy an average of one Bitcoin per day according to the DCA method. And I think small Bitcoin DCA method investment holders play a large role in buying Bitcoin in the market.",

If a thousand small scale investors DCA $150 worth of Bitcoin a week, it's going to make up $1.5k worth of Bitcoin coming from a simple DCA investment that cost a single investor close to nothing.",

I also agree with you, and at the same time, I get the point that the OP is making: those $10 and hundreds of dollar DCA purchases from single investors around the world might not appear to be much if looked at individually, but if the total number of people doing that little purchase is added together, there will be a big number that sums up that can't just easily be overlooked. It won't be anything or cause any effect like the single purchase of institutional investors with larger capital, but it's still worth it to reduce how much those investors hold and control.",

With DCA, investors get to buy Bitcoin at different prices (in decreasing or increasing order) so that they don't miss out the opportunity to buy at a certain low, for example if the price is falling, most investors might not just want to put in all their money to buy but would rather invest bit by bit while watching for the price to dip more. Some people too invest using DCA strategy because of how their income is paid, if they receive monthly salary, they can only invest after they get paid.",

To me, this can't distract or affect the market in anyway because Bitcoin market is a volatile one that doesn't rely on one source or something to surge down or high the price. The current price of Bitcoin is depreciating but El Salvador is keeping on buying Bitcoin everyday, why can't the market remain going higher as the case may be or to what rumors are saying, No.",

They have different strategies to accumulate Bitcoin, though a few institutional investors follow the DCA strategy. This strategy works very well for us as small investors. Everyone we are involved with has some business or job, so we don't have big funds to accumulate Bitcoin at once. Besides, it's less risky to invest; DCA reduces pressure on investors.
