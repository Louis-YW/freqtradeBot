  "content": "The ideas of many countries not supporting bitcoin has affects many individuals trading like in my country crypto currency is banned and we can't trade anything relating crypto with our local account. Because use our local account to do deposits and withdraw backs to our local account but the government give orders to block and seized income anyone traced with activities of bitcoin and altcoins. So is really big concerns trying to initial fair trade with people or even host a campaign.Like one of my experience, I was doing P2P from financial apps to my BTC wallet and use it to trade, then when I want to withdraw, I also use P2P to my local account. One day I withdraw $300 to my account and it was block by my bank, I didn't have access to my money, when I went to complain I was issued a threat to arrest me if i continue with that activities of crypto currency and since then my money was seized but someone help me to sort it out. So we really facing this challenge to trade bitcoin.What do you suggests to solve or amend easy way trading? With our government policies",

      "body": "If the banks in your country enforce the laws so strictly and block your account for only $300, then you simply have to exclude them as an option when trading with Bitcoin. One of the options is to trade personally face to face, because that is the only way in which you completely bypass the system, unless your government gets involved and instead of a legitimate buyer you meet an undercover government agent.Another option that comes to mind is to try to get a card that you can use to withdraw cash from an ATM, some CEXs offer such an option, and there is also a more expensive option in the form of anonymous bank cards. However, even that is not a 100% safe way to stay under the radar, because if your government wants to know who is withdrawing cash from the ATM, believe me, they will find a way to find out.",

And that way we were able to continue our trades without the bank noticing anything suspicious. Although, I don't know how strict the ban is in your country but I believe this might work.",

You are asking here for help to break your law. The only solution here is to follow the law or leave your country because doing tricks to just to invest invest in crypto while you are clearly doing a crime is not a good idea. You are just making yourself in a tight spot by having an investment that thereâ€™s no certainty that you can benefit on it in the future because it can be seized by the government when you caught.",

Likely the person that you sold the coin to labelled the transaction to be for coin buying,, which it supposed not to be, you should have always warn the buyers not to label the transaction to be for crypto transaction. My suggestion is for you to move out of the country until crypto become legal, or you should just continue a decentralized way to exchange it while telling the buyer not to include crypto payment or anything related in the transaction.Some people can go to the extent of using the coin to first buy gift card and then sell the gift card for local currency in return. There can be other ways like coins supported ewallets if your country supports some of them.",

So use a VPN, to access cryptocurrency exchanges that are located in other countries.

With our government policiesSome of the easiest ways to trade cryptos as per fiat to crypto exchange and vice versa has been using p2p services. Its just the most you could do and in that, having an escrow in the form of an exchange is one of the best means as it indeed protects your identity by ensuring you stay anonymous while transacting and protects your interest as well which includes, getting a fair price for your coins.Doing it p2p without an escrow isn't advised but still okay if you've got a well known vendor.",

For any crypto it is clearly illegal, of course foreign fiat currency also has the same status unless I change it to my country's fiat.About your problem, I think it's very important for you to know how bitcoin regulation is in your country. If it's illegal to trade and invest and as a means of payment, then I don't expect you to force yourself to keep buying at any cost. If it really is completely banned there, then try to find safe place that is crypto friendly if you want to get involved as a trader or investor.",

Because when you want to convert it to your bank or fiat currency through trading, you will be in trouble if your bank authority asks you to show the source of your money, even than it be in cash or digital banking system. So in my opinion if you want to use it when it is illegal in your country then you have to use that risk, Also, what I mean by other oops is to go somewhere else where it's legal",

Fortunately, I live in a country that allows crypto as a commodity asset, even though it's not allowed for payments, but I can still manage my money with crypto easily.Obviously you don't have a chance to make legal transactions, but you may be able to make crypto transactions illegally, there will be loopholes for sure, but it will be risky.",
