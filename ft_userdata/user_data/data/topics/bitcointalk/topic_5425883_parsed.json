  "content": "The bad thing about this is that I am sure that the majority of the population will believe it. The digital euro, with which they are going to control all payments and be able to put an expiry date on it or block it if they feel like it, they have started to sell it as something that is convenient for the population, of course.Digital euro: a common European projectOn the subject of privacy, I'm laughing my head off:QuoteThe first one is privacy. In our public consultation, 43% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of the digital euro, well ahead of other features. So it is clear that if we want the digital euro to be attractive, it needs to be designed in a way that meets people's privacy expectations.We seek to ensure high standards of privacy for digital euro users. But full anonymity – such as offered by cash – does not appear a viable option in my opinion. It would contravene other public policy objectives such as ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules and combating the financing of terrorism. And it would also make it virtually impossible to limit the use of the digital euro as a form of investment – for example via holding limits or tiered remuneration – for which identities of users need to be known.We should at least provide a level of privacy equal to that of current electronic payment solutions.So, no privacy. They want us to believe that with the digital Euro there will be privacy because they won't publish every transaction we make with our name and surname on a website accessible to everyone. And no, obviously they are not going to do that so that your neighbour or a thief knows what you spend your money on, but they are going to know 24/7 what you spend every penny on.Who are they kidding? I don't even know why I ask myself that question, because it's obvious: the majority of the population who will welcome it as something positive and a modernisation.What is the advantage in terms of convenience over paying by card? None. A lot to lose and nothing to gain.",

Completely expected when comes to the CBDCs.The only question I have if whether our financial information will only be available for government surveillance or there would be some relationship between the government and companies (so the latter can continue to profit off our payment habits, etc).Either way, it is a quite a distopic situation if you ask me and another reason to keep some satoshis in our power.

The European Central Bank have promised to give high standard of privacy in one hand and with the other hand, they would collect this privilege with anti-money laundering rules. I am very glad that Christine Lagarde acknowledged that privacy is one of the cardinal consideration of the public when it comes to digital money. Although they might be able to convince some persons in the Eurozone that the digital euro promotes privacy but they wouldn't be able to deceive everybody. The only currency that can guarantee to a large extent the privacy of its users is Bitcoin and these anti-Bitcoin forces knows the truth.",

Although I see that both you and he are focusing on the difference between current bank payment systems, such as transfers and cards, and CBDCs. But that is not the crux of the matter. The heart of the matter is the difference between cash and CBDCs. Big Data is big business today. If I go and spend €500 in a clinic and then €100 on medicines in a pharmacy, I keep privacy if I pay in cash. Paying with cards or CBDCs, don't be surprised if your health or life insurance is more expensive.",

Paying with cards or CBDCs, don't be surprised if your health or life insurance is more expensive.your thinking that CBDC is a one level system where \"government\" /business has your life history.i have seen a few CBDC and the main ones that are linking to the EU/asia m-bridge. are systems where there are 3 levels of \"wallets\" where the bottom level.. your $100- $500 spend amounts are non KYC.which is the same as a virtual visacard/giftcard service offering. there is no much information about how these eu/asia CDBC set about selling the data of the mid-top wallets. so im going to presume they definitely will. but i know the technology exists that could stop them unless you give consent. and laws could stop it too.. EG you have to use a \"cashback/points/interest\" account to give consent to sell data for those rewards.that said, even in the non kyc wallet. just having a bland number as your account address. obviously retailers that receive digital cash from it, can buy records of even blank ID associated with a sale on their side that did have a name on their retailer delivery service..  thus give that bland number account a name indirectlybut thats where signed messages can show easy proof of accepting terms. where a good government would require a user to consent or reject a businesses ability to buy your datawhich is what people should lobby for governments to include features of in a CBDC",

Large chunk of the rights could only be taken away from criminals or people who deserve to be in jail. This is why decentralized cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is better alternative and should be further developed to automatically or via consensus unmask the identity of dangerous criminals on its system. If it's impossible to do so, you can simply blacklist or tag crime money with proper proof-based labelling of the crime it's involved in.

It's a lie and a false promise.2. The big centralized organization might do the best it can to protect the user's data, but at some point, the the hackers will find a way to break its defense systems and steal the data. This always happens to the centralized systems. Sooner or later.Lagarde promising high levels of privacy but no anonymity is a complete nonsense. You can't have privacy without anonymity.The Euro CBDC won't solve the economic problems of the European Union...in the US\"bank secrecy act\" does not mean your funds are secret and private.. the bank secrecy act is not the act that gives you privacy rights.you cannot quote you have financial privacy rights by claiming ant law/act. the bank secrecy act is not what it seemsyou have no privacy rights i regards to fiat, never haveyou NEVER had privacy when it comes to bank accountsbank notes and balance are not your property. they are patented and owned by the bank and its their product to take out of circulation or licence/permit usage of to people under their termsmodern money has NEVER meant privacy as a human right or property ownership.its at most a presumed lack of exposing transparently to the public as a privilege which the act gives the banks. ...thats why bitcoin was invented to be differentas for thinking that government(politicians(ministers, senators,congress men)) are watching your every payment. this is not truebanks/payment facilitators/custodians watch and flag suspicious stuff, but that does not mean they are watching everyone with human eyes. they only look with bank employee eyes at the suspicious stuff, and if highly suspicious they send that to regulators. yes the banks/payment facilitators/custodians keep your data for 6+ years and sell your data and can be hacked. so understand that your main fears are with banks/payment facilitators(custodians) and their regulator parents. not really the governmenti know that my fiat transactions are not seen by my UK prime minister or his deputies(ministers/mps) my transactions are stored at the bank/custodian level where only if i do something suspicious would some bank appointed 'sherriff' see my spending habits regulators are not politicians. regulator CEO's are ex bankers.when a CEO is a banker and not a politician then it means the regulators are parent of the bank cartel not the child of a government cartel. they simply wear a government sheriffs badge but work for the banknote this is to clarify the reality of how money works and how the different layers are set out, as oppose to the tin foil \"gov spies on us\" mantrahere in the UKthe UK treasury is owned by HM(his majesty) meaning the kingthe UK bank of england is owned by HM treasury(again the king)the king does not want to day-to-day manage the public. so allows a management company(government) to run the day-to dayevery 4-5 years the management contract gets renewed and he king allows the public to vote on who is the CEO of the public management company(PM) by voting in their local management team. where the majority translates to the CEO of the management company being aligned to a certain partythe management company(government) dont want to day-to-day manage finance enforcement/oversight. so they delegate/outsource that to a different management group (regulators) which are usually ex-bank bossesin the USmany people think citizens own the government and the government are just a service company to the people where the people have shares on the management company(government). senators and congressmen are voted in as a management company whos members(citizens) of the company(government) are the public(citizens are customers of a business that allow members to vote on regional sales reps every 4 years to manage the business and set rules on how the company allows its members to use the company)(citizens pay a membership fee(tax) to then be offered services and products of the business)government dont want to run the day-today of finance. so they delegate that to a board of trustees of a trust(fed reserve) whos beneficiary is the US treasury.the fed reserve* prints money and shares it out to commercial banks. and its the commercial banks that day-to-day manage ithe finances of the members(citizens)*in the US the president nominates attorneys and economists to be the board members(trustees) of the fed reserve and they are then voted in by senators to report activity to congressmenthe fed reserve is not a company in the normal sense. but a \"trust\" where the board are the trustees and the US treasury is the beneficiary. meaning the fed res is owned by no one and the treasury reaps the benefits while being day to day managed by attorneys and economists. not politiciansthe us treasury is a agent(child/subsidiary/contractor) of the government who have another(child/subsidiary/contractor) agent called the US mint that print money. bank notes are patents/products of the us mint->treasury->governmentthe US mint distribute out the money to commercial banks(businesses) run by private bank managers, not politicianswho are supervised by ex bankers promoted in to supervisory roles(regulators)and now you see why FIAT around the world is so screwed up",
