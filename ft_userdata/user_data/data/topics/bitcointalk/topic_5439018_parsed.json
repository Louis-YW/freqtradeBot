I am not doubtful to say this fact of Internet connection to the world.There are people who use Internet in good or bad ways but because they are different types of people. Good people have their good ways and bad people have their bad ways but it is not responsibility of Internet to solve all those problems. If society accept Internet, use it, governments and citizens must build up supplementary things around Internet to make this space a better and safer place for all. Unfortunately we can not completely prevent bad things happen in life.",

But if he's know what he do and continue to hold his coin until 2021, he already earn 3x from his initial investment.Not too far, weeks ago, people said it is stupid to buy Bitcoin at $16,000 and now they are regretting about that. I don't think Bitcoin won't fall to under $20,000 again but my stance is if you believe in Bitcoin, you can DCA it as regular activities for your investment in Bitcoin.You don't have to find, ask yourself where is the bottom of each bear market. It is unnecessary because if you want to find an absolute bottom before you buying bitcoin, you will miss the bottom when it takes off already.Meanwhile of finding a bottom, you probably use your fund for other things that only reduce the total net fund you spend for investment. If you DCA, your total net fund will be bigger.",

And if we focus on Bitcoin, they would be the ones that take advantage of it to buy more instead of crying. Look back at the history of Bitcoin and see what happened to those who cried and sold at the bottom of the market and what happened to those who held on and bought more. Bitcoin has unique properties and has been very profitable, but if you cry instead of trying to see the opportunity at the bottom, you stand to lose.",

Whether it be scams or people telling you to get rid of your crypto. Once it goes away, you will come out stronger than before because you will have found out that you have defeated it from within you.",

By comparing, you always get lower, despite all your recent victories. Learn to compare your present self with your past self. Who you have become and who you were—if you are happy with your changes, go ahead and do not stop. The second way to keep your head up is to compare your problems with those of people who are much worse off. You have a house, and someone sleeps on the street; you have food, but others do not even have water.People tend to misunderstand their happiness.
