  "content": "I am selling this beautiful Spring Godess NFT for 0.56 BTC to raise money for my crypto project. You can view the QR version of the image here:https://discord.com/channels/1169215407840841858/1169218039061938287/1171743584664428605The image exists as an NFT on the BTC blockchain. Can it be copied or screenshot? No because both QR and Original versions of the images are encoded with BTC public key (open with notepad and scroll to bottom to view public key)Can't anyone just change the encoding? No because the original (version without QR) is kept private, so then the QR version and original version won't match. How to buy:Message me or send me a direct message on discord. What will you receive after purchase?Original image with encodingQR image for resellingPaper Wallet with Private key connected to the NFT image.",
