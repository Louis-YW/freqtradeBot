I keep holding and sell when I find the price to be high or when a new ATH is being reached. For now from experts view the bear market is supposed to stay long with volatility level supporting trade moves. So, this is a right time to make an entry.",

How often do you buy and how long do you plan to hold?You have to wait a long time for your thoughts to come true.Observing Bitcoin's history and taking expert advice suggests that Bitcoin will take a good position very soon.But you might be lucky enough to be able to invest in Bitcoin at a very low price.May you hold on for a long time. Never lose patience Bitcoin will surely fulfill your dream.If we invest in bitcoins we cannot keep it for a long time. If the price increases a little and from there some amount of profit is actually sold But we don't have that energy to keep for long time because we can't invest for long time due to family.A little profit has to be sold and spent on family work.",

How often do you buy and how long do you plan to hold?As a usual approach, I just accumulate, if possible, regardless of what's the price. Depends also on the budget.There's no specific period for how long should I plan to hold. It really depends on how I looked at a certain trend. But one thing is for sure, I can't afford to hold it for years or plan on holding it within that long timeframe due to the fact that, there are several factors and considerations why should I sell at some point. Sometimes even though I like to hold, there will always be a time that I can't follow it.",

If someone has sold everything during the last spike, then good, this is another period to accumulate. And if you didn't sold then continue to amass because the price is cheap. As to what is my preferred price to sell my stash, hard to answer, we all know how scarce bitcoin is, so sooner or later the demand is going to grow. Very difficult unless there is a very important reason to sell your BTC.",

How often do you buy and how long do you plan to hold?I also do DCA but in the next cycle or when the market overheats and we see that we break the highs, it is not bad to trim a little of what you have invested and take advantage to spend some bitcoin, because waiting for half a million or a million can take a long time. Having 2% of a bitcoin is not much for now but as you accumulate more and it becomes a large percentage of your net worth it is worth thinking about what I am telling you. The fact that bitcoin is in circulation also gives it value. As popular as HODL is, if no one transacted with bitcoin, it would be worthless.",

In investment terms, we have to put something in the coin that is worth holding on to, so that at any given moment we can see a suitable return, you are doing something right in bitcoin, it just takes time, because right now may not be the right time to let go.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on September 07, 2022, 11:28:07 PMJust wondering how everyone else invests in Bitcoin? How often do you buy and how long do you plan to hold?Many people do different strategies in carrying out investments, but almost generally people make purchases when prices are low, sometimes people make long-term investments to increase their profit portfolio, but it's also not wrong to use short-term to make small profits, the most important thing is how prepared we are in carrying out investments, both using long-term and short-term",

I would wait for a more realistic price if I were you, like $100k or even below. $50-$100k is a nice target I think. If you are very young then sure, wait for $500k but don't get mad if it takes multiple decades.You were wise to start DCA'ing now when the prices are low. A lot wiser than who started DCA'ing when the price was $60k+.",

I then sell some coins to make a profit and I keep some for the next all-time-high. (also buying more when the price drop)",

That is the purpose of investing because we want to take profits within a certain period and not sell our assets if we are not in a situation that really needs money.I also buy using DCA like you because I want to sell bitcoin at the new ATH price later. And I also know that it won't happen any time soon so I can hold it in for a while. Maybe I'll hold it for 1 or 2 years later but it depends on when the price will hit the new ATH.",

You should of course use money that you don't use in the future. I expect ATH to be reached in the near future maybe not more than 1 year, but it also depends on the state of the market and the state of the world economy. and there will be a lot of manipulation done by whales.",
