They boast that someone will get back to you about your email ticket in 12 hrs. It has been over 72 hrs and when i speak to the online support chat (for urgent matters only, a link in the email support ticket email) they say \"their relevant team needs more time investigating the case\". There's no evidence the funds left the exchange. The blockchain shows it went straight into my funded account and into the Bitget wallet with millions of dollars of crypto. This is the first red flag in my opinion and i wont be using them again. This type of shady practices screams of insolvency or a hack they are trying to cover up.

I just don't like blanket accusations and guesswork.I agree... would like to see some additional evidence as well. Their way of marketing themselves here is kind of shady, however. Most exchanges or projects that try to do what they're doing (paying accounts to slip in references to Bitget here and there) end up scamming their users.Would also like to see evidence of their campaign, which very well might exist, but I don't know where. For example, these accounts have all been talking about Bitget recently in an out-of-context fashion:Vivageneviv - 55 postsananyabushra - 30 postsZee27 - 29 postsBitcoinpoly - 21 postsCryptobabe - 15 postsShuuuuu - 14 postsThey're just cramming in talk about how reputable the exchange is in places where it doesn't need to be, makes me wonder how much they're getting paid to do this. Probably not much, $1 a post at the very max.",

Also curious to know if there's illegalities involve with this since its hard to choose over those old reputable exchange and maybe there's something strange happening here on why they decide to deposit such huge amount on new exchange.",

It's not even something they're sure of. It's just a hearsay and OP ran with it. I can't fathom why they did it, knowing that the exchange is making efforts to get the issue resolved in the first place. Such¬† an unbridled display of uncharitable comment can ruin a business. We can't say because this is social media anyone can say whatever they feel like saying and get away with it without getting sued. I think it's about time online people¬† started getting sued for intentionally spreading lies in order to ruin others. I know it's going to be more difficult tracking people here to physical addresses unlike in Facebook and Twitter where it's already done.",

They certainly did not gain their influence exclusively with good and accurate information, and for a monetary reward, they will publish anything. Their modus operandi is to publish bombastic news the real truth is not the most important for influencers.Once again, to be clear, it is not my intention to defend this exchange, even based on my intuition, I think they are closer to the description \"scam\" than trusted. But that's just my opinion, and I can't make accusations just based on my feelings. Of course, there is no possibility for me to send any deposit there, certainly not $16m like some smart influencers who share pieces of advice.",
