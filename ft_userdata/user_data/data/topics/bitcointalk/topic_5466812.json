  "content": "I read that one more bitcointalk user was scammed there, so I'm creating a scam accusation.I want to warn moderators, that this is not classic scam accusation, this is about SHADY casino here. I'll explain later what I mean.I'm talking about this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465617.0Let's go step by step. 4th September - the date it was created.Bitcointalk users discuss how good it is (lorem ipsum talk - i don't know how to describe it). I decided to give it a chance.5th September - I was scammedSo my message was: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465617.msg62799922#msg62799922Yes, I lost money by myself, but I lost them because of NO WITHDRAWAL in this casino. Let's go further:8th September - All 1k Promo Codes for Bitcointalk were used in less then 24hourshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465617.msg62814206#msg62814206Whether they were abused or the casino decided to void them. VERY SUSPICIOUS.12th September - One more user had issue with getting email to withdraw moneyhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465617.msg62830061#msg62830061Also, casino told that they DON'T HAVE CURACAO LICENSE, so they have not rights to ask for KYC, unless to scam more users.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465617.msg62832891#msg6283289113th September - they changed tactic, from no sending email to doing KYChttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465617.msg62838391#msg6283839114th September - new bitcointalk user scammed, no email as well9 days - they don't care about fixing the email newsletter.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465617.msg62844094#msg62844094Some of bitcointalk users talking bs about Philippine license, design, domain name - are those reviews fake and bought buy a casino? Also, this user decided to play their game and completed verification, what's now?Verification:Dear user, verification can take up to 7 bank days (but usually it's not longer than 1-2 days) - guys, they have like 10 players, it'll hook 15 mins to verify someone.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465617.msg62845467#msg62845467Withdrawal:Withdrawal process consists of two stages: internal confirmation of the withdrawal request and the crediting time frames after the transaction has been processed. Internal confirmation is manual and the requests are processed in turn, therefore, it can take from several minutes to several hours (from 10 minutes up to 72 hours)You should close the topic, as at least 2 bitcointalk users were scammed by this platform. It took them 10 days. And how many will get scammed in future, when they'll win something there?? Shady casino doesn't care about users wellness, right after my issue with email, richy.casino representative create promo-code to all bitcointalk community. He/she knows that casino doesn't have withdrawal opportunities, but their target is to get ours money. That's it.",

They just don't have that option. Due to technical issues. And I won't create this topic if:1) Representative answered on my reply in his thread instead of pushing his \"promo\"2) Noone else got the same situation as I got. Maybe, I'm not right about the Phillipine-based license. But seeing a non-trustworthy crypto casino that requires KYC because they did the wrong math with bonuses...As I replied in the casino topic, the casino is probably run by 1-2 persons, who are very new to this business and their goal is not to create an astonishing product but to earn some money and sell/close it.",

Although my DT is very weak, so it might appear intermittently, but the tag will appear in Default Trust at least until the next DT1 changes. On top of this the representative has not logged in for the last three days when there are scam allegations pending and we have not heard from anyone who has been able to withdraw. I've seen that you have also red tagged him but it appears as untrusted feedback as you are not in DT. I recommend that you make a custom trust list or you will never be in DTIt looks like an exit scam.",

But it's not just that withdrawals haven't worked for many days because of alleged technical problems, look at this:Quote from: Learn Bitcoin on September 13, 2023, 01:19:32 AMI have checked this platform and tried to sign up using their promo code. During the signup process, I used the BTT200FS promo code, which says promo code not found or something like that. But my sign-up was successful. So, I tried to use the 2nd promo code, but I cannot find where I should enter the promo code. The support button does not work, so I could not contact support. I tried to explore the platform further, and I don't know why, the tournament looks extremely fake, and some wagered to claim the top prize. Either it's their casino's insider or a bot setup that will wager automatically to beat real players. It has been handled from the beginning in a totally unprofessional way, and probably run only by a couple of people as has been said in the thread.

If a platform has already built a reputation and has run for a couple of years, its management has to think twice before doing such things. Most of the new platforms do not have management and are run by a single person, and they plan to scam as soon as they reach their target.
