  "content": "Bitcoin Class in the Church 14th August, 2o22. (Christian Youth in the Digital World)On the 14th August, 2022, I taught my church members about bitcoin through a topic from the Sunday School Manuel, Christian Youth in the Digital World. In the class I taught them the basic concepts of bitcoin and it definitions and other digital tools and devices which is used to navigate the digital world (internet). The class was divided into two adult and children. And I took the adult class and I started with the explanation of Christian Youth in the Digital World, that is how Christian should used the digital world to benefit themselves and also to enhance the gospel, instead of using to defraud people, watching pornography and evil things etc and the tools and devices (Mobile phones, Laptops, Desktops, IPhones etc, then Social Media). What you do in life and your appearance also influence others to go to church.  Then  I started teaching Bitcoin with some related concepts like decentralized, Trustless, p2p, digital, currency, Immutable, decentralized digital currency, space, ecosystem, Disintermediated, Distributed, blockchain, cryptocurrency, Hard Capped, Censorship resistant, nodes, Real estate, Secure personal information. These were some of the things I taught in the Sunday School Class on Sunday. And the women with the Pastor were very happy that I taught them such vital information that them have not aware of. If you want to read the Topic from the Sunday School Manuel, go to a nearby Church of God Mission INT.L. Page 30 - 35. you will understand everything there.",

(The majority of church goers here I'd say were under 20 or over 50-60 so it'd be quite an interesting group to educate on bitcoin - I've seen churches have a lot more variety of ages but those seem to be a lot bigger and have more of a chance for younger adults to acquire social contacts like older congregation members do).",

It is also good that your church and your pastor allowed you to use the Sunday opportunity for teaching about Bitcoin. It is a great opportunity considering that many of the members would usually flock to the church on that day for regular services. You'd get a bigger audience this way.While I don't like that Bitcoin will be appreciated with blind faith or that people would immediately support it just because their pastors or religious leaders say so, I agree that it could indeed be used to bring about good things, which must be what the gospels are all about.",

Bitcoin can be discussed in any group of people if the people are ready to listen to the teachings. So I don't know from what angle you are saying that this thread should be move to off-topic. Please give more points. The point you give is religious bias. And please don't bring religious to bitcoin discussion. Bitcoin can be discussed in anywhere.",

But one of the greatest challenges of these youths is inaccessibility to the right information. Due to the level underdevelopment and poverty in most developing countries, they become cheap target or prey to fraudsters and get-rich-quick promoters. Hence, most of the information they receive about Bitcoin are diluted and sometimes untrue. Thank you OP for striving to give the appropriate information about Bitcoin to the church congregation.",

This is a good thing that people in church be made aware and given proper information about the digital space to nip in the bud any misconception that may arise due to being too religious or over spiritual. Some over spiritual and religious persons can sometimes become too rigid in thinking and not easily accept some new innovations. To a young brother in church who suddenly begins to do well financially because he invested in crypto, some other uninformed members of the church may have a misconception that he has involved himself with something fraudulent when they hear crypto (I site my example in consideration of my environment, it may not be the same with your environment). This sort of brief bitcoin class that you have somehow introduced into your Sunday school lectures can go a long way in clearing the misconception that anybody who involves in crypto is a fraudulent individual. Christians can still be involved in cryptocurrency, It is not a sin.",

Is it good to teach digital to christian youth? I did not teach to adopt the currency but I taught them to inform them to know that bitcoin does exist and in the proccess if anyone is interested they can adopt it but it is not by force. Yes Bitcoin is also related to the topic was hand. Because the topic is \"Christian Youth in the Digital World\".

I am not a pastor but a teacher in the church. You don't get the connection bitcoin has with the topic provided? Jesus Christ of Nigeria. The Topic is saying \"Christian Youth in the Digital World\" I thank God that you said in you own understanding, because not all topics are meant for understanding but only for the spirited men and women. you mean I don't respect the church because I inform them about bitcoin? Are you for real? From your perspective everything is wrong.my comrade, I did not do bad for informing the church about bitcoin so they will not fall for the fraudster in the digital world. Christians use the digital world (internet) as well. Please learn more from others thanks",
