  "content": "Dear all interested in the implementation of blockchain technology in the whole world.I have submitted a proposal for the implementation of blockchain technology in Denmark with the goal of improving the Danish economy, increasing security against hacking and foreign cyber attacks, and increasing freedom and transparency for the whole world. Blockchain technology also has the potential to contribute to creating more justice in the world and globalization through its decentralized and transparent structure. In addition, the technology has the potential to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and thus help combat climate change, and much more.I only have 180 days to pass the proposal, so I need all the help I can get. If you are interested in seeing blockchain technology implemented in Denmark, I urge you to share this message as widely as possible. This can be done through social media, personal contacts, and other ways of spreading the message.The reason I say 180 days: In Denmark, you first have to do the same 50,000 before it can move on within 180 days. Implementation will take place over a period of time until 2030. If the proposal moves forward.I think it must be in all of our interests.I know it's going to be hard but food your home I think I know we can do it. I have already gathered some strong investor here in Denmark and will only same several. My plan is we in parts the news, it will only put more focus here in Denmark too and there with press the news concepts to send it and in that way the proposal will achieve its goal.Thank you for your help and support.Sincerely,Dennis VicedalThere will also be links to the proposal and in addition, there will also be a link to a facebook share. In next week.",

It is the first law in Denmark and believes that it must be in everyone's interest for Denmark to implant blockchain technology, both technically, security-wise, price-wise. It will be a joint effort from both private individuals, companies. But I need your help, even if there are no people who do not live in Denmark. But if people share my words. Will it put pressure on the news agencies and thus get it in the news and thus get the Danish population to vot.",

Blockchain technology also has the potential to contribute to creating more justice in the world and globalization through its decentralized and transparent structure.

Blockchain is really just a buzzword if you are not getting to any specifics. And then you are saying that it combat climate change. How exactly would your decentralized ledger do that?",

Could you link to your proposal so we would read about specifics of what you are talking about or is that written in Danish? I for one am interested to know what you mean. I have seen so many ideas and their quality and ways to implement vary a lot. Some are more professional then others.",

Or explain why blockchain would be a better solution for everything then a database. You are doing same thing here.Also your suggestions are just too vague to implement, in fact they are so vague that i can guarantee that some of your suggestions are already implemented, even in Denmark. Explain how it would solve climate change for example. You are saying it would but you are not explaining how. Saying WEB3 isn't the answer.I can claim that Lego bricks are a solution to reduce CO2 emissions if i don't need to explain how.Did you know that people are still building most this tech to be ready for regulators. That working platform for CBDC that would meet the needs of regulations doesn't exist yet for example?",

Are there many projects that focus on making the climate better? In addition, with an open accounting book, we can get more transparency in CO2 emissions and stop pushing the numbers around and thus deal with reality.but no matter what, the price of almost all crypto will rise. So everyone who supports the publisher will win.I don't want to raise a lot of money for my company to solve the problem. But many professionals want people to help solve the problem, as well as a global effort.like climate change, cannot be solved by just one country",
