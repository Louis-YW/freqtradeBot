      "body": "We're really happy and appreciate you found these troubles which we haven't noticed before. We will get improvement if we do have some these problems. BUT there are some questions with these comments. 1. Is this website really legit?  As it seems everyone could leave comments on us without really doing business with us. This review website doesn't require any order proof or chat details for people submitting their reviews on the company. 2. All reviews or comments attaching no screenshot chat history with Jsbit staff, those word are blank until they showed proof. Bad reviews judge on non-sales sites are sometimes meanless. 3. We are one of the major partners of Bimain and MicroBT which could be verified directly by their management team. Truth is that we have no time for us to do scamming.",

So you're a partner of Bimain or Bitmain?QuoteWe do not have any official distributor or reseller anywhereWe receive various queries about whether X or Y is an “official distributor” or “official partner” of Bitmain’s products simply because X or Y claims to be an “official distributor” or “official partner” of Bitmain. We have no official representatives or distributors in any country. This brings us to the following point.Second:What's with the covid certificates and the speaker certificates and why is not your company name on it and why do you even had them on your website?Third:Why do you use stock and photoshopped pictures for your office?https://archive.ph/4pcTUhttps://theshopcity.com/about-all/cotton-head-office-cotton-on-corporate-offices-headquarters-phone-address.htmlFourth:Do you really have an address at 123 N Sunset Ave, City of Industry, CA 91744, and why, when you claim you're offering shipping only from China and Kuala Lumpur and you have no business license here?",

      "body": "1. Yes we are the partner of Bitmain and MicroBT. And we think that being the main sponsor of  the conference also shows our capability.2. The covid certificates and the speaker certificates you mentioned are the website bugs and we are working to solve that. 3. Unlike branded companies in the traditional industry and the manufacturer which may put lots of effort and funds doing marketing, all of our marketing materials like photos and videos are shooted by our own staffs, we didn't do much polish of these materials. 4. The Los Angeles address you mentioned is our actual business address which could be scheduled a visit. Besides, reselling ASICs doesn't mean that we have to store all our models in our own stock. We have warehouses in Los Angeles and Hong Kong, both warehouses stored over 3K units this month. And as we directly purchase from Bitmain and MicroBT, thus some orders over 100pcs could be directly sent from their overseas factories(Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan).Our official website may not be the perfect one you think it should be, but we are doing the real business in the crypto mining industry since 2019 in China. We totally understand that verifing us before your purchase is significant, and also we really appriciate the questions you came up with.",
