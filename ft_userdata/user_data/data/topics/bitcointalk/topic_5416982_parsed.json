If they're all putting up their prices in line with inflation then quite a lot should make a decent profit out of it (most financial institutions have put up staff wages by 20% already, that money will have to go somewhere as well as the extra money the banks are getting in higher interest - and other companies will have to get in to cover buying new stock and emergency funds just in case their stock increases in cost more rapidly than they expect).",

The key word is to diversify Agriculture. My mother taught me how to grow crops, from growing rice to vegetables for daily needs, sometimes when there was more we sold to middlemen who passed by. things like that are very petrified the family's economy.  By diversifying, it can reduce risk because the losses experienced will be covered by profits from other business segments so that risk will be reduced.  Well, investing in land and gold is indeed good, safe and low risk but it takes a long time to get the benefits, that's in my opinion",

Since Bitcoin investment didn't fail investors during the pandemic period, I guess it will not still fail investors in this global recession that is preparing to appear in the global world economy. Now that the governments is making some requirements to stop the massive inflation not to collapse their economy like the way pandemic collapsed some countries that didn't make Bitcoin legal in their country.I don't think, government officials will allow citizens to experience this inflation that is about to happen in the world to reduce people resources and cause hardship in the societies.",

Because I don't think this is about the COVID-19 pandemic, but entirely due to the inflation that is going on so that the decline in the price of any asset is still happening until now. And this is not the end of everything so choosing to stay in the investment is also a good choice and it will not bother investors at all.",

Similarly one should then create a basic fund into some fixed asset which will be used for your big expenses in near future which are obviously necessary like can be your marriage or a higher education degree or anything. Rest of the assets you shouldn't touch. An aggresive person might try to sell the assets to buy cheaper later but practically it's almost impossible so not a wise thing to do.",

If you can't take it anymore and there's a need to dispatch your assets and sell them for profit as you need cash, you have to do what you're up to and take that decision for your survival. But there are assets that are not worth selling at these times because they might grow more when things have become calm. So before doing that, you need to assess it if there's really a need in doing so.",

Also go for lucrative businesses in your area.Buying land here in our place is a very deadly move, but yes, I agree that it is a good investment in long term as well as Bitcoin. What I mean by deadly is because people here are starting to get interest on claiming land that's not even theirs because of poverty I guess or they just love easy money. You'll get killed if you'll fight for your land here in our place, that's why I delisted it in my investment list. Bitcoin is the safest I guess, just in case world war 3 would happen (let's hope not), and cash it out as much as you can because if I'm not mistaken, fiat is the most important thing to have when that happens.",

Honestly, I'm afraid to invest for now because I know the worst is yet to come and if you want to stay profitable, better to ready your cash and cash every opportunity that may come. We should really be ready for the recession, many says it's already happening but the worst will surely come.

But the best approach is to work double shift to find some online work - which is less hussle and more profitable - this kind of work can save all your outside expanse and you can cope up with the inflation. Better stop curing the situation and start working to  gain financial independence And also stop buying anything for now. If you have your assets in USDT for now, it's good to just try not to buy anything and wait for the world to calm down. No buying of real properties, bonds, and stocks. But it's a good thing to physically buy gold and silver once this heat stops because I think we are going back to currencies backed by gold and silver.",

They're buying everything that are right now cheaper than before.This is when they're building their wealth and getting richer. It's because that they've got cash ready to pick up those assets that are cheaper due to the situation. You're saying that don't buy anything but suggests to buy precious metals. As for real estate, I would agree to just wait a little bit longer because its bubble might burst and I'm surprise to see that most real estates in my location are expensive.",

Gold, real estate, bitcoin and anything which can retain its value when inflation goes completely out of control, and depending on how bad you think things could get even food could be a good store of value in the country where you live, but the most important thing is to avoid fiat and to have debts on fiat currencies.",
