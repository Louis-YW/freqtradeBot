  "content": "Well first of it's good news from the perspective of those who think it is fine if the government regulates bitcoin BUT, it's even better that they are at least allowing the use of bitcoin within the country. Similar news is coming from Taiwan, where all the crypto regulations are waiting to be handed over to MODA formerly known as the Ministry of Digital Assets. However, they will be regulating only the assets which are reputed and running since the beginning. To put it simply, they are more than happy to accept bitcoin and other coins and regulate them however they won't be accepting the NFTs because FSC thinks it is a noob asset and there are no fixed commodities/products that are connected with it. NFT can be a million things at the same time so more focus is to be given to bitcoin/alts. The main reason for the regulation?Well, Taiwan's decision to regulate the market is due to the fact of FTX collapse.QuoteTaiwan will soon have special legislation to regulate cryptocurrency and its Financial Supervisory Commission will be in charge.Huang Tien-mu confirmed this to lawmakers in Taiwan’s parliament during a hearing about global banking stability. Bloomberg initially reported the FSC was set to be announced as the regulator, citing sources in the legislature.Wayne Huang, co-founder and CEO of XREX, welcomed the news, saying that the industry can only grow when it's regulated.“Our next steps would be for the virtual asset service provider industry to collaborate with the FSC to define regulatory operations,” he said, saying one of the first steps is to form an industry self-regulatory body to help develop a set of rules.Reports say that the FSC won’t be regulating NFTs. Local Taiwan media quote the FSC's Huang as saying that as NFTs are still emerging as an asset class, it's too early to regulate them.“Due to the extendability and composability of NFTs, they can represent a broad spectrum of things ranging from commercial products to commodities to securities. Therefore the FSC likely needs more time to develop a proper set of NFT classification guidelines,” XREX's Huang adds.Taiwan has two financial regulators: the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan’s official name) and the FSC.The Central Bank regulates monetary policy and foreign exchange regulations while the FSC has a broad remit over everything from banking regulation, securities and futures, to anti-money laundering.“Getting the balance between experimentation and investor protection is the order of the day,” says Alex Liu, CEO of Maicoin.Some in Taiwan’s parliament had called for the newly-established Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) to be the chief crypto regulator, though others have said that the Ministry is relatively inexperienced in regulation compared to the FSC.“Militaries use guns and bullets. Let’s say they started using laser guns. Would you expect that to still fall under the defense ministry or a new department of directed energy weapons?” Liu remarked.FTX pushed Taiwan to regulateHistorically, Taiwan has taken a hands-off approach to crypto regulation only regulating the asset class under the framework of controlling money laundering.Last September, authorities approved 24 crypto platforms under the island’s AML compliance system.However, the collapse of FTX added a sense of urgency to Taiwan’s regulatory push as the Taiwanese were one of the largest users of the exchange per capita, attracted by its relatively high-interest rates for USD deposits compared to local banks.An initial framework for the law is expected by June, with an initial draft for later this year.Taiwan’s Crypto Industry Welcomes Regulatory Announcement",

      "body": "If only bitcoin is existing, it would have been better, but the more there are altcoins and many exchanges and other crypto organizations, this makes crypto to become more of a scam to people. The regulation shouldn't be only because of FTX, there are many ways crypto investors have lost money in the past, FTX was just one of it but they are many.What about Do Kwon, the Luna and UST scam.How about those algorithmic stable coins that have deppeged in the past. How about many fake projects.They all have to be regulated.Another reasons is because altcoins are securities. Securities are mostly and completely controlled by people. Scam and money misappropriation is possible with securities, they should be controlled as soon as possible.",

      "body": "After all, it's better than banning it or restricting it like China, so this regulation is a welcome development in my opinion. And as we all know, there are shitcoins everywhere, countries that are regulating cryptocurrencies must be aware of that and safeguard against the loss it could cause to the citizen.Bitcoin and a few frontrunners coins will always be the preference of any country. What Taiwan is doing now is not what I did not envisage, more regulations will be meted out on cryptocurrency in the next decades, and this is to the advantage of all.",

      "body": "We saw how the ftx crisis was a catalyst for many official authorities in different countries around the world to legalize crypto activities in general.While any country that respects its citizens must prevent its citizens from falling victim to fraudulent operations. This is not possible in the prevention policy, since crypto activities can be carried out without the need for a license from the country that is supposed to secure its citizens.Taiwan has succeeded in preparing bills for encrypted currencies, but it is still awaiting activation, and we hope that this will not take long.",

It's good to see that they're open to crypto but I'm sure that those citizens that has a lot of investments through NFTs are disappointed.Needless to say, truly a welcoming development and this is what we like. But again, if we come to realize it, these has to happen and things will be regulated on this decentralized market.",

Investors might consider moving to or investing in Taiwan. I will have to study the gazetted regulation to ascertain how favorable it is to the crypto community because it might have some investment opportunities.Regulation is against the main aim of the invention of Bitcoin. The fear of the fall of exchanges might be the cause for this action but I also hope that government will not want to place restrictions on decentralized channels. In drafting and implementing this regulatory document they would be aware that it was exchanged that collapsed and not bitcoin. Giving the citizens the privilege of making their choice between centralized and decentralized systems should be the main focus of this policy.",

Because they definitely will mess up the growth of Taiwan's crypto adoption, as well as many other things, such as Taiwanese lives.Regulations on crypto may sometimes sound harsh but I think they will be aiming to build a legal framework which protects people while not hindering progress. FTX has shown us what happens when we leave out important regulations. There will always be people who abuse the flawed system.Not sure how I feel about them not accepting NFT's. Many altcoins can be considered much much worse than NFT's and yet they seem to be happy to accept those without much question.",

      "body": "There are perhaps too many kinds of coins and too many coins themselves to regulate everything, as they are often different from one another in various ways, but IMO the shadier a market is and the more centralized a project is, the better it is to regulate them. Bitcoin itself doesn't really need much regulation, and it doesn't have any 'fixed commodities/products' connected to it either. If the reason for regulations is the FTX collapse, why not regulate crypto exchanges, making them report how much funds they actually have, what they do with their clients' money etc.? But if some in Taiwan welcome these regulations, I hope it means they'll be favourable not only to big companies but to regular crypto users and customers of big companies.",

Not happening because that could lead to WW3 which would screw the Chinese too royally in the process. Taiwan is safe as long as their allies continue supporting them in my opinion.Just look at how Russia is struggling to conquer Ukraine thanks to their allies.",
