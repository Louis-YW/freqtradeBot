This time the leak appears more expansive: \"A new batch of classified documents that appear to detail American national security secrets from Ukraine to the Middle East to China surfaced on social media sites on Friday, alarming the Pentagon and adding turmoil to a situation that seemed to have caught the Biden administration off guard,\" The New York Times reported Friday evening.\"The scale of the leak — analysts say more than 100 documents may have been obtained — along with the sensitivity of the documents themselves, could be hugely damaging, U.S. officials said,\" the report continues.One senior intelligence official was quoted in the report as saying the leak is \"a nightmare for the Five Eyes\" - in reference to the intelligence-sharing nations of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Like the Ukraine war plans earlier reported on by the Times, some of these latest documents appeared on Twitter and other social media platforms, and they include reports labeled with one of the highest classification ratings of \"Secret/NoForn\" - which means they are sensitive enough to not be shared with even foreign allies. Interestingly, the NY Times notes that one intelligence slide which is circulating features \"an alarming assessment of Ukraine's faltering air defense capabilities.\" But these leaks, some of which actually appeared on a Discord server devoted to discussing Minecraft and other unusual places, include more than the initial content on Ukraine war planning: But the leaked documents appear to go well beyond highly classified material on Ukraine war plans. Security analysts who have reviewed the documents tumbling onto social media sites say the increasing trove also includes sensitive briefing slides on China, the Indo-Pacific military theater, the Middle East and terrorism....",

You know, the Pentagon usually would not deny nor confirm nor admit nor ... etc... why would they class this as a \"dissaster\" and a real problem publicly? There are so many doubts about the content that is nearly useless for any intelligence analysis. It is a problem with most intel.EDITED to add: Curiously, all leaks are sigint, thus no spies to be arrested or killed as a result. What a coincidence uh?",

      "body": "My opinion is that the leak really took place and this is not a controlled leak for misinformation (otherwise, only Ukraine would appear in the documents and there would be no information, for example, about the surveillance of the allies from South Korea, because of which the Pentagon now looks pale). However, the photographed documents were subsequently edited in Photoshop, possibly more than once. Nevertheless, the contents of the secret documents are curious and worthy of attention. It is interesting that the scale of the leak is still unclear and new secret documents, I think, will surface in various media for a long time to come.",

Other agents may even get killed as a consequence in the front.",

We should ask him if it was worth it 10 years later. Some people are awfully stubborn.Could've been an intentional leak by bad actors to shift the narrative. But given law enforcement's quick investigation, they must find the content really damaging.They found this guy in less than a week. The Dobbs leaker is still out there, though",
