Or he/she finally decided to move the funds to a much safer storage, or perhaps even sell them. But this isn't new. Every once in a while there's a dormant wallet that suddenly becomes active after a decade or even more. I think it was last year when a wallet containing hundreds of Bitcoin suddenly woke up after 11 years. The last time the wallet was active was when Satoshi was still active.",

Well, the bearish trend pass 2021 is no longer that bearish at all if these bitcoins were accumulated 10 years ago or even just after 5 years ago. A lot of things have changed especially the pricing so, if they want to sell and come back to those forgotten accounts that used to be held by them, it's now profit taking for them. And to those that have been promoting HODL, this is what actually HODLing is.",

By transferring to 3 addresses he is probably not going to spend it all but at least one of them is still HODLing, but this is just a guess.",

Years ago, we did not have multisig wallet but now we have it. If that whale feels like a multisig wallet is better than a single signature wallet, he could make his decision to change his way for bitcoin storage.If it is not related to cash out, it's very possible like the reason I guessed.",

And that is a long HODL though and it's just surprising that someone will suddenly move it when we are not even in the bull run.The prison scenario seems like one of the more-likely ones to me. There are 100 other possibilites, from someone finding an old harddrive with the keys to being in need of some quick cash-flow for an unexpected reason.However 280 BTC isn't a massive amount that would have any huge impact on the market at all. Also, regarding your question about cashing out in the current market situation: I don't think the market is THAT bad right now, it's still up over 75% from recent lows, so if you know you need the cash within the next 6 - 12 months, now seems like a reasonable time to cash-out (even though I think going doller-cost-average over a period of a few months is usuall the better way).",

For example I have some coins from back in 2014 that I haven't moved to this day (that is also close to 10 years), I have a plan to set a new wallet up using a brand new USB disk (ie. a cold storage with Ubuntu and Electrum) and using the new address format (P2WPKH) and send them there and also claim some of the shitcoin airdrops. I haven't had the time to do it yet though.",

If it were an inheritance they would have done it with all of it combined, not leaving some there, and for sure not a 3-hour difference between the two outgoing tx.Well, probably I'm inclined to think of this because that's what I would do if I were him, split it slowly and carefully into small batches, make the back-ups, split again, and then slowly erase the traces by mixing them before liquidating smaller amounts. With $40 million even if I would go through KYC and pay all my taxes and be completely legit I still wouldn't want anyone to trace my steps. Imagine making a one-time payment at a coffee shop in the neighborhood or some online store with your name and address and some employee with too much time on his hand discovering you have 1000 BTC on you!",
