Bitcoin? or something like a centralized shitcoins e.g. ETH, BNB, XRP.If you interested in Bitcoin, the most safest exchange is Bisq, but it's not really convenient. I'd say Agoradesk is more convenient to use, avoid to use centralized exchanges e.g. Binance, Coinbase etc.If you interested in shitcoins, unfortunately there's no safe exchange, but you can trade on swap platforms where you don't need to submit KYC and the process is instant.",

You can find out more about decentralized exchange and centralized exchange from the link below.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2906237.msg29885570#msg29885570It's important for you to be aware that you need to be very security conscious in all things crypto-currency.

Its just there are other who stay long in the business due to some good performance they provide. Much better not to trust them 100% or you might go home emptied pocket if there's issue happens. Just trade what you can afford to lose because for so many times even reputable exchange turn scam so be careful always dealing with any exchange.",

Op I will not advise you to keep funds in exchange but you can use it to buy and sell off at once. And the easiest one for that purpose is Binance exchange platform. Binance is much easier for me to use. Though I have not tried other ones because when I was trying to use them, I can't found sell but was only seeing buy so I move on with Binance because it is simple for me to use.

CEX always exposed you to risk since you are depositing your assets on wallets that you don’t have a full control. Your balance might be trapped in there anytime if something bad happened on the exchange like the recent event on FTX and more.Binance and Coinbase are both under lawsuit again SEC while they are the top exchange on crypto. Don’t gamble your funds CEX and start learning on how to use DEX. This will make your crypto experience less exposure on risk.",

They have been in the industry for many years and millions of traders trusted these exchanges. Still I would advise you to read the terms and services of these exchanges before creating an account there. Moreover currently there is an ongoing lawsuit against the Binance, so for the time being you can skip Binance. At last don’t use these exchanges to store the coins. Just use the exchanges to exchange or sell the coins.",

Note that a one-time purchase is not worth the risk of verifying any centralized exchange account; unless you have no other means of purchase, just try as much as you can to select a Dex exchange; it gives you total control over your assets, no KYC verification is required, and there is nothing like frozen withdrawals or any sort of centralized exchange issue.And when you are done making your exchange decision, try to get yourself an open-source self-custodial wallet in order to be fully in charge of your holdings. Quote from: Doan9269 on June 13, 2023, 03:03:44 PMdecentralized exchangehttps://bisq.network/https://localcryptos.com/https://hodlhodl.com/ Agoradesk should also be included on the list; Hodlhodl is not US-supported.

But I have a recommendation for you, use the exchanges just to buy and sell crypto coins, and never leave the coins there, some users leave their money in the exchange as if they can trust the service as a wallet and that's a big mistake, because if something happens to the exchange you will lose your coins.",

You talking about exchange shows that your interest already aroused in investing into bitcoin and I must say you are on the right track. There are lots of exchanges on the Crypto space but not all are worth it. Just as you have asked, I will advise you to check coinmarketcap and coingecko to see for yourself and  definitely you would see the exchanges with larger volume for which you should know are the ones leading the Crypto market.You can as well lookup to the mentioned names by other members to see for yourself too. I believe that could help you scale through to Knowing the best exchanges to trade with but before you do anything with them, read their terms of service so you don't have any issues in the long run.Lastly, remember the sayings that says\" not your coin, not your assets\".
