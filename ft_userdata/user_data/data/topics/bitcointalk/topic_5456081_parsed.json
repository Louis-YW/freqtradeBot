  "content": "Sent some on-chain satoshis from Electrum to my Muun wallet at 4.1 sat/vB about two hours before time of this post. Then I attempted to exchange sats on lightning network using FixedFloat with abnormal LN fee and then to see message \"This payment is waiting for an on-chain confirmation.\" Technically the satoshis are not sent off yet (money on hold) but the sats are deducted. FixedFloat will forget your transaction after 30 minutes and so if sent way after 30 minutes, my money is sent to the void. Will Muun cancelled the pending LN transaction after 24 hours or will it stay like that until on-chain fees are low again? If on-chain fees stay high, will the Muun wallet cancel that pending LN transaction? (I asked because I used a low fee so very certain that on-chain tx will not be mined in 24 hours) If the latter, have my money gone to the void? Need some clarity. Thanks.",

I am not sure why you sent your bitcoins from Electrum wallet to Muun wallet?They are same in self custodial wallet and they all have Lightning Network. You can have Lightning Network on Electrum wallet too.QuoteWill Muun cancelled the pending LN transaction after 24 hours or will it stay like that until on-chain fees are low again?Transactions on Lightning Network are not on-chain, it's off-chain. Fee for Lightning Network transaction is very low but you have to pay on-chain transactions when you open or close your Lightning Network channel in Electrum wallet.I don't know with Muun wallet, they provide a Lightning Network service for users and you don't have to open or close your own channel. It is strange because with such service, they are not self custodial.",

Thanks.There is no 24 hour window for on chain transactions, it takes an average of 2 weeks for majority of nodes to drop a transaction from their mempool.There is also no void where transactions go, it goes to another address it all depends if you have access to that address.",

If it's already sent there and you've got the link of your transaction which is also the reference number, it won't be forgotten. You have to save that link of your transaction so that you can still follow it up and check on which part of the process you are already. But if you're trying to send with that span of time and you think that it will be forgotten just after 30 minutes then try to make a new transaction for your convenience.",
