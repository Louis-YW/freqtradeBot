Is unfortunate that you have younger siblings that you are not sure would keep your document safe if they see it but that is also what you have to do, to keep your security code offline. You can make a separate self higher than they can reach, moreover you don't keep your passphrase just in one spot. You need to duplicate it more than two places at least.",

You can even put a random word in the mix and mark it with something like a simple dot and you'll know that this one should be substituted with the one you remember. I doubt that your siblings will be smart enough to go through the list of seed words, trying every single one, until they get the right one, but if you forget your word, you could spend a day doing it and eventually recover the wallet.

If I were you, I would get some kind of small fire-proof box, put the seed inside and hide it somewhere where no one would think to look for it. As for the place to hide, I would recommend that you consider (if you are able to) hiding inside the wall or under the floor, but you have to be a master to cover up the traces of the works.",

I don't know about you, but I personally wouldn't live with someone who I think is capable of stealing the whole safe. If OP is worried about his siblings getting into his wallet after finding a bunch of words written on a piece of paper then I'm assuming the worst, which is that it's a bunch of mischievous scheming creatures lurking around the corner and waiting for him to leave the room to go through his stuff. I have siblings and we're on a different level because the only thing I'd need to worry about with a paper wallet is that they would find it and throw it into the bin. They wouldn't know what a seed is and wouldn't even try to do anything with it. Maybe I'd find it remade into a paper plane or with a shopping list written on the other side. If OP suspects they'd try to take over his bitcoin wallet, he already has some serious problems that a safe may or may not fix.",

I suppose it isn't about them possibly tearing down that page or accidentally pouring a liquid on it or scribbling over it or anything like that. Is it about trust issues? If it is, you better device a way to keep your seed phrase in the most unlikely of places. Sometimes, hiding means keeping it in the open rather than keeping it in a secret place. If you write it in a book, don't write it as a list. You might want to right one word per page. But make sure you also have backups. Use a passphrase also. While I also thought of keeping the passphrase to myself without writing it down, I think that could be riskier. So you better write it down as well but perhaps separately.",

Also since they are younger, in most cases you can outsmart them. Even if you write down your seed phrase on a paper, do not be foolish to labeled it \"seed phrase\" or any name related to cryptocurrency or wallet. You can decide to extend the words by adding some dummy words too, or removing some words too. That strategy of course is still not the safest because you cannot guarantee that other people will not get to it.",

Please tell me. That's a good idea and I might adopt it also, the most important is not losing a copy of your passphrase if you lose then all is lost, if you are keeping a huge amount of Crypto you might want to rent a bank vault, like the one you see in John Wick movies checks your local bank on the cost of renting a bank vault, the cheapest I stumble annually is $20 so why not rent two bank vault in case something happens in one of the banks.QuoteBank safe deposit boxes, also known as safety deposit boxes, are individually locked boxes held within a larger vault, generally found in a bank. The boxes come in many sizes and can be rented annually. They’re used to store valuables, documents, and other valuable items for safekeeping.",

Like during thievery. If the safe is so small to the extent that it can not create attention, I can recommend it, but if not very small, not advisable in my opinion. This just reminded me that my brothers were even able to open my dad's metal safe many times when we were young is another thing to I can consider. I do not think I can go beyond using passhrase, or the create a multisig wallet. The last option I can go for, especially if the seed phrase is for both bitcoin and altcoins is to create the wallet on an airgapped device, get like three memory cards and encrypt the memory cards with a password, but which I do not not have to 100% rely on as I will check like monthly to know that the memory card are working good. I will prefer passphrase or multisig if it is bitcoin which can make me feel more secure and comfortable.",
