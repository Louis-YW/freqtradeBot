  "content": "The price of digital currency Bitcoin has started to rise again. In this reality, multinational bank Standard Chartered thinks that the price of Bitcoin may rise to 50 thousand dollars this year. Even in the latter half of 2024, the price of this currency can reach 120000 dollars. According to the news agency Reuters, investors may be more attracted to it as the price of Bitcoin is increasing recently. Earlier in April, Standard Chartered said, at the end of 2024, the price of Bitcoin, a virtual currency, could rise to 100,000 dollars. Then they said that the 'winter' of cryptocurrency is about to end. But now the bank's foreign exchange analyst Jeff Kendrick said that the price of Bitcoin may increase by 20 percent to 120,000 dollars.",

No one can predict the next all time high price for Bitcoin but for sure, it will skyrocketed again and again until it can't anymore. The only thing that we could do is to save bitcoin as much as we can and wait for every all time high to sell it to make huge profits.Also, never ever do panic selling just because  of FUDs.",

Recently I heard this story and I think we should not mess up with the feelings of Bitcoiners     otherwise, the results are in front of you. Social media will troll you brutally.",

How do you know for sure bitcoin will hit $100k before the end of 2024? We all expect the 2024 halving to produce a bull run as history has shown, but that doesn't mean it will immediately trigger a bull season and bitcoin will hit its ATH within that year. Everything is just conjecture, we have no proof to be sure of anything. I'm optimistic about the future of bitcoin, bitcoin will hit $100k is something I'm pretty sure too, but I won't jump to conclusions like you.",

And it's not surprising as well that these institutions are giving high numbers although it's truly possible but, they're all telling it with a good timing.It's like that we're about to see the bull run, and they know that people are all ears again to Bitcoin. Thus, they're giving good predictions and numbers but whenever we enter the bearish time, you'll not hear anything from them.",

Although there's just a little bit of doubt that Bitcoin can reach $100k before the year 2024 ends, the reason is that we are not very sure of what that year can bring. Just like some people also speculated that it could get to $90 to $100k during the last bull run, it didn't. By the way, most people did not even expect the last ATH. But the truth is that anyone who wants to invest in Bitcoin should not wait for the bull market before they can begin to invest.",

We will not see much of another bear market before the bull run, and the event following the bull run could be the best and highest price bitcoin will reach by next year 2024.

Likewise with the reporting of SEC recognition for ETF Spot BlackRock, Vaneck and several others.I still survive with $100,000 estimates to date, of course I will be very happy if there is a higher estimate coming from Standard Chartered and from other parties.This will be a reinforcement of hope.",

We will definitely see a new ATH price, but it won’t be more than 85,000 USD. Yes, so buying the coins now will really be beneficial for everyone. Buy as many coins as you can now and hold them till the next bull run. I bet you will definitely make three times the amount you invested as a profit.",

Imagine everyone having their own Bitcoin while the supply is limited, its value will surely hit the moon. The total supply is getting smaller too because of the halving, I expect Bitcoin to be on a six digit level in the next 5 years.",
