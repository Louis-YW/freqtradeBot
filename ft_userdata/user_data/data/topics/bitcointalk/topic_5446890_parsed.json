  "content": "Hello friends. I believe everyone has already heard of TryNinja's Super Notifier Bot[1]. This is nothing new in this forum. But, the thread is on Meta Board, so newbies like me might miss that. I am not going to discuss everything about it. People used to use it for New mentions and new merits only. But recently, TryNinja added some new features in his telegram bot, which can make your Bitcointalk life easier than before. Let's talk about how it can help you.Quote from: TryNinja on February 27, 2023, 09:49:23 AMNew update!- Added Tracked Boards: get notified for new topics made on specific boards (e.g topics made in the Meta board and its children boards).The traced boards feature can help you significantly if you are a bounty manager or a campaign manager. You can add specific boards like Gambling, Service Announcements, and Announcements (Altcoins). Every time new threads are created in those boards, you will get notified. This will help you to get in touch with your potential clients. Let's say a casino created its ANN on the gambling board while you were offline. There is a bunch of campaign manager who is online and can knock them and give them a business offer. When you come online, they may already hire someone for their campaigns. Of course, it depends on how quality-full your service is. But, sometimes, getting in touch quickly may give you a better result. Tracked Boards can help other users as well. Suppose you are looking for a new signature campaign. You can simply add the service board on your telegram bot, and you will get notified of new threads created on this board. Same way for bounty hunters as well. Quote from: TryNinja on February 27, 2023, 09:49:23 AM- Added Tracked Users: get notified for new posts (or only new topics) made by specific users.This feature can help everyone as well. You don't want to miss any signature campaigns or threads from Hhampuz, Royse777 or Little Mouse. You can add them to your tracked users list to get notified every time they create new threads. Bounty Hunters can add bounty managers to your tracked users list.Most Importantly, You can add some users to your tracked users list who contributed to this forum significantly. I don't want to mention their names (as they might think I am trying to get their attention Â ). But you may don't want to miss new threads from them. You can follow them if you want to learn every day. If you are Bengali, I have explained it in my native language.

I am currently using Loycev.club to track posts.A little while ago, I operated the bot and I think it is very wonderful and it will make it easier for many things, especially since I follow the new topics in more than one section and I only receive the notifications by email.Frankly, I am still surprising how I have not heard of this bot before. Rather, I invite everyone to use it, because as OP said, it will make your experience on the forum much better.",

Using the mentions and merits is just the greatest since it could easily notify you of all of the replies here in the forum in all sections, with that you could easily track and reply to the messages in case you don't remember your last topics.I think I would track the section tracker notifying us on every topic in different sections, Im just using the notify thing on email it works fine but I think it would minimize open tabs on my PC if I just need to open telegram plus notify me even if I'm only on my phone. The tracker for the new post doesn't really need to be specifically for signature managers or campaigns, I mean you want to find a campaign you can find it on the services thread.The notifier was all great and it help a lot of users here in the forum until now that it sends a 1000merit to everyone it's a troll",

I mean, being notified immediately can help you avoid posting a similar comment that other members might have already posted, especially when you are late in seeing the thread.Plus, being one of the few people who posted on the first page of the thread makes your post more visible, increasing the likelihood of receiving merit for your post, that is, if you have something interesting or helpful to say.",

See the stat from TryNinjaQuote from: TryNinja on February 28, 2023, 11:31:51 PM584 total users493 active users (didn't block/stop the bot)Considering how many people use this forum, this bot's users are relatively low. Either people are unaware of this bot, or they don't like telegram. You can't force anyone to use your bot if they don't find it interesting and valuable. I believe many people don't visit Meta board (Even if they do, the thread doesn't remain on top). So, a discussion on a different board will help spread it more.",

The community does the best.I wrote this topic a couple of months ago, and since then, TryNinja improved his bot further. TryNinja added another new feature I noticed. That is deleted posts notification. But I noticed if entire threads get wiped out, we do not get a notification. This bot is cost-free from the beginning, and it will remain free if I am not wrong. I am pretty surprised that the number of users of this bot is not huge. It's around 500 or so? How many active members are in this forum? I guess it's because people do not know about this bot. All we can do is try to spread the info and help others using it.",

Can you please elaborate on why you think it could be harmful? Let's say I am tracking Hhampuz for now and I will get notified if Hhampuz creates new threads. Usually, Campaign managers create signature campaign threads and contest threads. Most of the managers do not create useless threads. Even they create a thread once every few weeks or even months. I don't understand why It will harm someone to get one or two notifications in a month or so. Let's say I am not wearing a signature at this moment but I am looking for a campaign to join, I am sure this bot can help me get notified when new threads get created. I don't know what is harmful here",
