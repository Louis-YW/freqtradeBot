  "content": "One of the main digital newspapers in Portugal, presented a very good opinion article about Bitcoin:Bitcoin: a vacina ecológica contra a pandemia digital (Bitcoin: the ecological vaccine against the digital pandemic)https://observador.pt/opiniao/bitcoin-a-vacina-ecologica-contra-a-pandemia-digital/The article is in Portuguese, but it is an excellent article that I recommend reading and sharing.Here's a little bit of what's been talked about:QuoteFew realize the digital “pandemic” that started in China to infect the free world. Once again, the bogeyman of insecurity is being used to alienate people and confine them to fear. We observe, perhaps in disbelief, the blistering viral threat that is testing the proverbial patience of the Chinese, but we ignore the viral threat of central bank digital currencies (CBDC). In fact, Bitcoin's original formula is being modified to create programmable currencies that serve the new digital framework of power, and this adulterated technology is preparing to \"infect\" the digital wallets of Europeans.If you can't understand some part when translating, say so.EDIT:You can find the article in English here:Quote from: Antonas1 on December 23, 2022, 12:26:32 PMBy the way, Dario Rodrigues (author) has a personal blog.

I do not mean to say that they are not going to use it to destroy your privacy, but imagine the regular situation we are in right now without CBDC, is it any different in government world? Think about it this way, you have majority of the world using banks, debit or credit cards, loans etc, which means it is already tracked, only thing that you won't be tracked is cash, which could still technically be tracked, but harder.This means the same with CBDC, even bitcoin can be tracked, so only way would be moving it to privacy coins, if you want to, and it won't be tracked, or just use bitcoin, so get CBDC and turn that into bitcoin and if you are not worthy of tracking, they won't.",

For example, I recently visited one of those Amazon stores where you scan your Amazon account at the entrance, and then just take any products you want from the shelves (without scanning them anywhere) and leave without paying. The money is withdrawn later from the card linked to your Amazon account. While convenient, it does make you feel like you're in a Black Mirror episode. CBDC, IMO, isn't a big step further away from privacy after such things. And just like those Amazon stores, someone will find CBDCs convenient and won't care enough about privacy to be against them.",

But that reflects a reality that should cause greater concern than it is causing.CBDC allow the government to force the money to be spent or not, where to spend it among other things. But of course the governments will never say this clearly to the population, they will just convey the idea that it will be a new form of money where the person will have greater security and that does not need intermediaries.

The government will have complete control over all the financial movements of the citizens, strictly monitoring them, banning them, freezing their funds, or even preventing them from using their digital money in any way if it wants.It's really like a virus that puts the cell under complete control and makes it work for the virus completely.
