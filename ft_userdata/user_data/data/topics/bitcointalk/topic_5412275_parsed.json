These coins will be use only as is describe on whitepaper. We are currently financing the project from our own funds, servers, listings, 2 extra people for full time work, and so on ...You are just see the pre-mined, but read the whitepaper, or roadmap, there are huge changes in blockchain, if you are able develop cheap these changes , so lets go, you are welcome. I cann`t to write how much is cost listings and others services, because we are under NDA.Your thinking is like the thinking of an envious person. That`s all what is on my heard.BTW: Yes, Vitalik premined more ETH. So there is something wrong with your calculation.",

That`s all what is on my heard.BTW: Yes, Vitalik premined more ETH. So there is something wrong with your calculation.The numbers are right and you are correct, Ethereum premined 60 million, but they also completely built the platform that you are working off of.  What are the huge changes in the blockchain that was already created for you?  I read the whitepaper, you are completely using the blockchain that was created for you.There are some red flags such as the premine numbers and such, as well as the address associated with the coin being a tiny IT shop but all the websites were associated with Philippine IP addresses.  However, I hope you succeed, we all gotta start somewhere.",
