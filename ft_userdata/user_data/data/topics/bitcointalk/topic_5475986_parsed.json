Even if it turns out that it was indeed legit account, why would their name be \"blacklisted\". This is not North Korea.",

What could go wrong, after all when you speak against someone, they tag you!!!Did that account spoke against sinbad or those 2 DT? am I saying this to have revenge on people I never met or had any interactions with?It's for their own good, and the community's.

Reason is they're starting to realise that chain analysis and other related scams are simply not effective enough to pinpoint  and accurately target any of the results that it provides. AML scores, chain labeling, etc. are fools games. These tools alone are not enough to be able to do an LE job properly. One reason for such, might be mixers, maybe privacy protocols, maybe other means of privacy. Now, imagine that a group or entity finally realize that they've spent hundreds of millions, maybe in the billions, for ineffective tech?What happens then?
