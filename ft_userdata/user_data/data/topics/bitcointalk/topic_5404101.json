  "content": "Take Bitcoin as a long term investment and just forget it like it’s in a long-term investment account. Don’t let your emotions get too much into it else you might make the wrong decision and sell at the wrong time. The  best thing you can do is to not look at it, even if crypto is going up or down. That’s exactly what I do especially now that it’s dipping, I don’t want to stress over it because I believe if I hold and wait patiently Bitcoin is going to rise again.  My all time investment strategy is buying more when crypto is dipping, holding and selling back when it increases. In 2020 I bought ethereum when it was $700 and sold when it was $4000 in 2021. Within 2020 and 2021 when the price was going up and down, I decided to ignore the dip and hold on to it till I eventually sold at a good price.  This is the right time to buy more cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin because the  more people come into the market and increases their demand for it, its value continues to grow rapidly.",

      "body": "What a good advice. But why ethereum when you post it on bitcoin board. It was bullish for bitcoin and all-time-high was attained. In 2020, there was a time bitcoin was below $4000. In 2021, there was a time bitcoin was above $65000. It was a great passive profit making means for many people, people that hold at the time.Just like in the past, bitcoin stayed above $7000 in 2020, but when it dropped to $4000, some people would have panicked and sold their coins, but people that hold saw the price at $65000. Better to hold and not panic to sell.",

I am a bit confused after reading your post. Are you using the profits from Bitcoin to invest in altcoins or the other way around? To me, it seems like Bitcoin is your way to get more altcoins. In that case, that's a pretty risky game you are playing. Everyone knows what's best for them, but I would personally never drop Bitcoin to adopt an alt and possibly a shitcoin created only to make a small group of developers and early investors/advocates rich.",

Bitcoin was never in this situation. That's why I strongly advice to not go balls dip into bitcoin right now because risk are inestimable.The simple fact is the biggest money managers and wealthy  accounts under management are currently moving money out of high risk assets. The recent collapse means they have lost a lot of faith in the system and it can take a long time to regain. There is an upcoming fuel crisis in the world and bitcoin is somewhat wasteful when it comes to energy usage. People with money are converting to cash with the hope they can make big bucks in the coming recession by buying near the bottom. It was also very cheap to borrow money until the last year which flooded the market with easy money, as interest rates go up that is vanishing.",

The summary is simple - just like someone said do not invest what you cannot afford to hodl.The advice in OP is so great and understandable, even though he superimposed bitcoin and Ethereum in a particular topic, his points are still understandable. The issue of not ignoring your portfolio is not only for newbies. Old investors will also not ignore their portfolio when they invest more than what they can lose. So it is when someone don't have investment plans that they keep their mind in their portfolio when the market is going wrong. I started in this cryptocurrency with trading and immediately I enter a particular trade my mind won't be at rest, so I had to stop trading because of my wellbeing.",

I think he will make more profit if he invest on Bitcoin in early days rather than Ethereum because is the best performing cryptocurrency so far so if he made that profit in Ethereum then he can surely make huge profit on Bitcoin without a doubt. Ethereum will not reach 4K level if Bitcoin didn't pump to 65K. Investors is just looking for other investment opportunity after they finish trading on Bitcoin which is the reason why Eth and other altcoins pump.",
