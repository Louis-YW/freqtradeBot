  "content": "Howdy! I am new to the mining world, and crypto in general. I have been trying to educate myself on everything, and have over the past month or so been mining with a couple of old tablets via CryptoTab.It doesn't produce much, but its fun anyway. I have 3 old tablets mining at 1MH/s (1,000 H/s) each. I estimate I get in the the ball park of 4,000-6,000 sats a month (depends greatly on how often I can \"reset\" the miner. It only allows 2 hour intervals.)I am looking to upgrade to something a little more powerful (not quite ready to dive into a $6,000 miner yet). And found a GekkoScience Compac F that says it mines at 200GH, and an old Antminer S1 that says it can mine at 180GH.My question comes in at the production.I am using a mining calculator: cryptocompare.com and it is telling me that these two miners, that have significantly higher hash rate than what CryptoTab offers, will mine only about the same amount, or less. How can that be?I'm not overly concerned about profitability at this point, as I believe any BTC I can mine right now, will be worth significantly more in the future. But, I do want to be able to mine a bit more than 5,000 sats a month...Any thoughts and direction would be appreciated.",

I just want to add this calculator below with a breakeven analysis to estimate the ROI of your unit.- https://www.mycryptobuddy.com/bitcoinminingcalculatorThose are operational costs, and in reality they cost about the same to run per TH/s, but buying an Apollo would be much cheaper and simpler to run than 10 Compac Fs.You can in theory(it's sold out) buy 3 Compac Fs for $699.99Note that individual Compac Fs are being sold right now at $359.99 and to be able to get 300GH/s you also need to buy special rare USB hubs that provide at least 2.4A per port, a power supply for each hub, and fans.But let's assume an individual price of $233.33 based on only buying those packs of 3 miners. That means to get 10 Compac Fs you will need to pay about $2.3k.In comparison, one Apollo BTC costs $499.90:Also, it's hard to make a fair comparison because you can change the power settings on both devices.These are real numbers that I've measured myself:For the Compac F, to be able to run at 300GH/s you need to provide 2.4A in the USB port. At 5V that's 12W.The Apollo can run at different power settings, I'm running mine in a silent setting, so it's producing about 2.1TH/s at 120W.That's exactly 7 Compac F to match the hash rate of the Apollo.It's still cheaper and simpler per TH/s to get the Apollo:1 Apollo BTC: $499.997 Compac F: $1,633.31You can buy 3 Apollos for that price!",
