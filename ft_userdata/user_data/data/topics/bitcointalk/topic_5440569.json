I have made many mistakes myself by not taking out the profits while it lasted.Trusting a project deeply is one thing and taking out the profits on regular basis is another thing.I think other than bitcoin and ethereum all other projects are those where we should take out the profits on regular basis.For bitcoin and ethereum it can be a good thing to hold for long term.",

I'm not saying that I wasn't once in your shoes, but the whole point is not that you only care about profit, but that you sometimes try to use Bitcoin as a currency - there are certainly some things that you could buy/pay for online.If you only want to make a profit then try to play it safe, buy during a bear market, start selling when we are in the middle of a big bull run and keep doing it as the price rises. There is no other great wisdom in all this, because it all boils down to how consistent you are and how well you know how to judge the moment, and of course whether you can control your greed.",

But how I see this hodlers simply have to buy and forget and it should be stated that this process is long term before you get to see some real returns on investment, while the process for traders is more aggressive as their returns is much more faster, bigger and risk is higher as there is an element of losing money should price go against what we anticipated.Btw getting a 2x return as a hodler takes forever while going the traders route a 2x or 3x is super easy to attain..

Just wondering what everyone else does when it comes to taking profits?  If you want to take decent amount of profits, then prepare to hold your coins for long term, most especially for bitcoin and ethereum as they are the most profitable coins in the crypto market. However, selling when you start seeing the price has been doubled is not bad, but you can make bigger profits instead if you take more time to hold and only sell them when you need them the most, or when you think the profits are big enough for you. In the end, you still hold the final decision when to sell your coins.",

Just wondering what everyone else does when it comes to taking profits? That's depends on individuals trading priorities, some people target at every single pump, some target long term pump so even when is dropping they don't panic. Some even trade as daily income project, they check it every single seconds like soup. But the most important thing is to be accurate with analysis, so that's you will the bearing and bulling direction, how long it will stay dropping or going up, you quickly take profit when its pumps and is about dropping. Then you for it again when it dropping to some resistance of pumping again you buy or invest as the case may be, so it all bolls to individual game of trading. For me once it has exceed my capital and good take, am good to go",

It went so fast that I didn't even think about withdrawing at 2x, I let it roll. At 10x I withdrew my first investment and let the rest grow. At 12x I withdrew 10% and another 10% at 15x. I held the rest of my bitcoin all the way down from 20 to 3000 and I still have it.I later spent some of that sold 20% to buy ETH when it crashed to $300. I also bought ADA in 2019. In 2022 I didn't touch my bitcoin at all, I sold only some of the coins saved up from signature campaigns and half om my ETH. That gave me enough money to be set for years without being forced to sell my bitcoin investment.I plan to maybe sell some bitcoin when it breaks 100 thousand dollars and another part at 200 thousand.

It depends on your main target in investing, do you want to get results of 2x or more, but what we know is that most who invest in Altcoins they take from every profit they get not only based on how many multiples are produced, but there are also those who are waiting for the price to 3x to 5x to take advantage of the return on their investment assets. Apart from all this, it also really depends on the chosen Altcoin, some of them determine the target, and some determine the multiple, depending on the person and their goals.",
