      "body": "It is not profitable, you can't make more Bitcoins this way. Your consideration seems to revolve around user error or looking at it from a short term and constant fee perspective.Barring the human error, which shouldn't be a factor in your consideration, your main consideration would be if you're able to save more on fees when the network is experiencing bouts of high fees. Consolidating numerous inputs when the fees are low allows the user to spend less when the fees are high. Consolidating inputs essentially means that instead of spending from 10 of them, you only need to spend from 1 of them. Note that people who are using Bitcoin aren't always able to spend as and when they need. By doing so, they can save more on the fees if they need to transfer them when the fees are high. You can do your calculation in the following scenario and come up with the cost:Given 10 inputs and a period where fees are 2sat/vbyte and another where the fees are 10sat/vbyte:Consolidation Transaction (721.5vbytes): 1430satActual Transaction (140.5vbytes) 1405satTotal: 2835satsVs:Actual Transaction (721.5vbytes): 7215sats. Total: 7215sats.",

It is best to consolidate your small output when the blockchain is not congested and transaction fees are very low so that it will only cost you little amount. Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on July 20, 2024, 05:10:00 AM2) The chances of fees going up or down at any point in time is pretty much 50/50.Yea, since nobody knows when the network will be congested and fees will be high, it is better that you are prepared for high transaction fee than low transaction fee in the future by consolidating your transaction so that you can have a big amount of bitcoin output so that when you want to spend from it you pay very little amount for transaction fee even if the fees are high in future. Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on July 20, 2024, 05:10:00 AM3) Miners love it when people consolidate their inputs since that's how they get paid by people submitting transactions.Miners get very little amount of money from this because not everyone that is using the bitcoin do consolidate their transactions, but only those who buy bitcoin with small amount using DCA or folks that are being paid with bitcoin when they render services, like forum member in signature campaigns. Miners benefits more when a new block is mined and when the blockchain is congested. In fact miners benefits from all transactions carried out in the blockchain. To consolidate your transactions, it happens once in a while when there is low fee, meaning it is peanut that the miners get from consolidating of transactions. Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on July 20, 2024, 05:10:00 AM4) Consolidating inputs carries a risk of loss from either making a mistake and sending the bitcoin to the wrong address or being hacked. [/size]It is not true, that depends on the carelessness of the person who wants consolidate his small outputs. You should not forget that even if you want to make a realtransaction, and you did not recheck the address that you are sending your coins to over and over again, you can still mistakenly send it to a wrong address, especially if you keyboard is infected with malware. Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on July 20, 2024, 05:10:00 AMBased on the above, I don't see why someone would think that consolidating UTXOs provides them with any substantial benefits. Just use your coins when you are actually making a real purchase/transaction. It provides benefits of saving you from spending too much on transaction fee in future when you want to spend your bitcoin. This is because nobody knows how high the transaction fee will be in 10 years time, it might be very high that the profit you have made from your bitcoin investment might be eaten up by high transaction fee if you don't consolidate those many small input into one, making you to lose out from the profit that was generated by your bitcoin investment. As long as BRC-20 token and Runes have not being eliminated from bitcoin blockchain transaction fees might not be affordable in future for people with many small output.",

You don't have the same chance at any point in time that the fees could increase tenfold or be ten times less.  Therefore, consolidating your inputs makes perfect sense if you want to eliminate the very real possibility of losing more money in fees in the future.",

You, me and others are free to choose how we choose our UTXOs, fee rate and when to broadcast our transactions. It's freedom.Nobody can say others HAVE TO do anything with Bitcoin. The math is only simple that if you don't plan your transaction and consolidate your inputs when fee rates are cheap, you will have to broadcast your transaction with higher fee rates.I said with same number of UTXOs for one transaction, if fee rates are different, transaction fees are different.Same number of UTXOs, same transaction size, so will you choose to use 6 sat/vbyte fee rate or 60 sat/vbyte fee rate. Consolidation is only one solution but there is other solutions like storing your bitcoin on centralized exchanges, leaving it there for months or years. If you do this, no fee from consolidation but the bigger risk is you will lose all your bitcoin.I don't argue more here, it seems you stick with your opinion and don't want to listen.",

But the thing about consolidating your inputs is that you actively choose to time your consolidation in a way that the chance of fees going up is much higher than the chance of the fee going down. At 2sats/vbyte the chance of fees rising is much larger than the chance of fees falling and vice versa for e.g. 200sats/vbyte. You can't necessarily time when you need the coins for a purchase though, so depending on how many inputs you consolidate in a low-fee environment beforehand you can save quite a bit.",

Those can happen anytime and if you think that it may happen to you, then you might need to be more careful with how you pay.- Clipboard malware or any malware is going to steal your Bitcoins even if you don't make any consolidation transactions.- You can copy and paste an address wrongly whenever you're making payments.Even if you speculate that fees may drop to 1sat/vbyte instead of remaining at 2sat/vbyte, that is fine the loss vs benefits is fairly small. Besides, we don't tell people to consolidate when fees are high. We tell them to do so when it is relatively low.",

That is what most wallets do for you, and it is a very good way of doing so. However, most people won't have unlimited amount of money and the way that change works is that you're bound to end up with a whole bunch of inputs which makes little sense to spend when fees are high. More often than not, it is necessary to spend those when paying.Let's say I've got a client that pays me regularly for a server hosting that I do. When I'm paying someone else, the entire transaction amount would be far higher than any of my largest inputs.

Besides, consolidating to your own wallet has no risk of mistaken address, if you're only opening your own wallet. If you're risking being hacked every time you use Bitcoin, you're using it wrong.i haven't used every bitcoin wallet out there but the ones i have used required copying and pasting payment addresses. which is something i don't like to do. i think it's very risky because i heard of malware that will change the address. then you have to manually check if the address is correct or did it get changed. maybe after you check the address and click submit that's when it might try and change it, you never really do know. that's why i don't like doing unnecessary transactions personally. it's a pain having to go through all that. but if you know of a wallet that has a button called \"consolidate all my utxos\" and does it automatically i'd be interested to know what desktop software that is. not android or iphone app.",

You'd be surprised to know what malware can do. If you've got a malware that can change your clipboard, then you'll probably have other malware to worry about. The lamest malware will copy your clipboard and the normal ones would have gotten your private keys already. If you're scared of making Bitcoin transactions, then use a hardware wallet where you have visual confirmation on the device themselves.Regardless, if you're this paranoid, then you probably should re-evaluate what your security practices are. This shouldn't be discouraging people to consolidate inputs, because this wouldn't be a concern for most.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on July 21, 2024, 02:32:52 AMbut if you know of a wallet that has a button called \"consolidate all my utxos\" and does it automatically i'd be interested to know what desktop software that is. not android or iphone app.Just send all the funds to another address that you control, it shouldn't be complicated enough for you to have to implement another function.",
