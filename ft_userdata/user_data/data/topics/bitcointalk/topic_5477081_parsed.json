Should we rely on only buying long term projects or we should invest according to trend despite of looking that trends coin will have no value in future? Why should choose one? why not both? I have to be honest that I don't like altcoins that are only based on trends or hype, but I also have to be honest that I have been happy because I have made x50 from investing in altcoins that move because of trends or hype.So, I'll choose both by diversifying them, making special percentages for long-term altcoins (with good fundamentals) and also hype altcoins.",

Should we rely on only buying long term projects or we should invest according to trend despite of looking that trends coin will have no value in future? I don't follow coins that are trending because they are not suitable for the long term, but it's like gambling, it's better for me to buy long term coins even though my portfolio doesn't increase that significantly compared to coins that are trending, it can increase up to 1000x but it can also make our money disappear. Just invest in coins that are long term and have a good future because we also invest with the expectation that sometimes investments do not make a profit or loss but also maintain our own wealth. Do you agree with my opinion?",

Should we rely on only buying long term projects or we should invest according to trend despite of looking that trends coin will have no value in future? Well, in altcoin investment, as long as you are willing to risk losing some funds,  you can carry on investing in any token that you think will definitely do well during the bull market. It's true that some altcoins do pump very much during the bull market; that's also how an investor is not 100% sure which or which particular coin will pump and which one will dump so badly. While expecting an altcoin to give you a 100x profit, don't forget that it could happen the opposite way. It doesn't matter which altcoin one is investing in; only invest the amount that will not affect you when lost.",

Seeing people that are making that much money with these trending coins makes me interested on them.But anyway, I'd just leave it to them with that strategy of being long term. This gives me more peace and lesser stress because I don't have to do such things in a hurry which is being done usually by the people who spots trends.",

Long term investment for the good altcoins and do a trend strategy for the projects that are still new in the market, you can just follow the hype and secure your profit after. We know there’s a cycle in this market and now we are on a bullish cycle where we aims to create a new ATH with Bitcoin and after this for sure corrections will start and the bear will suddenly appear, so make sure you understand the cycle.",

Market doesn't care about fundamentals, or if your project is good or not. It cares about hype potential, and if the project is exciting enough. Fundamentals are good to sell when they are rebellious enough, tech is cutting tech, revolutionary and easy to market for newbies. And newbies don't care about tech that's few years old. It cares about tech that mirrors their way of life. Something that's fun, does barely exist yet. Something that's more of a promise of what's to come, then something that already exist. That's easy to sell. It's exciting because it doesn't make sense or old farts don't get it.That's why nfts were big, that's why memetokens were big. That's why monero, DEXes, farming and others were a big thing.",
