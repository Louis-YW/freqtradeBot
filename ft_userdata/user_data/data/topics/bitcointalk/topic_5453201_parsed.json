Do you think this is a bad sign for the future?It's about control & replacement just like with the robots. But that wouldn't be necessary if the world isn't getting dumber. Â When the natural light becomes so dime, the bearer looks for artificial light for help. The one who creates & gives the artificial designs it to show things from its own perspective. So, the artificial light users will think like him otherwise they will be replaced. Hope you understand where this is going",

      "body": "There is nothing but good thoughts about my personal feelings about ChatGPT. I use it more often than other search engines, as I want to know the use of it. So far, it has given me a thorough answer to any of the questions that I have. If not, it does send me links to research a subject or thought. So, I do find it rather useful in my day-to-day work. It helps me improve my writing skills and knowing that there is a tool like ChatGPT can really help others. There is a wide variety of knowledge out there in our hands and it is in one source. I hope this can only be put to good use and there must be an age limit. For something so brand new there will be kinks and bumps on the road. I do certainly not want to see ChatGPT fail. It is a great tool to have for many years to come.",

I see no reason for online communities to get destroyed because a better version of a search machine arrived. Communities just like Bitcointalk are for discussions. What Chat GPT provides is also available online which is possibly open for debates. The world is changing, and new innovations and discoveries are being made. History changed based on proofs as we progressed so does Chat GPT's answers.",

These bots are like helpful companions - they can translate languages, create cool stuff, and even give us answers when we're curious.But, like any new friend, they come with some rules. AI bots could be misused to spread false info or tricky stuff. So, it's essential to keep an eye on how we use them and be responsible.All in all, I think AI bots popping up everywhere is a good sign. It means we're getting smarter and more capable.

We can view it as a means to swiftly acquire information based on the data it has been trained on through AI.If you're referring to whether using ChatGPT to copy and paste content is detrimental to the community on this forum or on other platforms, it truly hinges on how it's employed. Copy and paste is a shortcut devoid of any effort, and indeed, it can disturb others.However, it doesn't need to be a significant issue as long as users take the initiative to engage in a manner akin to human interaction. ChatGPT merely serves as a source for information and knowledge; the subsequent wordcraft and delivery should ideally reflect each individual's distinctive style.",
