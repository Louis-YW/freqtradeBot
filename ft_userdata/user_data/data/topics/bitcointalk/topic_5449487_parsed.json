The price will be discounted from 19 - 26 April 2023. Instead of $219, the Trezor T now costs $186. Although nothing is mentioned here[1], if you scroll deep enough on the blog post detailing the process[2] we eventually find zkSNACKs:QuoteThe coinjoin process uses a coordinator, run by zkSNACKs, which is in charge of selecting which pieces of bitcoin (UTXOs) to include in a transaction and ensuring there is enough liquidity for the coinjoin to provide the required level of privacy. I'm a bit surprised that Trezor decided to follow Wasabi rule. I wonder what's behind this decision though - I'm sure that they know that a good percentage of their clients are fully aware of their privacy and wouldn't want to use zkSNACKs as a coordinator, so I wonder the reasons that's behind this move. One is still free to never touch the Coinjoin process within Trezor Suite, but it is still a doubtful move for sure...[1]https://trezor.io/learn/a/coinjoin-in-trezor-suite[2]https://blog.trezor.io/coinjoin-privacy-for-bitcoin-11aaf291f23",

I wouldn't buy one of their devices if it was 100% off.It seems that this is one of the stages of development of any company that produces such devices.When a device manufacturer is just starting out, the firm is not of interest to governments. But as soon as the company grows, becomes large and gains influence in its markets, then the regulator remembers them. After all, this is a tasty morsel: by that time, the company manages to accumulate big data about users (although they claim that they don't do this). Governments will always find a way to get hardware wallet manufactures to share this information with them. It is naive to think that the regulator will miss such a good opportunity.If privacy is needed, then it is better to use the devices of small companies until they come into the field of vision of big brother.It's time for the crypto community to think about creating their own open source HW devices that can be assembled like a kit (hardware and software separately). Discounts, of course, are good, but the changes pushed under this pretext don't bode well for users. Another big firm screwed up?",

I initially thought Satoshilabs would go with their own version of Coinjoin and do not take the lead of other wallets like Wasabi.It would be terrible of Trezor finally got pressured enough by the men in black and threatened into accepting to infiltrate their own products with surveillance code/addons.Would someone please give me context or sources about why this provider is malicious and why this Coinjoin is not to be trusted?

Thank you. Â I've explained here about some of the inherent problems with Wasabi coinjoins: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5419000.msg61220171#msg61220171However, even if Wasabi coinjoins did not have these problems which the devs try to sweep under the rug, every time someone tries to coinjoin some of their coins, Wasabi pay a blockchain analysis company for information about those coins, and will then censor the coins in question if they don't like what they find. We don't know which blockchain analysis companies they use because they keep it secret, and we don't know what their criteria are for censoring users. Their terms of service also make it clear that they will not tell you why you are being censored. By doing this, Wasabi are surveilling all of their users and enforcing blacklists drawn up by governments and other unknown authorities and third parties regarding who is and is not allowed to coinjoin their coins.I certainly don't want my wallet asking blockchain analysis companies to investigate my coins, and I certainly don't then want my wallet to then refuse to let me use my coins in the way I want based on secret criteria handed down from secret third parties. Not to mention that the fee you pay by using Wasabi's coinjoin is directly funding this blockchain analysis surveillance. By implementing Wasabi's coinjoin, Trezor are directly supporting all of this. All the UTXOs in your Trezor wallet that you try to coinjoin will be investigated by blockchain analysis, you will be censored if they don't like what they see, and you are paying a fee for this privilege of being spied on and censored.I consider directly funding mass surveillance and enforcing government blacklists to be actively malicious behavior, and antithetical to the very concept of bitcoin. I will never suggest anyone ever buys another Trezor product again.",

How about trying to build a Passport ourselves using the published OSHW files?  I reckon that would be a fun project.In my experience, building a new device from scratch (like the current DIY wallets) has a higher potential to fail / stall since without funding there eventually comes a time when nobody will continue working on the codebase and update the device to new standards and such.",

Both Passport and the ColdCard might not fit everyone's interpretation of an easy-to-use hardware device. Passport is airgapped, requiring users to work with QR codes and camera scans. It's not difficult to learn, but is different if you have gotten used to the USB-connected Ledgers and Trezors. Additionally, ColdCard isn't open-source. They have verifiable code, but nothing is released under an open-source license. I have said before that if I am an end-user interested in checking and verifying the code myself, ColdCard allows me to do that. So, that's ok. The reasons why they aren't open-source should be of secondary importance.",

Our ultimate goal in supporting coinjoin is to provide individual users with an easy-to-use privacy tool.We do not expose any new coins to a chain analysis company; the coinjoin coordinator run by a third party simply receives an existing risk score about the UTXOs entering the coinjoin. When UTXOs known to be connected to serious criminal activities attempt to enter a coinjoin, the coordinator simply refuses them. Nothing else happens.We cannot check individual usersâ activity, track it, or report on it since coinjoin is enabled via Tor, the anonymization network, and we also use block filters.There is more information on how coinjoin work in our blog post on the topic here, including further information on how the coinjoin coordinator selects the inputs.We practically cannot track or report users. Trezorâs coinjoin account uses block filters to mask the userâs wallet addresses and Tor to mask the userâs IP address. The process is one-way - we only receive information, that has already existed anyway, about the risk score of UTXOs entering coinjoin. This information is used for accepting/denying UTXOs to coinjoin and it is not used in the future for any purpose. This applies just for the UTXOs used for coinjoin, not for any other usersâ coins.More or less the same crap Wasabi team answers back when get asked about this.",

I can't imagine no other good reason to build this system but only to have a free tool to censor any kind of UTXO's that an entity so desires, without the need to disclosure anything more.I'm still baffled how Trezor managed to side with the company (and implement other privacy shady operations in the last months), but I guess the only thing that I, as an individual, is able to do is stop promoting their products and advise people that are better options out there.
