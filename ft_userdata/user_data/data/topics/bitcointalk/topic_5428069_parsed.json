Every other casinos requires KYC and you can't remove it and still keep your license.

Which mean they're not 100% anonymous and would still require KYC when there's a lucky gambler beat the house.Quote from: LTC Casino on March 15, 2022, 02:35:36 PMWe allow VPN, multiple accounts and we will never ask for KYC. In this case multiple accounting is just an additional prove of possible cheating - OP played ONLY ONE slot for 16+ hours in a row and used several accounts playing same slot.If you're want to convince anyone you have a good budget since you want to run a campaign, it doesn't help you to built up your reputation and I guess people should be careful, maybe this is a sister company from LTC casino.",

It is an honor to be here in this exciting Crypto and Gambling community. And we are looking forward to be part of this community for years to come.First, we are not in anyway affiliated to LTC Casino even though we admire their business model and hope to build our system base on the model of 100% No KYC while offering robust gaming experience to our customers. We don't know what happens in other companies but the case you sited seems like a typical case of malpractices which could trigger any casino company to take actions. Money laundering is a serious matter and we too do not tolerate it on our platform. Yes, we are preparing a serious budget to begin our campaign and we have slated to managers and partners to work with. If you think there is anything you can do with us, feel free to get in touch with me via DM or email to help@fortune.st.Quote from: LoyceV on December 12, 2022, 05:45:21 PMPlease leave me out of this topic. Your site isn't even probably fair, which means the player can't prove it if the casino cheats.This table was sent us as a recommendation in our previous post, so I decided to add it in this post as a head up to the mentioned managers. We do not know you personally. We are fair and our business model is governed by integrity. We hope you'll get to believe in us as time goes on.

About the country and mobile number on the registration form, you can fill in anything you like. We do not verify those information because they are personally identifiable information. In future we may consider removing it all together. But for now, you can fill in anything you like and be fine with the registration as the system do not ask for mobile verification.The site is already active and we are taking in new users. Feel free to create an account, make deposit, and start playing to win. You can win and cashout even now.",

Like we have stated time and again, we are preparing for launching and most of the activities going on at the site now are testing activities. If you have paid attention close enough, you'd discover that the name of the winner is \"Fortune Freak\" which is to indicate it's from the Fortune.st testing account. And the transaction name is also \"Test Lion\" indicating it's from test accounts too. As live transactions data begins to come in, they will gradually replace the test data. I don't think there is anything wrong in stating that our mission and goal is to become one of the best in the industry. Criticism is good but being reasonable is also important.",

Because of course, if you only gamble a little, you will use the referral commission you have.Then I just noticed that to avail of the 50% referral commission, it needs to be at level 4, meaning it needs to be worked hard. The personal if you know is my end level with 40%, and the direction of my 2nd level will be the 3rd level because I have 45$, and the direct referral of the 3rd level will be the 4th level that I can only avail here by 50%, right?
