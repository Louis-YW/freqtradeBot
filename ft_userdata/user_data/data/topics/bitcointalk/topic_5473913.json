  "content": "As bitcoin is on the rise FOMO will make people who sell their Bitcoin at a loss buy another bitcoin in other not to miss out on the next market bull run, and scammers will use this opportunity that buying and selling of Bitcoin has increased to scam people of their money who are not careful when selling their bitcoin on P2P trading. There is a scam in P2P trading that most newbies don't notice when selling their Bitcoin and they will end up losing some of their money in the trade. Some scammers set up two different buying orders in P2P trading and when you click on their orders to sell your Bitcoin to them, the buying order they placed on the P2P marketplace will not be the same thing as the one when you open the order to sell your Bitcoin and you will end up in selling your Bitcoin at a cheap rate without knowing. Let me use Peter-Obi as a case study. For example, Peter-Obi set the price of one BTC for 41,084,000 Naira, and when you click to sell your Bitcoin to him there will be a different price without you knowing. If the scammer has set such two prices differently it will not be invincible so you will not notice. I don't know how they manipulate this. How to detect the price difference on P2P tradingWhen you open a buyer order when selling your Bitcoin on a P2P trading, refresh the order to be sure that the price is the same thing as the one the buyer placed on the open market of the P2P trading before you enter the quantity of Bitcoin you want to sell or after you have entered the quantity of BTC you want to sell, do your math by calculating the worth of the quantity of BTC you want to sell in dollar to your local currency to be sure if the value you have in fiat from your calculation is the same fiat value on the P2P trade before you can click on sell.",

I don’t get your post, do you mean two entirely different selling orders? Or one order that reflects a different price when you decide to trade with them? Because the only thing I have been able to observe is that when you apply filters you’ll get different prices depending on the amount of coins you want to trade so you might have the price of bitcoin @37,000 when you want to trade up to $5,000 but when the filter is set to $300 you might have the price @36,500 or even lower price. And I’m my opinion I won’t consider it a scam just a normal trader trying to make profit but assuming the price was concealed that’s when I’ll consider it as a fraud.",

I don't understand your point, OP. Can traders really manipulate prices on Binance without Binance knowing? I've used Binance P2P for a while and never noticed such situations. The prices on the trading page match the ones on each trader's profile. Have you experienced this or is it just a glitch? Just as @cantsay mentioned the price range reflects the Bitcoin amount you are willing to trader. It is still advisable for newbies stay alert on P2P exchanges, as traders may use various tricks to scam them.",

I also find it difficult to understand what @OP wants to convey, but if I think that the seller lists Bitcoin prices in his profile, and let's say one Bitcoin is worth $37,000, but when you click on start exchange, order price is at a completely different exchange rate. Therefore, you started the transaction at an exchange rate of $32,000 per Bitcoin, and it is appear 37k at his profile thus you were scammed of the price difference.In general, if this is what he meant, you should give a negative rating to the seller, and always be sure to read negative reviews carefully.",

Usually there’s a red warning on Binance about the fluctuations of prices between the seller price and the current market price. Also you have the option to cancel any trades in case you didn’t check the price when you place an order.I thought this thread is about a market aggregator for all the P2P exchange out there that’s why I became interested yet you are just stating the obvious since the P2P price is visible the moment you go to P2P section of the exchange. It will be good someone will develop a site that list all the available order open on all the P2P exchange of CEX.",

      "body": "You have taken it wrong, it's not a scam as far as I know because the price set by the seller at the front is when they had opened their status for p2p trades, and when you have clicked on the offer to buy or sell the BTC with fiat the price at the top left corner is the up to date price which has been changed due to the volatility of the BTC. We all know that BTC is so volatile and it can easily go from 41,080 to 41,043. I hope you understand what I meant here.If you are afraid so much then the best way is to not refresh the page instead do not make p2p trades in BTC, convert your BTC into some stablecoin at the rate of 41,080 so that the stablecoin you will not get the difference of price that you was getting in BTC. Because most of the stablecoins are pegged such as usdt. After converting the BTC to usdt, use these stable coins for p2p trades but still use the refresh button to get the up-to-date price of the token in which you are trading. Again, the top left price is automatically updated by the API, not by the seller or buyer of that",

I see that you have included images in your post to explain what you meant earlier… But I think you’re wrong here, when you decide to open a trade with someone that has placed a sales ads and then the price changes Binance always make sure they notify the seller (which is you in this case) if the price change and if you’re okay with the new price you can continue with the trade but if you feel you’ll get a better rate from a different person then you can just go back and look for another trader. So the only time you can lose money is when you’re in a rush and then just decide to click “agree” on every notification that pops up without having to read through them thoroughly. So in the case of Peter-Obi you should have been notified that the price has changed.",

OP took a very long means to explain himself which might prove difficult for so many people to understand. But I think that I understood the Op very well and I will try to explain what he meant.The Op is saying that some P2P traders will place an ad which is higher than what they actually want to buy. They do so to be able to defraud some innocent fellow traders. For instance, Someone may place an ad to buy a coin at a higher rate and you accept to sell thinking it is the same price in the advert that will be in the deal. But in the deal, the person will now go with a lower price. If you do not verify by refreshing the page, you will end up selling very low compared to what you see on the ad.Even if you report the person, they might claim that it is due to price volatility and get away with it. So it is always nice to cross check the prices before initiating a p2p transaction.",

I think if you're fully aware of the actual price and how to use p2p trading, you won't be deceived by anyone. This isn't a scam to me, it sounds like deceiving innocent people which is an old tactic in p2p trading.",

Depends on each P2P trading platform, they can have Terms of Service on max or min price to avoid scammers. You will waste time to check orders of others user on a same P2P trading platform if you do it manually.",

But it does not make sense if they allow one user account can have many selling offers for a same fiat currency (one fiat currency) because it is like allowing user to manipulate the P2P market price.Honestly, I tried to search to find this term to against this type of manipulation from Binance but I could not find it.Anyone can confirm that they allow it, please?With OP question, I don't consider this is scam if a buyer opens a trade with the seller and say the seller has another offer that is better than this opened one.
