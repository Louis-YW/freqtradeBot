Anything centralised with a near infinite supply that has been pre mined to hell & back, distributed to the devs & investors needs to get in the bin. Do your own research people but in this instance, I am not surprised to see a sell off of epic proportions, it’s what these rug pullers do.",

The ICO market hype back then taught me some hard lessons about pump and dump schemes, so the loom situation doesn't seem any different. Also, how does one entity end up owing almost a half of the token supply while others were looking on like that.",

I expect a small recovery to happen but it will be also followed by another dump that keep occurs till the price of loom will be going back again to the around 4 cents. 10 cents is too big for looms. I think that another bottom price will be achieved once this coin will be going to the below 10 cents. It's only matter of time until will be dumped again.",

I didn't think there were so many people trapped in this token, even though from on-chain data, people can see that the developers of this project are no longer very active in developing it.The news from Cryptopotato might provide a more detailed explanation regarding this chaotic incident: https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-loom-price-is-down-over-70-in-the-last-4-days/",

I also got the news about this pump to you so maybe many people didn't ride on the train and they got only surprise to see the stats but maybe they are still not buying those news.But for newbie maybe they will get interest since most of the time newbie might think about grabbing some shits when all time high happen and they lose instantly when dumping stage occur so they need to watch on such events since this is common mistake they made and need to be correct to avoid big lose of money on their pockets.",

I think this token might push the price up near its previous peak again in 2023.None was knowing where the heck rumor is coming from. I have heard that too if the loom pump caused by upbit has been rumored to add it. The price is going down again drastically after it was getting very big pump. The token is not going to push to the previous ATH. It's going back slowly but surely to the what it should be. We will be seeing gradual pump and dump to occur on this token. The speculation about it is not yet disappearing. People are still talking so much about loom these days. I expect the intensity of people who talked about this coin will be less in the upcoming days. Loom is going down again.",

We need to remember that there were hundreds of coins which played similar techniques and if we are going to invest or if we see any coin pumping more than 10% we should check about the coin's potential and reason behind the pump, if we don't find any valid reason behind pump then it's a scripted plan from developers or group of traders to pool in more money and dump it when it's at peak.",

What you did is right, you are not a newbie already to commit a mistake and you think you are not an idiot to repeat the same mistake again. The essence of investing must be to buy low and sell high only and we shouldn't ever entered a moving train as it was very risky.Many new altcoins can start with a very low price but we must be careful about them and it's better to just go on a coin that has an experience already because there is a big chance that they can repeat their good performance again. We can also re-buy the coin again and won't abandon them permanently like others are doing in a newer coin. Last but not the least is, they are also easy to find.",

Even if you are lucky and enter early and get an upward pump, there is no guarantee that you will sell at the right time or that there will be enough sell orders to execute your sell order. When there is an upward pump in currencies like these, there will be manipulation in the possibility of withdrawal, especially if trading volumes are low or all of the liquidity is controlled by one party or if the token is listed on two or three exchanges.old classic pump & dump is scam, it is difficult to get money from an active scam, if we avoid ethics.",

Its not like we are trading a shitcoin but this is a Binance listed token where the volume is high and a lot of users trading it. You are right on some point but how can there be a manipulations on withdrawal? We are talking about trading activity not cashing out money. I believe manipulations can be done on this but not this kind of way.",
