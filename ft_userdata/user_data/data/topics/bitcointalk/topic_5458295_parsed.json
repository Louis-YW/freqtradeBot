If not, why not?Let's make this post friendly by sharing views and thoughts.Not sure I would reveal my true identity to the world unless it's absolutely necessary. I prefer to be unpopular or not to be too much known....otherwise I would be confused, sick or lose concentration as i'm not designed to be popular. I wouldn't mind revealing my true identity to my coworkers/friends though. Notwithstanding, it's better to remain private than giving out a fake identity which is real ID opposite. Fake ID could ruin ones reputation as it could be seen as identity theft, dishonesty,etc. Beside, Satoshi promoted honesty in Bitcoin System and Bitcoin whitepaper. I would rather use my true identity than fake unless there is option to use a Username or Bitcoin Public Address in place of real name. My username would probably still be my real name but slightly obscured.",
