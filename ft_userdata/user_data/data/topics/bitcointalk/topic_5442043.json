Especially if the following few people knew the importance of Bitcoin and its value would increase so much in the future, maybe they would not have created such an event.Martti MalmiIn October 2009, Finnish computer scientist Martti Malmi sold 5050 Bitcoins at a rate of just $0.00099/BTC, which was the record for the lowest price in Bitcoin history. But this was the first recorded sale of Bitcoin through PayPal.Laszlo HanycezLaszlo Hanycez This guy made a new history of selling bitcoins. He was the first to make history by making the first product purchase with Bitcoin. On May 22, 2010, he made history by selling his 10,000 Bitcoins for just two pizzas. Because of its history, May 22nd is celebrated every year as Bitcoin Pizza Day.Theymos/Bitcoin Forum AdminThe last person to record a Bitcoin sale was their well-known Bitcoin forum admin, Theymos, on February 20, 2010, who sold 160 Bitcoins at a rate of $0.003/BTC for just 48 cents, the lowest Bitcoin sale in history.",

Oh wait there was one guy, Man makes last-ditch effort to recover $280 million in bitcoin he accidentally threw out.

Now if the trading volume of Bitcoin decreases i.e. becomes zero (assuming) then the value of Bitcoin in the market will become zero i.e. there will be no acceptance among users.",

Because the truth is that back then in 2010 people didn't believe in Bitcoin, and even if they did, nobody expected it could rise to such price it is today, if not I'm sure Sir \"Theymos\" would never have sold his Bitcoin.",

Many of us have made sales transactions with bitcoin even though we know that in the future it could be worth a million dollars and even more. A currency that is not used is not a currency, and these events became famous and helped to gradually increase its use as a currency. Also, there are times when you want to spend now, not wait 10 years for the price to rise, the important thing is that you always save something, that is, if you have 10 bitcoins you can spend 1 today and with the other 9 you wait for the price to rise more. This without taking into account that over time you can get more bitcoins, for example by mining, which is what theymos did.",

There's no task required whatsoever to be able claim it, although solving a captcha was later on added. Gavin Andresen created freebitcoins.appspot.com so that people could try Bitcoin out. That was his way to spread Bitcoin. And he started with a stock of 1,100BTC. Donation was also accepted and many made contributions. Even the Bitcoin OG, BitcoinFX donated 500BTC to that faucet. Accordingly, Gavin gave away almost 20,000BTC through that faucet, although I think that amount already included donations from supporters.",

That's the question to ask yourself when considering the above listed names as people who made mistakes. Practically the fun of selling bitcoin for few bucks made them realize the importance of bitcoin and they stacked more of it. For instance, in domain business, if I have a portfolio of 10 domain names and sell 1 cheaper, that doesn't mean the rest in the list won't bring profits. Trading requires exchange, despite your claims that its a mistake, traders still sell bitcoin till date. Now I can sell 0.009BTC for $200 but later bitcoin might get too high that people in the next generation would say I made a huge mistake for selling at that amount, adding that I would have been richer if I held, yet it doesn't me from becoming rich. So, its a recurring sales and it happened willingly, it shouldn't be seen as negligence of bitcoin value.",
