What's the guarantee that you send the money then?Here are a few simple steps for users to create an order:1. Fill in the required fields.2. Proceed through the steps until you get to the wallet for payment.Any new order created by a user will be available for 24 hours. During this 24-hour period, users have the time to transfer the asset to the wallet provided. If the user does not make the payment within this time frame, the order will be deleted from the system.On the other hand, if a user pays the order within the 24-hour window, we will process the order within 60 minutes and manually change the order status to \"successfully paid.\" From this moment, the order link will be available for the user for 72 hours to check the TX ID, which we will provide after payment and more. We believe that the timing we have set for users is sufficient to address any issues or verify transactions effectively.Quote from: Husires on November 17, 2023, 08:13:00 AMQuote from: Darker45 on November 17, 2023, 01:57:04 AMYou seem to be in a hurry launching your platform you ended up doing it prematurely.
