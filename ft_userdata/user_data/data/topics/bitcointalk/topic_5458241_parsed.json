Venezuela and Lebanon[1], for example, are countries where individuals are not able to withdraw their money from the bank, and there are restrictions on withdrawals. We can draw on the recent bank crisis in the United States[2], which made the Federal Insurance Corporation insure deposits of depositors below a certain level.These topics apply directly because do not trust the bank.Also, if we take what happened in Iran, Russia and some countries that have imposed a ban on financial transfers, Bitcoin is decentralized so that you can send money anywhere in the world with fees close to zero.All of these are convincing and logical reasons and arguments that can be inferred to define Bitcoin more than the partial price or that it is an investment that will achieve a return quickly and profitably.[1] Lebanese cannot access money in banks since late 2019[2] 2023 banking crisis",

I always tell anyone who asks me how Bitcoin profit works that, to some point, I tell them that Bitcoin has past its 10x season and that there are no expectations of a 10-100x bull run in the coming days, weeks, and years. We should reduce our expectations in order not to get disappointed. Although there are also higher possibilities since Bitcoin price movements can't always be perfectly predicted,  Aside from Bitcoin being used as a means of investment with a possible ROI, I do tell people that it gives them freedom over their wealth, like total control of your funds, where you can use them whenever, wherever, and send them to whomever without seeking anyone's permission. Its seamless nature is one of the things I like the most about it; there is no limit to the amount that could be transacted at a time.",

Which is basically the features of BTC but your query needs different answers, because most of the previous threads point out the features which basically tell you why BTC is a good source of storing value. Here are some benefits came to my mind:BTC is decentralized which provides you full anonymity to remain hidden from centralized organization, which uses your transactional data to show different advertisements to you.BTC is a best source of sending money from one place to another place without the help of some middlemen who will charge you huge tax and feel. Like if you want to send money from foreign country to yours then you have to pay taxes and feel too but if you use BTC to send your money across different countries you will only be charged around 2$ for sending. Biggest example is El-Salvador country, there authorities has made one of the many statement that we are preferring it for legal tender because sending and receiving money through BTC becomes easy. Quote from: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2289763-why-has-el-salvador-officially-adopted-bitcoin-as-its-currency/but they have to pay high transaction costs, and 70 per cent of people have no bank account. Bitcoin enables quick, cheap payments across borders, and doesn’t require banks.  BTC could be used to remove corruption from the system, because every transaction will be recorded.BTC saves your money from different bankruptcies of banks which could become a problem one a bank bankrupted you will not be able to send or receive money didn't  withdrawal become impossible until system return to there normal functioning but that not happen in BTC which indicates 100% availability. BTC provide exceptional security which is not guaranteed by every bank in most of the places on globe.List is so long, but I would like to end it here. I hope it would helped you,",

But sadly most people associate bitcoin as an \"asset\" that they can invest in to make profit in the future. This destroys the whole purpose of bitcoin being a decentralized currency that will make people less dependent on centralized financial institution where individual people has no say in making any decisions, nor any freedom on how to use their money. But we can't blame people for using it as a long term investment opportunity due to some drawbacks that make bitcoin sometimes unusable as a day to day currency.",

So they even cant force their parents to invest in such a risky market. The Alpha generation wants to explore financial freedom and they looking at BTC BTC. I would advise those who know about Bitcoin and its fundamentals and have any type of small skill they should provide services and then invest that money into the market which will guarantee your safe future from a financial view.This is the way how youngsters like me can stay close to technology and the financial world without disturbing their ongoing financial circle. Besides that, if you know any type of investor who invests his money in different assets you should guide him to pay some attention to Bitcoin this way you can guide him and bring some capital to market which will be ultimately your own profit.Quote from: seesmtz on July 01, 2023, 04:54:24 PMSee my poll https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3563759;sa=showPostsHmm, wrong link and you should not post like this it will be counted as spam.

Like i also created a topic on this about people does not really care about decentralization.

But i think fee is not that much minimum fee may vary from 2$ to 5$ maximum.

Bitcoin is useful in countries with very weak currencies because it is a hard currency.2. Bitcoin is useful in areas of the world where people are unbanked because it allows digital payments without the need for banks.3. Bitcoin is useful for long term storage of wealth because you can bank yourself so it's like storing a chest of gold that nobody can ever find (note here I'm specifically talking about storing of wealth, not appreciation of wealth, since you want answers that don't have to do with appreciation of value).4. Bitcoin is useful for people fleeing or migrating out of countries because it means they can store they money in bitcoin safely and still have it when they arrive in their destination country and not have their money trapped in their country of origin.5. Related to #2, Bitcoin is useful in places where specific groups of people (like women) aren't allowed access to banks and financial services.6. Bitcoin allows the cheap transfer of money which gets around the expensive fees of remittances when people send money back to their families who live in poorer countries.7. For merchants, Bitcoin allows use of digital money without the ~3% credit card fees (using LN obviously rather than on-chain).8. Specifically for bitcoin mining, not bitcoin the currency, Bitcoin mining solves a lot of energy (as well as some heat) related problems in the world.I'm sure there are more but that's what I can think of off the top of my head.",

Many countries' currencies are losing value every day and Bitcoin has been stable for some time now. So keeping fiat in the bank can make the money worthless within a few years. Bitcoin can help nations and individuals to invade sanctions and government restrictions. Most nations that have been sanctioned by some banks or countries can use bitcoin to carry out business and other transactions. In some countries, the government is implementing strict banking control that citizens have limits to their banking transactions. This has led to untold hardship because some businesses and individuals have to resort to illegal channels of accessing needed funds. But Bitcoin breaks such a barrier. Before the congestion of the Bitcoin mempool, bitcoin transaction fees were cheaper than most bank transfers. So when the transaction price normalizes, bitcoin transaction fees will still be more competitive. Apart from keeping Bitcoin until the price appreciates might not be the only intention of every Bitcoin holders. Some people don't want the state, organization, or individuals to know how much they are worth, so they decide to hide their wealth using Bitcoin.",

Whether it's rare or not the problem exists, My view is also with the core community Ordinals have no place on the blockchain especially on Bitcoin because it was not the purpose but, Problem is still here because if I don't want to drink mango shake it doesn't mean other also don't want. Miners seem to be more greedy they are preparing well because, in the last congestion, miners got enormous rewards on the transaction fees even more than the block rewards.1$ 2$ hmm, is a big problem because the transaction for the day-to-day products will be in Satoshis and it can vary from 0.5$ to 100$ of referring the 0.00005 BTC to 0.001 BTC and even to 1 BTC or 100BTC. So a person who is buying the product of 0.0001BTC is not ready to pay the fees varying from 0.0001BTC to 0.0003BTC and even more if the network is busy. For the proper mode of payment there we can't be dependent on that many fees even though we already have alternatives.If I am getting my monthly salary in the BTC and I am sending the monthly expenditures to my family and for the rest of transactions above 0.002BTC I won't mind paying the fees but for the products like 1KG sugar and all that stuff, I can't afford the fee. In my view, this is the biggest limitation of Bitcoin being the universal currency. (Well this a matter of the future for now things are on Ok Ok level.)",
