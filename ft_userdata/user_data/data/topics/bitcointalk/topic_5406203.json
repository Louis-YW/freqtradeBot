  "content": "I have commented on this in another thread but it seems to me that this deserves a dedicated thread specifically.When there are market downturns, and in bear markets like this one, the community repeats the mantra that 1BTC is 1BTC as a consolation.And I understand that it has its logic for someone who acquires Bitcoin and will HODL it for a long time, but not if we conceive it as a currency, as a P2P cash as Satoshi conceived it, because if it is a currency we are going to use it frequently, in the day to day to acquire goods and services. If it is a currency, the purchasing power has been reduced by 70% or more.Quote from: Poker Player on July 14, 2022, 03:17:41 AMIf Bitcoin is a currency, you are going to use it to buy things, and the fact is that months ago, assuming that for example buying a loaf of bread cost you $1 or its equivalent in Bitcoin, with 1BTC you would buy 69,000 loaves, and today you buy only 20,000, which is a considerable difference.If you acquire Bitcoin as an investment, and you are going to HODL it for a long time, I understand that you repeat the mantra that 1BTC is 1BTC.Tautologies are apparently evident true statements, but if we stop to analyze them, they have many nuances.For example: Poker Player is Poker Player. Do we agree with that? Surely we do. But is Poker Player when he was 7 years old the same as Poker Player when he is 70 years old? No way.",

It is good as an investment, but it requires lot of support to be used as a currency. Even if bitcoin is valued in terms of Satoshi, every Satoshi will be valued in USD which is how it hold its value.Bitcoin can be used as a currency on daily basis if each and everything is priced in terms of bitcoin. This is tedious, because for a product that we pay with bitcoin might cost 0.01BTC, and the same when paid in USD will be lower or higher depending on bitcoin's price fluctuation. Here people wish to pay through which they can enjoy the lowest price for the particular product.",

To maintain the sequence of their correct actions, as people tend to evaluate themselves better. But at a time when the market is falling, I see nasty statements from my acquaintances that this is not so. An even more popular solution is that bitcoin is simply obliged to grow and regularly make a profit, and when something does not work, panic and sales begin, as many expect quick profits and are not ready to wait.",

It's not only the fluctuations in Bitcoin price that matters, it's also the country. Because 69k loaves in your country may have been 280k loaves in another country. However, I do get your point and I also feel that this wild fluctuations in the price, while they do bring Bitcoin into the news (especially in the bull runs), they are a barrier in getting it used globally as a currency and also as a store of value.Many (or maybe all) institutional investors advocating buying Bitcoin, the investors that should drive global acceptance are in trouble now and pretty much silent, since even if it's unrealized loss, it still looks bad on the papers.So while I do tell that 1BTC=1BTC, indeed, the context matters, hence you're right.",

I noticed that on this forum that some people will say 1 BTC is 1 BTC, it is right but I too see it as a wrong statement to be used during bear market, but in cases like when a newbie is confused, thinking that the value of his bitcoin can be altered when investing, the newbies can be corrected that no alteration because 1 BTC is 1 BTC. I have noticed that because of the volatility, some newbies are confused.Bitcoin is a speculative asset in this regard, it is not suitable to be used as a currency. But let us see it in another way too, I still do not have option than to convert my bitcoin to fiat whenever I want to spend, what if I can just spend it directly, that does not differ. But some people do not know how bitcoin price may fluctuate, these are the type of people that should be discouraged from using it as a currency because they may not know when to convert from unstable coin to stable coin and from stable coin back to unstable coin.You are not wrong.",

Ie at $69K 1 BTC = 1 BTC, and the same is true at $20K. So the considerable decline in price isn't related to Bitcoin's fundamentals, but merely market movements or cycles. Though of course I agree without selling at a loss, 1 BTC can easily return to ATH.The irony being that there is more of an argument for Bitcoin's lack of fungibility these days, with some people arguing 1 BTC ≠ 1BTC due to various centralized exchanges/services blacklisting UTXOs. But at the same time, this was also the case when Bitcoin was at $69K, as well as years prior, so doesn't appear relevant to price changes. Also to note the network treats each Bitcoin as equal, regardless of centralized providers suggesting otherwise. There will also be one company or product that can claim Bitcoins aren't equal, but this doesn't mean that they aren't...",

      "body": "I will comment strictly based on your title.  You say that one Bitcoin worth 69 thousand loaves is not equal to one Bitcoin worth 20 thousand loaves.  I think it is pretty clear even from your own title that one Bitcoin is still one Bitcoin, but what differs is the quantity of stuff you get from it.But on the other hand, while you can now get say 3 times less loaves with 1 Bitcoin, you can for example get a ton more Shitcoins using it than you could when Bitcoin was 69k.  And while for you loaves may be more important, maybe for me Shitcoins are.  In that case, you are in disadvantage while I am not.Then think about it.  While there are things you can now buy in less quantity and other things you can buy in higher quantity due to changing purchasing power, there are some things that are still priced the same they used to be years, maybe even decades ago.  For example, the cost of Bitcointalk VIP membership.So if we are talking about purchasing power, we will enter a long debate that, at least on my end, finishes the same way:  one Bitcoin is still one Bitcoin and just because what it was worth yesterday is different from what it is worth today does not make two Bitcoins different.Think Dollar.  You have $100 in your wallet.  Yesterday you saw a t-shirt that was up for sale at $100 and today it was reduced by a discount of 50%.  Yesterday you could get the t-shirt for 100% of your money and have 0% left in your wallet while today you can get the t-shirt for 50% of your money and still have 50% in your wallet to buy other stuff with or just hold on to.  Does that make your $100 from today different to the $100 from yesterday?Does inflation change your $1 bill that you are still holding from a decade ago?  Besides purchasing power in some cases, there is no difference that I see.  $1 is still $1.Anyway.  The discussion about 1 Bitcoin still being 1 Bitcoin no matter what has pretty much started from the debate whether Bitcoin is or is not fungible.  Some people say my Bitcoin is different from yours because they have a different history.  Some people say they are the same, because 'tainted history' is a made-up term that appeared only after Bitcoin was created and a decade ago there was no such thing.  I tend to agree with both sides.  I also agree with what Loyce or o_e_l_e_o once said here.  The most successful attack over Bitcoin is that they introduced this term, 'taint', which made us believe Bitcoin is not fungible at all.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Getting into thinking about that is quasi-philosophizing too, but surely it was the drop and the debate with you that led me to the conclusion, and, leaving aside what would have happened if what has happened hadn't happened, I think the argument would be equally valid if Bitcoin today was worth $0.4M as some theory predicted last year. The thing is that we could say that 1BTC ≠ 1BTC in a more positive way, because the purchasing power would have multiplied by almost 7 in less than a year.Quote from: pooya87 on July 14, 2022, 11:12:53 AMBecause if it's just because of sudden big drops, then a lot of other currencies in the world are not currencies considering they too dump a lot.

However, it is only true when we're talking about 1 BTC in the same respect (in this case, purely as one unit of the Bitcoin currency) and at the same time (which also helps to fix the issue with the price, as the price changes over time).

You lap on something to make you feel good and justify your shortcoming or missed chance. If anyone here got another chance to sell their BTC back when it was at ATH which was over $60k, I think everyone would take it in a heartbeat. Who knows, maybe a few more years when BTC price at $100k or goes as low as $5k. People wish they were buying or didn't sell at $20k. Basically, we're human and build around that unreasonable gloating to overcome our mistakes or miss a good chance to do something, cope as you said. If anyone here thinks I was shiting on them for that, please don't. I think it's completely normal behavior to pull ourselves forward and make our lives easier, and less negative. If not then it will be full of depression and can lead to suicide which you guys must saw it occasionally on the news: \"Man kills himself because lost his money in crypto\". It's just sad.",
