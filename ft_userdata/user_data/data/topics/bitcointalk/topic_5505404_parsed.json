Currently, we now have Black Rock and the largest asset managers having investments in Bitcoin, and Trump and other politicians talking seriously about Bitcoin. Ten years ago suggesting that that would happen would be laughable.I initially thought you had something pretty good to say about Bitcoin HODLing judging by the title, but in reality, your points are not without faults. Let me start with Bitcoin HODLing as the title reads, only a fool would say HODLing Bitcoin is bad, but at the same time, we should be smart about it. For me, more money would be made when people strike it at the right price, not at the top in the name of they want to HODL it for years, I hope Bitcoin will not disappoint such people. The way it behaved when it was still below $500 is not the way it is going to behave when it is close to $100,000. Also, a smart investment is in Investing and Divesting at the right times and according to what the long-term chart says, which is a good thing to consider by anyone, after all, an investment is an investment, it is the amount you earn that matters.As for Blackrock, well, it's nice, but I still want you to know that these people saw an opportunity in Bitcoin and they created a business around it. This could be technically selfish, but I still love their approach, after all, it's a win-win for them and Bitcoin. But for Trump, you will only be deceiving yourself if you think Trump is a Bitcoin Cabal, he is never a Bitcoiner but a deceit. The guy is only using Bitcoin's popularity for his gain, someone who had condemned it many times in the past. At your slightest consciousness, how many investments or businesses of Trump are in Bitcoin? Talk is cheap, let's be wise.",

Some people might decide to sell, while others will want it hodl for a long time. Bitcoin gives everyone the choice and freedom to use it the way they want. Institutional investors like BlackRock contributed to the increase in the price of Bitcoin, but they will keep promoting centralization. The best we can do is to keep our keys and also promote decentralization in any way we can. Politicians like Trump shouldn't be taken seriously. After the US presidential elections in November, this hype about Bitcoin in the political space will disappear. We will know the true nature of the winner of the election after the elections.",

Maybe those people find it crazy to think about doing that are impatient to wait for long time because what they think bitcoin is fast cash grab. They failed to realize that everything fast especially on crypto has negative effect like losing money instantly since volatility is really unpredictable and this is always caught up those people who's looking for fast earnings for their daily trades.But for sure people explore in those possibilities to hold then engage with long term holding especially if they really see the potential gains without exerting to much effort in this this investment we select. If there are some people laugh with that idea much better let them do whatever they want since for sure they will just miss those good opportunities especially if bitcoin reach at huge price that they don't expect to happen.",
