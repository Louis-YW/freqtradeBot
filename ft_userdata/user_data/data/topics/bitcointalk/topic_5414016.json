  "content": "I know all the members who are into bitcoin and crypto. We heard a sentence that whales are manipulating the market. Manipulating! It was a little confusing for me when I heard this the first time, but when I actually understand what actual manipulating should look like, there are lots of members who also want to know what it might look like to see that picture. And see the game how they played it 4 hours ago. They invested in knc worth 65+ btc, so they added value to knc, but it appears that they have already sold 52+ btc worth of knc after 4 hours. They are pumping and dumping the market price. This is how they actually play the game. Just think, you saw that the KNC price went up when they invested 65+ BTC, and after hours you saw a major dump on KNC after they sold 52+ BTC worth of KNC. Now we think yes, we got an entry point because it dumped, so it will pump again. But you might not have noticed that they are still holding 13+ btc worth of knc. So he can easily dump your fund, which means you invest in the price. Then they dump it again by selling their portfolio. You will panic and sell at a loss. They will again buy and play their usual game. I hope now you understand before investing or trading how much research you should have done and don't take an entry on a sudden pump and dump moment. Thank you so much if you understand what I actually wanted to tell you. Your comments will be appreciated by me.",

Also this whales has other tactics they use and that is buying Influences and if they already popular they make use of their own influences. We all have this business tycoons we all admire, follow, but their books and believe their theories now this make it easy for them. They can set one up to buying a particular coin by just speaking on the potentials and they supporting the coin. Many people can actually don't won’t to research but rather choose to follow the influences of whales or crypto influencers we have seen many projects rise by such influences but only a small portion still stays relevant.",

When more people start to buy at that price, they dump,• News and media can also be used to manipulate trader sentiment. Social media influencers are now becoming more popular to shill projects,• Governments can also manipulate the market with policies they adopt.Bitcoin as the most popular and adopted  cryptocurrency is somewhat inoculated from the effects of manipulation. It's mostly unrewarding and expensive to attempt.",

We can compare crypto whales to our daily physical activities and the whales we meet on daily market activities. These real life whales withhold their goods when they get information of scarcity or shortage of supply from manufacturers and this will cause price increase. They can withdraw their product from the market if they want to cause artificial increase. Crypto whales are not far from same strategy to shake the market for additional money, that is the circle of business strategy that we know.",

They are pumping and dumping the market price.That is not all of the pumpers' money that shows in this stats though. Basically the actual pumpers buy the shitcoin before the pump begins then they call up the idiots to buy the expensive shitcoin and as they start buying some others (with bots, etc.) notice and start buying on the rise. Then the pumpers start dumping as the idiots continue buying the expensive shitcoin.It is also obvious from the difference between the volumes (65 in, 52 out) that shows the bag holders who held on to the shitcoin hoping it goes up and gives them profit.QuoteThen they dump it again by selling their portfolio. You will panic and sell at a loss. They will again buy and play their usual game.Technically what you explained is just a correction during the pump not necessarily the pumpers. After each sudden jump in price of anything, there is always a dump when traders pull out their profit after reaching a certain %.Remember the second group I said join in as they see the pump starting? This kind of \"correction\" is usually them selling to get their quick profit out.QuoteI hope now you understand before investing or trading how much research you should have done and don't take an entry on a sudden pump and dump moment.It is a high risk method of making quick profit from market manipulation. You see a rocket, you jump on but you jump off quickly too before the rocket crashes!",

Most of the investors who are panicking here are newbies and those who have been here for quite some time might know what to do into that situation already. This affects traders at least and not those who are holding for mid to long term. We know that manipulation is happening for a very long time already and what's my strategy into it? I'm just buying long-term coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In that way, I'm less prone to pump and dump as these 2 are harder to manipulate plus I will have lesser stress. I already saw many people (mostly influencers) pumping a particular coin and then will sell it immediately and leave those investors who bought late at a loss.",

The problem here is they are doing it with big funds that why we can feel it as retailers since we only got a tiny pie on that part of they are trading. So pumping and dumping due to this isnt actually illegal cause they are doing it same way we do the only difference is they are risking so much money in the process.",

So prices become more dumped and panic sellers out. So whales will start to accumulate once again, when people see the green market they jump again.

      "body": "I've been talking about a similar thing on Bitcoin for years now, especially since they made the futures ETF and then allowed people to short bitcoin. When this wasn't possible the rich players were to lazy to convert their money into BTC and thought it to be too risky for them, but since the futures opened up they allowed them to safely make big money by teaming up with people who already had bitcoin.This works good for both parties because every time a bitcoin whale sells the futures fiat investor copies their move on a futures exchange and shares profits while the bitcoin holder takes all the risk by holding coins on exchanges. I have this to tell you OP. Don't play their game. They're here to take your coins and they pray on those who play with big leverage. They have enough money to liquidate you in minutes and they're doing it every day. Don't think their goal is to destroy bitcoin or dump it to 10k or something. They want it to thrive so they can keep doing what they're doing. They don't want to make everyone to lose everything on the market and leave.
