However, many economist predict that inflation may increase in the coming years due to factors such as rising commodity prices and increased government spending. Inflation can be caused by increase in demand for goods and services exceeds the supply prices tends to rise. Increase in production costs, increase in money supply, decrease in supply of goods and services prices tend to rise due to scarcity. Natural disasters can impact also Inflation rate.",

However, it should be noted that inflation is a global issue now and might have subsided months ago. But the recent inflation figures are now causing panic again as the curve is now shifting higher globally.how to check if my keyboard is workingThe US which is most referenced in this regard since its currency is vital to the world, is facing increased inflation and it was not a good figure last month. Experts believe that it will be rising till 2025 as you can see in the graph above, so we should get ready for it. While below image shows the last CPI figure of the US. The previous value was 0.1% and the last value was 0.1%, which speaks that inflation is still bitting.And for your reference, inflation doesn't necessarily have to grow with the rates as I've experienced, other factors are contributing as well. It's the USD that has the blessing of inflation as the currency is a Safe-haven asset.",

This is due to unstable global geo-political problems, weather problems, and many other problems which cause inflation to occur. Even the most real threat is that the US will default if the government does not find a meeting point with parliament. It will threaten the American economy and there will be many people who are threatened with being fired and it will disrupt the stability of the US economy. This default problem can be considered quite massive for the US and could have an impact on the world, even though it is not too significant, it can cause inflation for other countries. But you don't need to worry too much about the problem of inflation, as long as you are sure that you have enough money to survive, you should be safe.",

The whole world is going through a bad time today due to inflation and it is slowly taking a dire shape. A few days ago, the alliance of oil producing countries OPEC Plus said that they will reduce their production. As soon as this news flushes, the market begins to have a major impact. They decided to reduce oil production by 1.6 million barrels per day and on the basis of their decision the current situation is starting to get worse. They said that this situation will continue till the end of this year.",

Prices go up every year if there is no deflation (and usually there isn't) and inflation fluctuates up and down.And what whill happend in 2023 and beyond? in my opinion, the scenario of 1940 and 1970 (previous periods of great inflation) will repeat itself. What happened then? After the initial inflation spike and decline, there were 2 more waves. it all took about 10 years before we got back to normal.Something like this:So 2-3 months of inflation going down before turnover.",

I cannot predict exact percentages. Do you really want someone to try and predict the future of the global economy for you? Not going to happen. Some countries are going to have lower inflation than others, but the overall situation is going to be better(until the recession kicks in).The markets are unstable by nature. Low price volatility doesn't mean stability. I don't rely on the opinions of economic experts, because I have a degree in macroeconomics and I'm not that dumb.",

So we only need to prepare for all possibilities, and various anticipations in order to survive amid the onslaught of inflation that will occur. Whether relying on the opinions of economists or not, it is clear that there must be certain benchmarks so that vigilance is maintained. Each country has its own inflation percentage but it is possible that the increase in value will be quite high compared to the previous year.",

Even when there is no official statement of banks of any country according to you. It is evident that inflation is real and it is continuously growing. Prices are going higher, be it food, materials, products, or services. It is also in many forms like shrinkflation where product packaging is getting smaller. What more, the only sword and armor you can have against inflation is price appreciating assets. Have an investment. Bitcoin can be one of those. But requires lot of risk. It could also be stocks, metals, or real state.",

Predicting the future is something that almost no one can do, no one has a crystal ball to do it with. From what is happening, it is clear that inflation is showing signs of cooling down, and if the world does not have more negative news, it will certainly continue to decrease. But if we have a few more bad events like pandemics or wars, surely inflation will rise again. In short, a prediction is still just a prediction, there is no guarantee it will happen for sure and no one knows for sure the future.Another point worth noting is that many people think that the Fed will stop raising interest rates, and if that happens, it will mean that inflation this year will decrease, not continue to increase.",
