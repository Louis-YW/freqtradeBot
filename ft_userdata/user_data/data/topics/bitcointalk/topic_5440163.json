      "body": "What's new here? All the market capacity of alternative currencies moves with the movement of the price of Bitcoin, and therefore it follows the price of Bitcoin. If the price rises, the belief that the market is booming will increase, and therefore investment in alternative currencies, and the opposite occurs when the price decreases.The last price move was to try to break the top, which did not happen, and therefore I wanted the price towards the nearby resistance point.As for altcoins, they moved accordingly",

It’s just a retrace, I am not saying that we will not go lower but the price & market is not faltering at the moment.Let’s see what happens through the rest of 2023. It could be a wild ride due to macro environment.",

      "body": "Nothing new. I knew that $25,000 will act as a psychological resistance before it goes down. It's on my prediction as well that's why I thought it will be and it seems like it happened... at least for now.It's just a common retracement that's all. Now the question is, will the downward movement will continue, or it will make another bounce again and surpass $25,000 \"again\". Let's just observe what will be the next moves of Bitcoin and the whole crypto market. Just continue to accumulate at least.",

Price movements of 5% up and down within a day are happening pretty regularly even with Bitcoin and with the altcoins the price movements are even way bigger than that. Regarding the current situation of Bitcoin and the whole market, i think it is completely normal, that we are seeing red numbers today after the price went up pretty fast and also pretty high in the days before. I would call this a healthy correction. Now Bitcoin is standing at around 23.7k $ per coin which is more than 9% higher than a week ago. No need to complain here.",

There's too much volatility in this market, its hard to predict it.",

While Ethereum has made it to $1,700, the price was interestingly high again as the recovery was too quick for bitcoin. Every time when bitcoin goes down, it's making it look like it's really down to the bottom part of the market. Well, can't blame the article makers if they're like that. That's how to attract readers to their published articles. The author has to make another article about bitcoin's fast recovery.",

Nevertheless when we try to break it again the 3rd time, we knows, maybe it will be easy and then the price will stand on that levels. At least we have still more than a week to get to that this February and hopefully we can do that again this month and then look for $28k-$30k next month.",
