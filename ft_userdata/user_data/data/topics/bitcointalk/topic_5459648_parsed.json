  "content": "Hi all,I have been in Gala for quite a while and since the upgrade in May there has been a lot of confusion when it Â comes to their supply and potential in the coming bull run. Many people sold their position after the upgrade in May however I have just held but haven't bought any since. The current price should be appealing but I am put off by a lot of talk going round saying the potential of Gala is not so great anymore due to the increased supply.Can someone explain this as I am fairly new to understanding tokenomics and how it affects potential price. I initially started to invest in Gala in the hope it would reach at least $1 next bull run but many are saying now it will struggle to even reach 50 cents. I am just not sure what to believe and if I should buy these lows to bring my average buy down or just hold and hope for the best.",

It all boils down to the law of supply of demand. Demand for altcoins in general seems to have decreased so Gala increasing the supply circulating in the open market is going to be perceived as bad. Perception is enough for a lot of investors to dump their bags.QuoteI initially started to invest in Gala in the hope it would reach at least $1 next bull run but many are saying now it will struggle to even reach 50 cents.People's price speculation are often wrong during bullrun. You have ETH that has an unlimited supply with POW algo but ATH keeps breaking. If there is enough anticipation for Gala that people would FOMO then who knows what's gonna happen to the price?",

      "body": "Thanks Yogee, I will hold my Gala for now and buy if we fall below 2 cents to bring my average buy down. Hopefully we are only a few months away from bull run so we will know soon how well this will do.",

Like many other coins in the space, if it can survive and continue to grow through trends that are also receiving hype, then I think it still has its own potential. I haven't paid too much attention to it since quite a while after making quite a bit of profit with GALA before, but personally I still think it will pick up bullish signals in the next bull cycle as well. according to.So if you really have researched and believe in its potential, build a clear plan and I think there is a long-term strategy for managing capital as well as investing properly, remember that risk It is also important to look at the process and consider and be responsible for your decisions.",
