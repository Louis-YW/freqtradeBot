I said ok at least tell let me withdraw my fund. they say no and ban me permanently for money laundering lol.by the way, i have been an active member there i have wagered more than 1 BTC there in the past. When I deposit without a wager this time this trigger something on their system and I chat with Nicolas and ask what's up. He said you use stake for money laundering and ban me permanently without the ability to withdraw my funds.here proof  of can't withdraw. https://i.imgur.com/i115pV5.pngBy this way Stake is a scam. They told me they reply in 24 hours to review my account. they lie its been 7 days and they don't reply in  emails they give in my other account over 400$. so if they can't stick to their words is not the casino you want to play. this the email they gave.

Show your deposit and withdrawal page transactions screenshot, also the screenshot of your recent gameplay statistics. If they banned you for money laundering then they have strong reason and proof behind it. BTW, why you changed your initial post by editing it?Quote from: https://ninjastic.space/post/60916195I deposit a couple of transactions at once without use them yet and it triggered some security.They said you can't deposit at once without wager with it and ban my account.I said ok at least tell let me withdraw. they ask me for selfies and anything i provided them everything was fine and yet they came with the same excuses.That I use their platform for money laundering. extremely unprofessional for them to accuse me for money laundering.Only because I withdraw couple of time without wager.No casino will allow you to withdraw always if you don't wager with your deposits. Where you have done it couple of times at Stake (based on your initial post). Every casino will consider it as money laundering activity.",

It's really easy to abuse if there are no wager requirement. You are laterally using them as a mixer to break connections. If you have done it several times then obviously there are no doubt left that you are using them not for gambling but for mixing your coins. This is not allowed hence they banned the account.The last thing you can do now is, come to a negotiation. If they ask for KYC then do it or if they ask any other form of documents or transaction validation then co-operate them to get your deposit back. They are bound by their terms and if you play according to their terms then you should be able to get your deposit back.Good luck.",

Why would you even want to do that? Generally, wagering requirements are placed on deposits to ensure that they comply with AML laws. They have every right to consider it as money laundering since you have done it several times already. After all, what did you expect to happen if you knowingly violated their terms of service? They are a casino, not a crypto mixer.",

You should know better, you already wagered 1 Bitcoin in Stake and part of their TOS and all casinos, that when you deposit you are supposed to play, and you must play, you can play your deposit the next day next week but you need to play, changing your mind is not acceptable, and will mark your account as trying to use the casino for mixing, casinos have a hard penalty on money laundering, it seems you are not familiar on money laundering policy of all casinos for you to think that you can get away with it, so sorry but rules are rules but still take your chance, but accept the consequence of your action.",
