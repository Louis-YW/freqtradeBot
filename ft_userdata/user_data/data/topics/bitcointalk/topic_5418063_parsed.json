      "body": "jmlkav6699, Armory doesn't work if you download the blockchain in prune mode. I knew this, but I don't know why I forgot to mention that when replying to your other topic. I am sorry. If you can't store the full blockhchain, as mentioned by BitMaxz in that topic, the only solution for you is to import your private key(s) into a SPV wallet like electrum.If pruning was enabled when downloading the blockchain, that's what caused the problem.",

By sweeping your private keys, you actually made a transaction to your electrum wallet. Now, your transaction has been broadcast to the network and you should be able to see that on block explorers as well. It will be confirmed sooner or later. The confirmation time depends on the fee rate you used for your transaction. Whatever fee you paid, it shouldn't take long. Network isn't busy.",
