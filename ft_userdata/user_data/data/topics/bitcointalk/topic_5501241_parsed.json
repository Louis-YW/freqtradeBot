Things like this isn't new, just the way so many coins were called 'the next BTC,' all other crap / scam coins but you know how most of them ended. Fixed your post a bit.The best way to look at it is the global market cap of all crypto is $2.25 trillion of that BTC is $1.2 trillion. So every other coin added together is LESS then the value of BTCI would be more concerned about ETH taking a dive as more and more people who are staking it @ 4% give or take https://www.blocknative.com/ethereum-staking-calculator sell it off and move to a CD making over 5% https://www.synchronybank.com/banking/cd/ Back of the napkin round number math. You need 32 ETH to stake and at the moment ETH is at $3400 so 32ETH * $3400 = $108800 Now $108800 * the 1% you are giving up is $1088As ETH goes up in value your loss from staking @ 4% vs CD rates goes up as well.BTC will be fine.Alts will keep being crap alts.-Dave",

Bitcoin and Ethereum are two different things. Bitcoin is a  monetary network and hard money without inflation in digital form. On the other hand, Ethereum is something like a centralized company managed by a small group of people. In my opinion, Ethereum is a scam because they use the Bitcoin narrative to deceive people into buying their pre-mined ETH. When Ethereum was launched, it started with a pre-mine of 70 million ETH. They previously claimed to be the world computer, and now they claim to be ultrasound money, etc. This cannot be sound money; it is just like fiat money where a small group of people in the central committee determines monetary policy. So far, they have changed the supply policy seven times, and just a month ago, they entered into high inflation again. Anyone who understands economic principles knows that harder money always wins, just like in mathematics 2 and 2 are 4. Bitcoin is the hardest money the world has ever seen. Bitcoin competes with gold and real estate, not with tech companies like Ethereum, and it is likely to surpass the market cap of gold in the next 10-15 years. As for the future of Ethereum, it is likely that a better company like Solana or Kaspa, etc., will emerge and surpass them.",

      "body": "Ethereum has been #2 for a while, but I don't think it has real prerequisites to seriously become #1. Its capitalization is significant, but it's still way too small to compete with Bitcoin. In fact, it's a mere third of Bitcoin's capitalization. Ethereum had its time of fame during the ICO boom of 2017, and then maybe a couple of times more. But it's perceived more as a platform than as a currency, so Bitcoin is still getting much more trust and attention as a standalone currency rather than a platform for something else. And there's no good reason for that to change. Not to mention that BTC being PoW vs ETH being PoS makes the former more decentralized.",

ETH is a security issued by a group of people, and I believe that according to American laws, an ETF cannot be granted for securities but only for commodities. If we look at the history of ETH's creation and consider that the ETH foundation is essentially something like a company with Vitalik Buterin as the CEO who manages the company's operations, it is unclear under which law the SEC approved the ETF for ETH.",

I do not see this happening, maybe you can add more details to this claim of investors shifting to Ethereum and ditching Bitcoin. How can this even happen when Bitcoin have increased its market dominance to over 53% just recently; this simply means there is more interest in Bitcoin now than ever. If you also recur that Bitcoin ETF was just approved, you will understand why there is more interest and confidence in Bitcoin than Ethereum. I have not seen any response of the Ethereum price to the massive buy you are trying to convince us to believe, ETH is just following the path of BTC as usual so your concerns might just be unnecessary distractions.",
