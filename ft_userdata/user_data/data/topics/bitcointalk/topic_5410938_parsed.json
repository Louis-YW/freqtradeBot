Most children do not realise that gambling can be a form of entertainment or a hobby, but can become a problem if things get out of hand. In this case, it may be right to train young people about the risks.",

But this varies to the casino themselves if they'll make one just as what's posted next to you. They can make their own academies through their own platforms just like the crypto exchanges, they have their own academies.There's a deeper knowledge that's inside these academies and not just all about being a successful gambler. Well, I'd love to hear it from someone who's entered a gambling academy on how's the experience. I'm sure that many would be interested to hear that out just for the sake of how it does work and what's the experience.",

We all have a proper mind to tell us what's right or wrong once we deal in gambling. Besides, even if there's a gambling school, I don't think they will be able to change the person not to chase their losses or be addicted. Those gambling schools will just teach mainly how gambling works in general and not will act as an institution to help people with gambling problems.Just be responsible and disciplined at all times at any cost even how hard it is. That's the only way to become a better gambler.",

I mean, if the schools are such that, they teach you about gambling management, offering of the services, customer relations, debugging the system and things like that, I would get it but, when it comes to teaching yiu how to take bets and stuffs like that, WTF. Gambling is far from a full fleshed career and as such, having a school that educates people on it is just something I haven't given any attention or see it to be necessary.People would do whatever but, how do you study a game of luck... Does it even makes sense...!",

Its not necessary to learn since basic knowledge is enough for us to go with it.What we need to have is more knowledge about risk management and I do hope that added on the school you think since if you only think about getting more strategies to win more on schools I think we can go anywhere with that.",

There are other useful things where we can spend our precious time rather than attending sessions in gambling school just to prepare ourselves for gambling. It's like we are treating gambling here as a future profession and career. It's also a waste of money as for sure, people will pay for enrollment fees as no institution will provide that teaching for free.If the purpose is just to educate people about gambling, there are lots of sources around but actually not necessary to refer to those.",

      "body": "A gambling educational course would be too short to fit into a standard school curriculum. There wouldn't be enough background exposition and information to need an entire school year to cover it. It should only take a few weeks to get the basics down. Then the rest of the education and training would focus on fundamentals such as mental discipline. And recognizing the difference between logical choices and emotional choices. Each loss would have to be rationalized and broken down to figure out which errors were made. It couldn't be covered by daily education. It would be more like a sports coaching gig.I do not think that most gamblers are interested in scrutinizing their gambling habits closely enough to consistently be successful at it. For many its an escape. Its a means of coping. Its something that gives them hope. Its a social thing. There are reasons they gamble aside from wanting or needing to be successful at it. And that's perfectly ok.",
