In other words, it cannot be \"banned\" easily.I don't think it is legal for Tornado Cash to be on the OFAC SDN list. I don't think it meets the criteria. The fact that Tornado Cash is not an actual entity (nor a person) makes it difficult to get it off the SDN list. I am not an expert in the relevant law, but most likely, someone who sends/receives coin to/from the Tornado Cash smart contract and subsequently encounters problems would need to pursue litigation. Tornado Cash has essentially been \"banned\" via intimidation. That means the US government is threatening severe consequences for using this particular smart contract. From a technical perspective, nothing is preventing an arbitrary person from sending an arbitrary amount of coin to the smart contract address, however, I think few (if any) people will because of these threats. Quote from: witcher_sense on August 09, 2022, 05:26:38 AMSo, the question that bothers me is could the same happen to Bitcoin? What will happen to Bitcoin if the US Government suddenly decides to take down its Github repos? See my above comments. The Biden administration is not exactly known for its competence, or its ability to follow the law. From a technical perspective, many people have copies of the code for bitcoin core, and people would need to obtain the code from what they believe to be a reliable source if they need the code for whatever reason. However, I would again refer you to my comments about the intimidation by the US government.

This is independent of github, which is just a website.It's not like, say, subversion (SVN) where you have a server with all the story of the code and you just get a part of it locally. With git, every person that has cloned the source code has a full copy of the entire history of the source code. By the way, Bitcoin was first released via SVN in SourceForge. Times have changed, and now the main Bitcoin client is developed with git on github.The important thing is that every developer has a full copy of the source code, so it would be simple to just port it to another website that is not github, like gitlab, or literally you could host it in any custom server you want. There's nothing magical about github, it's just very popular.",

They can easily lobby against this kind of measures if it's the case.Honestly, I don't think institutional investors are that interested in bitcoin being censorship-resistant or private, they rather value the \"store-of-wealth\" aspect of bitcoin that allows them sort of hedge against money printing. If some platforms or persons get banned for doing bitcoin, it is not a big deal as long as bitcoin works and produces new blocks.That's correct. But they will care to know Bitcoin maintains (or grows) its price, and that cannot happen if it's unmaintained, or if people are panicking that the devs cannot access the source code.Quote from: witcher_sense on August 10, 2022, 06:09:01 AMSelf-hosting of repositories or spinning up a server is a solution to the problem of censorship, but most people won't bother running their own servers.Although I understand very well why the vast majority don't want to run a server, I tend to believe that our devs are not like the average Joe, nor like the average software developer. Also I think that some reputed entity will step up and say \"hey, we've deployed this repository for you to use\", in a somewhat similar way the whitepaper got \"adopted\" on many websites (I know that it's not that much similarity between the two, still...)",
