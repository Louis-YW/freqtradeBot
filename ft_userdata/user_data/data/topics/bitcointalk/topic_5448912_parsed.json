Banks are considered a part of the system because you can easily control people by the use of money (greed/ fear), and no institution can control and circulate money other than central banks.  Investors are behind all this for a simple reasons, that their large funds, means billions of dollars kept on banks. Once they put in or out, it would cause a large gap or fluctuations in price. One more thing. The money that doesn't exist but you can use. The all known generational debt. It is all controllable by the banks.",

Because according to me we are working day to night from the origin of humanity. Like, this is not a new thing, then why people like tate brothers, jordan peterson, joe rogan, hamza ahmad, iman Gadazhi and david Goggins are make the existence of matrix prominent and convincing us\\peoples to work harder and think outside of the box. Maybe because, we are stuck in a cycle of work. Like 5 to 5 job, less holidays, no fun, pressure to achieve targets. But what i think is, we are taking them wrong because if we do what we love we will feel no pressure and we will grow. Then people in the growing zone, do they also care about matrix. Because if it really exists then that's not good for overall, countries manipulated by matrix.",

Plasma TVsOne thing, just to show how out of touch this is, plasma TVs have been dead for a decade, and nobody is making them anymore.Second, when someone classifies stuff as \"unnecessary\" it makes them sound like some commie who will decide all by himself how much people are allowed to consume and how often. 10 liters of gas a month, waiting in line a year for a fridge, only 500 grams of meat per person per week, and only one kilo of oranges on Christmas day. Anything more than that is evil capitalism that will make your soul burn in hell comrade!So how about we stop with the matrix and that wanna-be pimp of yours and simply let people spend as they see fit and if they want to buy a tinfoil hat be it, if they don't and they want to buy the nicest car they can afford because you only live once then let them!

What we need for living is we definitely go for it regardless of any concept of matrix. And in the last is that a slogan of this forum or what, i really like it though. Quote from: concept2 on April 15, 2023, 04:47:23 PMyou know what I mean? ...it's up to you to decide if you wanna be part of the system or not.Yes, having high followings and if you are an influential person then i think you also controlled by matrix because i have seen, many influential people of their respected fields lets say of motivation, gym, and finances most of them talk about unnecessary things so that you guyz could stuck at the beginning. Overall, i do not think it should be wise to talk about such things openly and saying that it's up to us to join them or not because in simple words we have been left no choice other than depending on them. Quote from: Broly46 on April 15, 2023, 08:45:56 PMIt is crazy when you realized you have beenNah, that's not how it would went if these influential are there manipulating us. It's like a greed of power that each person (influential one ones to hold for longer period of time and i do not know how this thing could be real. We are manipulated from the early state take an example, of my place. We have been using only windows operating system from the origin like i didn't even know there is more OS there other than Windows why? Because windows has made its efforts to make the availability of its OS free in our region so we only go for it, its been 15 years of me that i am so dependent on these OS and cannot use any other one. Why? Is it also a manipulation maybe they just want to grow their business and we are taking it wrong like they did it on purpose to restrict us to only one OS so we could not grow in different sectors of life by learning development in that OS. Maybe i think it's just a way of perception.",

The banks are also imposing fees if the depositors are withdrawing their very own money. Sometimes, they even refuse to give the money to their owners. And when the money kept by the depositors are running out, they even charge another fee for it, and even freeze the accounts if there is no activity.I was offered for a loan by my bank. The reason is simply that I have a good amount of deposit in it. I told the manager I don't need money. She told me, you can have it as additional savings.

The banks are also investing their users' money and grow rich from it. This is true and it happens in all countries that the banking system never has its own money. They only run customer money lending it to other customers. Bubbles occur and it's not surprising when there are cases where customers make large-scale withdrawals while the bank is simultaneously collapsing. For example, in Lebanon, the collapse of a bank became a problem that needed attention, when customers demanded to take their investments, a crisis occurred. Banks cannot meet demand on a large scale and if it is done simultaneously in all banks then they are destroyed. For this reason, with awareness of investing in assets that are in our control, Bitcoin is the solution. No one will take your assets other than yourself. Bitcoin has been warning for years how dangerous fiat money can be.",

Don't aim at the institution, aim for the ones that benefits from it the most when it's destroyed and rebuilt.In my personal point of view, one of the biggest challenges of the system we have nowadays in the most of the economies is the fact growth is related to the consume and the ability the population has to continue to consume.That is why the technology goes so fast and the products become more and more sophisticated each couple of years that pass, the businesses wants us to change our phones, computers, vehicles, etc; for replacements which they promise to be better (and they are) but still both the old model and the new one accomplish the same objectives very well. If the people do not spend, there is no incentive for them to innovate and without innovation, people do not feel attracted to spend. Now they want to introduce the automation and the cut on human personnel to the equation to maximize the profits, sacrificing part of the ability people can to spend.",

They're pushing the boundaries to see how far they can go before someone notices. It's all a part of our human nature, like that guy who found a loophole in the ATM system and kept withdrawing. He had a lot of money already, but kept going to the ATM every day to get more and more. Even when you're getting something for free and with ease, you're going to want more and more of it, you're going to keep taking. That's what the banks are doing. They used to offer fair rates, like 3% on your deposit when the inflation was 5%. Now when you have 8% inflation, they're offering you 4%. They're pushing you to see where your limit is. Governments are doing the same thing by taxing you on everything you do to see when you push back. There's a tax on owning a property, using electricity, water, sewage, everything is taxed on top of the prices per unit. This means that if a power company demands you to pay $100 for whatever you've used that month you can expect that your real bill is $90 and $10 is tax. The government wants a piece of every single deal that you make. It taxes the food you eat, shit you make, water you use to wash your butt...",

We cannot blame the banks because they support spending, as they are not responsible for the consumer decisions of individuals. The rise in consumption rates is mainly linked to the improvement in the income levels of individuals and the extent to which they are affected by calls for more consumption.However, I would like to point out that it is permissible to discuss the consumer system as a social and economic phenomenon at least, which allows it to be criticized from different angles. Capitalism created societies with a consumer culture using propaganda and with the support of banks to facilitate spending. If this is a system of deception, then the banks certainly contribute to it.Quote from: stompix on April 15, 2023, 01:36:17 PMQuote from: CarnagexD on April 15, 2023, 11:33:20 AMInvestors are behind all this for a simple reasons, that their large funds, means billions of dollars kept on banks.
