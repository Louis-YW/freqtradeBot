From experience, I have realised that many people run into problems when they focused so much on winning a particular bet amd when such bet fails, they easily slide into psychological crisis.  Considering that gambling is a game of probability with the chances of losing higher than that of winning, it is therefore expected we work out ways of approaching it so we can remain profitable. One way of approach is to focus on winning certain number of bets in a series of bets. For instance, you can target to win at least 4 bets in a series of 10 bets with the odds being at least 5 odds. This way, you can lose 6 times and win 4 times yet you still remain highly profitable. This is my approach and through it, I don't get depress over few loses. This method works for me and I feel it will also work for others. Your opinion are highly welcomed.",

I can have 10 bets and In all none is being focused to have a correct scores or a higher probability of winning remember it's still a chance and luck based game so we can't still assured that the already trusted are to play accordingly as we may have in our minds. Just that our expectant is on a higher side that is what leads to psychological crisis across gamblers.",

      "body": "The number of games in a particular betslip does not guaranteed your winning. But you may have more chances or probability . I understand where your heading to buddy. In a scenario where you play only 4 games in a betslip since the number of games are not much abd perhaps the odds are low you will be required to stake high so that the winning will be high. That is a good strategy but it will be disappointing if you lose the game because not because an odd is low that means it will turn out well.Meanwhile much number of games may require just sone few amount of stake and the potential wining will be high plus bonus. However, i will prefer to include a maximum of 10 games in my bet slip so that i can stake with an average amount and the potential wining will be average as well. I am okay with that way.",

      "body": "And after that? You stop? What if you lose? What if you only get 3 of 10? My strategy is different when it comes to casino games. I bet low with a capital of let's say $10. I will bet only $0.01 and wait for a lucky chance to hit a multiwin. I keep on betting until I reach double my capital which is $20 as per example. Sometimes it does work out but there's always a problem of greed and if I claim the profits too early there will be boring moments. That's what I don't like so I keep on playing until I get exhausted or if it's time to sleep that's when I stop my auto bet. There's no assurance with that strategy and most of the time I will rekt my capital first before the RTP comes out. There's a matter of good seed too, in my opinion.It's nice to see that you come up with your but that kind of thing needs a lot of discipline to make it happen.",

If such a betting strategy works for you, I can try it too. but I'm not too focused on how many bets I should make. In sports betting, I bet only on a few matches that make me decide on a bet. let's say there are 5 matches tonight that interest me, then I will bet with my analysis or speculation. although there are other matches I might be able to bet on, I won't do it if the competing teams don't interest me. I don't think betting for higher odds. because I realize that in betting there are only two possibilities, win or lose.but if you implement it successfully, it will make me more",

Of course, when we play or bet we always target to win, maybe it was a single bet or a game parlay bet. So it's better not to make this difficult to ourselves, but bet on games that we think we can win and that's it. If we lose, then go and bet another day and expect that you will be highly profitable. Instead of like betting and targeting certain wins, on the contrary, this method might put you on chasing your losses if you didn't get that profitable with your series of bets.",

      "body": "I'm still getting a little bit confused with your analogy. Do you mean that in order for me to reduce my winning expectation in a serious 10 bet that I'm to place in a week or month, I should target winning just 4 out of the whole 10 bet that I'm going to place? Or do I need to focus on just 4 matches out of 10 selected games that could be placed in one slip? Giving this more light will make it a little easier to understand. And if this is going through the angle I understood it from, then to me it won't still make any difference. The reason is because the 4 bets that we might be expecting to win out of the 10 might be the ones that are going to let us down at the end of the day, and we might end up winning 0 out of the 10 straight games played.",

You are only assuming that probability will always play well on the profit side but you can literally experience 10 out of 10 loses even on a 50% winning chance rate. There’s no way to predict an exact outcome of your bets that’s why many loses on gambling because probability always not following our plan no matter what is our target win / profit.There’s no way to secure or guarantee profit on gambling aside from being lucky as always since all of the gambling games except skill based game are random. Having a target win will not gonna work because don’t know exactly when it will come before your bankroll last.",

Ideally you would want to work on improving the quality of your chosen bets and not just choose some arbitrary number where you expect to lose a certain ratio. Every bet placed should ideally be done with knowledge of foresight and only taking the bet if it is at the correct price point. However it is called gambling for a reason and the bookmaker has built in an extra buffer on top of what they are expecting from a bet. Maybe keeping a log and trying to refine based on evidence may be a more logical and powerful idea over time.",

It may be that this approach applies to soccer betting types and is not relevant to other types of betting such as slots.In my opinion, the 4 bets contained in the betting list have reached the maximum limit because more than 4 bets in the betting list are vulnerable, one of which will fail as predicted and is classified as having put forward the number of odds.Less than 4 bets for me is much better to do even though the resulting odds are less than 4 or 5 bets.For example, the odds resulting from 2 bets are 2.5, if we are sure it will work, bet a large amount.",

Do you have to win 4 bets in a row to make this method work, or is it just necessary to win 4 bets from 10 in any sequence?It's not that easy or often to win consistently in gambling with 5x odds or multiplier. There will be rounds where you will win less than 4 bets from 10 of them, and there will be rounds you won't win any bets. So, how are you going to cope with this kind of scenario which must appear in front of you sooner or later?It really doesn't look like this is a solid method to bet.

However, apart from that, we also have to have good financial management and emotional control, so that we avoid careless behavior that can lead to big losses in our gambling activities.",
