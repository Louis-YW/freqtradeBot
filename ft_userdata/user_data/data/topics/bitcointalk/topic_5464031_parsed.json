  "content": "The best advice you can give anyone starting their gambling journey is to choose the best online casinos to avoid getting scammed or playing unfair games online, however, it's not that easy to figure out a valid licensed online casino. Apart from regulatory authority checks, it's easier for any new casino to just name a number of big names as their authorizers e.g UK Gambling Commission or Malta Gaming Authority but my challenge is License Numbers.License Numbers should be easily viewed on casino websites but my question is how to really verify the License Number? Through a Database or a particular website? Has anyone done this before? How? Do gamblers even care about checking License Numbers?",

I don't think there is an up-to-date website or database that has a comprehensive list of valid casino licenses. The only way to verify the license is through the licensor. Visiting the website of the licensor and carrying out a search. A reputable authorizer should have a comprehensive list of casinos it issued licenses. Contacting  the licensing organization seeking information or certification about the license paraded by a casino can also be a good step to confirm the license's validity. I have not done this before but I really care about the genuineness of the licences. I know that Gibraltar, Malta, and Great Britain are more trustworthy licensors than licenses issued by authorities in Curacao and Costa Rica. But I think it should be a concern to gamblers because the licensor is important in the casino's operation, regulation, and in cases of litigation.",

      "body": "Just as the above member has said, it's always the licensor that usually has access to verifying the license number, in the case of those casinos that make their license details public.There are times when the casino owners or other online platforms that involve finances usually just drop it as a statement that they have been licensed by this or that government but don't usually drop any details regarding the licensing for the reason that it is confidential.But aside from this, even in most of this licensing, authorities don't just make their data public where anyone can access it or try to go and search the full details of any registered clients, as such tools might be misused in other ways. The best way to always verify if a license is valid or not is to go through the respective body that oversees casinos under a given jurisdiction. I believe there is always a body that one can always call upon to verify any information they need.",

In my case, I don't bother checking the license of casinos because it doesn't say a lot about the quality of the casino, and I prioritize other factors when picking a good crypto casino. I know there's nothing wrong with checking a license of a casino you're using, but even if they have a gambling license, gamblers can still have bad experiences.For what others said about gambling licenses, here are a few threads that asked a similar question.Gambling LicenseCrypto Gambling Licenses - What they actually mean",

I think what OP means is the license of the gambling company to operate for gambling purposes and manage the funds of its participants. But base on m experience, even the gambling website who don't have licensed back then was reliable. I mean they are responsive of my concerns with my funds and changes in terms and condition. Instead of checking their license, I base it on criterea like for me, I want a website whose responsive easy to withdraw and deposit.",

The latter two jurisdictions practice little control over online casinos and issue licenses without too much ado.

Sometimes I play in casinos that do not have a license at all, because they do not want to obey the regulators. For them, the experience of the client is important, not replenishing the treasury in the jurisdiction in which he works.I believe reputation and licensing are two different things. For instance, a casino can have a license but still possess a bad reputation. However, most of the time, when a casino is considered to have a good reputation, it is already assumed that they also possess a license. A license is a fundamental requirement for running a business, especially a casino. Without a license, a business can appear shady, as there's no assurance that we can hold them accountable in case they decide to engage in scams.I appreciate that OP has brought up this topic. Many gambling sites claim to have a license, but without the means to verify it, we can't fully trust them. For the benefit of gamblers, I believe licenses information should be made public and accessible for inquiry. This would also aid in eliminating scam casinos from the crypto world.",

However, as someone else said, it's not just the license that makes a platform trusted or reputable, there are a lot of things that you need to check and consider before you entrust a casino with your money, and the most important thing is community feedback about that particular platform.So when you are about to join a new platform, you just ask the community if the platform is worth it or not, if you receive a lot of positive reviews about it, it is definitely worth it but if it's the other way around, you should probably avoid that platform and try another one if you don't want any trouble with your money.",
