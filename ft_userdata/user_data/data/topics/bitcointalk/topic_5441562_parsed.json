First of all I check your profile and you have no flag created against you while the Op of the second link has three active flags so if no warning appears when you create a thread it could be because you have no flag (I suppose).Like I said earlier I don't really your Op.Edit:Oops I just logged out my account and it displayed warning when I viewed your thread but when I'm logged in there's none, I guess it's because my  Total time logged in: is more than seven days. That's the only explanation I could possibly think of right now.",

The flag is different from negative feedback.So there is feedback - positive, neutral, negative - that can come from DT, or somebody you trust, or somebody you distrust or don't care about, and this is visible in colors and numbers.And there's the flag. The thing with the flag is that it can be supported or opposed. If it gets enough support it becomes active and you'll see it that visible.For more details you may want to read: [GUIDE] Overview of the trust flags",

I always tend to think DT members is general (DT1 and DT2)Take this user for example. He has negative feedback from 3 DT2 members and when you check some of the topics he opened, the banner with a warning does not show up.",

Did you read the quote from theymos?Having a positive feedback from a DT member would not matter if the negative feedbacks are higher.Also, if a DT member gives a positive trust to a known scammer, they would not be on DT for long.Quote from: digaran on February 28, 2023, 02:48:02 PMThis new system has only 2 different flag types which punishes the supporters if they post a wrong flag, the third one which I have does not affect the supporters in any way. Thanks.What do you mean punishes the supporters?",

However, negative trust ratings created before the introduction of flags are \"grandfathered in\", and can generate a flag-like-warning, as a special case.Quote from: theymos on June 13, 2019, 03:25:14 AM - If the number of pre-flags-system negative trust ratings is greater than the number of all positive trust ratings, a warning banner is shown for guests & low-login-time newbies.In other words, this type of warning can be eliminated if the grandfathered-in negative ratings are deleted, or if new positive ratings are created to offset them, or some combination of the two.",
