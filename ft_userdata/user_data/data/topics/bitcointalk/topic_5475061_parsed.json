These actions prompted the initiation of a freeze request by the United States Secret Service and a voluntary freeze by Tether. The frozen wallets are on the secondary market and are not associated with Tether’s customers. To the extent lawful wallets were captured by this operation, Tether will work quickly with law enforcement and the owners of those wallets to unfreeze them, as appropriate.\"___This is a huge amount of money. What idiot criminal uses centralized stablecoins and centralized exchanges?",

What idiot criminal uses centralized stablecoins and centralized exchanges?Those who don't know how it works, and I believe not everyone knows how centralised USDT is and how their funds can be frozen in their wallets without knowing it, Many people believe that when they have access to their particular wallet, they are in total control over the assets in that wallet. Not everyone knows that even without authorising the movement of coins to another wallet, the funds can be locked up in that same wallet, and their access to withhold them will be withheld. And talking about centralised exchange, they might probably not know it will happen that quickly for their assets to be frozen in their, or it might be as a result of the owner of such money doesn't even know what to do with it or what token it should be converted to in order not to leave a trace. In cases like this, no one unless those involved can really say the reason why someone who has such funds can't keep their tracks and protect their holdings.",

This is already an anti-record and the highest stupidity.Centralized stablecoins on centralized exchanges. LOL.",
