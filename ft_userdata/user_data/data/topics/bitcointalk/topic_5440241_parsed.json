The service is limited within the United States and United Kingdom. This being a popular application to buy bitcoin makes the addition of lightning network an added feature. Already they've got 1.5% on instant transaction. Maybe this service could come at a better transaction fee. The access to international transaction need to be added and the same might be beneficial with the lightning network.",

We already have a lot wallets support lightning network e.g. Electrum, Blue wallet, Zap wallet etc and there are a lot exchanges support too [1].It just a benefit for Cash App if they have a plan to accept countries outside United States, but it's not give huge impact to lightning network adoption. There's also a limit which has been mentioned by above user, no way to use it.[1] https://github.com/theDavidCoen/LightningExchanges",

I personally prefer on-chain transactions when comes to deposits and withdrawals, though.",

We know, many companies and institutions were implemented bigger than LN, like bitcoin-self as the main blockchain. I don't know why news like this never comes with great news. Several days ago I hear about nostr, decentralized social network where many member used it for colaborate LN node and Nostr npub key .",
