From what I understand, there is no country that doesn't have corrupt citizens. There are always those citizens who are negligent about following the rules and regulations of their country, those who lack the good morals to do the right thing. Every country has this set of people. This set of people always want to do things their own way, so stop painting Nigerians black as if you knew a country that is 100% corruption-free. People have hope in life, but self-decisions and environmental influences tend to make people take their actions. In both recent and previous occurrences and news, other countries have been listed as engaging in fraudulent activities.",
