(the real bitcoin) If bitcoin can manage to make a new ATH, then there will be a chance for BCH but it is still not guaranteed because lots of shitcoins die off eventually and bch might become one of them shitcoins too.",

For me its either I go for btc or major alts rather this fork coin if I wanted to earn as much as profit now.",

I don't have too many biases or problems with forks, and if they are still in use, then it is possible that the price will grow over time. It can be a bit vague at the moment when we discuss a good scenario for the future market, but it is fairer to talk about coins like this because they still have their supporters and creators in new bull cycles of the market.",

How can you expect if this can reach 2k rate again after so many bad cases happened with this shit scam coin from the roger ver abd jihan wu? Don't you even watch how many people in the market are trying to sell their BCH to the another token? this proves that if this coin is not even worth anymore to hodl Im sure that if you are also aware about this as well. You must be aware about that. No chance for this shit coin to go to the 2k rate again. Talk elon to pump this coin to make it possible",

It's quite impossible to see this coin to go back again to the thousand dollars as its value., loosing the trust mean loosing the value. People didn't even care anymore with this coin.",

I'm not a BCH holder and it's out of my radar based on its performance in the market which dropped -96.7% from its all-time high I don't think this Bitcoin fork is worth investing we can treat it as another altcoin that will soon be out in the top 50, I don't know how you arrive in the comparison between Amazon and BCH but they are miles apart in comparison.",

I'd just stick with Ethereum as my 2nd choice and even in 3rd it won't be BCH and I know it's not just me who thinks less about the forked coin.",

But perhaps, that will depend on how the bitcoin price will be at that price because all coins will follow where the bitcoin price moves. So when the bitcoin price can break $100k, the coins will have a big opportunity to increase, and perhaps, bitcoin cash will have the chance to rise. But if bitcoin cash doesn't have more support, the price will not go too far than the price now, and even the price can go down, and people will forget it.",

By the way, I didn't immediately find this coin in the list, because BCH rolled down much lower than the position where I saw it before.Will bitcoin cash cost 2000$ in 2026? Why would suddenly? The most you can hope for is $200. I don't see any reason for the price increase.",
