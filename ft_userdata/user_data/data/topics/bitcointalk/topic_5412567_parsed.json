I felt it necessary to confront this one openly and transparently.",

      "body": "Rather than go through all the transaction info and calculations I will provide a summary of the total amounts and outcomes: I deposited 2 MBTC for this BATMAN Promo and was advised that I won a wheel spin.  Prior to making my depo I opted OUT of the 50% deposit bonus that is pre-selected for you in their cashier.  I said no thanks.  But after the depo was confirmed, I then was offered spin on the wheel for this BATMAN promo. I spun the wheel and got 10 spins yayy (the lowest amount possible on the wheel) which I was fine with.  Okay 10 spins. And the winnings have a 40x playthrough.  Okay sure.  But here's where it becomes strange.  Free Spins begin, I have 10 spins total. Fast forward to the end, I finished with winnings of 0.000302 BTC or 0.3 mbtc! Hardly any winnings at all.  But okay. X40 playthrough gives me a wagering requirement 0.012 approx or 12.3 MBTCThese numbers are confirmed in the promo section of my account.  It shows these numbers in their respective columns. So remember I had deposited 2 mbtc so now I have 0.002302 BTC OR 2.3 MBTC TOTAL. Wow. Not exactly what I had hoped for but that's fine.  Maybe an unlikely set of freespins.  It happens. No problem.   Moving on.  So now I take my 2.3 MBTC and play for a while and while.  My lowest balance was only 1.3 MBTC and to my surprise I worked my way all the way through that playthrough.With 99% of the playthrough completed my balance was 8.7 MBTC.  A nice amount I thought.  So at this point there is only a few spins left until I hit the 100% and finally clear that playthrough to unlock my free spins winnings which we recall from earlier was 0.000302 BTC or 0.3 mbtc.  100% achieved.  Yayyy.  I made it right? Nice day of wagering. 8.7 MBTC nice little come up right? WRONGI look up and suddenly my balance has changed from 8.7MBTC to 3.3MBTC. Wait whatttt? Certainly there was some error or miscalc?!? So I open live chat and explain and the agent says: \"as I can see you were using the batman promo which has a maximum of 3.3MBTC for the freespins\" \"....For the freespins\" were her exact words.  I didn't see that listed anywhere prior but ya know what, I accept it as they say.  Maybe there were some fine print, not the most ethical practice but I've seen it many times Plus I only won a small amount on the freespins of 0.3mbtc so the Max of 3.3 MBTC WINNINGS on the freespins should not affect me anyways.  So I stand my position that there is an error.  The support agent says \"no sorry thats the Max win for this promo\" At this point I see that they are fully aware of my balance details and are miscategorizing my funds as being from the freespins which had a hidden maximum winnings restriction. This is one of the sleight of hand type of shady behavior that I wouldn't normally expect from what appears to be a reputable website.",

This is improper behavior, incorrect categorization of my balance.  It's dishonest bahavior and they are attempting to shave my winnings but they are using irregular means or scam-math to weasel their way out of Paying me my winnings.  I know they have a decent reputation and that's why I'm confronting this foolery. This is nonsense logic and the community should stand against nonsensical justifications like this.",

Hi there once again.Our team picked up your query and we were working hard to look into this.After a further analysis, our team reassured the number is correct. As you mentioned, during the process of completing the promotion's wager requirement on free spin winnings, you won 0.0079 BTC. (And it is not 0.0087 BTC as you claimed.) This win amount from this promotion exceeded the max wins we disclosed in our terms and conditions of this promotion. This can be seen on the Batman landing promo page at number 5 and 9. https://trustdice.win/promotions/sept-promoWe thank you for your feedback as this helps us figure any confusions regarding our promotions we offer.We hope you have a fantastic week further.TrustDice Team",

Not one.  This is the amount that the 3.3 MBTC limit should be applied to.  Just the freespins.  Not any winnings from my entire deposit.  If I deposit 4mbtc and win the maximum amount allowable on the bonus spins I woild actually lose money as a result.  Think about that.  This is house trickery and a dishonest approach to operating your site.",

      "body": "Hello Bitcointalk community,After a thorough analysis and much consideration, we came to the difficult decision that we have to expose the ill-intentions here with detailed explanations, because we have a reputation to protect. First, we’d like to point out that the OP made an obvious attempt to mislead the audience with a partial, cut screenshot. This screenshot he attached in fact shows the Free Spin Codes he received, not Free Spin winnings. It was from ‘PROMO CODE’ page of our account system (URL: https://trustdice.win/account/promo-code) and the name itself is self-explanatory. The page is for PROMO CODE, not Free spins winnings.Quote from: Blockchayne on September 07, 2022, 06:15:41 AMThe bonus module within my account that tracks these exact bonuses and wagering requirements says itself \"free spins promo : winnings 0.3 MBTC\" so they prove on their own means that 0.3 MBTC is the freespins winnings.  In a larger screenshot, one can easily see the ‘Active your code’ from above, and a ‘Valid until’ column on the right, which the OP left out in his screenshot. ‘Active your code’ and ‘Valid until’ both clearly indicate the page was for PROMO CODE, not Free spins winnings. We therefore concluded the OP was intentionally chopping them out and it was his attempt to intentionally mislead and confuse the audience. With regard to the whole story, the OP joined our Batman promo and in the promo, he had won 7.9 mBTC (0.0079 BTC) in total wagering his free spin winnings. His claim that he only won 0.3 mBTC from this promo is completely false. Quote from: Blockchayne on September 07, 2022, 05:59:54 AMFast forward to the end, I finished with winnings of 0.000302 BTC or 0.3 mbtc! Quote from: Blockchayne on September 07, 2022, 05:59:54 AM I only won a small amount on the freespins of 0.3mbtc so the Max of 3.3 MBTC WINNINGS on the freespins should not affect me anyways.  On that 7.9 mBTC winnings, a “Max wager win” condition applies. It was truthfully displayed on the promo landing page, as below:9. Wager max win: 3.3 mBTC / 0.033 ETH / 21,000 JPY/ 150 EUR / 150 USDC / 150 USDT Source: https://trustdice.win/promotions/sept-promoKindly note this is different from no.5, which is a \"Max win of FS\" condition. As such win amount exceeds the \"Max wager win\", his final winnings from this promotion was automactially reset to 3.3 mBTC and it was truthfully reflected on his  balance with a 4.6 mBTC deduction. This has nothing to do with his deposit. We therefore refute the OP's claim that we mixed up his winnings with his original deposit. No we did not and will never do as a reputable casino. His winnings was deducted because it triggers “Max wager win” condition. For this, if the OP approves, we can ask the management to allow us to share a backoffice screenshot here. Quote from: Blockchayne on September 08, 2022, 12:24:20 AMJust the freespins.  Not any winnings from my entire deposit.  As raised by this incident, today we did an in-depth investigation on all Promo related systems. Upon its conclusion, we confirmed that all our Promo systems have been operating fully in line with the disclosed terms, with no hidden restrictations or undisclosed calculations. Thank you for your continuous support. TrustDice will remain committed to transparent and meaningful communication with the Bitcointalk community. TrustDice Team",

      "body": "I have no ill intentions first of all. My intentions are to hold your site accountable for using such sleight of hand magic tricks to chip away at your players balances and to fine print gimmicks  that are hidden away and only revealed when it's time to cash out.   I cropped out the activate promo code because I did not see the relevance.  That's your big smoking gun on how Intentionally mislead the community with Ill intentions because I cropped out that largely irrelevant section? You even said yourself that you didn't know why I woild do that. WITH or WITHOUT that element included it does not change anything that either you or I said.  That's why I left it out. To focus on the relevant matter which is your unethical and misleading bonus promotions and terms. These are *shady* casino practices, removing balances, hiding behind max limits on a bonus that I won 0.3 mbtc. Is total BS! I spun 10 free spins and won 0.3 mbtc.  There should've been no maximum limits on anything beyond the 0.3 mbtc.  *No other online casino operates under these ridiculous terms* that you have presented.  So yes your reputation is being directly questioned and for good reason.  I reviewed the promo email and there is nothing stating about limits or about the fact that if you win even the smallest amount on those freespins that your entire balance will be locked up after a few spins because of the way you calculate playthrough   Every wager you make reduced your real money balance and every amount won as a result of those real money wagers is credited to your bonus balance (including if it’s a break-even tie) which is locked up by an exhausting 40X playthrough. You all did a thorough review and in-depth investigation and you found *no issues* whatsoever — this means that it’s you’re *intentionally* operating under these ridiculous methods of calculations which systematically convert your users real money deposits into bonus funds (which are locked up with a 40x playthrough) — even when the amount won from the original freespins is a trivial amount as is the case was mine. It’s no wonder that you felt the need to include **TRUST** in the name of your organization because deception often requires overcompensation in order to fool others into believing false claims.  This is one of the reasons that some low-income or poor people will buy expensive shoes and jewelry, because they want to fool others into believing that they have a lot of money when in fact they do not. This is one of the reasons that Little Men with little D’s often drive big trucks with big tires because they want to fool others into believing they are big men when in fact they are not. And this same idea is the reason that shady websites that operate under misleading and/or false pretenses would include **TRUST** in the name of their operations - to fool people into believing that they can be trusted — when in fact they cannot  Again, including the ‘Activate Promo Code’ does not help justify your ill-intended policies whatsoever. Your “gotcha” accusation is laughable.   Lastly, Which of us benefits from misleading Bitcointalk members? I do not. But you?.. well that’s up to everyone else to decide.",
