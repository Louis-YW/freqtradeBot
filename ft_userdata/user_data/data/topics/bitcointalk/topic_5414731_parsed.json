  "content": "BTCMore companies now in the UK are looking to integrate crypto into their payment processing systems.BTCHowever, I only really see Bitcoin being pushed as a payment option. I was wondering if it would be worth while creating a payment processor to accept ANY crypto payment and have it payout to FIAT currency to the business ( at a reasonable fee of course )The business would obviously have the option to deselect certain cryptos that have high transaction costs or maybe front these costs to the buyer of the product. Just abit of context, recently got an Msc from a uni in the UK and before i went into the rat race wanted to get my hands on a good project whilst i can.Do you guys thing this would be something of value for business' online. I know www.harborsidehealthcenter.com/shop/ accept it now as a few others listed below ( they was on netflix btw - i think it was called \"Weed Wars\")http://www.vaporizerchief.com/http://www.shivaonline.co.uk/https://rollingpapersuk.com/clothing shopshttp://www.rastaempire.com/greenarborclothing.comI just cant seem to come across any sites that are not in a mainstream area and wondered if this kind of crypto payment idea would just attract the wrong crowd (in terms of banking) in the long run.Would love to hear your guys opinions on weather this should be something i peruse.",
