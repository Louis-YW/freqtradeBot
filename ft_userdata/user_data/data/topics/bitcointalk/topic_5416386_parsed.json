But know that it does not mean, there are many new gambling sites on this forum that are very good and perfect and no issue of hack. But we should not leave our money on centralized platforms, only leave the amount you want to use to bet on gambling sites. But I am not worried about gambling sites like the way I am worried about those centralized exchanges that are prone to attack.",

Exchanges are getting hacked left and right but I don't remember any major casino going bankrupt for getting hacked.Which makes me think... those exchange hacks are probably done by the insiders because the exchanges hire lots of people and when there are lots of people in a payroll, some fuck ups will inevitably happen.Casinos usually operate with much less people so it is easier to keep them in check. To answer your question, I haven't heard of any casino doing what you asked.Maybe it will be a thing when some of them get hacked in the future. (hopefully not)",

It's rare to see a few months go by without a breach happening on some centralized exchange somewhere.If you look closely at the Terms & Conditions of crypto casinos, you will notice they mention in one way or the other that players can't hold the sites accountable if an unforeseen incident happens. Major hacks and security breaches are examples of such incidents. I doubt many would or could (if they wanted to) compensate their users if something like that happened. It's their goodwill to do it unless the terms state otherwise.",

Sometimes in early April 6th 2022 a well known local betting site was hacked some local currencies were made away and i don't think people's fund refunded or something similar, since i m not user of that site. sourceSo from my experience here such have never happened before, rather the only complaint i have seen so far is gambling site banning them due to inaccurate and appropriate information submitted during KYC's.",

Crypto exchange earns huge profit from the huge trading volume fixed while casino only rely on the house edge and if players lose to earn profit which means they don't have that much funds compared to crypto exchange like Binance thatncan afford to have an insurance feature to all there customers. Most of the casino that got hacked usually closed and declared bankruptcy especially if the damage is huge. There is no casino offers this kind of insurance thing if you read  all of there terms.",

If in case of hacking incident, I think they are fast enough to detect the anomaly. Though there was one gaming site, Axie Infinity, where hackers got away $620M in crypto.https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-stole-620-million-from-axie-infinity-via-fake-job-interviews/",

So far we have not read about any casino hacking because they are taking care of their Whitelabel partners and in case there are I don't think you can ask them to reimburse you because there is nowhere in their TOS that they will do a refund in case their casino got hacked, it still depends on the casino if they are going to refund their players but I doubt they will, casinos are very much different from exchanges when it comes to the security.",

If a reputable gambling site got hacked, it's not that users' wallets will be depleted but rather the site's hot wallet. Those accounts that experienced deductions or unauthorized withdrawals on their balance were likely got hacked because of the users' fault.",

They definitely have the money to reimburse any players after a hack, since gambling casinos make such nice profits. A good reputation is a completely different issue. Any platform can be hack-free and have a bad reputation. But in the case of Fortunejack, their reputation is pretty much spotless.",

Most of the gambling site have hot wallet and cold wallet. They process the withdrawal of the users from hot wallet, but they never keep big funds in that wallet. Gambling site keeps a bigger part of their bankroll in the cold wallet. Therefore you won't be able to bankrupt a casino by hacking the casino website only. In the past, some gambling site was showing the proof of their bankroll by providing a signature message with their cold wallet address. But this trend isn't available anymore.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on October 08, 2022, 09:24:19 AM(2) is there any gambling website that got hacked and reimbursed their users in the past and they still functioning till date?. Probably not. A scam casino Betking was hacked in 2019. However, everyone has doubt about the hack story (that's a long story). A different casino (Bitsler) had refunded some players of Betking casino who lost their funds for the hack. Read this post and check this thread to know more about the refund story: BetKing.io Refunds - Partnership with Bitsler -Promo ended",
