Probably because it's december, and just like the gold old bullish days, December is a great month when the market is bullish. Yeay, welcome back bitcoin bull run, let's get this party continue its run as there's a lot of prove to the world, kill those doubters by bringing back the ATH, not this year (For sure), next year(For sure)...  AND LASTLY< HOLD!!!!",

With Bitcoin, if it is not the current price increase, people will also have the perception that its future will be great, so sometimes certain conspiracy theories are just to manipulate the psychology of weak and FOMO prone people. But recently, many financial markets have had a very exciting atmosphere. Because I am not a beginner, the current problem can only be seen as the gloom returning at some point. The return will not affect the investment plan.",

As for Bitcoin, it is not clearly affected by political variables, such as choosing a president for the United States, and there is not enough market capacity to be the number one currency and the global reserve currency. Therefore, nothing will be decided next year except expectations of reaching $100,000.",

Gold and silver has lose many customers to Bitcoin when the price of Bitcoin hit $69,000 last two years for long term and short term holders to used the opportunity to achieved a lot of income that gave other people mind to withdraw their money from gold and silver investment and invest the money in Bitcoin.

In my opinion that is not exactly the case. Part of the market cap of gold and precious metals in general that was used as a store of value has been absorbed by Bitcoin, but not at that specific moment of the ATH, it has been a slow process that has lasted years from the moment Bitcoin was launched. If we compare the profitability of gold versus Bitcoin in that period we will see that gold has barely been profitable, the opposite of Bitcoin. That we are on the verge of ATH in gold is another indicator that the best is yet to come with the price of Bitcoin.",

Your happiness seems like you are holding a good amount of Bitcoins which is bringing you a big profit. Yes when the price of bitcoin increases then a positive effect is seen in the whole crypto market and at that time almost all types of crypto investments give us good returns. The way Bitcoin price has started to rise will make a new ATH very soon. On the other hand, we have seen previously that when the price of Bitcoin goes up, the price of Gold goes down and when the price of Bitcoin goes down, the price of Gold goes up. But this time we see a completely different picture. Now Gold, Silver, Bitcoin all started to rise simultaneously. This is good news for all types of investors",

However, no one is going to be very sure when this will happen. I am considering to buy small portion even at this rate just because I think it could pump to new ATH as to what we seen back in 2017-18. However, this is not advisable to others as long as they are ready to take their own risks.  But we have come to the range where new opportunities are going to open soon.
