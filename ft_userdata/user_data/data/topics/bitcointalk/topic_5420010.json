  "content": "Cash payment is done offline, when spending with paper money no real identity is needed. A buyer can spend their currencies without the bank coming into the picture, no name required because the receiver doesn't need the name of the buyer for transaction to be completed. Bitcoin does hide identity but it is not completely anonymous. Despite Bitcoin not requiring identity to own some coin and spend them the public ledger reveals every transaction on different bitcoin block explorer and as such merge transactions of a particular wallet together and can lead to one's identity been revealed if caution isn't taken.Where the limitation of cash payment come in is where it involves distant transaction, one that cut across distant boarders and bulky transactions that will seems risky to move with cash. Credit cards over the years substituted for this but we sold out our identity in exchange to execute our transactions using cards that got our full information tied to.Bitcoin on the other hand doesn't work in an offline manner. But the advantage it has is no central server is required but a peer-to-peer network keep the ledger trusted and immutable which is the only way to provide a data that cannot be tempered on nor nullified since every transaction that goes into every block is confirmed by participating nodes.Why will Bitcoin remain most preferred over every other traditional payment option including cash is thus:CREDITCARDCASHBITCOINNot anonymousAnonymousPseudonymousDistance transactionLocal transactionBoarderless transactionCentral SeverNo server neededA p2p server neededSmart SpendingRisky SpendingSmarter SpendingFunds hardly noticeableBulky Sums obviousNot Noticeable since it has no physical formCan be CompromisedNo compromiseFully trustedCash transaction would have been a perfect option for 100% anonymous transaction but it cannot be sent to some one who is afar off. Bitcoin stands out as the perfect option not as an anonymous tool but as a private coin with no central server.",

Except if the cash you are referring to here is not the physical cash we spend, that is otherwise known as fiat, Â then I would like to know the type of cash you are referring to as anonymous, because to me, cash transactions are nothing near to being anonymous. Cash and credit/debit card transactions are the most centralized form of transactions, anything centralized is not anonymous... This is my opinion though. Quote but it cannot be sent to some one who is afar off.  Fiat, otherwise known as cash can be sent to people or some one afar of, through western union, money gram and the likes, the down side is that, it is highly centralized, takes days if not weeks and months before the receiving party gets the package, and it also cost alot in fees as well. Quote Bitcoin stands out as the perfect option not as an anonymous tool but as a private coin with no central server.Yeah, I agree with you on this one, bitcoin is a decentralized currency and payment system, highly efficient and absolutely secure and boarderless",

Cannot say that bitcoin is the best, is all we need and government cash is useless. Bitcoin was born and ushered in a new era, one that allows us to respect our privacy but not so that we forget about fiat and start vilifying it. We should remember that we have been using it for hundreds of years and it is still our main daily trading tool. Fiat depreciates over time, but that doesn't mean it will die or become completely useless. The best way is that we should balance both and use according to the most suitable cases to bring high efficiency and convenience.",

With bitcoin, it is possible to make fast, borderless, censorship-free payments in the most secure and trustless manner, and, what is more important, bitcoin is barely susceptible to the influence of financial manipulators of the traditional world. Unlike physical cash. The main reason physical cash is less secure than decentralized currency such as bitcoin is that it is still money issued and controlled by the government. The government can't effectively track your cash transactions, but it can control those transactions remotely via different regulations, limitations, and draconian measures. They can dictate the price of your cash because they are in power to manage the economy via printing. They can dictate which goods and services you are allowed to pay for with physical cash: people who accept cash in illegal transactions are risking to find themselves in jail, which is why they will prefer either credit cards or their substitutes also fully controlled by governments. It all doesn't sound very secure, at least not for continuous payments.",

If it's for everyday purchases like groceries, local transactions are enough. Cash is also, unfortunately, sometimes almost a must if you are in a place where digitalization didn't quite kick off or where it's temporarily at risk because of power shortages or something like this. Also, while Bitcoin is borderless, let's not forget that it's also usually not accepted as payment, so it's not very helpful that you could use it if you actually can't. At the same time, if a person has some savings and doesn't want them to become devaluated, I'd say Bitcoin is better than cash (if you're okay with waiting for perhaps a couple of years) because cash is steadily losing value (inflation) and in times like the current recession, it can lose much more than usual, without bouncing back.",
