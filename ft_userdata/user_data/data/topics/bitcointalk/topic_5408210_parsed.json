      "body": "Satoshi created Bitcoin to lessen our reliance on banks (particularly central banks), whose reckless lending practices led to the collapse of the real estate market. A great account of the housing market crisis was produced by the National Council for the Social Studies. The market had enormous leverage, investors disregarded fundamentals in pursuit of short-term gains, and the Federal Reserve changed its interest rate strategy. Cryptocurrencies: Can it withstand a downturn?Let's look at Bear cases and Bull cases:Cryptocurrency markets have little control over external economic factors. Recently, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in an effort to promote the economy and control inflation. Growth in the economy and inflation are balanced by the Federal Reserve. More money is available in the economy thanks to lower interest rates, but inflation rises. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers, which lowers consumption. Rate increases could start a recession. In a downturn, people could have to liquidate their cryptocurrency holdings to cover living expenses.The potential of cryptocurrencies is essential for surviving a recession. Cryptocurrency is no longer just for peer-to-peer transactions. The current use cases for cryptocurrencies include DeFi, NFTs as art, gaming, and Polygon Nightfall. While many more use cases have been put up, they have not been generally embraced. The use of cryptocurrency for decentralized storage, digital identities, and housing documents has immense potential. Numerous businesses have entered the bitcoin sector, lowering the likelihood of a collapse.https://www.nftically.com/blog/can-cryptocurrency-survive-a-recession-nftically/Most markets and sectors are harmed by recessions. The legal ambiguity and youth of the bitcoin industry may make it more vulnerable than other sectors. The underlying technology and its use cases will improve businesses' and individuals' lives. It's difficult to see all of this disappearing because of a bad economy.",

If you buy bitcoin, it is btc that is deflationary or inflation resistant because of its fixed supply or halving after every 210,000 mined blocks and not the dollar, because if you want to look at your money in terms of dollars/fiat movement or you plan to convert it, it is still affected by inflation, what i mean is whichever way any of the two different currencies move doesn't affect or can hedge the other as they are extrinsic.Quote from: feeling sound on July 31, 2022, 08:25:02 AMI personally am not sure so I'm just slowly  DCAing  in to my favourite projects. If you are using DCA to buy bitcoin, it is great, but if your \"favorite projects\" are many short term, shit and scam coin altcoins, you may want to recheck that and buy only bitcoin for crypto investment, and other extrinsic assets for diversification.",

That's the point of volatility, intermittent upward and downward movements over a period of time. Volatility is high in this niche and so, that period of time can be very narrow, leading to wild daily price actions.Quote from: feeling sound on July 31, 2022, 08:25:02 AMIs Bitcoin and crypto proving it really is a hedge against the devaluing of the dollar, or is the fact it was only a 75bp hike until September that maybe caused the case for optimism?Bitcoin is not proving to be anything; It is what you make of it.It can be a speculative asset, a hedge fund, a currency etc. There are qualities in it which makes is usable as any of these.Quote from: feeling sound on July 31, 2022, 08:25:02 AMDo you guys Believe in this pump or is it just temporary until another leg down?I think the pump is temporary, but I also think we've found or at best almost found the bottom and the price should not drop much further.",

I would say bitcoin went up once it reaches the value of at least ATH of this year, that is from January to present timeline. I am not talking about the last years ATH since situation at that time and this year is entirely irrelevant. Basically there are many things are happening since we reach 2022. Most of the businesses are settling back, but then two countries started war and more than half western hemisphere got tangled up into it indirectly. Different sanctions, yes and no's is really making the market go crazy. So definitely investors are very used it now and might have started investing back again into bitcoin no matter what news feeds the paper. May that very tie of what will happen next is now broken and thats why up and down movements of bitcoin all the time.",

Maybe that's why some investors started buying Bitcoin again. This definitely isn't a bull run. It's normal market volatility. At least all the \"doom & gloom\" anti-Bitcoin haters/FUD spreaders have stopped with their nonsense for a while. It would be nice if the price recovers back to 30K or even 40K USD, but this is highly unlikely to happen anytime soon. I predict the Bitcoin price is going to stay in the 25K USD range until the end of 2022 and a 60K-80K price range after the next BTC halving in 2024.",

On the other hand, there are also those who try to explain the bearish market to be generally brought about by macroeconomic factors, of which the recession is an effect. I guess opinions are basically divided. For me, the movement of Bitcoin's price right now is not really related to the recession issue. It so happened that Bitcoin has already started to recover--if indeed this is recovery--when the issue of recession exploded, even though it has already been a topic of discussions for some time.",

So, let us feed ourselves first and be happy till recession is over.On the other hand, some people will feel that the only way to respond to the effect of recession is to invest in bitcoin since 1BTC is always 1BTC. In any of the two ways the effects would be seen on chart.Personally, I don't have e good knowledge of the charts. The only things that gave  me hope to DCA from last month is that I am sure bitcoin is not a bubble and I have seen bitcoin @ $69k and now it's within $20k, which means it will surely hit $69k again, it doesn't matter how long it takes.",

I understand all of those questions popped on your mind but this is the normal market for crypto that we have. Whether we have recession or none, we'll always get to see the crypto market pumping and dumping.With good or bad news, the market will always react at both sides, positive and negative, decrease and increase. You should get used to it when you see it go from side to side.There's really nothing to think about it that much when you see it fall and rise.",

The US market is very important for cryptocurrencies (perhaps the most important), so any positive change there reflects positively on the price.I believe that the overall situation would be even better if there was more determination in the EU, but different interests within the Union result in a great indecision, which creates a very confusing effect in addition to the consequences of the war. In addition, the Bitcoin crash at a value of up to $17k is largely the result of the fiasco with Comrade Kwon's project, and the bankruptcy of various crypto landing companies.Although it is in the zone of speculation if that crash would have happened without those factors, I still believe that they would be much closer to $30k right now if those things had not happened.",

I did that back in the late 2018/early 2019 when I sold all BTC and bought it again, almost doubling the amount of Bitcoin. I tried to do something similar later that year but then I lost decent portion of that profit, proving that previous time was just a dumb luck and that I am not cut for trading. Since then I just hodl and I don't try that \"sell high buy low\" tactic as in my case it usually ends with \"buy high sell low\" lol.",

I won't say that increasing from 23K to 24.5K is acting like bullish trend because the volatility range is somewhat at 5% range which can happen everyday even with no news due to the trading market and volume difference. Anyway even if the Bitcoin turns out to be bullish in the recession then its not really a big surprise because people are moving to adoption from time to time so we assume that they also started accepting bitcoin as storage of value against these inflation.",
