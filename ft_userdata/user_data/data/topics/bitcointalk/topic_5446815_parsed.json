But right now in my country I don’t see my self attend such physical events for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies because it exposes one to the government. The risk seems maybe too much for a knowledge I could also get from my home anonymously. More so also everything that can be teach physical can also be done through online classes",

Do you mean some kind of official event held to discuss Bitcoin, some kind of seminar or training like that?.I've never come across such an official event at my place, or maybe I'm not up to date for events like that. It is possible that even if there were, I might not have time to attend such an event because of my busy schedule.Usually I will only get together with my friends who are crypto fans and we are not there to discuss crypto or Bitcoin seriously in particular, we just get together, joke and tell stories and discuss a little about crypto or Bitcoin occasionally.Quote from: Zoomic on March 29, 2023, 06:59:58 PMThere is no much benefit in going to such events.

But some still like to go hoping that they'll be able to gain more network/connection with those that are high up in the bitcoin ecosystem, I might consider going depending on who's going to be present there at the conference because you never can tell what you'll gain by being present there.",

However, if you're involved in the Bitcoin business, attending such events can significantly expand your network and lead to potential investment opportunities. It's important to note that while attending these events can be financially beneficial for those in the industry, it may not provide the same level of financial gain for general crypto users who may not have the means to attend. Nonetheless, attending these events can still provide valuable educational and networking opportunities for all attendees.",

I have not attended a paid event, the first crypto event I attended was sponsored by FTX, that should tell you that there are pros and cons to attending these events. The pros is that you get to connect with people with the same interest as you, grow and build a community, and possibly make a name for yourself as a bitcoin expert. The cons is the sponsors of the event could spend the whole time talking about their company or promoting a coin and not actually focus on the supposed theme of the event.",

If doesn't benefit us that much since those seminars could be held online where you can attain knowledge unknown that doesn't expose your identity which is I prefer due to it can be dangerous at the same time. Maybe at some events for sure there's a lot of freebies and coupon that you can get which make it more fun. I haven't tried to go in bitcoin events, however I've seen some online where they post a lot of pictures of the event. It's more likely a marketing strategy to acknowledge bitcoin especially if its done in public places. A lot of influencers and artists to gain more public attention. If you're aiming to have connections with other people might be better to do it online.",

Informed of marketing, they do giveaway and shows how crypto works and what's needed to make profits in the market. Cryptocurrency events will not lecture you on the crucial information about the space, rather it will enlightened one to know how the market operates, the basics information about the market.

Just like an expo, You can find your fellow enthusiast, find new connections, learn something new or just enjoy the even you attended. Sometimes it's refreshing to talk in person on things you like or things you are knowledgeable of like in our case it's bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I've attended one or two bitcoin and crypto event in my life and for me it is enjoyable given that I've learned something new in the space and the potential trends. There are also new connections that have been born with public persons, You just need to approach them right    You're not forced to submit your identity in events like this if you don't want to. My local area only had crypto event like this once and I didn't let it slipped, I'm shocked that there are more people than I'm expecting and I wasn't expecting some familiar faces.",

Similarly, you might observe people asking various technical questions during Bitcoin physical lectures that you might not even consider. therefore taking bitcoin lessons would make it simple for someone to learn everything at once. In particular, beginners may find those Bitcoin classes more motivating than learning alone online. Let just  know that acquiring knowledge for both sides are really helpful.",

I once checked in at a hotel where there is a crypto event. It was centered on investment and trading. Just recently, there was also a gathering of sorts in what is called the Bitcoin island here.
