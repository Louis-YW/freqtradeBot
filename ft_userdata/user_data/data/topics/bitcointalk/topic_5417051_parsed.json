I saw them to save their private key on Google drive. A small group of people are only aware about securing their cryptocurrency.",

I don't know how much that $100 means to you, but if you can survive without it, don't risk your documents and probably several months of delays that you can expect from them. I know of many cases where much larger amounts were involved and where everything ended up positive in the end, but as I already wrote, the question is how much someone actually values their privacy and the time that needs to be invested to convince them that you are not a suspicious person.",

It's normal when exchange or some other service has strict KYC measures because they need it to have opportunity to attach fiat payments. But a WALLET must be anonymous or close to it, because it's a CRYPTO WALLET. Of course freewallet scammers may answer that \"you could see it in our terms of service, it's your fault that you dodn't pay attention\".But still it's closer to a fraud, but just a little bit \"legal fraud\"",
