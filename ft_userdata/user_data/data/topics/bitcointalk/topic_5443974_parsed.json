Good medical care will not be free, and then you may not be able to afford it, especially for individuals in the middle and poor classes. There are also consequences after the operation, such as care in the first months, medicines and other costs.Also, some countries are better in certain disciplines, this chart may give you better information, although I am surprised at the reason for choosing Mexico, perhaps because of the flight costs)",

      "body": "I can understand that if the US go to Mexico for health care needs and that should be selected few, those who can afford to leave the shores of US in search of cheaper health services because it is expensive for them there not necessarily because the health care system in there is not good. Those few are the rich and wealthy American population. Those wealthy are the most targeted in the Obama's administration. I remember the tussle then during Obama's regime on his health care bill that was eventually signed around March 2010. That law is what the Americans are still running with in their health care and it seems not to favour the wealthy because of the tax attached to it but the ordinary people are most beneficiaries of US health care and moreover, the system is overwhelming overburdened, so if the rich are traveling to Mexico for health care, you can understand the immediate reason because I think there health care system is more affordable for the ordinary and low income earners compared to the wealthiest of US population.",

It's inherently anti-competitive. Universal healthcare isn't the answer if you want to maintain high quality healthcare that isn't rationed there's an attainable middle ground that doesn't involve government subsidies.Mexico has cheaper healthcare, but lower quality.

Seems odd Mexican cartels would target random U.S. citizens who were on their way for a cosmetic procedure. It's possible they were complicit in nefarious activities.",

Over all the quality of life in US has been going down every year for the past 40+ years.Medical services is not an exception either. It slowly got more expensive and at the same time the quality of services dwindled. At this point it is safer to receive medical services elsewhere including Mexico than inside US not to mention that it is way cheaper.",

The same behaviour can be observed even amongst people in my country who travel to neighbouring countries to book international flights because of the very high cost of international flights in my country. People usually go through extra stress when they know it is cost beneficial especially when they see no particular difference between the services offered by the two parties in comparison with one having a higher cost than the other.",
