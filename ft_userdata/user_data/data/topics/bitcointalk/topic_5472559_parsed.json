These people were victims of the closure of MtGox and after so many years they are still being victimized by the people who are supposed to be protecting their interest. This is one of the many reasons why DEX rose up to counteract the many bad possibilities to happen to CEX...though of course nothing is really guaranteed in the crypto space. I am hoping that soon JUSTICE can be served to whom it is due and assets must be returned to the rightful owners.",

This way, they will be able to save up more than they could have paid to the affected accounts.The ideal form of payment should based on the cryptocurrencies that were owned by each victim. A victim that owns Bitcoin should be paid with the same currency. There could be other payment options but victims should allowed to make their own choices. It will be robbery for these victims who have waited for close to a decade to receive payments based on the past price of Bitcoin. There could be deductions due to legal and other fees but it shouldn't be an excuse to steal from these victims.  QuoteThis is the only reason I believe they have been prolonging this payout, thinking of the best possible solution to make it happen, where people will complain less and have no other option than to accept the little that they see as better than receiving nothing, but then again, will the court allow such a ruling if the MtGox representative presents it in court?This is not the first time the deadline for these Payments has been moved. The current reason that the trustee Kobayashi gave for the delay of payment is that the process of partnership with banks, exchanges, and fund transfer service providers took more time than predicted. Who knows if the trustees are targeting the bull to make more profit? These victims have endured for almost eight years, they have to wait for a few months.",

What kind of reputation are you talking about? That company dances on the edge of the law in most countries of the world where it operates, and their CEO claims that 99% of all crypto users will sooner or later lose everything they have if they use non-custodial wallets. This means that you also agree that you are somehow a stupid person and that you believe that it is better to believe that your private keys are safer on that CEX than in non-custodial wallet.",

The settlement allowed for a large amount of latitude so I don't know if he had to ask every time there was an extension 2) No, the repayment date was never set in stone so long as the court does not have an issue with it there can be no penalty.3) The 2024 date is supposed to be the END of the repayments so they probably will start before that.As was discussed in the thread I posted above and many other places it's been such a long process finding everyone and getting it right is not a simple task.Add on the fact that it's a world wide payback and you have to navigate the laws of many locals just makes is more difficult. -Dave",
