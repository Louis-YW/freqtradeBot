If they contacted you through Telegram and you don't have any other their contacts, I'm afraid that it will be almost impossible to find them. It's possible that something happened for them, but you can't know. No idea what to suggest for you.",

Since you have their Telegram usernames, you can share it here so if anyone can identify them. Telegram username is a public name so even though you share there is nothing spoiled. And if you have their other. I also advise you to be patient, probably they might think that the work is big and it would take time for you to complete it and also probably they are also doing another project at somewhere. April to June is some how far distance but since they have paid part of the service fee. I believe they will show up. If you can finished the work so that whenever they came back, and pay you the remaining balance then you submit the whole work to them. And that will also create trust among you guys.At first when I saw the topic I was like, what kind of topic is this. And when I enter the inside I understand the whole story.",

      "body": "There is no other way of contacting them in other messaging app but only through that Telegram account they've used to message you. If they've paid in advance just to get you work out and then the remaining balance when the work is fully done and complete, that's the typical contract that freelancers does and I guess that's the concern rather than the other one. Regardless of that, keep them informed on that account they've used to message you and what's the situation that both of you are experiencing and the terms that you've agreed with. Isn't it that Telegram accounts have number? Do you see their contact number there? and how long you've been waiting for them? I guess that's the only way aside from chatting them on that username so if it's visible on your end their contact phone number and if you want to contact them that is pretty much the way.",

When they contacted me and we agreed on the deal, never knew he'd trust a stranger with all that money without escrow, so I really hope they're safe.

I got discouraged when he went MiA. I also am worried if I put in another full month of work at the expense of my other jobs and they still do not show up. Maybe I should try this and wait another one month.

This what I also told him. As it is, he is swimming in the biggest ocean that doesn't know when to land. But if he would provided those needed information at least it would have leasing his efforts of wide thinking information to know the person. I don't know why the op even open this thread for such case when he knows that he is not going to provide the searching person information. Op we are not saying that when you provide the person information he would be found once NO but it would given you straight forward answer of Yes and no.",
