  "content": "QuoteRussia's economy is collapsing as exports to the sanctioned country plummet in the face of President Vladimir Putin's ongoing, unprovoked war in Ukraine, trade experts suggest. The \"economy is imploding. We forecast a GDP collapse of -30% by end-2022,\" Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Institute of International Finance trade group, tweeted on Sunday.  Brooks added that data compiled with help from Jonathan Pingle, an IIF researcher, indicated that exports from 20 countries to Russia were down 50% in April compared to the same time a year prior. But monthly exports from Russia to other countries were up 64% in April compared to the same time a year prior, Brooks said on Monday, as oil and gas sales become a bigger part of Moscow's revenue. Brooks said the country's account surpluses were \"massive,\" which meant Russia was exporting far more than it was importing.Russia stopped publishing its trade data after invading Ukraine in late February, so Brooks said the data was compiled using 20 of the country's top trading partners.The Observatory of Economic Complexity said Russia's top trading partners include China and Germany.  Since the invasion, European and Western countries have unveiled a slew of sanctions packages aimed at crippling Russia's economy. Ukraine's government has routinely lobbied for harsher sanctions and led a push to try to redirect European Union countries away from Russian gas and oil — a main source of Moscow's federal revenue. https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-economy-imploding-exports-under-pressure-ukraine-war-sanctions-2022-5....They say russian imports are down 50%. While russian exports are up 64%. Therefore russia's GDP will suffer a collapse of 30% by the end of 2022.As far as I know russia's food production has risen annually which has decreased demand for food imports. Russia's imports should fall naturally as it seeks to become more independent under sanctions. Russia has lived under economic sanctions for so many years I don't know what sanctions they propose to impose on them that have not already been done. Russia exporting more than it imports may also represent the opposite of a trade deficit. Which could be a good arrangement depending on who you ask. China and germany being named as russia's largest trading partners is another surprise considering natural gas and oil exports to the EU have typically been named as the route to crashing russia's economy.",

The fact that rising living costs has happened off the back of these sanctions isn't any happy accident. Certainly, isn't solely down to the pandemic either. The thing is, the sanctions were not universally supported because a lot of those countries relied on importing Russia's gas, electric, and what have you. So, those countries that significantly relied on them are now starting to feel the pinch, just as much as Russia if not more.",

Do you ever post anything besides Russian propaganda? It might be easy to think this is your full time paid job, putting on an image and trying to counteract the huge damage that Russia has done to the world by launching the biggest war in Europe since the end of World War 2. It's one thing to post occasional good news about different countries, but it is clear you have a tunnel vision mindset of \"Post Russia Good, Post America Bad\" when this is meant to be a forum about all sorts of economic related news.Imports are down because nobody wants to sell to Russia anymore, not out of Russian choice, as Putin has caused untold suffering to many innocent people - Ukrainians and Russians alike. You are representing exports falsely as it is purely based on the increase FROM BELOW ZERO of the price of oil during Covid, yet again misleading what is really happening in this situation. Oil and gas are propping up this delusion but require no real skills beyond extraction. A free and civilized country engages in all sorts of other productive business pursuits which drive forward innovation.",

The share of Russia in China's imports is approximately 2%. The share of China in Russian imports is 15%. Supplies from Russia to China are 70% oil, timber, coal, i.e. resources. At the same time, China imports these resources, at the prices that China wants, Russia does not dare to put any conditions on China.Deliveries from China to Russia are from penny small things to the most high-tech systems. With the latter, however, a strong reduction in supplies is noticeable. Moreover, China did not even bother to warn or explain to Russia why it does this Germany - the picture is identical. But Germany, on top of everything else, also initiates and launches sanctions against Russia Really great partnership?",

Russia the third largest country as a producer of gas, oil and minerals for European countries and if they stopped shipping gas, oil and minerals wouldn't it make it difficult for the industry in the European continent to run? I think as a country with oil and gas producers of course it is not difficult for Russia to find other importers besides China and I don't think China will be able to dictate to Russia to sell its gas and oil at cheap prices because it is clear that it has violated the mutual agreement later, even at the Union Summit Europe yesterday in Brussels, it seems that the cohesiveness of the European Union in carrying out sanctions against Russia has begun to crumble, even Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have begun to reject the sanctions because of their dependence on Russian oil and gas so far.",

You should seriously stop reading propaganda specially from BBC There has been inflation in Iran but not a crisis and the inflation also had very little to do with sanctions. It was because of an incompetent government printing money non-stop. Otherwise prices were mostly stable for the past year ever since the previous president's term ended and new one took office. That is despite the increasing sanctions against Iran.IMF puts Iran's economy as 20th largest economy, Iran's GDP is the 17th biggest in the world. And both of these are excluding the billions of dollars of trade that Iran doesn't publicize due to sanctions!On top of that as the country with the second largest gas reserves and large oil supplies with the soaring energy prices the country's revenue has increased significantly.",
