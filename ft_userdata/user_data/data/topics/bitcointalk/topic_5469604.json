  "content": "Today, I am sharing the method of signing messages with an Ethereum address using an Android smartphone. Signing a message serves several purposes:This tutorial is just for learning purpose. Bitcoin message sign is best way to sign message and If you have a PC then no need of Ethereum message signing although users only have android smartphone could use it as an alternative. Account Recovery:It allows you to recover your account in case you lost your account because of hacking or you lost access to both your mail and account.Changing address:It's useful for changing addresses in Bounties and signature campaigns.A method was already shared for signing messages through MEW (MyEtherWallet), but unfortunately, images are no longer supported due to Bitcointalk no longer supporting Imgur embedding.I will show the tutorial of signing messages on Etherscan through Metamask/Trustwallet/Safepal/Bitget wallet or any wallet that supports WalletConnect.First, go to the Etherscan signature page site:https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignaturesConnect your wallet through any compatible option. If you use Metamask, then simply click on it. If you use Trustwallet, click on wallet connect and then select Trustwallet.After connecting your wallet, you will see the screen like below. Write the sign message in this format:Code:Today Date: Oct 08 2023.This address is owned by Hondacd125 Note: You can customize the sign message as needed.The sign-in prompt will appear in your wallet; just sign it, and you're done now.Click on publish to make it public.Save signature hash for future use. Signature hash:0x1761e86e28a842aa69f76c8199fb38b669cf055a955d88b7e3573d8b3a1c861d394574fcc8b9b d2689785375bb9449b1a05b3593f88608f52bfb6ec5403f490c1cYou can check or verify your message by going to this site https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures, clicking on Verify, and then just put the signature hash.Note: When you done signing message then goto Revoke.cash and revoke all permission for safety.",

So I will just advice you go stake or sign your bitcoin address instead if your purpose is for account ownership proof.  Quote from: HONDACD125 on October 08, 2023, 04:08:34 AMChanging address:It's useful for changing addresses in Bounties and signature campaigns.You don’t need to sign every single address posted on the forum. If you plan to change your address and the manager has doubt over it then he would simply as for the signing of the former address. Signing each address wil just make that thread lose some value or make a long thread. Quote from: HONDACD125 on October 08, 2023, 04:08:34 AMConnect your wallet through any compatible option. If you use Metamask, then simply click on it. If you use Trustwallet, click on wallet connect and then select Trustwallet.After connecting your wallet, you will see the screen like below. In terms of privacy or security concerns it is very bad to connect your wallet to any online website as this will expose your keys or seed phrases to the internet which is the first step of getting your account into the hands of hackers. Any private key that would be connected to a site should be for a wallet that doesn’t have much relevance. So if this is the only method of signing Ethereum then it is kind of bad and I wouldn’t advise it. Quote from: MusaMohamed on October 08, 2023, 05:07:19 AMIf you signing a message, you must do it with a wallet that does not store your coins. Because signing is with a private key that is a kind of risk for your fund.I don’t quite get you but if you’re talking about signing of both message and transaction, you need that particular wallet to have your private key, a watch only wallet which doesn’t have a private key doesn’t sign a message or transaction and that’s why you don’t broadcast transactions from those wallets. Just like the transaction signatures are signed by private keys from your wallet and later verified by nodes or miners using your public keys is almost similar to signing of message and verifying it. So you need a wallets that holds the private key to the address you want to sign it’s message",

It solely applies to this forum and maybe other cryptocurrency-related forums/platforms.Quote from: MusaMohamed on October 08, 2023, 05:07:19 AMIf you signing a message, you must do it with a wallet that does not store your coins. Because signing is with a private key that is a kind of risk for your fund.Technically, signing a signed message does not pose a risk to the funds in any way. Unless the user wrongly accesses the website for the signing processes, say accessing a phishing/fake site, then it is obviously out of the question. So what specific risk did you have in mind when you said that? In terms of funds security, it should not be a problem.",

If anyone don't have a PC then this is one method for recovery.

I make this tutorial after reading thread in Meta. some old members told him to sign ethereum message but all thread tutorial image showing error.Quote from: DYING_S0UL on October 07, 2023, 01:31:17 PMSome might say, Why don't you stake BTC or PGP and sign a message saying that?

Because the danger is not actually connecting to the site at that time but exposing the private key. If the hacker gets hold of the private key if you later store coins on that private key even though it is not that wallet the you will still lose your coins. Base on your explanation the staked address or private key should never be used to store any coins then",

You can sign message using Mycelium android, on accounts page click on your address, on top right there is option to 'sign message' [1].Quote from: HONDACD125 on October 08, 2023, 04:08:34 AMNote: When you done signing message then goto Revoke.cash and revoke all permission for safety. I tried with metamask, it did not ask for any permission. I don't think signing message causes any fund risk, unless one goes to the shady website, they are sure to ask for shady permissions and your wallet will be drained. Most ethereum scams happen by giving shady permissions than private key being leaked. [1] https://www.talkimg.com/image/twFev",
