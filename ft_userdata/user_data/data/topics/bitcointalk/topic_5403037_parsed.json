  "content": "In crypto, the impossible becomes feasible, and the past becomes the present! The 20k support has been strong, and no time in BTC's history has the price fallen below the previous ATH. I've been thinking about this recently, but I know it'll be bad if the 20k support is broken, as BTC could fall to 15k or even lower.What do you guys think? Is the previous ATH price ever going to be broken? Is Celsius liquidation price going to be the bottom? The only reason you should hodl and not panic sell.Quote from: CZ Binance In 2017, we thought 20k was crazy high, today we think 20k is painfully low. The industry is growing.Quote from: borovichok on June 18, 2022, 07:13:35 AMPrepare to be shocked!!! In a few days, we'll be doing a 10k!! History has been shattered in front of our eyes, and Bitcoin may never recover over $40k till the next halving... In two years, we'll see each other again.I will finally own 1BTC when it drops to $8k",

      "body": "Bitcoin is too volatile no one knows what will be the price of Bitcoin and this is not yet the right time to decide if $20k is the bottom price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin blockhalving is a good time to invest lo because if you know the Bitcoin price history you should notice that thing. Check the chart from this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin then scroll down. As you can see Dec 2017 reach the highest price of around $19k and the price dropped last December 2018 to around $3.3k so I don't think that $20k is the bottom price so there is still a big possibility that the price of Bitcoin this year will drop more. I'm not FUD it is just my own analysis based on Bitcoin price history.",

      "body": "After an ath, the previous ATH hasn't broken till date. This time the chances are quite high. The price of bitcoin have fallen from the value around $68k reaching $20k. This has happened out of different reasons. The Ath was reached during the month of November, 2021. Now we're just seven months away and we've been close to the previous ATH after hard resistance at specific price points of $43k and $28k. Same as that it can happen around $20k before further drop.",

Right now, it seems the $20k was the actual support but we don't know if it will be broken, maybe today or tomorrow or by the next day.That's one thing for sure that as you've said, \"the impossible becomes feasible\".And that's how we must think that everything can happen unexpectedly.",

But many are saying that for now there is chance that it may first rise and from there it could plummeting again or continue to stay there longer. But this analysis is still a complete BS since its not saying anything where the market is really going.If an individual have some fears that if the price dips to $15k, he will lose more money and may not survive in the next 3-5 months, he  will sell which I guess the whales will be happier that another one bites the dust.",

It may dive but it may straight to the upside too, this market is very tricky and if you aren't that ready on both scenarios, you're the loser. Historically we haven't have any significant huge losses in the past years even during the COVID crash last March 2020, it may signal a more bearish sentiment but it could signal the other one.

Any minute from now, it could fall down from it. It's only a few hundreds that's holding this $20,000. But, again, there's really nothing to worry about. To those who've been HODLing up to this point, there is really no point selling. To those who are afraid of buying, it will probably just take months before you look back and realize that it's a good decision.",

If we accept the fact that market makers and exchanges will set up traps for liquidations against their users, we can more easily to be opened with scenarios that they will do the same for Celsius, 3 Arrows Capital. They are not very different than us, just have bigger capitals.Bigger capitals mean exchanges will earn more by liquidating those entities and their over leveraged positions.

It is hard to say because the correct question in my opinion is to ask \"How many newbies are left who want to follow the US economy crashing and sell their bitcoins instead of buying more?\".As I've said before, this is not a normal drop. This is a clear case of panic sell simply because over the past year people have been brainwashed to believe that bitcoin should suddenly start following US stock market after 13 years of not following anything. So they panic sell whenever a crash occurs on the other market.Funny enough these people ignore the fact that last time the discussion about this fake correlation was heated bitcoin soared while that other crash continued.",
