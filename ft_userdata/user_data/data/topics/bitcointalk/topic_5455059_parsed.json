Any suggestions?You can try exchanges like Gemini, and Coinbase to purchase Bitcoin in New York city. I'm not sure about other crypto-exchanges, but you can at least purchase Bitcoin by using those two exchanges, and I'm sure that falls into category of legal actions. They are available for the residents of the New York city and anyone could purchase crypto-currencies from those exchanges.If you're unable to access those exchanges then you should contact your internet service provider and ask them the reason that why you aren't able t access those exchanges even these two are legally selling crypto-currencies in the city and have proper licenses to work in that particular region.You should also elaborate that what problems are you facing while visiting those exchanges? Once we know your problems then we will try our best to help you. I recommend you to try those exchanges first and if they don't work for you then you should let me and others know so that we could help you as much as we possibly can.",

Any suggestions?I know that the use, buying, and selling of Bitcoin is not illegal in New York so your restrictions might be a personal issue. You didn't state why you have been blocked from accessing or using all the exchanges you tried using. Maybe you might be having a KYC issue with these exchanges and you may have to consult their customer service to determine what is wrong. Have tried using the Bitcoin ATM finder tool to search for functional ATMs in New York, it could also be of good help. But if you care about your privacy you might consider using some reliable P2P platforms like Bisq and others. Or you can consider buying from a reputable member of the forum.",

Any suggestions?I am not aware that NY banned crypto transactions. I don't think it is correct unless something has changed in last couple of weeks. Which exchanges are banning you? What is the reason they are providing? I am sure that's not for the location. As per the Bitlicense, any exchanges holding the license, are allowed to offer crypto services to any NY residents. Try Coinbase if you haven't already.",

Here are a few ways you might be able to buy cryptocurrency:Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Trading: This involves buying from someone directly. You'll need to take precautions to ensure your safety and the security of your funds.Â  MyTHDHR BenefitsOut-of-State Purchase: If you regularly visit another state, you could consider buying cryptocurrency there, if it's legal and more accessible.Use of a Trusted Exchange: Some exchanges like Gemini and Coinbase are allowed to operate in New York and offer a variety of cryptocurrencies.",

Any suggestions?what exchange are you referring to that blocked you from buying Bitcoin or cryptocurrency? because what I know that you can buy crypto there in New York is Kucoin, cashapp, gemini and coinbase. It's just surprising because you can't buy bitcoin at the ATMs that I know there are more than 1k plus ATMs in NY. You mean all that is useless?",
