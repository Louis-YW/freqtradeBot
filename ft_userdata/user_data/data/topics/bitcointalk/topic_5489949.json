  "content": "Hello,I have wired idea I want to apply on myself. To Control my spending as I spend alot of money.As I am 40 years now, I want to buy a new bitcoin wallet, send bitcoin with timelock to a bitcoin address I have, distrubuted for the next 40 years, that on daily basis ( or monthly or Weekly)  I get some bitcoin for the coming 40 years. Once I done this, I will destroy the new wallet along with the pass seeds, that I cannot change the programming ever!I can do this with both bitcoin and bitcoin cash, in this way I have income for the \"Rest of my life\".It will be hard to do via trezor a daily transactions for 40 years, but maybe monthly or yearly, unless there is technical way to programe it.Please let me know what you think and ideas for implementation.Best Regards,Anas",

      "body": "Hi.So, if I get it correctly, you want to create daily transactions with timelock, so that you can broadcast each one of them on its specific day?Something like:Tx1, timelock for March 23rdTx2, timelock for March 24thAnd so on?Technically you can do it, but there are 2 issues:1. Programming time locks for 40 years on a daily basis is very time consuming.2. You will need too many transactions if you pay yourself daily.",

      "body": "It's an interesting idea, but there's a couple of problems with this:- You can't change the fee rate of the presigned transactions. This means you will either be overpaying to get into a block, or underpaying (which would require you to CPFP from the destination wallet, which is just another way to overpay).- The security model of the wallet that receives the presigned funds is very tricky - it effectively controls all of your funds, so you should give it the same security as your most serious cold storage. However, since you will presumably be spending from this wallet on a daily basis, it would become tiresome if this wallet were cold.",

Maybe you can do every 2 weeks which is usually how paydays go anyway. The 15th and the 30th. I have mixed feelings about this idea, though. I also have a hard time maintaining my finances but this type of program’s not gonna work with me because I might not have a consistent income.

For me, even though I've been a hodler for a really long time, I think that I won't be able to do a 40 year restriction on my bitcoins, I like to at least enjoy whenever I feel like I've profited enough already so that's why I can't do anything like that but if you're going to push for it OP, I wish you all the best and I do hope that you'd find a way to make things work for you. Maybe consider also what others have said about this thing that you're doing, you don't want to be starting something and then end up not committing to it because at the middle of this journey, you've found some problems, do your utmost consideration of many factors before committing OP.",

Because it is possible to write double spends. So, it is possible to make it more flexible, if you would have one transaction, sending you some coins today, and another transaction, sending twice as much tomorrow, but using the same inputs. Then, if you don't need those coins, you can wait, and save on transaction fees.But yes, predicting all scenarios require creating a lot of transactions.

It applies to any type of money that someone has put aside. You can have money in the bank. There is no reason at all, in accumulating money (in any format) if you can't use it to cover a sudden need. Money need liquidity. OP the only solution to your problem is to spend less. If you have any kind of addiction that pushes you to spend, then it's a severe problem and you need to contact someone. If you just spend, stop it.",

Do you do daily transactions through DCA? Doesn't that seem tiring? Why don't you just do it once a week ortwice a month like that?After all, you're going to do that for 40 years, and I think you can really do that, and you just have to be careful where you keep your trezor wallet, because it's actually a pretty good plan, and that's the extent of your plan, to be honest.",

To create that many transactions, you'll need that many different inputs. Or you need to build a long chain of transactions starting from the first one, spending your own change again.You have no idea what fee you'll need 20 years from now. You may be overspending, or it could be too low to be able to  broadcast the transaction.What if 20 years from now the Bitcoin protocol needs an update? Let's say you get 5 years to transfer all coins to a new quantum resistant encryption. Or the block time changes which changes your time lock?I'll suggest what I've suggested before: it may be better to bury your private keys. If they're 20 meters under ground and it takes you 2 weeks to get there, you won't be spending it without thinking about it.Or just work on your self control. Proper offline cold storage with offline signing is a lot more work than a hardware wallet.What if a Fork happens in the future, and you can't sign a compatible transaction anymore?",

It seems a bit frivolous to me, because theoretically you can live another 60 years, but also maybe death knocks on the door much sooner than you expect - because life is like that, unpredictable.

Bitcoin is now in existance for just 15 years, it matures slowly, but it's not possible to predict how it will be in the next decades.If you stick to your excuses and can't control yourself, then how about involving someone you trust to control in a more reliable way. This of course depends heavily on the necessity to have someone or multiple persons to trust.You could use e.g. a 2-of-2-multisig wallet: you hold one part of it and multiple people you know and trust hold the other part of it. No single party can spend alone, you have to co-operate to spend. (Multiple other people holding the other part for redundancy reason, to avoid a single party besides you messing up. If you mess up, it's your own fault, no-one else to blame.)You give the other multisig-wallet part holders clear instructions and rules to sign a transaction weekly or monthly for you (just don't go the daily way, if you can't cope with a weekly or montly payment schedule, you're in serious trouble).That way you can still react properly to changes in Bitcoin and sudden changes or needs in your life.
