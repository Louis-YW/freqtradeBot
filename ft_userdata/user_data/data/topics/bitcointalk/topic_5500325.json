Anyway, I also hope that this movement will be more implemented in different countries because I know many people or bitcoin investors who will want to help using their own assets. I'm sure this kind of movement will be implemented more if this first project is successful and if many people actually donate and give some of their assets. Anyway, I hope they could accept other crypto currencies or multiple coins so that many people will have other options for donating.",

It is also usual nowadays to see BTC being used for purposes like these, because you can send BTC to any part of the world, fast and easy; and all the receiver needs is to create a BTC wallet address and make it available.Quote from: Assface16678 on June 18, 2024, 10:41:31 PMAnyway, I hope they could accept other crypto currencies or multiple coins so that many people will have other options for donating.They are not accepting donations in only BTC, but in a lot of other cryptocurrencies.

However, if such important steps are taken in all countries of the world, Bitcoin will be known as one of the main means of payment in all areas of life in the future.However, it is very important to verify the authenticity of organizations that will accept payments through Bitcoin in the service of humanity. Because there are many fake companies who collect money from people in the name of services, in this case those companies collect money through various online payments.All those humanitarian organizations and organizations engaged in the service of the needy people are cheating like this based on the helplessness of people and these organizations should be vigilant so that they cannot collect money through Bitcoin. However, in the case of organizations that are certified by the government and various agencies, there can be no substitute for Bitcoin to collect money from different countries.",

That's just you who thinks poor people or those that are in need are parasites, if the money can help stave off hunger at least for a day, I would definitely donate also, I don't think you're really donating or doing the charity yourself, you're probably just saying that so you're not that bad looking for saying the people that are helped by these charities are leeches, sure there are some organization that really don't help the people they promise to help and that it's a good idea to do the helping yourself but I don't think that's you.Really cool that Habitat for Humanity has done this, that means that more exposure to bitcoin and more people are going to be learning more about it, hopefully I can do some donations there some time. This is actually a good thing too, if they consider the bitcoin donation for long-term hodl, they might be able to help more in the future if they wait for the bitcoin donations to go up in prices.",

The most important thing is that we share our blessings to others and maybe our deeds will go back ten folds to us.And with this, perhaps some Bitcoin enthusiasts are going to used some of their stash for a good cause for Habitat for Humanity and thumbs up to you.",

I'm happy for the organization being open-minded and futuristic.

They received a lot of money $225 million to help people in need. Accepting Bitcoin is great idea because it helps people and makes cryptocurrency look good. But I think charities like Habitat for Humanity should make it easier for people to donate Bitcoin. They should put  option to donate Bitcoin in obvious place not hide it away. This way more people can donate and help make bigger difference. It is important to make donating easy and clear especially when people need help the most.",

You can save your money and do good deed by yourself while also donating to huge charities with other purpose than yours. Habitat for Humanity Intl. is an organization that build homes for those who need it. I find that donating to large scale charities can help more people as they have more reach and more resources and they have the actual time to build the necessary infrastructure.Right now, I can’t just build a house no matter how much money I save up. So I can help in other ways. I can instead do a feeding program. You can do both. There can’t be too much kindness in this world.",

We can also assure that our donation is safe and can able to reach to those people in need,research or something that helpful to our nature.Also good to see that Habitat to humanity considered to list bitcoin as their accepted currency since this could bring something good to them also for strengthen up the existence of bitcoin.
