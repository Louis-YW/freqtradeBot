As only 2/3 of people only work for it anymore, I choosed to create a new directory for myself which I will work more on it.Also Blockxs lists websites that bitpr0 doesnt have a category for.",

      "body": "Hey there Stakefast! This site seems pretty interesting.  I am definitely going to keep an eye on how it develops going forward.  The one thing I am not totally crazy about though is how all the links initially point to your own tracking url before redirecting me to the actual site and  I get why you set it up like that, but I just dont love it since I cannot see the real url when I hover over the links.  Makes me wonder if there might be another way for you to keep track of clicks that does not hide the true destination url from us.  By the way, I noticed a small mistake: It should be \"BOT.SEUNTJIE\", not \"BOTSETUNJIE\".Anyway, cool idea overall! Ill be curious to see where you take this.",

Perhaps you can take some names from https://thebitcoinhole.com/software-wallets when it comes to software wallets. It's a website created and maintained by another user of Bitcointalk. I also feel like the wallet category, being as important as it is, should be much higher up on your website and not something placed in the end.",
