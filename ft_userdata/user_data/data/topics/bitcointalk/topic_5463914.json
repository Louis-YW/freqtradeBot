I'm a touch late for the 15th anniversary of Bitcoin.org launch The domain name bitcoin.org was formally registered on August 18 2008.The domain ownership was transferred to several organisations outside the Bitcoin developers circle after Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from the project. I think It was done in order to maintain shared accountability and prevent any one organisation from having an excessive influence over the Bitcoin protocol and its growth.Like many beautiful things in life, Bitcoin.org's source code is available to everyone.Satoshi, despite the current market downturn, I still cling to the decentralised ideal that we have all fought so hard to foster. Happy birthday, Bitcoin.org",

      "body": "Decentralization will always be a defining factor for Bitcoin and even the whole of the cryptocurrency market. This is where Bitcoin stands really tall and will always be the standard for the many to be gauged with. This is a way for people to get empowered and not be always on chain with profit-oriented financial institutions and the controlling interest of the government.",

Happy birthday, Bitcoin.orgThe very source of an alternative, embeded in technology is what we see and call Bitcoin. We have immense gratitude to the inventor and creator of the blockchain technology, the person or the group of programmers called Satoshi Nakamto, for this revolutionary invention.",
