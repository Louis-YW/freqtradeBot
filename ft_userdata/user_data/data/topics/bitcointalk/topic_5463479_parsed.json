Some time i used to think who are those people who bring the economy of the whole country to this level like back in 20 or 30 years this was not happening like it is now. Maybe i am wrong here. But since i get my consciousness i am evidencing huge jumps in inflation over small period of time.What's in the world it started is this started when US military left Afghanistan, (i know that's old). Or when Russian war started and BRICS came up somewhere in between and now i just heard there is this mBridge thing to avoid US swift banking system. Point being made here is, every country is fighting a war not just Russia or Ukraine instead every country is fighting one. We are also in the war with inflation and our country is totally depend on the Dollar because we are under huge debt from many countries but IMF is the one on top of the list. And increasing Interest rates are root problem of all of these things. There must be a balance between these economic situations.",

The Netherlands use to have the one of best economies in the world just some years ago but what is currently happening in the country is the law of supply and demand taking its course. They are currently experiencing one of the worst housing crisis, high inflation rate and rising living cost too. There is just a low supply of housing to match its high demand. Furthermore, their citizens are losing their jobs due to automation and the result as we can see is the \"technical recession\" which is a negative impact on the growth of the economy. We may likely see them recover before the last quarter of 2023.",

First of all, countries such as Netherlands were not that much affected by the COVID pandemic. Most of the population got vaccinated before the Delta wave began. It was third world nations such as India and Brazil that got impacted the most. And these countries have shown robust economic growth during the last few years. So what is wrong with Netherlands? The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war has played its part, but the rot started long back. Many of the European governments still believe that they are super-rich and splurge money on unnecessary expenses.

I wonder how much more it will affect this situation to the world, it was predicted that this was going to happen and that the territories would have to experience difficult times, it was never thought that it would be so fast, the currencies are losing stability and the money that is obtained is not enough to cover the basic needs of each citizen, international debts are leading nations to ruin, all because of the bad administration of the country, If only fair and experienced people were in power who did not seek good for themselves but also for the rest of the people, the scenario might have been very different. Now the only thing left is to survive, it will no longer be possible to live comfortably, little by little not even emigrating will be an option to seek a better life, so do not open any nation that is not affected by inflation..... the only thing that could To change this situation would be to seek refuge in technology, digital currencies whose value does not depend on any political event in order to withstand the blow and move forward.",

That's true Stagflation - a time when the monetary and economic systems are out of control. It's a little bit surprising to see that the Netherlands recently suffered from two consecutive quarters of negative growth. This is because the economy bounced back more quickly and strongly than most European nations after the COVID-19 pandemic. This adverse economic condition was mainly caused by the decline in exports and household consumption. The global economy is slowing and most people are reducing their expenses on essential goods which is leading to less import from other countries. And the most affected sector when there is less consumer spending are the industries, agriculture. and fishery. Almost every central bank are increasing interest rate to curb inflation but it is also affecting the flow of money that would have increased more spending by individuals. I think the country should seek more markets for its exports and consider reducing interest rates to encourage more household spending.",

Not just that, the same event occured in my village. And this all were fake reports to kill innocent people. Why they did it is just a mystery to me. But, Thanks for reminding me of COVID.",
