      "body": "This is totally wrong. There is no learning concept. Rather you are relying on someone or some group. Hey, you cannot but disagree nobody is perfect. Then how are you sure you would gain profit from there? This is merely a trend to gather people who have zero knowledge in trading or who recently joined in this sector and looking for some trading signals.Brother my advice is first learn how this works. If you really wanna make a group, why not but make a learning group where everyone will share their trading knowledge. Self learning is the most important. So rather then depending on others try to gain experience from others & then try to trade a little.Quote from: hugeblack on September 03, 2023, 11:42:00 AMQuote from: Oshosondy on September 03, 2023, 10:56:36 AMDo not worry, you will later know that they are not wall street.

Giving trading signals is the lasted scam on board because these scammers knows that newbies wants to get rich quick through trading without putting in effort of learning how to trade. It is free fine but it wouldn't be free anymore,and you will be asked to subscribe to get signal. Read and learn about trading if you want to be a professional trader,instead of depending on signals to trade,because you will loss double. You will give them money and you will get a wrong signal which will make you loss the second time. Instead of jumping into trading, why don't you hodli as this is very easy to practice than trading.",

I guess those signal providers are feeling leaving telegram and YouTube will be a good disguise for them but it will never be like that because some users still know it is the same strategy. Call groups are only interested in your money, they guarantee winning but it is not as promised. You win and lose most times you lose more. If they are free today after your welcome bonus you are required to pay the next time for you to get the signal.Quote from: Learn Bitcoin on September 03, 2023, 12:03:44 PMMost of the time, traders never win the trade in a single shot, and they have martingle the trade.

In this case they are struggling with winning a trade if they are ordering in martingale strategy without the first trade in profit. Martingale is better used if the existing trade is in profit then you can use it to accumulate more profit to maximize your gain but using it while you are already in lose, you are putting your account on pressure and soon you lose your account with a volatility against you .",

The majority of trading signal groups are not profitable traders. They only care about the money paid for their service. There are many people who fall victim to this. Don't rely on people to trade your money; if you don't have time to trade, you can do so. But if I were you, I prefer copy-trading since you can check a trader's previous performance before you copy them. So you can tell if a trader is lucrative or not based on their performance. However, it is always preferable to trade on your own, so take the time to learn how to trade.",

FYI, that is a binary trading platform, which is more like gambling. I have followed some of their signals, and only a few of them actually work.Most of the time, users had to martingale their trade.
