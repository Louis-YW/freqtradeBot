If you are using a Linux based operating system then you should use Code: sudo  That will grant the command root access. It seems that you aren't running it on Linux but on the windows operating system. So running it as administrator might solve your issue. On the command app you should left click on it and select run as administrator that will give complete permissions to pywallet. And, if things go well it should work without any issue.If it still gives that error then try to quit Bitcoin core client and other bitcoin services, and restart those to see if it works or not. Sometimes due to the running services the permissions become limited and might not work properly. That's why quitting those first and restarting them again can help to solve the issues.",

My best guess is my wallet.dat is not located into right file or something like that.Since everyone here think we noobs know what to do, I would need step by step guide and nobody wrote it here, everybody miss some steps so I'm trying to learn and catch and still not there yet.I literally never used cmd or python or anything so definitely I need step by step, every single one what to do after I recovered wallet.dat file.I know how to install python and how to download pywallet but where to place files, where to open cmd, what commands should I use - no clue",
