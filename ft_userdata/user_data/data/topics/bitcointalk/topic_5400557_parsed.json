  "content": "Good Afternoon from Illinois,I thought I'd give it a shot and post a topic for asic repair services. I am looking to see if any users need hashboard repairs (psu and control board too). I'm located right here in the midwest, have repaired plenty of S17 (and S19s) including the S17 variants too. Contact me I can do a zoom/skype video call and can walk you around my shop. I repair S17s daily. I have been pretty successful finding users here that need future repairs in the midwest. Would be happy to help now if users here ever need repairs done. https://www.reddit.com/r/ASICminerRepair/comments/us87ht/local_us_miner_repairers/TLDR; I'm in Illinois and I fix and repair antminer hashboards, power supply units, and control boards. Available year round. I fix and return within 14 days. I also price match. Contact me for shipping and logistics.Thanks,Brycefixmyasic@gmail.com",
