The phrase “what you don’t have, you don’t need” in my opinion, is totally false and I would disagree with you. Picture an individual without fingers on his hand. He obviously doesn’t have fingers but I would say he would definitely need them.",

Wats your take ?This is not possible to see like if you follow the economic phrase too that says human wants are insatiable. So it is a human attribute or character to want things and if they want many things they keep looking for the satisfaction and the satisfaction is to get that thing. That phrase of yours of \"what you don't have, you don't need\" is not proper because you only can think you don't need it because that you don't have it, I think I put it in another way  . You know everyone like to have good life but we need caution and moderate.",

Wats your take ?There are still things that we don't have yet we need them. Maybe the things that you're about are luxurious stuff that we don't really need but we want but sometimes contentment can't be a good motivation for us to strive more and to reach success. Being contented when we haven't reached our achievements will not make us live comfortably. We can't stay poor and be contented. If we'll have a chance to strive and hustle then we must grind for us to have a comfortable living. The things that we want must be our motivation.",

We're never satisfied with what we have, but we do desire things we don't have and may find the use for them.For instance, I could live without a car, but it was a pain to travel by bus. When I got a car, I found out that it's a huge help, but after a year I had problems during winter on snowy roads, so I begun to look for a 4x4 car with more power. When I finally got that, my daughter was born and I needed a bigger car. We always want something that we don't have and believe me, we often need it.",

Wats your take ?A concept for cultivating a submissive biomass, instead of a country's population. This is essentially a slave ideology, or the ideology of a weak-willed, unfree society. A certain semblance of several decades was formed in a country like the USSR. There, too, \"postulates\" were driven into the heads of the entire population:1. Living in abundance is evil2. Having good things and a lot is indecent3. We must endure and work as \"ordered by the motherland\"4. The high standard of living in other countries is all a lie, these are attempts to deceive you and turn away from the great idea of ​​\\u200b\\u200b\"communism\"5. Even a folk saying existed \"we did not live richly - and there was nothing to start\"",

Wats your take ? The problem is no one gets life’s contentment and satisfaction as we are born with greed and that is something that is undeniable. Yes, we could live in a better place if it’s possible, but knowing we always go for what we need and what we want even if it seems unrealistic to us, then probably depression is the thing next to being uncontented and dissatisfaction. Something that we need to accept, but somehow it can be avoided if we always act the right way in the first place.",

Well it’s kind of reverse psychology. Because the truth in life is, what you don’t have then the more that you will shape up your life and do better so you can have them in the future. I guess humans are just like this, they won’t look for something or crave for if it’s already there, the only reason that they will look for it because it’s something that they don’t have so they should always work hard to achieve it finally.",

Only that things, do not own you.\"It may seem counter intuitive. But some of the happiest children I've seen were the ones living in poverty with few worldly possessions.
