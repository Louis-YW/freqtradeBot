Monero runs on a blockchain that is privacy oriented and the transaction is said to be private through the use of shealth addresses. If a transaction isn’t visible then it will be hard to trace the transaction back to where it originated from and such can not link addresses together. QuoteSecond question: Is LocalMonero a mixer/tumbler for XMR coins? If your answer is \"yes\", I assume that AgoraDesk is also a mixer/tumber for BTC coins?No both the localMonero and AgoraDesk are decentralized P2P trading exchanges where you convert your coins to fiat or vice versa without having to submit KYC. They are not in any way a mixer or tumbler. You. Can visit the AgoraDesk ANN thread.  QuoteP.S.: I searched everywhere for answers to the above questions on the whole of this forum and found none; hence this post.Here is the thread designated for XMR on the forum https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.0",

So Monero offers more privacy than other cryptocurrencies, but moving coins between your own wallets is better than going through exchanges if you want to stay totally anonymous.",

If your answer is \"yes\", I assume that AgoraDesk is also a mixer/tumber for BTC coins?No. First, those kind of platform is not a mixer or tumbler. Second, Monero did not require a mixer or any similar platform as such.Both LocalMonero and AgoraDesk establish their website clearly as P2P platform. You can see it on their respective About page. Regarding Monero, the underlying technologies are inherently private. It developed and implemented to ensure users privacy and security in mind. So there is no reason it requires mixer or tumbler.",

      "body": "First of all Monero (XMR) is a privacy based coin. It is not possible for anyone to trace the origin and the ending of its transaction. It is a coin which acts like a mixer but has its own Blockchain. A mixers is not a Blockchain, it just jumbles the address to make it untraceable. If I am correct you only have Bitcoin mixture and not for any altcoins. Local Monero is a P2P exchange and not a mixture.",

Technically it's not a mixing service and the coin we are talking is not traceable which is same for Zcash, Grin or any other privacy coins.",

I think if Agoradesk will not fully anonymize the Bitcoin transactions on their platform it's just likely a publicity to make people patronize their service. Agoradesk is not a mixer, it's just a centralized exchange with great privacy.",
