  "content": "When you go to some boards like reputation board, at the first page you will see many locked threads. They don't appear pleasant to my observation. It messes up the decency or aesthetics of the such boards. Many people might not see it as a problem and it might not be a problem. Then forgive me because there are people who would always want something to be 100% nice even if it doesn't matter to others. There are obviously threads that aren't relevant to be in the first page. I am suggesting that as there is a means to bump a thread, there should also be a button to push a thread down to second page or bottom. Locking a thread and waiting for other active ones to override it might take time to happen, or might not happen because more threads would be locked.A thread like this https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409141.0 should not occupy any space in the first page anymore because it's solved.However, I am not suggesting that all locked threads should be pushed down, but some obvious ones that might not be revisited anymore should. I think a first page like this; Is more decent than this;",

When a thread is locked it ends the discussion, but your suggestion will keep threads open and spammers may still spam in it and bring it back to the first page even when the discussion is complete. But needless to say that when a thread is locked, spammers can't bring it back to the top again, and it must eventually crawl down.",

If it did, I don't think you would be around  The current forum layout is obviously not what one can say is beautiful, but I don't want to join the queue of complainants  .  I have read many suggestions for new forum software, I have seen a board created for new forum suggestions and I have seen a thread about Beta forum bla bla.

If it did, I don't think you would be around  It wasn't you're point but I do like the forum design for its simplicity...Some sites are a bit like a first presentation after you've discovered transitions in powerpoint in school, it looks cool to you but it's not going to work everywhere and is going to look like every other website.I'd support the suppression of locked topics - unless they're made by a mod sich as for topic moves - but I'm not on boards where I often see them so my view might be a bit irrelevant (also the text for them in some places is smaller so they're harder to accidentally click).Also it might be easy for a user script /plugin to be made for doing this.",

If someone can locate a thread to lock, is it to push down he cannot do?Both. You can lock the thread yourself (you can try with this thread if you want and then unlock, see the option at the bottom left) and it can be locked by moderators. Once in a while, when reporting a thread, I have put \"I think it should be locked or trashed\" and the moderators have locked it, I understand because they believe there is value in posts in the thread. I'm not convinced by what you say, and I think it's fine the way it is. If a thread is locked and is not re-unlocked, it will disappear from the page and will not bother. But there are others that the OP lock for some reason to unlock later, and it seems reasonable to me.  Look at this one by theymos, for example:DT update log",

So if you don't see much problem with it then you will see a different look after a lot of new threads are created or old threads are bump.Right now only 8/40 threads are locked in there, didn't see much of a problem via PC but the phone display might not look good to you. I don't expect many new features to be added in this forum, so I'll just enjoy all the quirks.",
