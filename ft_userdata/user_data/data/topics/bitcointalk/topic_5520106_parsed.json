We will hear a lot of predictions but no one can predict the price direction, all that can be said is that we have not yet reached the highest peak where positive news continues for several days without any negative news.",

Let’s enjoy the ride and see what’s ahead! $100,000 is a round number and it is like $10,000 in the past, it will be very strong resistance and barrier for Bitcoin to break. There are many possibilities for Bitcoin to break it.The perfect one is breaking it with a first try. That would be massive but don't feel bad if Bitcoin fails to break it with its first attempt.The another possibility is Bitcoin will try one, two or three times and eventually will succeed to hit and break $100,000. This scenario is what I believe will happen.Either what will come true, I believe Bitcoin will break out from $100,000 and make its ATH for this cycle higher than that. We have one more year for bull run, a lot of time for many ATHs in future.When will $100,000 be broken, honestly I really don't mind it will happen in 2024 or in 2025.",

Success feels pretty good, doesn’t it?Just imagine the following -real- scenario.You buy $150 worth of Bitcoin in 2020.You just set it aside and forget it.In 2024, you want to buy a service subscription.Let's say the subscription costs $15 per month.You can either use $150 from you card and buy 10 months of this subscription, or use the BTC you have set aside from 2020 and now with the same initial amount of $150 you can buy approximately 80 months of the subscription.Now, instead of cashing out the BTC and paying with FIAT, giving premium to banks, credit cards etc, imagine using the Bitcoin immediately without intermediary. I reckon that's a better way of doing things!I don't know about MSTR but personally, I view Bitcoin as a currency. I use it as much as I can to buy regular stuff and I don't plan to cash out. In life, there is no \"never\", but my goal is to live using Bitcoin instead of FIAT. So far, it's not possible, but it kind of works for a very small percentage of my financial transactions.I don't view Bitcoin as an investment... I am among the very few who think Bitcoin will become the global store of value and, why not, the global currency. The latter is very difficult, I know, but the former is very easy!",

So again, there is not like something that we are not expecting, we are looking for this price point along and we have been predicting this ever since this phase started from 2021-2025 run, the four year cycle.",

Perhaps Microstrategy, is up to something as you said, but I won't worry myself about whatever it is, I'm more concerned about history being made to show some haters that I know that Bitcoin has the potentials to reach $100k and far above.

That’s just $3k shy of their prediction, and guess what, it’s not even the end of the year yet. Heck, it’s not even the end of the month, with 9 days left before flipping the calendar. After that, we’ve got a whole 31 days to hit or surpass that target.Honestly, their prediction seems conservative at this point. With the momentum we’re seeing, December could be even more bullish. Let’s enjoy the ride and see what’s ahead!  I guess we don't need to wait at nearly end of this year since there's huge possibilities that anytime to day or in next following days this 6 digit figure($100k) will be reached by bitcoin. These will be a great milestone and it will leave a mark since this is the first time in history that bitcoin would hit this figures.December month would be more exciting since everyone would provably get hype more on these date knowing that many people speculate that there are more factors that could drive the demand. So there's huge chance for bitcoin to achieve more great figure even for next year. So everything in the market right now becoming more interesting and for sure there would be more from bitcoin since bullish season seems going to continue until next year.",
