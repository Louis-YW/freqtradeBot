But humanity, with its anthropization was tormenting the Earth by siphoning resources from it, cutting down forests, killing animals, polluting water. One day in a mad race between nations to see who would get first to the centre of the Earth in search of inexhaustible energy humanity invented the Super Drill. Some people were against it, but they were quickly silenced...When the drill reached the core, there was an explosion that tore the planet apart and scattered people across islands. The energy - Graviton - that was released began to hold the pieces of earth together after the explosion preventing them from being scattered across the space. At first humans lived like savages on islands. They lost their knowledge and ability to communicate. They started all over again. After some times, the humanity has managed to modify the Graviton energy to Civilisation's benefitYou goal is to develop communication between the islands.

      "body": "👋 Hello MOTU People! 🌍🚀 We've launched a mini-game to help you start your immersion into the Motu 🎮 Play Now 🕹️🔗 Telegram | Chat | Website 🌐🔍 Today we will take you on a dive into the resource history of the MOTU islands. 🌌 Graviton is a quantum of the gravity field. Energy crystals that permeate everything on the MOTU islands. 🧐 As a rare substance which is always in short supply, graviton can be extracted from mines, air, sandstorms, ice rain, and volcanic rock. It is the basic material used as the main source of energy and to produce currency, MOL. 🌪️Farm, mine graviton, produce MOL and improve your camp and heroes.⚙️ Graviton is the main resource in MOTU. Graviton is required to create new buildings, trains, and research upgrades. Graviton is also required to hire heroes, buy items, or activate special building functions. 🌍 In MOTU, everyone has a universal source of loot - mines and flying debris. In addition to this, each Faction has its own unique way of farming graviton based on their habitat:    🏭 Faction 1 and Faction 2 use working buildings that produce an absorbing panel that soaks up Graviton through meteor showers  💨 Faction 3 builds a wind generator that sucks Graviton out of the air  🛠️ Faction 4 uses Drills to extract Graviton from the quarries     [/color][/size]🤖 Farming bots are available to help you with your fossil mining. Upgrade your bots or buy improved ones in the form of NFTs, for more Graviton mining. 🌟 All players need to farm Graviton constantly to succeed. Whenever money is tight, expand, build farms, look for crystal fragments, curb ball lightning, and catch clots. 💥 Graviton also appears in interactive forms: - Debris that hits the inhabitants and can bot the farmer if you forget caution. 🏭 In order to produce the currency, MOL, you need to build a workshop.The workshop recycles at 30% loss, an improved NFT workshop will recycle at 110% in a player's favor  📝 At the moment it's just a draft but we can't wait to share it with you and gather feedback as only the community owns the MOTU world🔗 Telegram | Chat | Website 🌐🤝 Join us we welcome everyone!",
