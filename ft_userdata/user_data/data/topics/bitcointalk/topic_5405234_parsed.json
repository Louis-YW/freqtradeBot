You connect your monitor with the mainboard or the first gpu? You set the IGP as first GPU in bios? What Powersupply? Enable Above 4G in Bios?",

You connect your monitor with the mainboard or the first gpu? You set the IGP as first GPU in bios? What Powersupply? Enable Above 4G in Bios?I was finally able to get a signal by resetting the cmos but this time with only one card connected! Also am always connecting via DP to the first card only, then I went ahead to bios enabled 4g decoding and tried setting Gen1 for two PCIE related settings, also again tried setting Gen2, I was able to get up to two cards working today, but when I try to connect ANY thid card I won't get a signal at all ! I tried a few combinations of Gen 2 and Gen 1 but never had any luck and this board is pretty basic there aint much settings to play with I guess !... any help guys greatly appreciated...",
