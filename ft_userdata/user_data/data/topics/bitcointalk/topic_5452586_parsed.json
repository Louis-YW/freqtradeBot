Let him enjoy and use his money, maybe when he's already reach 12 years old, you can teach about good and bad things.",

How to teach children economic literacy?There is this practice we used during childhood and it works greatly to cut down our spending,  it is called a saving box,  this can come in any size depending on how much you want to stock in there in cash,  it comes in different makes and designs some are made with steel and ions with a code lock and a space to slide into it the cash while the code will remain unknown until it reaches the time to open the box. The adult that the kid trusts will have the code to the box and will only open it when the agreed time is reached,",

It's an abuse of money and also teaching the baby how to live a wasteful life because by the time the baby may have come of age, $1k can't even take good care of him or her for the week which is not encouraging at all. But nevertheless, if the parents are willing to keep doing that I will suggest you should stay away from the baby otherwise you are inviting problems to yourself.",

How to teach children economic literacy?There is not a bad book on finance for children \"A Dog called Money\" by Bodo Schäfer. I'd say that it talks to kids simply about complicated things. You can read it with your nephew and then you can play with virtual investing with him, showing how it works. Children learn through games so main thing is to find proper financial game and while playing to explain how finance work. If you can show it with game example your nephew probably can learn it better than just with explanations.",

How to teach children economic literacy?I have to laugh when I read your story , 8 years old is a very, very young age and still has to be called a child, which means he still doesn't know anything about where to get money or regular income in his life. So don't blame him when he starts spending as much as $10 a day just to buy ice cream because it was born from his own desire that he still can't think about making money. Apart from that, you also don't need to spend more time teaching your nephew about economic literacy because he won't understand it so the time you spend on it will also be wasted even though you need to limit it in a number of bad ways so as not to make him accustomed to doing things that are not good, but you don't need to limit him to eating food, including consuming ice cream even though it tastes bad and he doesn't eat it all the way.",

The best way is to give them experience, if they ask for money, then provide them with a job, and only when they complete the job will they get the money. That way, they'll know how hard it is to make money and appreciate it more than just sitting around explaining it to them. I always use this method with my children.",

When I was young I also spent money anyhow, but now i know what life is really all about. It’s better if you can just leave the boy, when it’s time he will start saving, I don’t think their is anything you will tell the boy that he will listen, he is still a kid But let me ask you, what do you even want the boy to be saving for?",

If the parents decide to give the child $100 per week, that's because they want him to spend it on anything he needs. Although you can teach him how to save by first teaching him a bit of theory about how to save and how important it is to save, For example, you can tell him that if he develops the habit of saving, it will help him get things for himself any time his parents don't send him weekly pocket money. After trying to convince him with the idea of saving, you can let him practicalize it by creating a safe for him with the house in the old-school way. It could be an empty cane with a cover, and you will ask him to save at least $20 every week from the $100 he gets. I think that will help.",

How to teach children economic literacy?The problem here is not the child; if there is actually a problem, the parent is okay with it. You see it as a problem and a waste of resources, but the parent who is giving the child $100 for a weekly allowance sees it as giving their child the best in order for them not to lack a thing, to be very comfortable, to enjoy their childhood, and not to feel uncomfortable among their playmates. That amount of money is considered huge depending on your income, and it's also considered small depending on what you earn.How to Save You said, \"How can you teach someone who was brought up to always grab and have what they need, when they need it?\" That they actually don't need those things at that time, and you trying to teach the child how to be economically at that stage might feel like you are trying to force the child to forget his home brought up. Left to me alone, it's really unwise and useless to even attempt that. You, as the nephew, for whom I believe the child gives you a lot of respect, can only try to advise the child to limit its spending, but let me ask you, what will you tell the child to be doing with the money he should be saving from his or her weekly allowance, knowing that the parent has enough to foot all his bills and a child of that age has little to worry about other than eating food, playing video games, and having fun? The more the child grows up, the more he will make up his mind and limit himself to things that he will actually spend money on without anyone telling him about them, because he will realize that those things are actually unnecessary and then try to put an end to them.",

After all, you said it all: one of the best lessons to teach a child is how to save, so that when they grow up, it will help them manage their financial life more effectively. The OP is just seeking people's opinions here, and probably he will act based on the advice he gets from the random comments he gets on this topic.2About that, and like I said above, OP will act based on the opinion he chooses here, and you are not wrong in advising that he should start by consulting the child's parents first. I completely agree with that opinion of yours. @OP, since he's not your child, if you try to take my first advice without consulting his parents, if they get to find out, they may really not be happy with you, if not for anything, but for not letting them know first.3You are absolutely correct 💯, mate. The Bible says, \"Train up a child in a way that when they are old they will not depart from the part you have taught them.\" So, if they learn good lessons in their childhood, when they grow up, they will make use of those lessons and probably excel with them if it's so beneficial.",
