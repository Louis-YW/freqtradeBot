So in my opinion there is no need for Bitcointalk to create a special panel related to online casino problems, because this forum is not intended for that, this is a forum that accommodates crypto users to be able to discuss, not to solve problems related to casinos, for problems like that should be resolved privately or discussed with other members.",

Theymos wouldn't have to bother himself with those complaints not related to the forum. The biases will bring more chaos as users will have to make known private and sensitive information to the panel. The problem this complaint panel brings outweighs the benefit in the end. There is Askgambler to go for it, Askgambler has handled cases of whether it is resolved or not. It's on their hands.",

Casinos won't really feel the need to respond to those accusations anyway especially if the amount is something trivial to them, and can be completed once the user of their platform becomes compliant to whatever they're asking. I don't think it's also necessary to have a panel for this kind of thing. The boards are doing what they need to do just fine IMO, and it's up to both the parties on how they would resolve those cases using the board already present in this forum.",

A tip is also required in case the complainant is willing to use the forum service.99% of all gambling complaints are just users whining about getting caught gambling out of an illegal country or breaking the TOS and not getting their account back. I would wager that only very rarely does anyone here have an actual complaint which has reason and legitimacy. But even during those rare times, those should not be complaints but rather scam accusations. And we have a forum for scam accusations. So everything is quite adequate.This is not a forum of lawyers who can give actual legal advice on who is right or wrong and what to do. And I think solving cases in the gambling world, which is filled with people in regret and shame and blind hate, will not be of any use. In fact it seems like a waste of time and resources.",

I was quite active there, and it's not. It's one sided, the crew mostly supports the forum user, and #allcasinosarescam is written all over it. Here and there you would find someone who would think of the operator, but all in all it's not the best board for resolving complains. Quote from: Wapfika on June 30, 2023, 05:32:52 PMI read mix opinion about my suggestion but most of this suggestion is prolly based on the title itself without understanding the whole point of this suggestion.It's in the gambling sub so you'll have tons of people coming to fulfill their comment quotas for the day  Regarding your idea, I agree that we would need a better process, but to have a successful scam accusation case being solved, the setup would need the following:#1. A Casino Representative. If there's no representative on the forum, you will not get them to reply to anyone. I'm telling this because operators, in general, hate forums since in 90% of them users discuss bonus abusing mechanics. So if you don't have a forum representative, you'll not reach the casino department, especially if they know that they are right. They will not even enter the conversation. #2. A Casino Affiliate. Someone who is in touch with the casino and actively promotes their offers on their site and on their forum, just as another touching point between the forum and the casino.Â  #3. Someone who understands how players cheat. This is crucial, because if no one knows how bonus abusers breath, everyone will hold the forum users side, not thinking of the operator at all. #4.Someone who understands how operators cheat. Similar to above, you would need someone to point out flaws and methods scam casinos use. Only then could you effectively communicate and solve this case, but the issue that arises after that is:a.) Forum User Profiles are dispensable. If a user that abused the casino comes with a scam accusation, after losing that battle, that user is not punished in any significant way. You will not see someone with an established profile to come and claim it, it's mostly smaller to medium accounts. b.) Casinos don't care if they are listed as scam on 1 forum. Now the other side of the coin, what if the user is right and the casino is wrong? Well, in general, nothing will happen, people will still go to that casino and gamble there if the marketing is strong enough. One single scam accusation, or even 5 of them on 1 forum will not make a dent. Â So, in general, I do agree with you, we would need a better scam accusation process, but I have no idea how to make it work.",

Even lets say that having that complaint panel but still it wont really be that sufficient for it to be taken on legal means or simply we could really be just be ending up on neither giving their forum account some negative trust but this wont really be solving a thing so its just pretty useless. If the said complainant would really be likely on doing that legal action then its impossible that he wont really be able to know on where he should go. Its true that this forum doesnt moderate scam therefore it is really just that understandable that it wont really be making up some changes just for these situations.",
