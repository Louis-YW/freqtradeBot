  "content": "I recently browse this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5424403.0 about wallet.dat recovery service. I remember I have my old Bitcoin wallet.dat file save on my google drive before, that I already lost the password. I’m not sure exactly what’s the exact amount in there but it contains my faucet savings that I collected last 2014 to 2015. I just want to know if there’s a way to check what’s the wallet address for that file? I want to check the total balance on the blockchain to know whether this wallet is worthy for a recovery or not. I used a strong password before that stored on a notepad saved on my desktop. Sadly my computer got corrupted that wipe out all my keys and password to all my wallet. I became over confident that my computer will be remained unharmed due to my AV and cautious usage. Physical back up is really a must.FYI: I’m not good on coding, Please explain in layman terms in case there’s a way. Thanks",

To do so, open your wallet, click on \"Window\" button at top of the window and select \"Receiving addresses\".You can also go to \"console\" and use the following command. Code:listreceivedbyaddress 0 trueNote that if you have ever made any transaction from the wallet, it's possible that your fund is on your change addresses.",

There is also other guides that I couldn't remember but what I remember is that it uses a hex editor or viewer to find the line that includes your addresses.",

I want to check the total balance on the blockchain to know whether this wallet is worthy for a recovery or not. I used a strong password before that stored on a notepad saved on my desktop.Just load it to a fresh Bitcoin Core install and let it sync, it will check for the balance even if the wallet is password protected.I'd recommend v24.0 (github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v24.0) for this since loading the wallet is as easy as using the menu \"File->Restore Wallet...\".",

      "body": "Thanks guys for all the suggestions. I will lock this for now since I’m still waiting for my Desktop to be repaired by the service center. I will try all the suggestion above  especially the Bitcoin core since I’m more familiar on it and it doesn’t have any code required to check my balance. I will come back and unlock again this topic once I finally try all to give a feedback.Thanks everybody!",
