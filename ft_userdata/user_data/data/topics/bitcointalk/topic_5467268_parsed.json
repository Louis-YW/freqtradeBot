  "content": "For Bitcoin, multi-signature technology has undergone extensive testing and is supported by various software. Using electrum software, and both ledger and trezor hardware wallets, (or more different brand hardware wallets, like bitbox, keepkey), you can generate a multisig wallet, 2-of-2, or 3-of-5,...   Each transaction needs all signatures of different brand hardware wallets.  This is a good way to prevent individual wallet companies from doing evil. This is very very safe, and is a true decentralized solution.        However, Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum's multi-signature is based on smart contracts, and there have been instances of smart contract vulnerabilities where hackers have stolen tens of millions of dollars. If Genosis safe (Maybe the only software, which supports the Ethereum's multi-signature) leaves a backdoor in the contract or is successfully hacked, then the clients all die. That is, it has a single point of failure, unlike Bitcoin's multiple signatures.Moreover, there is no evidence that Genosis safe is much more reputable than Ledger and trezor. The multi-signature of Genosis safe software, then, does not provide any more security than a single hardware wallet, such as ledger or trezor!        Another solution is that: Using trezor hardware wallet (the mnemonic word is generated myself by python, then the trezor company will never know it. This prevents a random number seed backdoor for setting mnemonics), and a third-party software in an offline environment, which provides a double-layer security protection(For BTC, the trezor never be connected to network, and the only way to reveal the mnemonic is through the two-dimensional code of trezor's signature displayed by electrum's software). However, I cannot fine a proper software, that support the trezor's signature in offline environment.        So maybe the best choice for me is: Generate a mnemonic phrase through programming by myself, input it offline into a Trezor wallet, and use the Metamask software to read the Ethereum address offline. After that, store USDC and DAI, and use the wallet only once.        Final question: Why do I want to store USDC, DAI, USDT? Everyone knows that the price of bitcoin has a cycle, when the price is too high, sell it for USDC and DAI, wait for the price to come down (about 1-1.5 years), and then buy back Bitcoin. A better solution would be to sell the bitcoins and exchange them for dollars or euros, or some other local currency. In my country,  cryptocurrency trading is not legal, it is easy to receive illegal  money on Binance, and bank cards will be frozen.",

What if they themselves do evil? At least two independent well-known companies must jointly guarantee, that is safe enough. For example, Bitcoin's multi-signature, as well as airgapped wallet + trezor. I haven't found a suitable wallet that supports Trezor in an offline environment.",

In China, there are no legally operating exchanges, and converting to Chinese yuan may involve the risk of receiving illicit funds. It might be better to hold USDT, as it avoids potential involvement with illicit funds.",

The various incidents in this market are not really new (hackers, CEX bankruptcy, etc.) but it is not a worrying error compared to the whole, imagine billions of hacks $ with a market worth trillions of dollars. So for me, even if I keep USDT on any network, I am quite assured, perhaps if an incident occurs, it is still a mistake from personal management.",
