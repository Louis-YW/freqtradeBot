Stopping to count your losses may not be so bad even though it can get depressing. Counting your losses is different from chasing your losses. I will even advice you count your losses even more often than annually or twice in a year. If you count your losses often like every month, and know how much you have lost to gambling, you can call yourself back to discipline not to spend so much to gamble the next month if you are the type that gambles without a fixed amount of money set aside for gambling particularly. Count your losses to keep track of it, but do not chase your losses after counting. If you try to chase losses, you will most likely end up loosing more.",

      "body": "Alternatively, don't count profit or losses. And practise budgeting like any responsible adult Set aside a fixed amount for a year of gambling (I would do it per season). Consider it money spent on entertainment, an upfront season ticket for months of enjoyment. When the funds run out, you're done until the next season. End of season and you have funds? You made unexpected money, treat yourself!Personally, this was how I started out. I'm much more casual now and in addition to a \"season\" fund which starts/ends with European club football, I also have a monthly budget or so. If you can budget for entertainment, you can do it for gambling.Need more money to buy a tricycle or house? Set a budget for that.",

I get sad, or angry when I lose a bet, but that's about it, I get over it within the hour and move on because it was never guaranteed in the first place. I knew the risk.There's no point thinking about what you could have used the money for because all the money you used for gamble didn't come to you at once and you didn't spend them all at once.  So even if you had not gambled away the money, you would have still used it for something else.",

Regrets aren't good but it will give you lessons especially on gambling. As you count those figures and you didn't ever had a good experience on it that will really hit some nerves of regrets and I think is not good for our mental health. Better let it go and just move on but take the lessons, it's really takes a long time before we realized this and that's normal, you'll never know that in the present because you'll never thought any regrets but just expectations that you might won over your bets.",

The same thing goes for the amount of money you spend on unnecessary things. Once you've seen all the amount of money you used and you lose, you'll start thinking about the meaningful or useful things you could've bought with that money. Although, it can make you realize to start spending less on gambling, I still never thought of calculating it. Because I think it will be heavy on your feelings, since you'll feel a lot of regret and guilt for spending that much amount on gambling alone.",

Evaluating your activities, especially the financial aspect is very important. It will help show you if you are spending too much, small or moderately. At least it was from your yearly evaluation that were able to know that what you have lost on gambling will be enough to build a house and put in place an investment. It might be very annoying and depressing but it should be a time to replan and cut your budget on gambling. Auditing your financial operations gives you the uncommon privilege of identifying what to do to get the best out of gambling and your life. I will suggest you have a budget on how to use your income. You need to build a house and get that tricycle and gambling shouldn't be a stumbling block because you can always control your gambling expenses. For me counting your losses or wins is advisable if you have the time and ability.",

But it might not work for everyone, because I remember seeing a casino player on youtube who uploads their games do such a calculation on how much they have lost over a year and still gambles the same. Obviously they earn from youtube itself and the affiliate commissions, but its a difficult life to lead with an addiction growing inside.Most gamblers who end up getting wasted are those who cannot budget their playing money.

If you feel regretful for not having purchased a tricycle, because you used that money to gamble and lost, it means you should have prioritized that first or at least decreased the amount of money you were using to gamble. The main goal of a gambler should be to feel satisfied after the betting session and detached from any sums of lost money. However, if that is something disturbing the gambler due to still being attached to the lost money, he has to review his habits, reconfiguring them to best fulfills his needs and welfare.",
