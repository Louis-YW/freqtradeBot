According to whois, the domain was registered on 2022-08-28[1].3. I checked Twitter page[2] and found out the interaction/comment doesn't look natural[3], where the reply either say \"Done\" or tagging other people.Sorry OP, but i have doubt about your service credibility.[1] https://who.is/whois/swape.io[2] https://twitter.com/swapeio[3] https://twitter.com/swapeio/status/1566157057736069120#m",

We don't expect high amounts through our exchange, but now that you've mentioned this, it might also be useful for trust if we set this. We'll look into that!2) Correct, we are completely new to the market.3) We hosted some giveaways at Crypto Twitter accounts, we tried to come into the spotlight through this, only in hindsight a lot of it seems to be bots.",

How do you intend to send clean BTC or other tokens?Since you're offering token SWAP, any proof of funds? Where can we see your liquidity?",

Someone sends you 1 Bitcoin, you send it to Binance, and exchange it there for whatever altcoin the user wants? Even if I ignore the fact that nobody should trust a website that was created just 2 weeks ago, how do you think Binance is going to handle non-KYC funds? Binance will seize your account, after which your \"non KYC\" service will turn into an exit scam.If you use centralized exchanges, you're not a mixer. They log everything.No honest exchange would claim there's no transaction limit. There's always a limit.I checked BestChange, and you'd end up on the lower end with the most expensive exchanges. Your site claims to be the \"Cheapest crypto to crypto exchange\" (in very large font). That's a lie. If you want people to trust you, you should never lie.I'm curious: why does your Trustpilot link go to the Dutch version, while your only review comes from someone who speaks Dutch? Did you write that by yourself?",

Now you claim to be the \"Fastest crypto to crypto exchange\". I haven't tried it, but if you're using third party services, I doubt you're the fastest. I've seen an instant exchange accept a zero-fee deposit and instantly send the exchanged coins. I believe your current claim is most likely another lie.Maybe add some humor instead: \"Newest crypto to crypto exchange\" Can you share which country you're in? Depending on the country (and that's assuming your intentions are good), and if you indeed use several exchange accounts with your own KYC data, you could get so many legal problems from doing this.",

IIRC, unlimited transactions on Binance can only be made by corporate accounts, not personal accounts. This raises concerns at some point.In addition, there are some exchanges that suspend accounts that have KYC for security reasons (of course) such as sudden high transactions, and they revoke your KYC status as if they no longer trust the identity documents you submitted previously.",

Many instant exchanges that claim to not require KYC verification might be telling a partial truth in the sense that they don't need that verification themselves. But if you deposit coins to their wallet to make a swap, you can be asked to undergo KYC. They justify this by saying, it's not our fault, it's our partner exchanges that are asking for your KYC info. To the end user it doesn't really matter. I have my doubts about OPs claims they are making these swaps through their own KYC-verified accounts. That means it's their name connected to the coins being deposited. If I deposit stolen or hacked crypto, it's not me who did it, it's them. I don't see this working successfully for them or their users.",
