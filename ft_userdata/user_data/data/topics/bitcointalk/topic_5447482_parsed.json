  "content": "Hi we are thinking on starting a fundraise to increase our current bankroll we have $500k but we know our site is going to get huge fast and we want to have a bigger bankroll also we have a list of high rollers $1.5M+ and a list of 10K users who are waiting for the site to get out.The site is 100% ready (we are just finishing some details with the marketing material) and we have about 500 players without a single ad and official announcement.This month the site made $28k profit in just pure random players who got to the site.We want to raise at least $400k, you can go to the site now and create an account and test everything to see the site is 100% operationalLet me know what you think and what kind of % would you be interested",
