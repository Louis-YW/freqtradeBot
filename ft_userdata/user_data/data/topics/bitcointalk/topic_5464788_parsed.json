We all know that Virology is a very important discipline to educate us about the viruses and the infections we get from them. I know that viruses aren't living cells themselves, but we can't ignore the fact that they have reproduce inside our cells when they get access to it. I don't know that what they want to prove to us, but it's really wrong to make a discipline as bogus only because the scientists can't show the presence of viruses. I think they will understand that there will be technology that would help those scientists to show the actual viruses, and they will then have to change their mindset regrading this discipline.",

      "body": "Virology is a well-established branch of microbiology that studies biological viruses, their structure, classification, evolution, infection, immunity, diseases, and applications. It covers all aspects of the virus from plants, animals, bacteria, and humans.Virologists are medical doctors/scientists who specialize in diagnosing, managing, and preventing viral infections. Virology is a vital science that helps us understand and combat various viral diseases such as COVID-19, AIDS, hepatitis, influenza, and many more.Also, viruses are not living cells themselves, but they are not inert either. They are submicroscopic particles of genetic material (DNA or RNA) enclosed in a protein coat. They can only replicate inside living cells by hijacking their machinery. They can also mutate and evolve in response to environmental changes. Viruses can be detected and visualized by various methods such as electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serology, and sequencing.Therefore, I think it is clear that virology is a legitimate and important science that deals with real and diverse viruses.",
