  "content": "Total computational power of the bitcoin blockchain is expressed in terms of the number of hashes generated by all the nodes. calculate for a second .At this time it is about 220 million tera-hashes per second. One tera hash = 1,000,000,000,000 hashes. 51% of the total computational power means, single mining node (group, person ) should be able to generate more than 110 million tera-hashes per second. which means this node can mine the blocks faster than all the others in the network together — so it has a higher chance of producing the longest blockchain.If the node of the 51% of the total cpu power decides to cheat, it can change the value of the bitcoin reward (from 6.25 to 100 bitcoins) and add them to his account? The value of the bitcoin reward and how it changes with time is defined in the BTC mining software. Each miner have a copy of this. The attacker can change it's copy to create more bitcoins for the block reward and possibly add that to the blockchain. But, once that block is sent to other nodes of the network — the miners who works with the legit software — and who follow the right rules, will reject that block. then the blockchain behind those nodes are not updated with this block. this will result in a fork.When there is a fork, all the nodes in each branch of the fork is curious to know whether they are in the longest branch. Since the bad guy has control over the CPU power,it can generate more blocks and possibly own the longest blockchain.BTCMiners can find that there is another branch of the blockchain, which is longer than what they are working on by reviewing the block height property of the blocks they receive. block height is the how many blocks preceding a particular block on the chain — and the value of the block height is included in the block header. Once a mining node receives the block, node will validate it and if it conforms to the accepted rules of the the bitcoin network, then it will look at the block height. If the block height is higher than the latest block which mined at this node, then there is another branch of the blockchain which is longer than the one known to it. So it can disagree back in the blockchain and update its own copy by requesting the latest from its peers. make sure to remember this complete process will only happen, if the the block it receives is valid.In case of the 51% attack, since the block generated by the scammers is invalid (in this case), even though its blockchain is longer, the other legit miners in the bitcoin network will not shift to it. This will make the attacker solo in its own branch. He or she can accumulate more bitcoins, but no one outside it's branch will accept those.But, there are some other things an attacker can do if it owns 51% of the total CPU power. Double spending is an example . For example I buy something for 10 bitcoin — and post the transaction to the bitcoin network. The scammer can mine a block with that transaction, and updates the blockchain. Now after the merchant confirms that transaction, the scammer can mine that block again with a new transaction with the same inputs, but outputs the amount to the buyer’s bitcoin account. Now that block is a valid block, and the attacker can repeat this on top of that to make it the longest blockchain, with its 51% in computational power.Also, the scammer can block some transactions being added to the blockchain. attacker can have it's own preferences and keeps-on mining the blocks with the set of transactions it wants. This will defer certain transactions — even though they happened quite earlier in time. Satoshi Nakamoto has suggested a way here to prevent such situation , but he himself concludes that there will not be a need to do such, where a miners want to explicitly drop some transactions.By this moment , nearly all the miners are mining through pools, very few miners solo. A mining pool lets miners contribute their cpu power — and paid to each miner based on the hash rate they contribute. The following link shows the percentage hash rate generated by popular mining pools at the time of this writing.https://www.blockchain.com/charts/pools",

Now that block is a valid block, and the attacker can repeat this on top of that to make it the longest blockchain, with its 51% in computational power.he cant change who YOU have signed YOUR transaction destination of funds to go to..instead when he goes back to edit the confirmed block. he can just remove the transaction and make it unspent.. (unconfirmed) once he catches up and makes his chain the re-organised default chain that includes the block without your 10btc transaction.. then YOU can spend your coin again..there is no advantage to him.. so he wont do that. he would probably want to re-exclude one of his transactions he already spent. thus he could double spend that and gain/profit from his effort.however. the cost to mine so much hash just to edit out a transaction.. that transaction better be of large volume to be worthy of the effortQuote from: Cryptornd on June 25, 2022, 09:01:09 AMAlso, the scammer can block some transactions being added to the blockchain. attacker can have it's own preferences and keeps-on mining the blocks with the set of transactions it wants.

Having a million ASICs costs a lot of money not to mention the electricity and cooling and other costs to run these to mine all those blocks. In other words the cost of the attack becomes significantly larger than the profit made from the attack.",
