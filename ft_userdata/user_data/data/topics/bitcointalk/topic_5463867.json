      "body": "Did you report them to moderator?I just checked and it seems like the main purpose of that account creation was to spread spam referral links across the forum. Next time Op, after creating your scam reputation thread to notify forum members about the potential risk of clicking any link provided by a certain account you should also report all the posts to moderator and that lead to the deletion of all the posts and possibly the account could also be banned for spamming the forum with referral links.Nice catch btw.",

The winning people are chosen unfairly (they could be from the platform team) They help their pyramid and Ponzi scheme to grow. Unfortunately, many of the people who lose their money in these obvious schemes are beginners who have no previous experience and knowledge of this most common thing.",
