It's suboptimal, but it's not prohibited. It will be interesting to watch what happens when first of these will get a hack or something, but on the other hand, don't we already have a long history of exchange hacks and people keeping their coins at exchanges? So.. let's just stay real, OK?",

He reminded them that the approval of these eleven spot ETFs is a win for centralisation which is a clear deviation from how Bitcoin was designed to function. This is an indication that they might have some hidden agenda behind this approval. After the fall of FTX, many people understood the importance of keeping your keys which led to massive transfer of funds to to non-custodial wallets. Nobody can stop these centralized investors from putting money into the Bitcoin space, so we just have to wait to see the long-run outcome of all the hype surrounding the ETF. But we will not stop announcing that not your keys, not your coins, however, people are free to choose between freedom and bondage.",

Interestingly this didn't concern you.* ETFs will keep a huge amount of bitcoins under centralized storage, while some companies will buy IOUs for getting richer. Should I care about them, as long as I can buy actual Bitcoin and keep in my own wallet?!!",

If you want a decentralized currency that is peer-to-peer then how is that good for Bitcoin. It only servers to give banks more control of peoples money.If you look at Bitcoin as an investment, which is what the banks want, then an increase in price will benefit Bitcoin holders.  Who holds the largest percentage of Bitcoin? Large institutions and wealthy individuals? A run up in price will make the rich richer and our greed will give them complete control of the one thing that could have transferred the wealth back to the people who create it.The issue here is that individuals work and large institutions(banks) control the representation of that work(money).  The people who work should be paid with a currency that is controlled by them and can not be inflated(stolen/taxed) without their permission.Don't lose sight of what Bitcoin was meant to do!!!!!",

As everyone understands here, Bitcoin is a public ledger.  Privacy is not one of it's core tenants. As a matter of fact, one of the arguments we use to defend Bitcoin as a tool for criminals is that all transactions are recorded on a public ledger so it would be stupid for criminals to use it to commit a crime.Bitcoin was created to be a currency that is decentralized and peer to peer with limited supply.  It is decentralized so that no one organization can create more of it.  In order for it to be decentralized it must be peer-to-peer.Not one application created for bitcoin except Core is truly peer-to-peer.  In order for a transaction to be truly peer-to-peer both parties must be using their own node. If they are not then a third party node is in use and a third party is involved in the transaction. Satoshi made this very clear. That is why the node was designed to work on a standard PC.ETFs are the ultimate third party.  Banks will custody it, KYC you and hypothecate Bitcoin just like they hypothecate other currencies.",

As a small investor, you won't be able to buy Bitcoin Spot ETF shares directly and will also have to use middleman companies. It increases the risk.If people felt safe with custodial wallets, centralized exchanges, they can trust Bitcoin Spot ETFs even it's risky. There are many options and they are responsible for picking risky ones.In another view, Bitcoin Spot ETFs will have to use money from investors to buy bitcoins before they can issue their Bitcoin Spot ETF shares. The point is new capital, that is big, will appear in Bitcoin market. Those companies can buy bitcoin from OTC market or Spot market but soon they will have to buy it directly on Spot market because available bitcoin on OTC market are not enough for their big capital and demand.",
