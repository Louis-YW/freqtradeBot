If you want to real staking, then why wouldn't you just run your own node then?Because i am sure that you already know that what exchanges are doing isn't real staking. Real staking involves running a node and validating transactions. And in those as well, many real staking smart contracts will lock up your tokens for a certain period of time. But least you are participating to something meaningful.",

Binance don't issue private keys so it's a known thing that everyone has to trust them with their money. The other side of staking is for those wallets where they issue PKs and then you're free to unstake at your will. That's how it goes with staking and all of them have APRs/APYs.",

Huge interest rates are creating surplus of tokens in the market, devaluing the currencies' prices really fast.And even if developers address all these points, they will be still worthless if there isn't real demand for the token. That is the most important aspect developers and investors should be worried about.",

The CEO of Binance is a wise man and I think many other crypto CEO should learn from him. He has a strategy that had been working for him since the last hack attempt on the company. Binance was able to program there staking in a way that is suitable for every investors no matter how much you are staking or the kind of coins or tokens you are staking. Staking is another way to earn bonus when you are not using your coin for anything and it can be very rewarding if the fund is huge. I had made some staking on Binance and I had make some few dollars from it since the crypto market is still dipping.",

FUN is available on binance, huobi,free bitcoin. The last one is amazing collaboration we might have seen until now. Along with the taking the platform is capable of giving away other premium features.The point of this, they are actually very much profitable when they stake the coins. It creates good hodling position in the market. Its more or less shorting the market with supply and thus creating huge demand for the coin. This makes it grow actually over the period of time and thus everyone is able to make the profits out of it. It's more or less savings plan with hypedÂ  rates",

From your argument now it is clear you do not know that those short durations on staking is never to the advantage of those who are staking but for the exchanges that do it.Binance does not charge any stake/restake commissions. In addition, in the case of longer staking (60, 90, 120 days), it usually offers a higher APR than you can get by staking in your own wallet or taking advantage of the opportunities offered by a given project. So in the case of staking, they rather pay extra than earn on it. Such a solution is therefore more profitable and more convenient for the user, and Binance probably pays for these costs thanks to the commissions from trading it will generate thanks to users encouraged in this way. However, it is necessary to remind here about the risk of keeping funds on exchanges. Not your keys, not your coins.",

I think there is a little misconception here between native asset staking and staking on a yield farm or on an exchange or something like that. I don't think that staking a token that has native staking programmed into it will ruin it. Obviously this was all thought through when the project and the tokenomics were created. Projects like Atom, Radix, Polkadot and now also Ethereum all have a staking functionality and i think all of those projects have good fundamentals.Staking assets on a yield farm is a different story though. If the farm is offering huge APY's on your stake then it should be obvious that this can not be healthy in the long run, because those interest somehow need to be generated too.",

People who stake coins on Binance are generally ones that wanna invest considering long term profits. They tend to pick better altcoins and start 3-6 month limited staking. But on defi projects people wanna quickly make money through feeding pools or just farming money. Obviously that kind of projects are very very speculative! And may damage crypto ecosystem. I also prefer Binance to other because I think it is trustable, yet, centralized exchanges may die like FTX.",

However, Binance only acts as a platform to showcase projects and provide users with related services, such as accessing funds on behalf of the user and distributing earnings, etc. Binance does not assume liability for any losses incurred due to project on-chain contract security issues.\" Emphasis mine.With that in mind, Binance does not technically manage those 2 prerequisites. It only exists because the Binance side enforces it on their end, and does not imply it will be safe and ensure the longevity of a project or exchange. It is rather a bad thing to put a staking coin or token via an intermediary like Binance. Besides having a risk exposure on the staking platform, you adding up a risk factor with Binance itself.",

Not sure about this, maybe it was successful because the staking happen to the biggest exchange of them all? So for me it based on who is offering it, of course staking on mid-tier exchanges will be different design because they want to take advantage and make profits as well, as they usually does.So what I'm saying is that not all staking protocol are equal, maybe others have different design and became successful with it. While others might fail for some other reasons. There's no such thing as one size fits all in crypto.",
