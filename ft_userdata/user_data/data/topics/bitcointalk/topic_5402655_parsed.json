  "content": "I originally posted this the other day in \"politics and society\" but it was apparently deleted without any notice or so. I spent 7 years designing and building a system I now call BitPeople. It is described in full on https://bitpeople.org, and the source code is there as well. Very innovative solution. It seems like it would be OK to share that on this forum, that Satoshi created back in 2009 when he launched the first \"majority controlled\" computer system, using proof-of-work to prove voting rights. So, I do another try here and share it under \"Off-Topic\" instead.",

      "body": "The day you can define the Turing test as how hard it is for a computer to fool a computer that it is human, because it would be harder to fool a computer than a human, then sure.The human interpreter part is the strength. It is how Turing test is defined, fool a human.What you mean in last part, a human who participates in the event for the whole event is to be verified. If you are a human and just say \"yes I am unique\" and then go do some attack vector, you do not get verified. Getting 10000 sybil nodes (whatever it is you say you would do with them), also requires you to succeed attacks to start with. Collusion attacks give percentageColluding^2. To get 10000, assuming a population of 8 billion people, you need 0.11% of the population, 9 million people, to collude.",
