  "content": "I’m curious to know if there’s any players (fighters,footballers….) who have been caught betting on themselves or on their own team to lose or win, i know it’s not allowed for any player as a part of their contract for example Ufc fighters are strictly forbidden from betting on their own fights. And the reason is pretty obvious since the player can easily manipulate the final score of whatever he is playing or fighting.But surely in small or unknown leagues there must be some people doing it. For example a goalkeeper of small devision league in Africa where some bookmakers cover betting on the match can create an account on it, if they ask for KYC verification can easily ask his friend or family member to do it for him. And can earn much money by letting his team lose. Fighters can manipulate that even more.So i would like to know if you heard of any player been caught doing that? and if my example is right?",

Fixing games are happening all the time in regular games that aren't as massive as national level, mainly because of the lack of proper security and integrity. Then again measures are taken and are actively being employed to ensure that these doesn't happen that much. But it just can't be helped, these people will always find ways to fix games and manipulate the odds according to or against their will to earn a quick buck.

There are a few exceptions to these rules, especially when athletes find grey areas in the legislation and regulation processes. This is only valid for individual matches and sports, like boxing, MMA, or tennis[1] https://medium.com/bitcoin-news-today-gambling-news/can-a-professional-athlete-bet-on-themselves-593223b597c3[2] https://shortboxing.com/why-boxers-can-bet-on-themselves-but-not-against-themselves/[3] https://www.fightmatrix.com/2022/11/28/ufc-fighters-and-betting-can-they-bet-on-themselves/",

If a player were to bet on themselves or their team knowingly, it is sure to influence the outcome of the game, hence, it defeats the purpose to which the player plays and why the spectators bet. It is rather an improper conduct and is a crime which could derail ones career or profession, if such a one is(are) discovered.",

And the reason is pretty obvious since the player can easily manipulate the final score of whatever he is playing or fighting.You already get the point and this makes me wonder,Why are you curious then.It's really that simple for players not to bet on there own games or teams to avoid issues of manipulations. Perhaps in some underground games but some properly regulated games by a body, its just something that shouldn't be done.You'll have players doing all they could to either win or deliberately lose and that would mean, doing what is unbecoming of a good sportsmanship.For football, it's a no. At least to the best of my knowledge. You don't don't get to bet through someone else. Perhaps other sports should adopt that to ensure good sportsmanship at the games.",

In sports like football, I don't think it would be easy to manipulate the score except if some of the team members are aware or the goalkeeper is involved. Just one player might not be able to determine the outcome of a football or basketball match but one boxer or wrestler can.But I think this act of gambling on self or ones team should be highly discouraged and should be covered and restricted in the contract of this player regardless of the size or level of the club. Players betting on themselves or their team can kill the beautiful game of sports.",

The same here,some years ago a big scandal was with a couple of best teams of the soccer Premier League we have here.Some senator players as they were called because they were the ones who made a difference in winning most of the games and winning titles back then,were caught drinking cigarettes (totally forbidden for any football player),drinking alcohol (heavily not recommended) and they were caught on a hidden camera talking to each other how they used to fix games.A further investigation was made and they were all put to jail for some time and the teams were put in second and third category.Now I don't know if this happens again but I am sure that if players of a certain team want to bet on the team they play and to fix the game it is heavily possible from the smallest country to the great ones.",
