This doesn't mean that you should use any exchange on coinmarketcap though. It's just that the criteria to be listed there are not that simple, not for someone who wants to scam people and earn a quick buck anyway.",

The \"BIKA 3.0 trading system\" will be launched in May 2022, creating a new era of contract tradingAfter 3 years of polishing, BIKA exchange now ranks in the top 29 of the global exchange rankings. And cooperate with more than 30 mainstream media around the world to carry out digital asset trading business in more than 50 countries and regions.it's clear they are lying and it means you should definitely avoid it.Plus, be really careful about self-hosted android apk that are not even present in the google store, you have no clue what you're downloading at all.ps.Their twitter links to bika.cfd, also just 4 months old so impossible to have obtained this :QuoteMarch 2021: BIKA was founded in the US and obtained MSB license in the meantime.",

Old crypto exchanges have better users reviews that you can find online using search engine but you can't find such for new exchanges like this BIKA, so always stay with popular exchanges to avoid bad experiences later.",

I also wonder why you are still curious about the centralized exchange you ask if you don't want to use it?By the way, they have an alternate domain registered on the same date according to whois.Quote from: https://whois.domaintools.com/bika.top131 days oldCreated on 2022-07-02Expires on 2023-07-02Updated on 2022-07-02",

Thank you!I think, you should hear what @Charles-Tim has to say, information about BIKA exchange is minimal, there is not much information that we can take from the BIKA exchange, only some dubious information that can be seen about the BIKA exchange.For example: https://linktr.ee/bika_globalAnd if you look again on youtube, more doubtful, only two videos and 10 subscribers.Example: This is marked, the exchange is highly doubtful to use in crypto trading/investment, you should follow @Charles-Tim's advice use a reputable exchange, to prevent problems in the future, Rather than you forcing yourself to use an exchange whose reputation is not yet clear.",
