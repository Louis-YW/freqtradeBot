Or should I use my Coinbase address?You should use your own address, safely generated, and certainly not a third party. Just imagine that you actually get to hit a block and there's a problem with your payout. And you cannot prove ownership on the payout address either...So you risk losing a lot of money for... laziness?Learn how to safely generate and store an address for yourself. If you cannot do that, get yourself a hardware wallet. Better safe than sorry.",

If you could afford to buy mining hardware and perform solo mining, i strongly recommend you to buy hardware wallet or computer/laptop only to manage your Bitcoin wallet.2. Based on commit message of ckpool source code[1], it looks like they support Native/Bech32 Segwit address.[1] https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool/commits/61513a765b12947fae30535179194b1672dc82b5",

Or should I use my Coinbase address?All other advice aside, you realize that by solo mining you're basically playing the lottery right?  There's no problem for small miners to mine to NiceHash, but I would agree if you're going for a block, you'll want that fresh reward on an address you are the sole holder of the keys as the untouched reward carries a premium to most.The thing I'd like to stress to you though, is that you're playing the lottery by solo mining.  Nothing wrong with stacking sats slowly.  Depending on your hashrate, you may never see a penny from solo mining.",

Why do you still not have your wallet (or don't want to use it), for example, in electrum, although you have an address in Coinbase?

If you look only at ckpool, for example, then I can see 254 blocks which were mined by solo miners: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?q=coinbase_data_bin(~solo.ckpool).

It turns out that with such a device, like Compac F USB sticks (which costs about $300 on ebay), the probability of finding a bitcoin block is not at all ghostly. Whose reward, by the way, is 6.25 BTC. It really looks like a jackpot, and a probable one at that. If this is a goldbitcoinmine, then this method of mining should already have a bunch of followers. $300 turning into $150.000 - isn't that the dream of medieval modern alchemists? I feel like there must be some trick here that I just don't know about.",
