  "content": "Most African nations depend on Ukraine and Russia for many things. Economically these two nations supply most of the raw materials and finished products that help the economies of the continent. Africa suffered at the beginning of the invasion because most raw materials like wheat led to the high cost of bread. Academically the continent relies so much on Russia and Ukraine. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine about 26,500 Africans were studying in Ukraine and many of them became dropouts. Many students that would have studied in Russia are not going because of security and diplomatic concerns. This is denying Africans the opportunity to access quality education. Politically it is affecting the continent because it is dividing us among the Western and Eastern blocs. Some of them have criticized the war while others have been silent. Recently six African countries have scheduled to visit Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to seek peace. They are aware that this war is affecting the continent negatively and that the war should end. We know many more powerful nations have tried to end this war but failed, I am just praying that South Africa, Zambia, Senegal, the Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Egypt might find a way to end this war.",

As for the international students in Ukraine, I know from a friend who was studying in Ukraine at the time that they were given a transfer permit to universities in other countries to continue their education. The question you should ask yourself is does Africa have the influence to end a war that doesn’t concern her?",

      "body": "There is a way to end the war. It's just not up to Zelensky and Putin though but it's up to those who supported Ukraine. China offers to broker the peace deal but Ukraine is pushing. African leaders these days are leaning more toward China since Xi Jinping built roads and infrastructures in many countries. Now Africa relied upon China for the future some countries are totally abandoning the US.The commerce between Ukraine and the rest of the world AFAIK still goes on. Africa though has their own oil source. Africa is a rich continent, it can live on its own trading with China and countries within Africa.",

We'll only If the US economy is affected by the war then Africa will be affected. On the contrary, we actually do. And just like the Op mentioned the dependence on wheat, it's a fact because in 2020, there were 15 African countries which imported 50% of their wheat, while 6 imported higher(70%). Nigeria usually imports #898bn worth of durum wheat but had to reduce it to #753.59bn. Also, asides from wheat, some countries rely heavily on the country's oilseeds, fertilizers and steel.  So even if one would argue that Africa is more concerned about the lengthiness of the war simply because of what they get from them, I think majority, Africa inclusive, are concerned for the damage and chaos this war is causing.",

I hope Nigeria government will make Nigerian Universities better so that Nigerians can access quality education directly from the country. Ukraine and Russia are not only the existing countries with better education.The war is enough for some universities in other countries to give admission to affected students that are serious with their education.

The question you should ask yourself is does Africa have the influence to end a war that doesn’t concern her? just when the global economy was trying to bounce back from economy stagger due to the effect of covid_19 epidemic, the Russia's invasion of Ukraine worsened the situation by pushing up prices of commodities, because Russia is the world's largest wheat exporter along it neighbor Ukraine, these two countries make up roughly a quarter of the entire wheat commodity. Significantly, Nigeria are importer of wheat product, about 95% of Nigeria's wheat supply is imported, according to \"Nigeria  Bureau of Statistic\" the country imported N1.29trn worth of durum wheat in 2021, with all claims, Nigeria has a lot of concern in the ongoing war.According to source, Africa is pushing for peace keeping.",
