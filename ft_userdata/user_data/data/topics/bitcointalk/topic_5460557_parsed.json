  "content": "The person controlling the deadsea33 account could well have been getting away with his nefarious (and non-nefarious) activities for a long time to come had he not started a thread questioning a simple matter such as a neutral tag. That thread inadvertently brought the deadsea33 account to the attention of the wider community and it was discovered he was not the person that created the account back in 2013 and for that reason he has (it seems) given up on trying to use that account.You can view the deadsea33 merit history and decide for yourself if anything looks suspicious.Personally I do not feel the cover/excuse that will be given for the merits being awarded will be sufficient if it is based on this thread: deadsea33's \"Complete the Word Game and Get Merits\" because clearly that was set up in order to find an excusable way to send and receive merits and to present it as a defence if questions were asked about suspicious merits.The accounts that have received excessive merits and/or questionable merits from the deadsea33 account are free to post here with anything they would like to say. I have no doubt members would welcome their views and comments.Having said that, at the time of writing this post I will not say the following accounts have engaged in anything suspicious but I will return to this thread when I have time and I will update the OP more accounts if necessary and I will tag any and all accounts I feel have participated in merit abuse._Hiloveua_HatchyRbolisnaRipon9909",

I do not blame you for not looking at their post history before giving merits because we all have done the same thing (and still do from time to time) but your generosity should not be taken advantage of.

Hope you uncover more and that this kind of abuse stops because it's unfair to those who try to earn it honestly. If the former is right, I think it's weird that they only messed up this time, maybe this is a new owner or just plain stupid of that person that they got too complacent about hiding their abuse.",

I didn't want to take up the spots of other lower ranks in the later rounds. It's sad that there could be an ulterior motive behind running this game for the community. I was not surprised about the ulterior motive because he is not the only one who has them.If a member with hardly any posts worth reading and hardly anything positive to contribute to the forum starts a Get Merits thread, that is highly suspicious. When members with little to no history or contributions or newbies miraculously find themselves on that thread receiving merits then that too is highly suspicious.When the same members are repeatedly given merits seconds after the next game is posted because again they are miraculously online at the correct time, then that too is highly suspicious. Also, what makes it more fascinating is that almost none of the games were posted at the time deadsea33 announced, they were taking place later yet miraculously certain members were there posting and collecting merits.That is either too many miracles in one thread or something suspicious is definitely going on.When I originally came across the thread I noticed your name and cygan in the OP and to some degree I think that provided a cover of legitimacy to deadsea33 to carry out nefarious activities including merit abuse. That was also part of his ulterior motive. When members stumble across those boards and notice names of well known and/or respected members in the OP as reference points then it goes a long way to removing the element of doubt.There was absolutely an ulterior motive therefore I was not surprised deadsea33 was caught out and as usual it is the arrogance that some members of this forum display that brings them down. Had he simply not reacted to the neutral tag placed by hugeblack and had he not started a thread to complain then he would not have had his account analysed.",

That account simply stands out the most because not only has the _Hiloveua_ account already received merits on 24 different occasions to the total of 50 merits, deadsea33 posted that he owes 28 merits to the _Hiloveua_ account which will be given on 29th July 2023.

When I have time I will take a detailed look in that ITExpert account to see what can be discovered, thank you for mentioning it.I will be busy over the next few days therefore cannot give the investigation the time it deserves and for that reason prefer to not tag accounts periodically but I will tag ALL the accounts associated with the deadsea33 merit abuse at the same time, after I collate evidence.",

      "body": "Today, while checking my notifications, I noticed that I have been mentioned in the investigation of @deadsea33. It is true that I earned a lot of merits from his game, which might be considered merit abuse. However, I want to clarify that I have no connection with @deadsea33, neither as an alt account nor a merit farm. it's my first time hearing such word here on the forum.Like any other user, I came across his game in late June and decided to join for fun, as it would be my first game since joining the forum in April.I started playing from round 2 And as you can see,  I attempted his game multiple times during the second and third rounds  but didn't answer correctly. From round 4 to round 7, I earned a few merits and then stopped playing due to other commitments. I returned to the game in round 12 when the pattern changed and it became more difficult, focusing on the names of legendary members. As a new member to the forum, I found it challenging to answer because I wasn't familiar with most legendary members. This made me less interested, and I only played when I had the chance.Another aspect that discouraged me from playing his game was that he never stuck to his schedule. Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=900041Somehow, whenever I check this page, the rounds are already completed and I see the schedule for the next round.Then, when I visit the page the next day, the rounds are completed once again.However, this time, I have carefully observed the time of the post and it has already been over 5 hours, yet the round has not started yet.It's time for me to sleep and I am sure that when I return tomorrow, the rounds will be completed once again  GrinI guess I am unlucky to take part in this game.Report to moderatorLike other members, I waited for hours to get a notification about his game, but I never received any. When I returned after some time, I saw that they had already completed more rounds, so I eventually stopped playing and left the game.Regarding his suspicious activities, I also noticed that an account that had been inactive for a long time suddenly became active, distributing merits, and deleting some posts. This raised suspicions. After @hugeblack tagged him he created a post explaining why he became active after a long time.QuoteI registered in this forum in 4/25/2013 . I was regularly active in this forum till 2018. After that suddenly due to family and personal problems I could not active in the forum like before.Then after becoming active once in 1/3/2021, I thought I will be active regularly from now on, so I changed the password once. My luck was bad then, again I had to fight for my family. Then I thought that after becoming active, I will start from zero. Moreover, many of my posts were of poor quality. So I deleted almost all my posts.Also, a forum member can delete his own post, this is not an anti-forum act. So anyone can do this.I forgot the password so i 6/17/2023 date reset the password through email. Then I use new email and strong password to strengthen security.I don't see anything wrong in doing this for the security of my account. Hope you understand.And Starting a word game for all forum members especially new members to gain knowledge and share good things Many members dropped messages for him to prove ownership of the account,but he never returned to that thread to address their suspicions. In my opinion, he either bought his account from an old member or created the game to gain enough activity quickly and rank up to a full member since he already had enough merits but lacked activity.And to add up, during his game, he didn't post on other threads or topics and then, he immediately applied for a signature campaign just a few days after finishing his game and ranking up, which raises more questions.I want to plead my innocence, as I had nothing to do with @deadsea33 and was merely fortunate to have won some merits from his game, just like other members did. If you check my merit history, you'll see that I've earned more merits since leaving his game. merits from his game only gave me a boost. I hope this matter is thoroughly investigated to prove my innocence. Thank you all for listening to me.Please feel free to mention me if you have any questions, and I'll be happy to answer.",

For some it is life-changing to earn more in a month here than in their jobs therefore they mismanage the situation.If they have farmed accounts which are not used for merit abuse, not used for revenge feedback, not used for revenge trust inclusion/exclusion and not used for DT manipulation and they post enough to meet quota for their campaigns then that is different from using the Reputation board trying to remove a neutral tag and getting noticed. If the signature campaign was of such significance they would have refrained from involving themselves in anything beyond their signature campaign quota.In many cases at least signature campaign participants have contributed positively in some capacity to this wonderful forum of ours but when the greed (as you put it) takes over they lower the bar with low quality participation via their posts and that too can be seen.Quote from: DaveF on July 22, 2023, 12:06:38 PMUnless they ban sig campaigns all that can be done is fight against it as best we can.Thankfully some members are trying to use the Reputation board to post about these types of things, there is no other option.",

That account simply stands out the most because not only has the _Hiloveua_ account already received merits on 24 different occasions to the total of 50 merits, deadsea33 posted that he owes 28 merits to the _Hiloveua_ account which will be given on 29th July 2023. The post is here.Another interesting point is that \"_Hiloveua_\" never once offered a wrong answer in the \"Complete the Word Game\" , despite the fact that his answers were often given just a few minutes after starting a new round. Even if he found some effective way to recognize words (I do not know if there are online dictionaries that can assist with these types of games), statistically speaking, he should have offered at least one incorrect word matching the given pattern. Unless, of course, he knew all the correct answers in advance, and the entire game was merely a farce for merit abuse.",
