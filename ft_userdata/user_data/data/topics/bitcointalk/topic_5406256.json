If it's just cash then I can imagine them.finding ways to blend in more (like by continuously depositing and withdrawing smaller amounts or by not having much income paid there - wealthy people that stay wealthy tend to earn more than they spend anyway).",

NO That's ofcourse a disadvantage of having a system which is not governed by a central body, i do think that you do understand, other than spreading correct, informative knowledge none of us holds any power over the whole system and therefore we need to try and look at the positive outcomes that they might bring, increase in price, more trading opportunities, howsoever temporary.",

There are always other ways to keep Bitcoin and they could do that by spending just a little amount of money to buy a known wallet with better security. They're using Bitcoin which is not their countries currency. We must not forget that fact. So whales buying on El Salvador might do them better if the demand will increase again.",

I don't really think so. In total currently it just has 700 Bitcoins which in USD translates to just 14 Million USD which is no where near to even the 50th richest man of US forget about the whole nation. So trust me no country so far is scared of the monopoly they could make because they really won't be able to make one very soon and moment there is an opportunity to make one, US and China would immediately jump into it.",

A legal and tax paying monopolist wouldn't bother whether the transactions are public or not. But an illegal monopolist will be definitely worried because their data is becoming public. A tax evader will be worried. A criminal will surely be worried. A black market dealer will be worried. So it entirely depends on the type of monopolist. If you stand at the right side of the law, you shouldn't be worried at all.",

Sure be ready for it, there is nothing wrong with being ready for anything, but being worried and getting ready are not the same things. I personally would believe that El Salvador and monopoly would not be in the same sentence right now, it is not there at all, not ready for it.",

This is considered the lowest price they can afford and this purchase is very small compared to the previous ones. Perhaps they have run out of funds to invest in bitcoin and the world economic situation is unstable they are hoarding money to deal with upcoming difficulties rather than buying bitcoin at this point.The bear market is not expected to end anytime soon, so I hope they have a long-term holding plan and strategy in place.",

The best they can attain is having a stable economy which is actually what Bukele is looking at.El Salvador would only be richer than US if they bought the 1,770 btc when two pizzas was bought with 10,000 btc, lol.I didn't quite understand op's idea of monopolising btc is El Salvador.  Maybe I'll wait for a clearer explanation.",

El Salvador's current BTC accumulation doesn't make them richer than China and the US if the BTC price surges to $100k.  It might give them more funds to development but labeling them the richest country will be an overstatement.  Besides it isn't the monetary fund that makes a country the richest but the overall valuation of the country from infrastructure, developments, reserve funds etc.  So I think to be able to beat China and the US in terms of financial funds, they should put way more money into BTC.Quote from: stompix on July 14, 2022, 10:25:14 PMIf Salvador would buy all coins available , 19 million of them, at 20k each they would first need about 400 billion to do so, their whole GDP is 24 billion so they would need 16 years of spending every single penny for coins.Now, if all those coins could raise to $100,000, their whole value would be 1.9 trillion, which is about 9% of US annual GDP.

(including 1 yo children) would need to have at least ~$19 million worth of assets.LE:Going further on this (why do I even do this, I don't have a clue)  At $100k per Bitcoin, each Salvadorian would need to hold 190 Bitcoins but since there are only 21 million coins each can't get more than 3.5....Impossible!",

However, I agree that President Nayib Bukele is sometimes too hurry to buy Bitcoin. He actually has much time to buy at the lower rates during the bearish season. He may be too confident that BTC price really flies to $100k someday, so he doesn't really care about BTC price in the near future.*They probably have experts at reading charts.
