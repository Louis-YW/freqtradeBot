  "content": "According to the Whitepaper, FireDAO is a social DAO based on Soulbound accounts and DID system. DAO is well known to everyone and by definition, FireDAO intends to create a social DAO that uses Soulbound Tokens(Soulbound accounts more in-depth) and DID system to realize a fully-decentralized organization. Besides, fire is a very important symbol here. What does fire stand for in your culture ? Over here, fire symbolizes power and hope. Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks.",

They believe that fire can not only bring light and heat to human beings, but more importantly, fire is the god of light, happiness, cleanliness, and love, and has the power to dispel darkness and all ghosts and evils.The world is full of praise for fire. I don't know about this project, almost nothing. But the name is still good. The DID identity protocol of web3 is considered by many people as the asset confirmation of data on the chain. I am also optimistic about the NFT sector.",
