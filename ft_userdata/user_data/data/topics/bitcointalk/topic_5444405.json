I also hope they sell that bitcoin and the market gets dumped, that's awesome.

It would be a good security practice for government officials to do the latter, because I am sure there should be some black hat hackers abroad trying to social engineer some agent to stole at least a percentage of that pile of money. The chances of a rogue agent also exist, but slim.",

Hopefully they aren’t but you never know when it comes to the government. Common sense would say to wait two more years but…What are their plans?Sell all those bitcoins at once or sell them gradually on the market, maybe if they do it gradually people will feel less fearful about that. However think of it as risk and chance.Risk is for people who are over leveraging at the moment or in latest past and they still let their leveraged positions open. They are risk takers and I am sure they would feel panic about that news.Chance is for people who don't use leverage and wait patiently for such fud or black swan events to get very barely seen discounts from the market and weak hands to accumulate more bitcoins with cheaper price.",

I therefore figure that, having the pertinent authorization, it is feasible to liquidate seized virtual assets through an Exchange. See asset forfeiture policy manual (requires pdf download):https://www.justice.gov/criminal-afmls/file/839521/download(chapter 10 verses on use and disposition of seized and forfeited property).",

Right?and I read some old news that yes they usually 'sell them at auctions, as it already happened previously'According to coinmarketcap at the current price of btc, its daily trade is $23Billion and the conversation should be, how $1b transacted by the US government helped the market to plunge drastically. The sells pressure is what affects the market price, seeing such a news would lead lots of people to sell their coin believing that $1billion worth of btc sold by the US Government is capable of further reducing the price of bitcoin. By the way the price will bounce back to normal if people eliminate FUD and hodl. Same way is applicable just like the negative and positive feedback loop, if the news was a reverse, that reads; \"the US government purchased $1b worth of bitcoin\" what do you think would happen to the price of bitcoin? it'll pump again. Considering this sales a detailed info-graph was prepared by the perkshield alert twitter handle of how the seized btc from silk was spent and disseminated.  It seems they didn't bother to ask for the 50BCH that individual-1 gained, for holding 50btc he unlawfully obtained from the Silk road firm, during the btc hardfork in 2017",

However, at this time, there has been no official announcement or confirmation of any such sale.It is not uncommon for governments and law enforcement agencies to seize and hold cryptocurrencies as a result of criminal investigations. In the past, some of these agencies have sold seized cryptocurrencies through public auctions or private sales. However, any such sale would likely require approval from relevant authorities and would be subject to various regulations and legal requirements.",

That's the question we should ask ourselves and probably look into when it comes to the modus operandi to have been chosen in this round.Having yo auction it maybe didn't earn them the much they needed or could have gotten out of it. Using that module never meant they didn't have the idea of exchanges and what could have been to have utilised it.Bitcoin has gone through a bearish phase and even now, it still struggles with the bulls. This could be an attempt to further dump the price and as such, sending the coins to coinbase could be some means to introduce bias in form of FUD and to see how the people react.",

There are some things that when the government sells are at, and I know this is not the exact proper term, fair market value at that point in time.Some things they can auction, other things they have to trade just like the rest of us. It's usually things like gold and such but I guess BTC / crypto in general can fall into that. Some things depending on the case are going to auctioned. Others are just going to a trading desk.It's just the nature of how and why the government came into holding the asset.-Dave",

It would have been much more efficient to send all the bitcoins and sell everything for a total of 1 billion. And nowadays, they use more efficient methods to do it via regulations, stablecoins stuff, annoying binance, etc....To see how people react: well, look at the price, nothing happens and the price has been down for about 3% (and today in green).
