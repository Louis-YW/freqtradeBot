  "content": "A little coin called 'XJO' has transaction comments. Groovy. But the coin is dead.PIN coin (Florin) has tx comments.I think CLAM coin has tx comments, but I can't quite figure it out. TX coin was a TOR coin that claimed encrypted messaging -- but it has also gone to crypto heaven.Ooooh! 'Coinconnect'? New to me. Seems dead.42-coin has an 'encryption engine.' It requires a little practice to get used to. But it also is groovy. But 42-Coin is also comatose.Does anyone know a crypto that has both tx comments and an encryption engine?Or either?IndiaMikeZulu",
