      "body": "You may learn how to trade but start to be losing. Use the amount of money you can afford to lose to trade. If you want to leverage, it is tempting to use 2x up to 125x on exchanges, like OKX or Binance, or up to 200x on exchanges, like on Huobi global. Better not to leverage at first. Use 1x is better. Spot trading is risky, not to talk of margin or future trading which are far riskier.I started to leverage in trading with $2000 and I lost all in just less than 2 days. Do not make such mistake. Although, I have learnt and I am better now, but it would be better to avoid that by using the amount of money you can afford to lose.If you want to leverage, you need to either go for margin trading or future trading (derivatives). For marginYou can borrow up to 3x - 10x if using margin trading on most exchanges. In market trading, spot market price is used.Future trading Not using spot market price but derivative market price in a way you can leverage too, but without borrowing. This is my best option that I prefer. The derivative market price is almost similar to sport price with just little difference in prices.If using margin trading, you can only buy just like spot market, and sell for stable coin or other coins. But the advantage of future trading is that you can go long (buy) or short (sell). If you go long using BTCUSDT and the price of bitcoin is increasing, you are gaining If you go short and the price of bitcoin is reducing, you are also making profitIf otherwise, you are losing.The higher the leverage used, the closer the price of liquidation. Try and use exchanges like Binance, OKX or Huobi global or anything trustworthy exchange for practice. One of the advantage of future trading is that you can start with low amount of money, but this could also depend on the exchange you are using. I remember when I was using Binance, I was able to use less than $1 (like $0.25) to either fo long or short, but I do not know if that is still possible.Leveraging in trading is very risky, the higher the leverage the higher the risk.",

      "body": "I'd recommend getting used to paper trading and spot before going in with leverage. It's damaged a lot of portfolios - most of the time because people don't know how to manage risks.Leverage essentially lends you money given your provided collateral and allows you to trade with more. If you put down $1000 and wanted 20x leverage, the exchange would lend you the other $19000 and you'd be able to trade with that. The catch is you'd then get all your funds wiped if the asset drops by about 5% (or a twentieth in price). You also have to pay a funding rate every 8 hours (with most exchanges) to cover the interest of the \"loan\".There's no way an account can go negative but a good chance it can go to 1% if you're not doing diligence on risk management and don't incorporate it into a strategy (such as limiting trades to 1-5% of total funds in the futures account and then customising that based off success rate).",

It's true that you can earn quickly on this kind of high leverage trading but the risk involved is too high for a newbie like you to handle. This is already a gambling so I won’t recommend it at all for to try it unless you have enough experience already on trading.To give you an idea. By the word itself leverage, You can borrow a money to exchange in equivalent to your leverage multiplier. So if you have 100$, You can borrow up to 10,000$ or equivalent to x100 leverage but this incorporate to a liquidation margin is very low if your leverage is high or vice versa. Simply you are borrowing money in exchange for a risk of liquidation of your position. I believe the youtube video explain it all to you.",

It's like you're asking for a coach or something.There are many ways to have higher returns, but it will most likely be harder to have more risk to have that kind of return. Don't you think so? Many people are into teaching people about trading, and then you need to be more patient and become accustomed to trading itself.",

It's okay to get on leverage as long as you're already aware of it and you've experienced how it works. But as a start, you should just be cool and stay with the spot first and learn how the market goes through it because it's a good start and you'll apply what you've done there when you already start to get into futures.",

Gaining profit in trading isn't that easy, even though in copy trading which you copied on expert traders like on the Etoro exchange platform but the chances of losing are still there.",

      "body": "Seems OP already got the meaning or how leveraged trading works.Now, I can share is the risk management on trading especially when you are using leverage. My suggestion is always to use risk management, here comes the risk:reward ratio where you need to identify first your trade size, stop loss, and price target. You must stick with your plan and become consistent because expect that there will be no always 100% win trades.Always analyze if your trade size is worth the profits if your price target will hit versus your stop loss.Capital preservation, leverage trading is very risky, if you are not sure with your trade, it's better not to trade, capital preservation is a must.",

You can be lucky to stay longer or maybe succeed if you have passion for it. You can only learn by yourself, the things written or watched doesn't really add up. Trade with what you have learnt but with very little amount to play around with because chances are that you are going to lose before you understand why you are losing. Use little leverage size and don't be greedy.",

The replies made above, have explained how these work, but the only person making a profit off these trades will be the exchange and the youtuber whose affiliate link you clicked to sign up on the site, not you. This is because any sort of trading other than spot trading is a type of gambling and here the luck becomes a more important factor than your skills. If you are serious about making money, first get a job, get some savings done and then allocate some fraction of your monthly income in to spot trading, starting with doing it on paper (dummy trading).",

You will lose by holding or selling the coin if you buy it at a high price. But on the other hand, you can see that the loss will turn into a profit if the price increases again. But if you decide to sell it, you will lose.While in leverage trading, once the price reverses direction, you will get a loss that you will receive. And only losses you get without any chance to make a profit because the trade you made is finished.",
