      "body": "The education renaissance needs an ambitious plan from the government that works in the long term, meaning that the new generation will benefit from this plan, which extends from 10 years to about 40 years.The countries of Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, have succeeded to some extent in this approach, as investing in education enables these countries to achieve a good and profitable return, and thus education becomes an income-generating industry instead of a service that the government cannot fulfill and students do not benefit from.I don't know how the education situation is in Nigeria, but from what I've read, it seems that things need a comprehensive plan, and separate solutions will not work.",

BTCGood idea.There is a famous trader called Larry Williams who has won trading competitions and has his own wikipedia page.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_R._WilliamsHis trading system involves crunching statistics to figure out which days of the week monday through sunday are statistically best for buying and selling stocks. A good crypto trading calendar could include a similar feature. Crypto's transaction volume tends to peak around black friday and the holiday christmas season, which in past years was correlated with high demand. January through march are the inverse opposite correlated with low transaction volume, which make the 1st half of the trading year calendar prone towards the most declines in bitcoin and crypto prices. With the 2nd half of the year trending in the opposite direction.There are also 4 year boom and bust cycles present in bitcoin's price valuation, which correlate with miner rewards halving.It if were possible to overlay those factors, and others which serve as useful trading indicators. You could have the basis for a good trading app or SaaS.",

BTChttps://www.cryptocraft.com/calendar?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ccal&utm_id=ccal&utm_content=bro_knoAn investor does not care about the calendar, because when he buys bitcoin he buys it for what it is and for the long term, regardless of the price fluctuations that may result from the G7 meeting or what the president of the ECB says.Even for a trader, I don't see how it can help. Those events can have an influence on the market, but you can't predict what is going to happen beforehand. For example: if the ECB president says she is going to flood the market with liquidity, that is bullish news, which usually drives the markets up, but you can't know before she says it.",
