The proof of transactions from your binance address to you current address will always be on the blockchain and anyone with basic analytic skills can link the dots. What you can do is to create a different set of addresses and send (coinjoin or mix) all the coins into these new sets. This will break the link between your current set of addresses and the new one.- Jay -",

I am curious to see whether I can use the mixer to mix my UTXOs and send them to the same vault.Keep in mind that what you do before sending to mixing services and what you do after the mixing was completed are equally important for preserving your privacy because any false move or mistake may compromise your identity or the safety of your funds. Let's call these \"pre-mix and post-mix etiquette\": pre-mix implies preparing your UTXOs for mixing with coin control and other techniques to prevent unnecessary merging of anonymous coins and coins connected to your real identity. On the other hand, post-mix implies the absence of interaction with any centralized services that may peer into the history of your transactions and freeze your account for suspicion of money laundering or other criminal activity.",

You'll probably want to enroll that in the 0.01 BTC pool. So you'll end up creating 9 outputs of around 0.01005000 BTC, paying 50,000 sats in fees to the coordinator, and creating a toxic change output of around 0.009 BTC. Your 9 outputs will then pay for themselves to be coinjoined, and you'll end up with 9 coinjoined outputs of 0.01 BTC exactly.
