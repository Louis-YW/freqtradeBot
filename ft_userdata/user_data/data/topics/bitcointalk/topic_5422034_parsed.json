  "content": "I know revealing public key is safe. I know that but still i have few questions.So currently BTC has 3 Address formats as follows1. Legacy Address (begins with 1... a.k.a P2PKH )2. Non-Native Segwit Address (begins with 3... a.k.a P2SH )3. Segwit Address (begins with bc1... a.k.a P2WPKH)Questions1.) I know 100% that when you send bitcoins from legacy Address (P2PKH) then your public key gets revealed in transaction signature So this is also true in case of other Address formats (P2SH and P2WPKH) ?2.) I see Some Addresses do not reveal the public key even if they have spent their bitcoins like this address here - https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3BJKWL5ipkVe2bjkRSt6ZNbVWQaRrEFjMs     So How can this be possible?3.) How can i hide my public key while still Re-using the same address for spending? I suppose it's possible because the address i mentioned in question 2 is able to achieve that.",

Correct but even if you didn't have to include the public key alongside the signature in your transactions, the public key could still be derived from the ECDSA signature that you had provided. In fact this is how signing messages work, you only provide the address + message + signature and in order to verify that message others could easily derive your public key and perform the verification.That is how ECDSA and asymmetric cryptography work.",

Each time you create a transaction you are providing an \"unlocking script\" that provides required data and commands that can \"unlock\" the coins that are available on the blockchain. This script can be a simple signature + public key or a more complex one that contains conditions (branches), timelocks, hash operations alongside public keys and signatures, etc.Quote from: NinjaBitcoiner on November 18, 2022, 08:53:38 AMIf all 3 address's types reveals public key when you send bitcoins then what's the additional advantage of using newer btc address types say Taproot one's (except the lower fees benefit) ?Lower tx weight hence lower fee.Help increase block capacity (improve scaling).Faster verification time for full nodes.Avoid malleability problems.Access to new features introduced in newer address types such as public key aggregation in Schnorr signatures.",

Multi-signature addresses are usually used when a transaction should be signed by multiple parties. If you generate a single-signature wallet on an air-gapped device and keep your keys safe, it's secure enough.

The latter is just not going to happen (unless you make a mistake), the former can easily happen.From your topics, you seem to have a hard time understanding how secure Bitcoin is. Maybe you should spend some time trying to brute-force the private key to a funded address, to convince yourself it's not going to happen.Now i am not having a hard time understanding how secure bitcoin is But it wouldn't hurt to know more about cryptography in general. Does it? and it's a technical sub forum.Also like you ask there's no harm if public key in known. So why to hide it? I know this BUT it wouldn't hurt to conceal it for privacy reasons does it?See if the bitcoin devs didn't care about it they wouldn't introduce Taproot which essentially enables multi-sig wallet to conceal their pub keys and aggregate them into 1 key and no one can find out the real pub keys which is great IMO and helps in privacy. Even no one can find out if it's the multi-sig tx or single sig",

Multi-sig provides extra security, provided that transactions are signed in multiple devices.  Quote from: hosseinimr93 on November 18, 2022, 10:21:16 AMQuote from: NinjaBitcoiner on November 18, 2022, 10:04:25 AMIf an address is multi sig of say 3 address then attacker has to find 3 private keys correct?If the address is a 1 of 3 multi-signature address, a single private key would be enough. Important to mention that an attacker needs the two other public keys as well, in contrast with single-sig, wherein just having the private key is enough to move the money.",

I think it is possible because the address I mentioned in question 2 achieves that.In my understanding, this is not possible, in my few years in cryptocurrency I have never seen a pubic key hidden in every transaction done by enthusiasts here in the crypto space.    And I also don't understand why you want your public key hidden? The only thing I know that is really hidden and cannot be shown is the seed phrase words and password, that's all but not the public key.",
