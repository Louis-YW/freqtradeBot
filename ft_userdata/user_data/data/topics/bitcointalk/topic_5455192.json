Often times the last resistance which I believe was 25k will be the support level in this decline. In the fundamental side of things, I have no idea. News and fud probably causes this selling again.",

According to the economy going down a bit too slowly can new investments be made at the moment.Nothing is totally impossible in this life; it's hard to predict a perfect Bitcoin market, but there are people who can give a price prediction of what the market will look like in the coming days, but not an exact market figure.You shouldn't be looking at economist predictions regarding market change before you can make your investment decision; always look at what's best for you, which price you have in mind as your buying target, and do your own personal research since you already believe that Bitcoin's future price can't be predicted. Maybe you know what the best feature or track is that you need to see before you can make your own investment decision.For me, I will say every time is the best buying time for me, which all depends on my financial status as of that time, because I rate my investment time based on what I currently have to spare for investment and not on the current market price or what someone has predicted the market to be. I don't want to fall victim to being disappointed when the market doesn't turn out to be the way it's predicted to be.",

According to the economy going down a bit too slowly can new investments be made at the moment.Predictions can be made about the market, but there is no certainty. Because no one can be 100% sure of what they say. The things we need to pay attention to are what happened in the market before and how the markets reacted. Other than that, the estimates sometimes hold and sometimes do not. I don't think it makes sense to invest based on those estimates.",

According to the economy going down a bit too slowly can new investments be made at the moment.It's impossible for a human to predict the market by himself but possible with the CREATOR. So, you can actually predict the market if you rely on the ONE who knows the future market very precisely. The current situation of the market is as a result of different factors, one of which is to make sure that no human takes the credit when it hits 30,000 soon and remains at that level until it records new high which is +32,000. It was actually predicted late last year that price will hit 30,000 and it actually did. It would have stopped at 30,000 if others weren't trying to pretend they made the prediction too, then the credit that belongs to another would go to them. So the goal post was shifted to ensure that credit is given to whom it's due when it hits +30,000",

Volatility should be considered as something that cannot be separated from crypto assets and prices can move in all directions. Markets can move up and down depending on how market fundamentals affect supply and demand. No one can say for sure what will happen in the future - so you need to be wise enough to manage your investments and plan accordingly.OP - don't make other people's predictions your financial advice because basically those predictions can never guarantee you a return. Even if you believe, then you must be wise enough to manage your own risk.",

If they say that from next month bitcoin price will go up in some percentage and it happened on that way so toÂ  some extent people use the market tools to predict the market and it working for them. When the price of bitcoin goes down investorscan be invested massively to their satisfaction. Just like the way I did to on p2p purchase of bitcoin. Personally I was out of cash to buy bitcoin this days but when I look at the market, bitcoin is about $25k so I bought it from the person because I know that the price is down and it will still go down. BTC price is unpredictable but we can make a guess work.",

According to the economy going down a bit too slowly can new investments be made at the moment.Unfortunately, it's impossible to predict the future of any market... For example, now there is a high risk of fiat inflation, so even in non-crypto market nobody knows what's gonna happen. I think that crypto projects are rapidly developing, but not all the project will be successful. Its impossible to find out which project is going to win the house. Also, considering fluctuations in BTC/USD price, we usually assume that USD is stable, but in case of fiat inflation not BTC but USD has the risk to become unstable, then this ratio (as well as any other crypto-to-fiat ratio) is going to mean nothing.",

The market has been showing a decline for a few days and although for today it has shown a slight recovery, it still seems to me good enough to see an opportunity to enter the market because the pumping potential is not that great in this recovery so anyone can make up their mind for now.But it also depends on how prepared people are to take the appropriate amount and most importantly the policy in managing investments must be based on how strong their understanding and ability to assume the risk of loss is and even if they are still unsure about buying then DCA is one that can be chosen to make a purchase.",
