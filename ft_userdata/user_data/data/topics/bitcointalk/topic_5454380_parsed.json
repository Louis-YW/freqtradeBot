I have a youtube channel that already earning not that huge profit but I’m not focusing anymore on regular videos upload but on the reels.I suggest that you should focus more on reels since most viewers once a quick and simplified video like the 2 minutes format of Nas daily before. You can create reels about Bitcoin tutorial and mix it with your current living setup. I’m sure many viewers will be interested to your unique reels.",

I'd suggest that you purchase an already existing youtube page from social media marketplaces and begin your crypto youtube channel journey. The best way to earn bitcoin is to accept donations on the page and also reach out to new cryptocurrency projects that needs exposure on youtube. As for youtube monetization, they don't pay content creators in bitcoin. However, you can also promote your blog on Patreon and drive traffic through there. Create a Patreon account using your domain name as your username, subscribe to a content creator there, normally they'll shout out the username of their subscribers on new videos. You'll get your domain name called out to thousands of people and many would check through your website. In addition, get in touch with the content creators too, for a youtube shout out, that way you'll be getting more viewers on youtube.",

      "body": "I'm aware that there is a lot of educational stuff about Bitcoin, but most of it is a load of claptrap imho. That includes some from people who purport to be senior specialists. For example, very few people understand how a vurtual asset like Bitcoin can also be a hard asset like a house ( which is actually a virtual asset in the UK ). There is also too much emphasis on the technical aspect, and too much repetition of trite comments like \"Bitcoin is decentralised\". Explanbation of this is frequently ignored. I'm not too hot on the inner wheels and cogs of Bitcoin, but I hope I understand its aerodynamics, safety record, and fuel economy.I suspect that Youtube will never include Bitcoin in its monetisation, but we can live in hope. One way to gather Bitcoin would be to have a merchandising plan with Bitcoin payments. However, I wonder if there is a danger in the heavy promotiuoin of Bitcoin. Youtube may have a vested interest in minimising its use.",

YouTube always pays out in fiat and they are not really friendly to the Cryptos. So that Avenue is not available. There is only one way to receive crypto is through donation if someone is willing to donate for the contents you create. I knew a website called a-ads which allows you to monetize your blog traffic through crypto related advertising. I am not sure how good are they but worth exploring. If you have a good traffic in your website, start monetizing that.",

I hope you have a long life, always be healthy and happy and can get what you want.As far as I know, displayed YouTube videos can get revenue from advertisements that will be played alternately. But not in the form of Bitcoin but Adsense but I don't know. Maybe a new policy from Youtube provides payment options to its members.Maybe the only thing I think about is government surveillance, especially if your sites can become more popular because they already provide content about Bitcoin. So you must be careful in providing any information because we don't know if you are being watched or still free.And I haven't even started making my own videos yet. But I have told my sister to try to make some tutorial videos. And you can create educational content to help people looking for information. Once again, happy birthday.",

But to generate bitcoins through the YouTube channel, you can't get bitcoins directly. Because the payment system that is usually applied by YouTube to content creators is through payments using dollars. But the dollar can also be bought for bitcoin assets. Apart from that, what I know is that being able to make money through creating a YouTube channel is not easy. Because there are several conditions that must be met in order to monetize it. But it all depends on your persistence in creating content, especially those related to bitcoin.I also want to suggest, if you really understand 100% about the ins and outs of bitcoin, when you already have a YouTube channel that has produced or has been monetized by YouTube. In terms of followers, there must be quite a lot if a YouTube channel has been monetized. If that's the case, you can create an online group, which contains direct teaching from you about bitcoin. And you can charge people who want to participate, and that fee uses bitcoins. And apart from the YouTube channel from the group, if a lot of people participate, you can make bitcoins or money.",

Unfortunately YouTube doesn’t have bitcoin as a payment option, I doubt they will have one anytime soon. As you know, to be a successful YouTuber, you need to have lots of views, comments, shares and subscribers and that’s hard work. Gone are the days of YouTubers boosting their channels with bots and fake accounts, prospects can now know when a channel has real engagement, so they know which channels will get them the results they need. The crypto space on YouTube is saturated with lots of “experts” giving advice and tips, I believe people are tired of these content creators and will be very much interested to watch a real bitcoin maximalist give his two cents.",

I have a friend of mine which has a channel and one of his videos quite hit a huge amount of views but still not getting anything from it. However, having an idea of what you would be offering to the audiences is already something.Going back, as others have mentioned, there's no way you could directly earn Bitcoin from youtube 'coz monetization as far as I know is fiat and usd based. But you may still consider earning fiat from your channel and eventually investing the profit to this technology.",

At least directly from YouTube you can't earn Bitcoin last I checked.I otherwise think there is still value to come from YouTube videos about Bitcoin, as long as you are avoiding the usual over-saturated topics such as price analysis and general news. I've always thought that more in-depth analysis of Bitcoin technical developments, via github pull requests or similar, would be an interesting thing to hear about. For example Ethereum core devs have zoom calls that are shared via YouTube that are relatively popular for people to follow the development that is currently going on. As far as I know, this isn't available in regards to Bitcoin, most of the tech news comes via Twitter these days (not even here).That's just a random thought. I don't know if you're much of a techy type in regards to Bitcoin, but I personally think this would be the best angle if you're looking to gain views and followers via YouTube.",
