      "body": "One thing way Bitcoin holder go fit learn easily nah how to dey patient and discipline, this na the number one important thing first, without say person get those things the person no go fit hold longer, just imagine person way no get patient start to dey hold em coins, the person go like to try other coins whether those ones go fit skyrocket early and those way no get patient nai dey lose pass for Bitcoin. We as a Bitcoin holders we suppose to dey listen to other pipo predictions but we no supposed to take them serious because possiblities dey say we fit lose all efforts in just a matter of seconds. Quote5. For the method wey dem dey call DCA, no go carry your mind dey trade or you come go dey monitor the market just invest your money den you leave am there.This thing way you talk here to go outside the discussion sha, I think say you dey try to talk about Bitcoin holding,,, but now, sha this DCA method way you dey talk about, nah for investors way dey accumulate more Bitcoin and not for traders, most traders dey always dey active when dem wan start to trade their coins so them gass to watch the price if e dey go up or down before them sell.",

And person wey dey into holding suppose get enough knowledge on how to secure em private keys for places where no go cast easily, meaning make em no save am online all private keys dey advised to be saved offline, and e nor too dey advisable make person generate em own pattern because if you pattern cast back up no dey oo, the best and most practiced storage method na when person write am for book store am for water proof or fire proof safe.I go also advise say person wey dey into holding of bitcoin make em no dey allow em emotions make financial decision for am especially when it comes to buying and selling of bitcoin, because this na one of the major thing wey dey destroy many newbies ability to hold, na why I first say make the person first get knowledge about Bitcoin, so em no go make mumu decisions, make e no be say as the market just experience small bear run the person go just go sell em coin and las las bitcoin must rise, just give the market small time e go must rise na just time e go take. And again person wey dey hold bitcoin nor suppose to dey share em financial details anyhow, just keep that part very anonymous.",
