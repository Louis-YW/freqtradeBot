This and many more are questions popping up in my head, what is your opinion on this matter?  Many Iranians are already opposed to the way the government runs the country, with the years of outcries against the forced behavioral alignment against women courtesy of their morality police, and never-ending struggles and issues economically and politically. This stop of support isn't entirely without basis, after all why would you not support your own local team in one of the biggest tournaments in all of sports? But for your second question, of course morally speaking there is no way a blood must be shed in retaliation to one's beliefs. But unfortunately that happens in a lot of countries in the world special mentions to Iran, this is why there had been multiple protests made not only within the country urging the government to be redefined and be made more fair at the very least to all citizens.",

That same austerness could prolly be a big problem here as anyone would react to anything, based on their own discretions.Is a security man not supposed to protect a citizen? How has loosing in the world cup tournament got anything to do with a homicide? That's fucked up.... There are no excuses for that, and that ass' should be locked and executed immediately. I thought I'd choose my ways to do whatever I wanted? As Long as it ain't a crime? So how could he shoot him on the face? Except they're just gonna play some midgames with that, he shouldn't be set free!!!Sandra üßë",

C'mon, for crying out loud, this is football and not politics. Granted, the Iranians decided to use this as medium to renege against their govt, but going out and shooting a civilian for celebrating? Personally I don't see how that would solve the problem of unrest in the country as this could lead to something greater.¬†In the 1990 world cup, after Cameroon were kicked out of the tournament, it was gathered that a woman in Bangladesh took her life!",

Did the security operatives do the right thing in killing a man just for the reason that he wasn't supporting his country's team in a world cup tournament? This and many more are questions popping up in my head, what is your opinion on this matter? Those Iranians celebrating their loss against the USA team are heroes. They don't hate the country but they are just expressing frustration and oppression by the government. In the same competition, the Iranian national team failed to sing the national anthem to express their displeasure about the killing of Mahsa Amini by the Iranian morality police because of a trivial offense and the crackdown on protesters.True citizens sometimes express their anger by celebrating evil that befalls their nation. Some of them even go to the extent of joining their country's enemies to undo their own country. There was mass and wild celebration on the streets of my country immediately it was announced that a president died and there was total sorrow when another one died. Citizens disrespect or respect their country based on how the current government is treating them.The only way the Iranian government would prove that it doesn't support extrajudicial killing is to investigate this matter and bring the perpetrators to book. This killing is senseless because Mehran Samak didn't commit any crime. He deserves the right to a fair hearing even if he committed any crime.",

Football is an extremely passionate sport, and fans all around the world have engaged in incredible behaviors both when their teams win and when they lose.You have to live a carefree life in an Islamic nation like Iran since things that are normal elsewhere could be seen as an abomination there.Despite this, it's horrible news for football and a catastrophe for human rights that the public agency wasted a football fanatic in the football festive season like the world cup.",

However, this story bears a distinct privacy because it is not uncommon to see a person celebrating the loss of his country to a rival team, regardless of all the contrasts between the two competing countries. So since the scene is somewhat strange, I would not have been surprised if the one who carried out the killing was another citizen who was jealous of his country's team and could not see a citizen like him encouraging the opposing country and celebrating the loss of his country. But that the Iranian forces were the ones who shot him directly and in the head, this is what makes the scene more strange. The armed authorities are responsible for protecting citizens, not trying them for their opinions and feelings. What is happening is the result of the culture of the morality police, which issues judgments based on guesses and intentions.Everything that is happening in Iran proves that it is a country that is not suitable for living, and that the Iranian citizen has reached maturity and awareness that makes him deserve better than living under a theocratic regime that obeys the order of the ruler, by the command of God.",
