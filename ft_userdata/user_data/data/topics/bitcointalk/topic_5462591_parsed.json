Bots need high liquidity and most times the liquidity is not enough and the bot will be operating based on the program therein. This will make the expectation to be different from result.If these type of bots should be effective, it should be during the bull run when the market is just green and in one direction.",

In fact, in reality every exchange is using those kind of bots to pump and dump some useless shit-coins that don't have any good use case other then getting pumped and dumped to loot the money out of the pockets of the greedy fellows. The bots can't be trusted because they can also make the users to lose the money if an exchange decides to dump or pump the price out of the bot's expectations. The bots are programmed by a programmer and they work in the same fashion by watching the different parameters of the markets and they coins they will be pumping, and in that case there might be anti-bots from the exchanges that could cause huge dumps in value of the crypto-currency that the bot is trying to pump. In such case, the bot will end up losing capital value of the users and anyone who puts money into that bots ecosystem will be at a loss without any question. That's why I always recommend users to learn trading themselves rather than relying on a piece of software that could go wrong anytime without any warning.",
