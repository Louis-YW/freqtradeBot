It's within China's interest to have the deadweights die off. China, much like Japan, is experiencing a labor issue with not enough young people being born to help subsidize the older generation. When the collapse comes, the first people that start to die are the older folks who can't help themselves.",

Their common relations are based on organized trade between them, not that they have ever had a really strong central government.When the main inter-provincial trade is disrupted sufficiently, the whole togetherness will collapse, and we will have 23 separate countries.
