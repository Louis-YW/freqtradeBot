Is it meaningless to try to explain them that you just exchanged your coins and you have no idea that your bitcoins are tagged? How can you know whether incoming coins have gone through something bad? This is something beyond your capabilities. Maybe their system did a false positive? How can they be so sure that your coins are bad?QuotePlease be informed that due to privacy and confidentiality laws, we'll not be able to provide further information on our decision.This doesn't make any sense. Anybody can claim that your coins are bad without any reason and tell you they can't show you proofs because of confidentiality laws.Btw, did you choose max mixing level on yomix? Did you enable random amount of transactions with high service fee and some hours of transfer delay? This would increase your anonimity.Btw [banned mixer] claims to send you coins from exchanges that make you not to worry about bad funds. [banned mixer] uses monero bridge and logically should offer you high anonimity. There is also a [banned mixer] that has been on market for centuries with proven reserves of more than 2000 bitcoins and I haven't heard anyone saying bad about them.",

I read the email, and it did not says anywhere that the amount is being funded from some terrorism account. I assume you are new to mixers, as you already said in your post, and then you should know that, many CEXs don't accept payments from mixers. You have to understand that if CEXs are positive terminal then Mixers are negative terminals. Means they are opposite to each other.They are both against each other purposes. CEXs shows your identity and ask it and will share it with feds while Mixers don't do that, at least it is what they say.

I think it's depend on individual experience level. Personally I will not give up my strategy and want someone else to adopt it to make it became common. I use mixers a lot even in the recent time I used one of the mixer [not calling the name for obvious reason] that is advertising on the forum. Thankfully I never had any such experience.Besides when there are no information given to show/prove the validity of the reason they gave, it's hard to make a conclusion too.",

AFAIK, the message given to you by uphold is the typical description when user caught using mixer to deposit on their platform. You check their ToS if they forbid the use of mixer to deposit since some centralized services that usually involves fiat as main currency is very strict on mixers. We have centralized service too in my country that doesn’t allowed funds coming from gambling, mixer and other platform which can be use to launder except exchange.There’s no way to filter out Bitcoin that being watch by FBI since there’s no such sign like that to determine tainted Bitcoin unless you knew the watchlist of FBI.",

The issue is obviously from your Uphold account perhaps there are some other transactions you did that was related to the claim by Uphold.

So yeah, these wallets have a number against mixers for some reason.I would not go as far as saying that OP is on an FBI watchlist, because 1) there is no guarantee that Upwork (same company that makes uphold) actually reports these activities to the FBI and 2) they are overwhelmed with leads, tips, and other received data that a single isolated mix isn't going to catch their attention.The correct action by upwork would be to allow the OP to withdraw their funds, before closing the account if they wanted to terminate it.",
