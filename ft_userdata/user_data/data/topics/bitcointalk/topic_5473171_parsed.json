Now Meta is giving users in the EU, EEA and Switzerland the choice to pay a monthly subscription to use Facebook and Instagram  without any ads. This special account can come for as high as €9.99/month on the web or €12.99/month on iOS and Android. Users can get this account this month and enjoy the package  Although the subscription fees is high to some low income nations but I think it can held to reduce gambling disorderly behaviour. Some gamers are triggered to gamble uncontrollable because of advertisment so this package will help them gamble responsibly. According to a study carried out by Sheffield and Glasgow universities the more people are exposed to betting advertisment the more likely they are to gamble and the greater the risk of them developing a disorder. This package is also helpful because it will make gamblers avoid adverts from many scam casinos that are using these social media as platforms which will also reduce gambling disorder.What are your thoughts?",

What I am gaining from the this forum with gambling signature campaigs, I can not gain it from those meta social media, but I still prefer X. But nonetheless I can not pay for subscription on those social media. But on social media that belongs to Mark Zuckerberg, I have not been using them and I see them not useful for me than to make me not to have a private life.

For people that pay for the subscription, not that the ads are removed. Nothing changed because most people will use the social media with ads.",

It's surprising to me that gambling ads are still allowed on FB and IG.I read the forum blackhatworld.com where some people say that it is possible to run gambling ads on Facebook, but it is very difficult and the possibility of the ads getting rejected is high.If I was a gambling addict, I would avoid social media completely(assuming that gambling ads are allowed). There's no point for me wasting a monthly fee on a \"no ads\" subscription. There are multiple social media accounts, who promote gambling via their content. There's no way to avoid them, if you are active on social media. The algorithms will put their posts in your feed sooner or later.",

As for the subscription requirement that'd ridiculous, it's not a once time fee thing but monthly renewal? To hell with Facebook and Instagram, I don't even have an account on Facebook and the reason why I used Instagram was for some advert assignment and this was years ago, I won't dare pay a penny to any social media if I am not making money off them.The sub is good for those who are monetizing the platform, if not then it makes no sense, I thought that Instagram have already ban everything related to casino and crypto, maybe I read wrong, it's crazy that people can come across gambling ads and decide to go back into gambling, like they don't work on me, I easily ignore any gambling ads that I come across without thinking about them twice. If you are addicted to gambling you should just stop using any platform that supports gambling ads and promotions, go back to the real world and spend countless time with your friends and family, if making money is why you get addicted to gambling you should start learning a new skill.",

This prohibition also applies to games where anything of monetary value is required to play and anything of monetary value forms part of the prize. Common types of gambling or gaming activities include betting, lotteries, raffles, casinos, fantasy sports, bingo and poker.The problem isn't someone who promote it, but the biggest problem is Mark Zuckerberg and his team has very low action to monitor illegal stuff posted in their platforms! the addicted gamblers also has a problem for not able to control themselves.Imagine the addicted gamblers subscribe the no ads feature, do you think it will stop them to read user that promoting gambling ads? nope, those users will promote it through reply or personal message lol, they're creative.",

Also, wouldn't this be a useless thing anyway because you're going to see content creators having their own in-video ads that directly pays them? Regarding less gambling ads that might influence gamblers or make recovering gambling addicts relapse, I believe in the power of advertising and I believe that this might moderately reduce the people that will try gambling or anything of the like.",

And there are researches that back this up which I think makes it credible to say that exposure to betting ads increases the likelihood of gambling disorders. By giving users the option to pay a monthly fee to avoid ads, Meta might help individuals gamble more responsibly. But cant it be free? Making this feature free to  audience could enhance its impact. It's a step in the right direction and addressing a real problem but finding ways to ensure everyone can benefit from it would be key to its success.",

      "body": "For me personally, I try to use Instagram and Facebook as little as possible on my phone. For facebook speficially there are some open source apps like Frost for android that try to hide ads, but really its very hard to hide the ads on the mobile version as its the main source of Facebook's income. Facebook really doesn't care if you're an addict, it'll play to your addiction just to earn more from advertisers. Oftentimes they're even caught advertising outright scams and they do nothing about it... So my advice would be to uninstall Instagram and Facebook apps from your phone. Tell your friends to reach you via an application that doesn't and will never have ads like Signal. If you have to use Facebook and Instagram for work do it via a browser on personal computer. And use these tools to hide ads: uBlock Origin hides ads on all sites including Instagram. Just install the browser extensionhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlockFBPurity hides ads as well as many annoyances as recommended posts from Facebook. Install it as a browser extension or user scripthttps://www.fbpurity.com/",

In that package, the point is that addicts should not play on social media if they don't want to be influenced and feel unsure about controlling themselves. For me, that's just a normal thing.",

Although I would be cautious about the results of a single study. In the end many people who have addictions have to learn how to get out of them despite the possible triggers that are everywhere.

Before, we didn't want to see ads and we had no option but to view those ads they'll make money from the viewership they get from their audiences like you and me and this is how they are actually earning from the platform, and that's our task and that's to view their ads for their metrics, statistics, and analytics to show for their advertisers. Now with this offer, it's like a YouTube subscription that you'll have to pay on a monthly basis so that you'll have no ads on your feed or wall. It's actually a business strategy for most of the platforms now so they make money from those users that don't want to view ads through subscriptions. Still, they also earn money from those who don't want to pay because they'll still view ads from their sponsors or advertisers.But I am thinking of the brighter side that if it's going to be helpful for a gambler who's dealing with hardship because he/she sees left and right ads about gambling because that's how they work, algorithm. They know our interest, they know the websites and cookies that we've got so in short, they'll just send us with a blast of ads that are also part of our interest. I don't wanna cut the fun but since I am not from those regions and even I am part of it, I'll not do it.

They may want to add another security measure by blocking the uploads of those content creators who put gambling inside their clips.
