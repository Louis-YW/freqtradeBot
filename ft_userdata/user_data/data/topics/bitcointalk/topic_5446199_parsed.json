I think this project is very innovative because it combines blockchain technology and gold, which makes it easy for people to store digital gold in their Ethereum wallet.",

      "body": "If graphics aren't a giveaway how seriously they are doing this, let me spell it out for you This is a low effort MLM money laundering scam!Even without visiting their site i was sure that no third party in the world would have audit their company.But then i visited their home page . I actually started to write a detailed description how any investor in western countries would have no legal way to get their money or \"gold\" back. But this is not worth my time. Just visit the site yourself and you see all the red flagsThey offer staking rewards, which i find hilarious if this would be a real concept. If they weren't selling synthetics, this would cost a lot as just storing gold securely costs money. Yet they throw away the money out from this air i suppose.There's zero transparency of anything. None of their \"lawyers\" has even seen this site, i can guarantee you that.They are saying that over a $1.7 million has been raised with this bep20 \"ICO\" without offering any proof on that. And they call it a \"donation\" which i find hilarious also when in retrospect it will get revealed as a scam, so it was a \"donation\". But it's safe to say that they have raised zero dollars so far and numbers are there only to create hype. There's so much shady stuff in their FAQ answers that left me stunned. It's like they wouldn't have a clue what they were doing and started this money laundering scam years too late. This is so bad it wouldn't have worked in 2017, and back then everything worked.",

That image that you are posted looks like it was made by a 12 year old within 10 minutes in Microsoft Paint and is more fitting for one of those stupid meme-coins that are dead within a few days again and not for a project that wants to store gold for it's customers. For that you need to create trust and to get that trust first of all you need a way more serious appearance of your company. Even then i don't really think, that this will be a great success because i can also easily go to my bank and buy gold. It is not really that big of a difference if the purchase takes 1 week or 1 day because gold is a longterm hold anyway.",

But if it is about digital storage then of course security is the most important thing. I have used several gold storage apps digitally and I see that they are good but the credibility and trust of a platform is needed.",
