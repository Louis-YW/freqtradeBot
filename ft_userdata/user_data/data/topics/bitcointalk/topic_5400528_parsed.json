Coinmarketcap and similar sites also should show you the tokens volume (but it might not be as trustworthy unless from a major exchange).",

On youtube channel we can not say that the people who are you looking at is a legit and trustworthy.

On the other hand, the right coin, bought in the right moment and (very important!) also sold in the right moment can give nice profits.On the long term altcoins have disappointed me. So selling is just as important as buying.But can you find out those moments? I'm not so sure. You have to be either very lucky, either very experienced. Or both.So you better step back and get on learning. Crypto is not a simple \"get rich quick\" world. Altcoins, especially, can easily be called \"get poor quick\".Quote from: Shamm on May 28, 2022, 06:20:50 PMStable coin like bitcoin , Ethereum and bnb is a good coin to be invested if we are newbies or new in the word of crypto. Just to make sure... stable coins is a term used for coins pegged to certain value (usually USD or gold), so Bitcoin, Ethereum or BNB are not actually stable coins.And if you want to call them good coins, I will agree on Bitcoin, but not on those altcoins.",

Is it true that new Coins can give big profits as people say on youtube channel?Well, there's half truth with those youtube channels if they're telling big profits for the new coins. There really are people that makes a lot of money after investing into new projects, they're the early ones and also luck plays a part on it. Because they don't know if it's going to hit success or not and once they see that they've earned a lot already, they'll start selling. But, to shortcut it, don't believe in anything they say and most of the new projects are the riskiest ones. If you want to have a stable journey, invest in bitcoin and if you're into altcoins, not all of them are great to diversify and maybe choose only ETH.",

I think the utility of a cryptocurrency determines if the project will be long term, it doesn't guarantee profits but I'm confident projects with good use-cases are bound to last longer than meme coins and the rest.",

Is it true that new Coins can give big profits as people say on youtube channel?From the beginning you have to know the project commentary and from there you will understand if the project is bad one or good one, many projects are deceitful and you will find it difficult to detect or actualize the project that's potential from the commentary of investors. Its quite good to detect the potentiality of a project before investing there. Like as a beginner, you have to start investment with coins that is well known and also have potentials via investment.",

Why should a coin that no one actually uses be worth anything? Because their marketing team promises that at some point in the future everyone will use it? It's a wrong perspective to think that there are \"scams\" and \"good coins\". An altcoin will fail even if its creators have good intentions, simply because blockchain doesn't solve any real problems. So instead of looking for some quick gains, just buy Bitcoin and wait a few years at least. Because Bitcoin achieved what it promised the moment the first block got mined - being a peer-to-peer electronic cash.",

He is probably talking about scam tokens that you can buy but can not sell or transfer to other addresses. Like the \"ERC20 Honeypot\" scam.

Is it true that new Coins can give big profits as people say on youtube channel?There are dozens of ways in order to know if a certain coin/project is a scam. First, you must check the whitepaper of the project. You have to read and check if what they created is purely original or plagiarized from different whitepapers already existing in the crypto-space. Second, check the domain if the website is relatively fairly new. If they registered under a fake domain address, then chances are that they are only hosting for free spaces which suggests a rug-and-pull scheme. Third, check the team members of the project and the overall creation of the website. If you saw that they did not even bother to put some effort towards the website, then chances are that such may be a scam.There are lots of ways to determine if a project is a scam but you always have to remain vigilant and observant in order to avoid being scammed in the first place.",

Is it true that new Coins can give big profits as people say on youtube channel?I tell you the truth, not only newbies that often fall into losing but also all o us here are still risky of losing in the crypto investment or trading. And, never trust what you watch and heard from YouTube or other channel media or influencers that promote new projects. But, we all have known something basic, never follow any hype project that is conducted also with FOMO. A new project is very risky, this is more likely to gambling. Although we have researched the project in detail, we consider that the project will be good and valuable in the future, this doesn't guarantee if the project can really grow up, finish their selling token, list in good top exchanges, have high trading volume or market cap. It doesn't guarantee. That is why I personally will not suggest people or moreover newbies to invest in new projects, because of the high risks. Except that you are a high-risk taker with some experience in investing in this kind of new project.",

And after that, stop investing in new projects instead, and go for Bitcoin and leading altcoins as they can provide you profit, not losses. Maybe you can blame those people who come and say on YouTube and encourage you to invest in a scam project but I think, it was your responsibility as well to do the research before falling into their trick.
