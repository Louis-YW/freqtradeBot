  "content": "QuoteChairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Capital Market and Institutions, Babangida Ibrahim, has disclosed that the chamber will soon pass a law that will allow digital currencies in Nigeria. The Investments and Securities Act, 2007 (Amendment) Bill, when passed and signed into law, will allow the Securities and Exchange Commission to recognise cryptocurrency and other digital funds as capital for investment.The proposed law will also define the regulatory roles of the Central Bank of Nigeria and SEC regarding digital currency.Source: https://punchng.com/proposed-cryptocurrency-law-to-define-cbns-roles-reps/This one na really good news ooo and if dem successful pass this bill into law e go make sense. Cryptocurrency is one of the trending topics in the world and Nigerians should not be left out, we should be at the forefront of history. Thank God say sense don dey dawn on our legislators say banning cryptocurrency no be the answer. E get people wey dey use bitcoin and cryptocurrency do legit businesses. After the END SARS protest they just get up ban crypto. Even with the ban, boys still dey smile as P2P trade and other forms of transactions using crypto still dey go on. They try to impose e-Naire currency, which proves to be a total failure with a 0.5% adoption according to statistics. E be like say our government don dey wake up from their slumber, first by giving 30,000 Nigerians scholarship to become blockchain developers, the program is still running and now, this bill that's in the offing.",
