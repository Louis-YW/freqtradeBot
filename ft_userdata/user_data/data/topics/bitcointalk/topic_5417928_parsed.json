  "content": "In my consciousness, Bitcoin will unequivocally get better and better in the near future.Â Â  Â  Â  Â I know most people have had some unpleasant experiences with bank transactions, like that of the kiwi bank double charged customers Quote Hundreds of people were double-charged on Friday after a system failure impacted the connection between Kiwibank and Visa Debit Cards.Between 3.20pm and 3.35pm on Friday, 230 Kiwibank customers were charged twice for their purchases, with a total value of \"less than $10,000\" according to communications manager Kara Tait. Â I had similar harsh experience with my bank.Â Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Good day my friends. On the 13th of January 2022, I went to a supermarket and bought goods that were about $130 in my local currency. I paid with my debit card and got debited. On getting home that day, I received another debit of $130 from the same supermarket I had just left. I rushed to the supermarket and complained, but all they could point to was a network glitch, claiming that the problem was not from their end and that I should contact my financial institution.Â Â  Â  Â  Â I went to the bank and filed a complaint. I was told to wait 48 hours and the money would be reversed. I waited, and the money was reversed in 28 hours, less than the proposed hour. I have carried out lots of Bitcoin transactions but have not been double charged like my experience with the bank.Â Â  Â  Â  Â Bitcoin Double-spending: Double-spending is a potential flaw in a digital cash scheme in which the same single digital token can be spent more than once. This is possible because a digital token consists of a digital file that can be duplicated or falsified.Apart from the Double-spending problem of Bitcoin which is not very much difficult because a transaction verification mechanism (Blockchain) has been developed to combat this problem.Â Â  Â  Â  Since 2019, when I got into Bitcoin, I have not even read or seen any Bitcoin user complaining of having been double charged after sending Bitcoin to a Bitcoin wallet address. That confirms how Bitcoin transactions can not be compared to transactions that are based on a centralized system. Bitcoin will even grow from better to best in the future.Kind regards, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘º",

      "body": "I have had a similar experience but the reverse was the case, where I visited a supermarket and apart all my purchase, on getting to my location all my two times payment which was made on the supermarket was reversed to my account which I realized few days after the purchase and I was wondering where the error was coming from. I have never encountered such an issue with any crypto transaction since I was introduced into the crypto community, it's just a high gas fee of eth back then... I have never been overcharged or double-charged before with crypto, and I think it's impossible unless it's something one will authorize by him with a smart contract call. if not it's nearly impossible. Since I have not used any crypto card before I don't know if any users have encountered such using the card.",

Bitcoin transactions can never be double charged, but that doesn't mean it can't be hack or frozen for those who stores it in centralized exchange such as \"Binance\". But however,Â  it's still far better compared to fiat as it is borderless and has no limit toÂ  which amount one can transfer per day, week or month, just like most banks",

      "body": "I have no experience like that but there is one reason that it causes double charges and that is when you are increasing your fees to make the highest priority. I made that once or twice, if you will set it to the lowest fee for example $1 and it takes a longer time to wait for the confirmations. But because you want it to arrive instantly, you pay an additional fee of another $1 or $2 in order to speed up the confirmation. Though the scenario is making you pay more than that regular fee, perhaps this is a solution for impatient people, however, I don't see it was a doubled charge but it is because we wanted it to happen.",

Most exchange uses 3 or above confirmations to make sure no one would double-spend the transaction and even one confirmation will need huge power to reverse or to double-spend the transaction but only transaction with RBF.Before there were some online shops that I heard accepting BTC with 0 Confirmations they were bankrupt due to this issue and they learn that is why they now wait for 3 confirmations to make sure the transaction is irreversible.",

I have never done a transaction and got double spend in BTC, even there was a day I tried to make transaction with about 0.009 BTC and that was all I wanted to send at once so I initiated the transaction first with my trustapp but saying pending but I m still having the btc in my wallet was just surprised what was happening. So I tried sending same amount to same wallet they it refuses.Now taking of bank double charged you, to me it has happened almost in every month or so, but with the type of account I m holding I got immediately reversed without waiting for 24hrs or more. My advise to you is to visit your bank withdraw the amount you planned to used for the week and keep save in your house maybe anytime you would want to visit the shopping mall go with the cash otherwise most of shopping center are not considerate you could get disgrace with what would happen to you.",

Even if you have 100 BTC on one address and spend 0.01 BTC of those bitcoin, none of the other 99.99 BTC will have the same previous transaction as the 0.01 BTC you spent, meaning the transaction you made spending 0.01 BTC cannot be repeated or used again in order to double charge you.Double charging in fiat is when a malicious or bugged receiver pulls two sets of fiat from the spender. Double spending in bitcoin is when a malicious spender sends the same coin to two places, although obviously it will only ever end up in one of those places.",
