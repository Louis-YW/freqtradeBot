If the crypto is prohibited in your region and you are using your Bank account for P2P activities, whenever the Bank will find something suspicious they will notify you according to the official guideline in the case of continuation they can directly freeze your account at any time.This is what happened with some of my fellows in my country who were providing the Buying and Selling Services of USDT and other Crypto pairs.",

When the bank blocked the account, saying that it did not like the replenishment of 7000 hryvnia, I could not explain what kind of transfer it was, since webmoney is prohibited and blocked in Ukraine.So, you did a P2P on Binance and then someone transferred you $200 and you got blocked, did I understand correctly? You aren't banned on Binance, yeah?When you do P2P on Binance, it looks like someone is just sending you some money on your bank account, like, friend, for example. If we negotiate on Binance and I ask you for $100 deposit on my Alpha Bank account in exchange of I sending you 100 USDT on Binance platform, then you received 100 USDT on Binance while you send $100 on my Alpha Bank account, this is how the situation looks like and no one knows exactly in bank why this or that person paid you and it's not visible for them to know whether this money actually comes from sold coins or not, unless that person writes that in transaction's description.If your Alpha Bank account got locked because of that, probably your bank controls people too much and every single transaction is dangerous, which I doubt, especially in Ukraine. Or another reason will be that someone was a known fraud and tried to launder money through you. It can also be that someone's account got hacked and then he filled a claim and you as the receiver of some funds from him, got problems.Quote from: gnuuser on July 28, 2023, 08:27:36 AMI'm wondering how you can get a lock on payer, advcash and perfectmoney.

Cant your request for the account to be reopened with some strong argument? Hmm, Webmoney and P2P on Binance with the 1000 USD is really not a big deal because the 1000 USD can not be considered as a major Black sourced money, or whatever reason they are imposing on transfer. For that amount, I'm wondering if they will never take the strict action of account blockage you should need to find the other flaws.Hmm, It will not an issue to have such turnover on the WebMoney exchanger like MoneyGram, Skrill or any other exchanger you are talking about.",

I am fine using binance to enter the market, there are other third party places that helps it as well. So, it is from my fiat in bank to crypto in binance and then crypto in finance into fiat in my bank. That's how I do it and I believe that it could be the perfect system, shouldn't really be anything different.I believe that we can't really make more or change anything, that is why I believe that we can make it work. I know that it is going to matter a lot if we care or not, because if we care then we are going to trade very well on anywhere and we would be making a profit and it could be great. I know that it is not going to be simple though, hence we need patience and hard work.",

Restricted accounts sometimes are cause by third party payment which is not allowed in Binance. Everytime you trade with P2p you must follow the instructions very carefully and comply P2p policies. As what I have heard, the reason why some funds in the bank transferred from Binance got lock or hold is because of that third party payment which is the money was came from illegal or fraudulent activities and not from Binance. So we should have to be aware with this kind of stuff to avoid circumstances in the future.Aside from that, I'm not sure if it's really prohibited in your place because it still in the list of payments.",
