This idea will serve as a means of employment and also increase the acceptance of Bitcoin as payment in El Salvador. Only the news of this will have a positive impact on Bitcoin and the crypto market at large.",

Because we all know without providing them the knowledge they needed. It gives the vibe , that things are forced upon them. And they had no other option but to accept the BTC and from 2021 to till now they had not started the education program. It is so shocking for me. Well! What we can do, \"They dance to the beat of their own clock\". I hope things will change for them while things changed for the neighbor country of El-Salvador. As they did not accepted the BTC as legal tender but they ad adopting it at mass level. Besides all this, I had this feeling in mind way before when El-Salvador adopted the BTC as legal tender. That they are adopting it at the wrong time. At least the time of accumulation was wrong because BTC was already at its high and they bought it and after that price came down and till now the country is suffering from financial problems. But as I said, things will change for them once the price of BTC will make new ATH.",

I understand your concern about El-Salvador, buy in that time is not wrong decision because no one can say what will happen next. El-Salvador government have big plans for there country because even when the price is going down is still putting more effort to spread the awareness of bitcoin and the cryptocurrency at large.Talking about there financial challenges, don't consider that as there involvement in crypto that brought the challenges, almost some of the countries of the world are facing the same thing, which they are not involve in bitcoin. I think the El-Salvador government is also looking for a way to solve the problem this financial problem that why Bitcoin is now going to be a subject in school.",

It is so shocking for me.  In a modern society things are ought not to be done in a rush manner but in an organized and coordinated way and I think that's what the El Salvador government had taken time to map out since 2021. What would have mede it seem forceful on the people was if the education was immediately thrown on them but rather they were given time to understand and have contact with the technology. For me the timing wasn't wrong and shouldn't be shocking but rather should be welcomed.",

What doesn't make sense is that you think that other governments in the world will go in the same direction just because El Salvador did it.Imagine the situation if the US, the UK or the EU declare Bitcoin legal tender and start telling everyone to use it instead of national currencies. El Salvador replaced their national currency with $ 20+ years ago, so they are in a specific situation where they can experiment with Bitcoin.Given that there is a main topic about El Salvador in the Bitcoin Discussion, I wonder why there is a new topic at all and why in Beginners & Help?",

I am not surprise at it because before taking decisions on what to do next as a country that has adopted bitcoin,you must first observe the rate of adoption of bitcoin and what will be a barrier to the adoption. Bukele has seen that the knowledge is important if the country wants everybody to adopt it,and he has also seen that the youths are the leaders of tomorrow. This is why he has chosen to train 150 teachers to be grounded on the basics of bitcoin,so that these teachers can impact the knowledge on their students. So many benefits will be achieved by El Salvador citizens from bitcoin and it blockchain. El Salvador wants to use bitcoin to step out from poor economy in the nearest future.",

El Savador government try to make Bitcoin as beneficial payment currency in the future and teach their student how to understand well and easily for earning profit through Bitcoin.

This initiative is really great and the way is good because kids will learn it and those who will show interest might provide some useful insights in the development of new technologies based on TC blockchain. New innovation might be made, but till then I hope such programs might start in my country too. But the chances are very rare. As crypto is ban but we are not stopped or restricted by the government o learn about crypto so we can learn about it on our own while governments are unable to fulfill the full facilities even in simpler studies then thinking about Crypto is not a normal thing. And a matter of fact, most of the political leaders do not want their supports to be educated about something by using which people could expose them. Just saying.",

It's a really appreciable innovation done by EI Salvador. This will provide more information to young ones and also the potential benefits of it and inform more people which lead to more adaptation of Bitcoin. The EI Elavador is adopting the right strategy by teaching about Bitcoin in the schools which will reach a large number of people at the right time because the young will understand it better and watching them the other schools will also adopt this trend which will make the whole country towards bitcoins.Bitcoin is a new technology but it gaining popularity in the world and learning about it is more likely to adopt it.

Before now some NGO like Mi Primer Bitcoin has taken it upon themselves to be going around in schools to teach students about Bitcoin.

But it is obvious that these students will be introduced to the basics of bitcoin like wallets, transactions, security, etc. And it also seems like the target is high school students which is okay. Teaching children who are less than twelve years old might not be the right decision because they might not understand the concept. There is also a report that participants are given a diploma certificate that is nationally recognized. An undiluted Bitcoin education is needed globally. People need to know about Bitcoin and its benefits to individuals, businesses, and institutions. So it's great news to know that over 25,000 students have learned about bitcoin in El Salvador and this awareness is moving to other Latin American countries like Uruguay and Cuba.
