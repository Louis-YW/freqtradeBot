  "content": "Hi, I've downloaded the latest version of Bitcoin Core and got the indexing up to date bar about 30 minutes. I've tried a) importing the old wallet.dat by locating the backup version and copying and pasting it over the version in the bitcoin directory and b) by using the file/restore wallet function to do, as I understand it, essentially the same thing. In both cases, the outcome is the same, when I try to open the wallet (which isn't passworded that I can recall) the opening wallet field flashes green in the same manner as the processing blocks field flashes green while it's updating and keeps on (and on and on) doing it.Is that what I'm supposed to see? It's been years since I did this and from what I can remember once I'd loaded the backed up wallet then it would open straightaway. Of course the database is much, much bigger now which might be the problem... so am I using the right procedure here?Â  Thanks :-)",

When you move a wallet.dat file from one machine or core install to another by default it is going to want to scan the entire block chain to find all the transactions that may be associated with this wallet.On older / slower machines it will take some time. -Dave",

Like there is the abortrescan RPC call when you launch Bitcoin Core from the terminal.I have not used the GUI wallet for quite some time, so I am not sure if this feature actually exists, but checking just now on Github, it appears that this feature request was rejected for not being popular enough.",
