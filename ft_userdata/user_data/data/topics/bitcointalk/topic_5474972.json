I really love the idea of fantasy theme but it gets old really quick so hopefully you can do some sort of new stuff like blending of the said themes but who am I to say much right? Do some screenshots of your progress here using TalkImg, other users can help with the problem of the image not showing up.Here's the link to the TalkImg websiteCode:TalkImg.com",

If so, personally i find the game rather boring. And since Satoshi Nakamoto is anonymous, i prefer if your video game doesn't show face of Satoshi at all.",

Now this has become a thing of the past and the games are incredibly advanced, so young people will never like these old games.I know that it is an educational game primarily through entertainment. Education through entertainment is a very effective way to consolidate information in the mind in a very easy way. But the problem is that if this game is aimed at educating young people about Bitcoin, it will not be attractive to them or attract their attention. Therefore, the game will not achieve the main goal.Therefore, if this game could be developed in the future into 3D, it would be of much greater benefit and impact.",

      "body": "well, this is a pretty good game with an interesting retro concept and suitable for people who like the retro game genre. from the gameplay video that i watched, this game contains a character who just walks around and finds people to find out their stories about bitcoin, maybe that sounds quite boring. it would be good if you could add several features such as;- a private room in which there is a computer that can be used for bitcoin mining and a browser where he can browse forums to earn money and for trading.- a place where there are shops that allow him to use his bitcoins to buy various goods- an office where he can work and earn money- a place to socialize and increase his experience in bitcoin.i know that it's quite complicated to develop a game like that, but if you can add features like that, i'm sure your game can be even more exciting.",

      "body": "@cyberhermitA couple of suggestions:Considering that the potential audience of this game would come from different parts of the world, I think it'd be better to replace the English white paper link with the following \"link\" that contains various types of translations.Personally, I didn't like the route you took to show how/why John Galt became interested in Bitcoin [its soaring value (IMO, it'd attract the wrong type of users)]... Alternatively, you can pick the sanctions route.- Apart from that, everything else was great.",

      "body": "Congratulations on getting a game out dedicated to Bitcoin. Here are few features that I felt should be added before the final release.1. You should focus on mobile version than desktop..2. The background music should be similar to the best known 2D projects or better than it.3. The written words should be as subtitles rather part of the project. 4. The graphics are good but lack clarity.You can come up with a funding proposal. It would help you to make your animation professional and reachable to anyone who is watching reels or tiktok.",

Although as said by the other members, there can be a lot of improvements but as a start, you did great. I like RPG games but I think you can summarize most of the talks to lessen the boredom of the players since it's an RPG game, most talks or quests aren't that long because it's really going to make the player tired reading all of those lines and just want to play the game. Can't wait to see how the progress will be.",
