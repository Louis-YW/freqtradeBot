Since you already have a good position with average buy price of 19K, Wait a bit for correction is the right thing to do because your initial investment is already on profit and there’s no need to chase for more profit by buying on a pumped price. But of course this depends on your terms of investment. If you are looking for a long term investment such as a year or more, The price doesn’t matter whether it’s currently pumped or dumped because this price movement is only short term while you can average your buy a lot more on the following months coming.",

During investing, it is good to be patient.Some people have a target, it can be $25000 or $30000 before they will no more start to invest. People that want to invest for long term can use this kind of strategy because they believe bitcoin will reach all-time-high again and they are going to gain. Some people can just take part of the money weekly and later invest the remaining if the price of bitcoin decrease. Some people will continue to DCA as they know that bitcoin price is still not high enough.",

I suggest to make your buy schedule bi-weekly to make sure you can average your buy evenly and for a less hassle of buying frequently.Yeah, There’s no harm on halting to buy for and wait for another good entry since you have a lot of time to DCA. Buy as low as possible without rushing things. Keep it up!",

Sometimes it will be pulled back and you win with your waiting. Sometimes, it skyrockets and you fail with your waiting then end with buying at higher price than like $24,600 today.By predicting price, peak and bottom, you are breaking core idea of DCA that is to eliminate emotion and psychological effects.",

Just wondering what everyone else does, do you buy the same amount each time or less as its more expensive? It's always good to keep your eyes open while doing DCA. So I wouldn't suggest you to invest same amount in all market conditions. Rather, invest more when the price is less than your average buying price and invest less when it is higher. That's the wisest route to take. Because if you keep investing same amount when the price is higher, you will risk increasing your average price.

Important for OP to consider where the market is now. Is it in a bull market or in a bear market? If OP thinks it is a in a bear market (I agree with), it is good to continue DCA.In addition, if OP believes that in future, just with a next bull run, after a next halving in 2024, Bitcoin will at least reclaim its all time high nearly $70,000 or better make a new all time high above $70,000, price around $25,000 is a dream for many people just next one more year.If OP agrees with me on these two points, why stop DCA with price under $25,000?",

If in terms of money I spend to buy BTC or in terms of my fiat currency with the same value regardless of BTC price fluctuations because this is based on the presentation of spending for investment, even though the amount of BTC you get when doing DCA is sometimes a little and sometimes more because of fluctuations it is very confusing if you think deeply about buying DCA when you want a large amount of BTC to get, in this case I have additional funds to buy when it goes down to buy more BTC and treat disappointment when doing DCA at high prices in previous time.",

Just wondering what everyone else does, do you buy the same amount each time or less as its more expensive? It's as simple as this: If within 1 week you always take the time to buy then there is a 7 day option to make a purchase. So you don't need to force yourself to buy when it's green, because within a week you can have 7 choices and will definitely be adjusted to the price when a correction occurs. DCA is a good step, but choosing a purchase at the right time also requires careful consideration.",

Try to tweak your strategy.I mean in times like this where the market is pumping, it's pretty obvious that you don't want to buy Bitcoin and wait for it to go down at least. Keep the money that you want to use for this week and use it next week or until it goes down. After all, you are doing DCA \"weekly\" and there are still a few days left to end the week. Maybe we might see a bit of a downward movement after this pump (which is what always happens), and that's the time where you need to buy Bitcoin.As for what I'm doing when I'm seeing pumps, nothing . Maybe I'm a bit happy to see a pump but, I'm not buying when a pump happens, but at the same time, I'm not also selling when a pump happens unless, it's time for me to sell (I've have my own strategy of selling some of my Bitcoins). Keep your money for the week if it does not go down. be patient and wait for the dump to happen. Tweak your strategy. Have some Plan B's and Plan C's.",
