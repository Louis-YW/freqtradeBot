Having liabilities higher than assets, the assets will probably be liquidated at a bargain price, and the little that is taken out will be used to pay creditors, but those who had something invested there can take it for granted that they will lose at least a part and most likely lose a large part.",

This is same when Terra UST collapse before. That's why I say. And it doesn't just happen with cryptocurrencies. When a company goes bankrupt there are always those who had invested everything in that company, or even borrowed money to invest. Pathetic stories, as in the article you link, which refers to a reddit post: :Quote one user shared their troubles hours after Celsius posted its announcement. “I had all of my savings I’ve been building for 20 years in Celsius. I don’t know what to do. I have my 2nd child on the way and a mortgage to pay for…” the post read. “My wife has no idea. I am so scared on what to do. I am thinking of just ending it. It would be easier than suffering through this major loss. My whole life. Gone. I don’t know where to go or what to do.”  Another reddit post:https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/vyi07y/my_life_savings_are_lost_and_ive_managed_to_ruin/QuoteMy life savings are lost, and I've managed to ruin my lifeAbout three months ago I deposited my life savings to Celsius in order to earn yield while waiting to find a nice apartment to buy for myself.I've managed to lose it all. I've been working for this money since I was 16, now I've lost it all.My life is ruined and I will never be the same person after this.Some of these stories may be made up, but I'll bet most of them are true.",
