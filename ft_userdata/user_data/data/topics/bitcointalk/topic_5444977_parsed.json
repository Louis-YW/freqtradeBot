I just realized this is a different wallet I created (using the same password). What happened to my original wallet? I think I just lost $900 sending it to a wallet I can no longer find.",

      "body": "Question for you, OP:What wallet app did you use to create the old wallet?Do you save your seeds elsewhere, or do you judt view it in your profile settings when needed?Have you ever shared your seed, or used a shared device?In my mind, you never sent those $900 btc, you just accessed another wallet because of the wrong seed. Try to find the txid of the $900 bitcoin you sent to the old address to see if the balance is still ok.",
