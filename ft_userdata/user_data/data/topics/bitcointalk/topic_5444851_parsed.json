Something very important came into me to know how do you feels whenever someone said of their investment and how it yielded and they made fortune out of it. By just reading and scrolling here in the forum, I've seen a lot of different stories like they succeed and some loss a huge amount of assets. I conclude that it depends on people's action in this industry whether they can profit big time or not. Of course as I saw successful experiences of other people I feel happy for them and congratulate them.Those kinds of experiences inspires me and motivates me to have a wise decision sharing their thoughts would also help how can I also to be like them.

If you always feel fomo it will just lead to bad decisions and losses in this industry. Much better to learn more and explore more rather than rushing yourself in this industry, go learn have some knowledge and experiences first. And if I were in theirplace, I must say I could utilize those opportunity, there's nothing to be fear of having risk if you know what you're capable of.",

I am happy for people who can make money through BTC, but i do not want many people to feel that BTC investment is a means of making a fortune. If everybody shares stories of how they made fortunes through investing in BTC, we cannot even know if the stories are fake or true, but newbies would take it to be true and they may start investing with the hope of making a fortune, which may not happen, and they would not even attempt to learn a thing about BTC, which could make them lose their BTC.Quote from: Cryptomiles1 on March 14, 2023, 10:52:45 AMDo you feels your late getting involved to the industry and do you wishes to be like them, and if you were in their shoes would you be able to utilize those opportunity they got or you won't afford to bear the risk and get involved?I don't know the exact group of people you are talking about, but what i know is that i don't feel late about the time i got involved in BTC investment, but i know if i was involved in BTC very early on, i would have sold a long time ago, but i would have continued to buy more since then, through dca.",

I honestly regret that I once unfollowed the crypto world thinking it was too late.  Currently I have about $3,000 in various types of portfolios and I'm sure in the next 3 to 4 years I will get some profit from them",

Because this is where we can learn and also gain knowledge about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and also teach and provide the best information in terms of profit.but you also have to know because out there there are still many investors who experience losses, and that's because they don't get a useful space for them to have enough knowledge about bitcoin and do it without knowledge that makes them wrong and lose.and I don't think it's ever too late to get involved with bitcoin, because bitcoin is the future and also the best long term in terms of profits and also to minimize losses. So do it as long as you have the desire before repeating the delay and regretting it again, and study everything well and don't be lazy to read before getting involved.",

So I don't feel sorry that I didn't get in on Bitcoin early, and I don't regret any of mine Bitcoin-related decisions. I'm happy to read successful stories of others, I'm glad that some people knew how to do it right and managed to benefit greatly from that. Also, I feel like I'm a risk-averse person, so I probably would not have risked investing in Bitcoin early on and not selling the minute it starts costing something significant. I did, after all, invest in Ethereum at $16, but I sold at $300. So it would have been similar with Bitcoin, even if I managed to invest in the first place.",

Everything changed for him because his financial status was very good since he got to know bitcoin, but I was very touched to hear his stories and the struggle before he got to know bitcoin.

Personally, I feel happy for those who are successful in their Bitcoin venture and feel sorry for those who lost huge amounts of money because of scam companies.   We should be vigilant in our venture into the cryptocurrency industry, many people who participate in this industry are just waiting for the right time to trick others.",
