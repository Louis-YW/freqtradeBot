  "content": "I decided to do a throwback today. Do you remember the first bitcoin website in 2009? I guess not. I made use of the Wayback Machine (archive.org). Archive.org is a website that archives internet stuff for the future. To get archived picture of the first Bitcoin website from 2009. I simply entered the URL - bitcoin.org in their search box provided and below is what I got.Image source: https://web.archive.org/web/20090722011820/http://www.bitcoin.org/Of all the changes I noticed, the one I want to point out is the one that is written - QuoteThere are two ways to send money. If the recipient is online, you can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public key and send the transaction with comments.  We no longer need to enter a recipient's IP address blah blah blah...we just use the recipient's bitcoin address to send money whether they are online or offline.What other changes did you notice from the first bitcoin website?",

So this is actually the way the first website looked ?  Well I had no idea about it old looks and since am familiar with this new look, this image you post kinda looks bizzare and too plain. Well what would you have anyone expect, I mean it was the early stages so a lot of corrections was still going on and that same the way the price of bitcoin was also poor but evolution is rather constant and thats why both the website and the actual coin itself has evolved so greatly and I know there are still more upgrades to come in more in this crypto journey.",

Since Bitcoin doesn't actually have an official website.It was crazy back then, looking at the way it appeared, although I didn't experience or notice all of this. But it could have been crazed to some point because you will need the attention of both the sender and receiver of the coin to be actively available before one can conclude a successful transaction, which could have been hectic. Thank God for development. But I think this old form of sending will be faster and almost drop in an instance since it sends using an IP address, so there will be no form of block confirmation needed.",

It seems that you would always get a new public key if you wanted to send bitcoin to somebody, but intead needed to know his IP address.Can somebody explain more how this worked and when this was changed? Seems to me that this was only a very basic version of that bitcoin that we know today and a wallet that was used then would not be able to be used today?",

Now we doesn't want to add the ip address during transaction. Earlier those were all needed, which might've looked an easy thing in the past, now such usage will surely considered something far back in development. What we use at the present looks perfectly developed and nothing more required to make things easy access, over time upcoming generation will find this to be behind in development. Only time can give the answer about the changes that's gonna happen.",

Because ip address could be used to track anybody (or receiver too) then what purpose of BTC's anonymity and decentralization remains there. Well, i think, back then, most of the people preferred offline way (by using wallet address). Because this can not be linked to any single entity's ID. I am happy this method doesn't exist now. Well, the layout was simple and User friendly back then too. Which is a good sign but other than that i can not find another difference, as this also shows the confirmation status, plus i think today we do not get to see the \"message option\" as it was back then. Or maybe we still have that option but rarely of usage. I was totally unaware of this tool you used and it is really great Thanks for it.",

The bitcoin.org domain was registered by Satoshi. As the original creator, there is no one more official than him when it comes to Bitcoin. A lot of things changed after he left.",

Seems to me that this was only a very basic version of that bitcoin that we know today and a wallet that was used then would not be able to be used today?A simple search from the internet states that the feature is removed when Bitcoin core v0.8.0 was released.For how it works.QuoteSending bitcoins to an IP address was a convenient way of sending bitcoins to a Bitcoin address along with additional information.Your client contacts the IP address to find out if they're actually running Bitcoin and accepting IP transactions. If not, no transaction occurs.Your additional information (\"from\", \"message\", etc.) is exchanged with the server.The server generates a brand new Bitcoin public key and sends it to your client.Your client sends coins to this public key.And it was removed for this reason:QuoteUnfortunately, the implementation provided no authentication, so any \"man in the middle\" could have intercepted your bitcoins during the transaction. When they see that you're sending a Bitcoin payment by IP address, they pretend to be the actual destination and send back their Bitcoin address. You end up sending bitcoins to the wrong person. It's therefore no longer a good idea to send bitcoins in this way, especially if you're using a proxy.Looking at how far the development of Bitcoin is astonishing.  From Legacy Address (address starting with 1), to P2SH(address starting with 3) to segwit (bc1) to taproot (bc1q). Developers are always working hard to give us premium service while minimizing the fee and enhancing the privacy and security of our transactions.Source: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/IP_transaction",
