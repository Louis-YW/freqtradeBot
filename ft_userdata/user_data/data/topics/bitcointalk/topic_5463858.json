So don't spam my topics with your pseudo-righteous, butt-hurt content.Quote from: jgarzik on April 13, 2012, 01:59:33 AMThe Press board replaces the Bitcoin press hits, notable sources thread.  The original motivation of the thread was to collect links that fit Wikipedia's definition of Notability.  Once bitcoin was deemed sufficiently notable (a milestone!), the thread became an ongoing log of links.  Discussion was discouraged.(...)The main goal is to keep the noise down.",
