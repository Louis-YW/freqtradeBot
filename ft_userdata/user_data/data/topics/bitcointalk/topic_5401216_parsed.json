      "body": "Yes clipboard malware has been around for a while and many have been victimized because of this, especially those who are in a rush and not double ot triple checking the address. I also assume that you didn’t install any antivirus software like Avast.I have installed it on my computer and have paid subscription along the way just to fully protect my computer from further incoming malware. It’s my mistake back then of not installing the antivirus which leads my wallet to get hacked for allowing myself to download the ZIP file with malware inside. I lost $12k that time and I still feel a bit of pain and regret of it though.Make sure you backup all of your important files before making the full reset of your OS. Don’t delay. Just do it before something worse happens later on.",

Remember do you install pirated, shady applications, or do internet-related activities that might compromise your device(e.g. opening a file from spam email, etc). It's a good idea if you comprehend why you got infected in the first place, that should make you aware of what things you did with your device to prevent future security concerns.",

It is better for you to save the recovery phrases in a safe place and reinstall the system on the device to avoid the risk of theft. You should know very well that many users have lost their money due to the spread of viruses on the Internet. You can also use one of the paid antivirus programs to avoid machinations!!!",

This will help also. Scammers watch on their prey on a slightest mistake to attack your system or phone. To avoid this kind of problem is to avoid clicking random links or making download from untrusted website. Hackers know it is easier to get hold on people through porn sites, people fall more because of nudity.",
