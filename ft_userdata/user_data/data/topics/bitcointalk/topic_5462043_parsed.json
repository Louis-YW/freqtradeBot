  "content": "Introducing Rethereum: The Ethereum Restart Project Rethereum is a new blockchain project that aims to revive the original vision of Ethereum as a global, decentralized platform for money and new kinds of applications. Rethereum is based on a modified version of the Ethereum Go client, which is a fork of the official 1.11.6 release. This was the final release to support Proof-of-Work. Rethereum is not just another Ethereum clone.  It has several unique features that make it stand out from the crowd. Here are some of them:ETHash-B3: Rethereum uses a new Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm that replaces the hash functions and DAG generation of ETHash with Blake3.  This should allow for a natural progression of the chain from CPU mining to GPU mining, as well as improved security and performance.RTH: Rethereum has its own native currency, RTH, which is used to pay for transactions and smart contracts on the network.  RTH has a fixed supply schedule that starts with 4 RTH per block and gradually decreases to 1 RTH per block after 9 years.  The total supply up to 9 years will be 124,438,360 RTH, plus block fees and uncle rewards.Compatibility: Rethereum is fully compatible with the Ethereum protocol, which means that it can run any Ethereum smart contract or decentralized application (dapp) without any modification. Rethereum also supports the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20) token standard, which allows for interoperability with other blockchain platforms.Innovation: Rethereum is not afraid to experiment with new ideas and features that can improve the user experience and functionality of the network. For example, Rethereum has plans to move the reward model to a 2.1% inflation target in the future, which could provide more stability and sustainability for the network.Why Rethereum? Rethereum was born out of a desire to preserve and enhance the original spirit of Ethereum as a platform for innovation and creativity. Ethereum has grown tremendously since its inception in 2015, but it has also faced some challenges and trade-offs along the way. One of the most controversial decisions in Ethereum’s history was the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, which is still ongoing. While Proof-of-Stake has many advantages over Proof-of-Work in terms of scalability and energy efficiency, it also introduces new risks and complexities, such as centralization, censorship, and security. Rethereum believes that Proof-of-Work is still a viable and valuable consensus mechanism that can provide security, decentralization, and fairness for a blockchain network.  Proof-of-Work also enables anyone with a computer to participate in the network and earn rewards, without having to stake or lock up their funds. Rethereum also believes that there is still room for improvement and innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem, especially in terms of user experience, performance, and functionality.  Rethereum wants to offer users and developers a platform that is fast, reliable, and easy to use, while also supporting cutting-edge features and applications.How to join Rethereum? Rethereum is currently in its pre-launch phase, which means that anyone can join the network and start mining or using RTH. You will be able to download the latest version of the Rethereum Go client from our github  You can also join the Rethereum community on Discord to stay updated on the latest news and developments. You can also find more information about Rethereum on its official website: http://rethereum.org. (Under development) Rethereum is an exciting new project that aims to bring back the original vision of Ethereum as a platform for money and new kinds of applications. If you are interested in joining this project or learning more about it, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us or visit our website. We look forward to seeing you on Rethereum!LinksBuy RTH: https://safe.trade/trading/rthusdtDiscord: https://discord.gg/xCB4AJDEFbWebsite: https://www.rethereum.orgDownload: https://github.com/Rethereum-blockchain/go-rethereum/releasesOur github org: https://github.com/Rethereum-blockchainExplorer: https://explorer.rethereum.org/----More updates to come soon.This project is still in active development and project updates will posted on our discord as well as here.",

Where is the GPU miner that the controversial Rethereum project has been hiding from the very beginning?There is no miner we are hiding. A member of the community created there own private miner. Everything we have built is open source and released on our github. Non of the rethereum devs have any experiance with opencl or cuda to create a GPU miner. We looked into it, it was too hard for us, we asked reputable miner devs to add the algo.",
