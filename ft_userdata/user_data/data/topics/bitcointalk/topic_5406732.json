But ratio-wise the ration of usage for illegal activities compared to anything else is so much lower when compared with fiat. In other words if people were worried about a currency being used for illegal activities they should stop using fiat.",

As for said of ponzi schemes because people do not understand why the price of bitcoin can go up or down.",

In other words if people were worried about a currency being used for illegal activities they should stop using fiat.That's true, usage of fiat is more for illegal use than the use of bitcoin. It's harder to trace and even finger prints, it couldn't be traced there if those people doing illegal transactions are aware of it, they'll just use those gloves or will simply glue their hands to avoid being traced through their marks and finger prints.The belief of being used illegally is still there and I think it will be long until the majority and newbies would come to realize that fiat is more dominant in that case.Quote from: Lanatsa on July 18, 2022, 11:54:46 PMThey are simply just missing out the opportunity on making a great or good investment specially now that we are on dip or possible bottom of 20k+ price which we might not able to see in future years to come once againif the market starts to make out some significant movement in price then to those who do jumped in are the ones who would really benefit out and to those who do keep on doubts and still scared to engage on will reallymiss out the train.Its just like that where people who dont like to take risk will not gain something but of of course every investment does have its own risk then its up to someone to accept on it.I've been on this market for lots of years and this isnt a smooth sail ride to have.Missing out is one reason and they have thought about buying when the price was high and when it has dropped too much, that desire is gone in an instant because it changes their mind.And thinks that it will be long time again before bitcoin recovers but, the easy logical understanding is to look through its history. Bitcoin may down for sometime but in the long run, it will dominate again and will reach new all time highs and lows.",

The only people who do think about that is honestly who are either owning a bank or either they are actually in the government, the new mentality is way different, when we talk about ' Bitcoins ' we are not talking about an investment and also the most dominating and strong cryptocurrency which is very well known around the world that it is now being taken as a solution for most of the issues like inflation and it's going to be inevitably used for things like money laundering but everything is used for it to be honest, be it fiat or even good or other precious metals.",
