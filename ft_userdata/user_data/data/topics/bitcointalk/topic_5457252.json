As you have posted here so you did there before. I expected you to edit it and add whatever you want to add rather than deleting and creating a new thread with replica of what was written on the deleted thread.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457233.msg62445249#msg62445249 Come to talk of it. Your introduction and announcement seems very poor with no or little information about the casino. This is why you are advised to take out time to go through the platform so as to know what is obtainable here.I think you will have to upgrade your account to a copper member so as to be able to upload pictorial excerpts from your website for view.Nevertheless, you have a question pending answers as to why your white paper was a product of plagiarism here;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457233.msg62446152#msg62446152",

Secondly who does gambling with real money to get fun and have a good time lol? This statement is completely controversial. Nevertheless the announcement thread could have been more better in design. You could have just used images to enhance your post and make more people interested about it. Regarding the name, why did you choose “Tron” ? Is it because, it rhymes with fun or Tron is the primary coin to gamble in the site? If site is not accepting Bitcoins, then this thread needs to be moved to Altcoins Section here in the forum.",

It is too early to judge about the capability of the platform, but we need to see some improvements in the near future. Also, based on the terms, they will ask kyc if deem necessary. But before they start asking for kyc, make sure they have their gambling license already.Because in case of big winnings and they start asking for your credentials, I don't think it is fair from the player to submit his personal details if you are not licensed yet.But I do like the combination of payment method here, TRX is one of the fastest and cheapest alts that you can use for any transaction.",
