You can replace the GPU fan yourself, the high availability of GPU fans in the after-market. While you can only RMA the card when VRAM breaks or 3rd party GPU repair shop if the warranty expired. So the VRAM is under high priority even at the expense of the GPU fan, I think.",

So the VRAM is under high priority even at the expense of the GPU fan, I think.I bought a 10 year warranty with the card. So I prefer to follow the RMA route. The reason I ran the fan speed at 100% was because the GPU was in a nice glass cube case. Looks great but not ideal for cooling. After the fan fell off I moved the GPU to an open air rig and the temperatures were around 54C even at 120mh/s and only two fans running at around 75%. After I received the RMA I left the 3090 in the open air rig and moved a 1080TI to the glass cube case. If I ever move a 3090 or 4090 into the glass cube case I will go with a radiator version. The cube case has 128 GB RAM so I plan on using it for more than just crypto mining. And  I know the 4090 is not out yet, however when it does come out I will probably pick up two. Sounds like the 4090 will be a monster. Hopefully the 1000W power supplies I have in the glass cube and my main computer will be enough. They have a few hard drives and high powered CPUs so it might be close. Apparently the 4090 might max out 600w! I have a 1400W PSU that I can move into my main computer if needed.",

Many manufacturers do not supply the fans separate and don't want you to replace them yourselves.  The card has to be disassembled to replace the fan. Sure most of us can do that no problem. But if you have a warranty might as well use it. They basically send you a replacement card and once you receive it send back the damaged card with fan included. Only thing is with a RMA like this you have to leave a deposit, in some cases double the amount of the card. They did that because of scarcity of cards. Some people lied about damaged cards and once they received the replacement card just held on to it and parting with the deposit. By requesting a double deposit they are assured people won't play those tricks. So for a 3090 that means a deposit of around $4,000 for a RMA!I would imagine as the supply chain issue is resolved this double deposit amount would go away.",

I kept mining with only 2 fans on the 3090. Once I received the replacement card i shut down the faulty one and replaced it. Downtime was the time it took to replace the two cards, maybe 5-10 minutes tops. If the faulty 3090 ran with very high temps I would not have done that. However with only 2 fans working the temperatures were around 54-55c max since it was in an open air rig.",

If there was insurance at the time of purchase, then other options are possible, but a big plus is that after 45 days the seller must return a working video card or money to me.",
