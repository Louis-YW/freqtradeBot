  "content": "I wanted to do a file backup on mobile Electrum but I was unable to. This is the error: Code:Cannot save backup: PermissionError (13, 'permission denied')First questionWhat is causing the error?I thought I have made an Electrum backup before, but I am not able to remember if true or not, but I think so. The reason I want to experiment the backup is the Electrum pin, not the password. I know already that you need the existing password to use an encrypted file backup as the file is encrypted with the Electrum wallet password, which means if you want to recover a wallet from encrypted file backup, you need the password.Second questionBut what about the pin, if you have recovered you Electrum wallet, will the pin still be effective? Or the wallet won't no longer require pin if you want to check your seed phrase, private key and if you want to make transaction?Third questionHow can it be possible to successfully use file backup on mobile Electrum to recover your wallet on mobile phone? I remember I wanted to try it in the past, but I was unable to.",

Or the wallet won't no longer require pin if you want to check your seed phrase, private key and if you want to make transaction?PIN Code is the method that the wallet uses to sign transaction and therefore without it you may not be able to sign a transaction. The password is the key to decrypting your wallet file without it you need to brute force it to find your private keys.you can cancel PIN Code from the Settings page but if you miss your wallet open, anyone can send from it.",

Desktop Electrum has more features, clear and undebatable how desktop Electrum is far better. With sincerity, I prefer to use Bluewallet on mobile phone than Electrum because it has more features.",

In order for the second wallet to know about existence of the pin code, that information needs to be already saved on the wallet file. If you have the password required to decrypt the wallet then you can easily retrieve it, which makes it pointless.",

I read somewhere that this bug is occuring probably due to the \"scooped storage\" function which was first introduced in android 10. This stops some apps from accessing the system's external storage directly. But this wasnt the case for older android versions. Thats why users having android 9 and below aren't facing this issue.",
