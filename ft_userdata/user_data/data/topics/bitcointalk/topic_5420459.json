  "content": "The comedy in the cryptospace never stops. I am shaking my head so many times, my head is spinning hehehe.In Washington D.C., there was a bill that was proposed by Sam Bankrupt-Fried that would give the government more oversight and create more regulations on the cryptospace which would certainly make decentralization lose some of its advantages. It is a bill that might kill the cryptospace.He also caused the collapse that gave the lawmakers the reason to pass the bill into law a priority. I am beginning to be very skeptical of Sam. He might not only be another cryptobillionaire. His mother is a lawyer of Hillary Clinton and an active member of the Democratic party. I will post more information if I can find them. They are easy to find. If you can help me, share them, thank you.The bipartisan authors of Senate legislation that would increase oversight of cryptocurrencies considered to be digital commodities in the U.S., like bitcoin, plan to move forward with the bill.Embattled FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had been the strongest industry proponent of the bill, known as the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act. The bill would grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the two U.S. markets regulators, more power over cryptocurrency markets and exchanges.Read in full https://www.theblock.co/post/185746/senators-moving-forward-with-sbf-backed-bill-after-ftx-collapse",

      "body": "to understand some basicsas a security/property/currency bitcoin was regulated by the SEC, which had limited regulatory power only over things like money businesseshowever treating bitcoin as a commodity. means that other agencies can step inCFTC the commodities authority can set many things like quota's thus illegalising cryptos from making too many units or offering too many airdrops or premines or even try to close down cryptos that are managed centrallythey can partner with the EPA and get things like mining restricted, by telling energy companies to not supply businesses deemed as mining companies. under the pretence of climate change. think about other commodities like wheat and beef. CFTC and EPA monitor and set limits on farmers yield and also the health and safety of farming aswell as how much quota of produce can go to marketthe adaption of bitcoin to not just be bitcoin. but a main net. that then bridges to other networks like subnets(ln/liquid) and sidechains, has allowed the opening of the door to the jurisdiction of commodities regulation.because a commodity is simply a raw product used in the creation of other productsthough many see or want bitcoin to be a base product to then create new tokens/units of measure on other networks. the downside is opening it up to other agencies regulating more aspects of crypto/bitcoinit is a big shame that the big players of crypto businesses lobby FOR this transition to commodities. rather then stay unrestricted in the unregulated era of being a tradable product(pre sec:currency status) 2009-2014its even more shameful that FTX ceo is partners with greyscale/DCG CEO where by even they want bitcoin to be treated as a commodity because the SEC has not given exchanges the ability to open up ETF and their main hope is they will get ETF acceptance under commodity status.. and thats pretty much the big picture reason for their pro-commodity lobbying",

It is also very correct that our precious coins are safe in our decentralized wallets. But regardless of all its disadvantages, centralized platforms play important role in the Bitcoin space. They are the easiest way to have access to fiat, especially in nations that have not grown or developed their P2P platforms. Total regulation of this centralized platform would affect the crypto space negatively because many people rely solely on their services.",

Nobody will ever trust a man who mismanaged the assets handed to him by many people and investors. Now, this will be an open space to dig many dirt that we can find on Sam...sadly he just wasted a big opportunity and a big platform handed down to him by the industry. Right now, just like the Tera debacle, FTX will go down in crypto history as one of the saddest moments and one that is enormously undermining the trust and confidence of the mainstream population on cryptocurrency. On another note, just looking at Sam pictures, I now realized that he is really looking like a big joke with a 75% resemblance to comedian Jonah Hill.",

like Uberi dont view the SEC/CFTC as child of senators/congressmeninstead i see them as the mother and father of banks/financial industryi view SEC/CFTC not as a government department. but as a business.. they lobbied congress/senate decades ago to give their business powers that allow them to parent an industrysetting rules where by you have to buy a licence(membership) to be allowed to enter an industry(pay rent to live in the family). it helps avoid boiler room scammers just setting up shoddy banks. but also puts up barriers to ethical people that want to set up genuine money businesses to compete against the banks(unless your part of the elites)lets take DCG (coinbase, bitfinex, ftx) via their business connections of their elite social group they get to easily set up exchanges/businesses with no oversight. but they also know the best tax accountants and fiat law lawyers to know the loopholes to escape the costs of doing business, which more common folk dont get this privilege access toyes senators and congress have a say in what powers and actions the SEC/CFTC have and can use. because senate/congress control the law. but get bribed(ops i mean lobbied) to re arrange the law in businesses favourdecades of bribes and golden handshakes and buddy system allowed these regulators(businesses) to gain power and prestige pretending to be government departments. but in reality business partners of industrywe seen this with the bitlicence . the then head of SEC set up a bitlicence(membership NY businesses had to subscribe to) and once set up he resigned as regulator(job dne) and entered the business of bitlicence adviser taking extra fee's to guide businesses in the loopholes (of the rules he set up) to aid the business buddy system of who should enter the crypto world in NYthe regulators are businesses in of themselves getting money both from treasury to do the good deeds of law. and also the corporate money from business to do the deeds of banks..DCG(greyscale) wanted an SEC regulated ETF. but got pushed back. and so DCG and FTX now want to pivot bitcoin away from mommy and daddy SEC regulations and instead get adopted by foster parents CFTC.. even other regulators like the EPA(environmental protection) are a business. they have powers to shut down farms and tell power companies to not service certain industries.. if you stop viewing regulators as some trump/biden grandchild.and instead view them as business parents. where by they bribe, beg, coerce or blackmail government(senate/congress) via \"lobbying\" you start to see how trying to point fingers with \"biden/trump is /was spying on all your transactions\" (facepalm)and instead realise banks dont want competition who has less work but more profits.. the picture becomes clearerknowing the difference between:congress/senate (contracted men that like side deals)paper law (national/state level) which has no arms to punchlaw enforcement(idiots who like guns) employed to do raids and punchregulators (businesses with power) that can call on law enforcementbanks(that fear other financial industries/competing jurisdictions finance)MSB(lower level less elitist financial services) some are family some are outsiderscrypto code(rules of code) which has no ear to hear paper law and no body to be hit or arrestedyou learn the middle guys (banks) are the ones fighting to stay alive.. not the congress/senate......bitcoin itself as code if everyone just ran the same code and never changed. would be unstoppablethe \"safe\" of bitcoin is to not allow any business to coerce or mandate changes to code. not allow businesses to gain power to control the edges of bitcoin where people enter and exitwe need to fear firstly BUSINESSES (like DCG(blockstream devs, NY agreement economic nodes) and their CEO's that lobby to change regulator jurisdiction of the industry over all)then the regulators whom may gin powers to stifle mining locations or which merchants can startupthen lastly \"government\" but more so about how businesses (banks and MSB) lobby said government. rather than thinking that its a top down finger point of government downwards.. its actually the businesses upwards.. because .. \"capitalism\" not \"communism\"congress/senators do not call the FBI/SWAT to do raids on citizens.. thats just bad practice and not good for future election hopes of their careerwhat happens is BUSINESSES watch their customers and suspicious activity or activity one business doesnt like seeing another business do is reported to regulators.. the regulators then call on FBI/SWAT..th electric car industry sees crypto as a threat to the electric availability. if power is going to crypto then people wont want to buy electric cars due to lack of electric to drive to work. so the electric car industry(elon) is lobbying regulators to push hard on bitcoin businesses to be more \"environmental\"its not a biden decision top down. its a business lobby middle upbanks dont like non fiat becoming common money. thus there is a push to have crypto only as investment not money. again (middle up)then there are msb's  they also want to have their other financial products like ETF, sidechains and subnetworks. so they want regulation changes. but dont care about the other effects that can happen due to their selfish wants. heck they have been bribing the regulations middle up.. and also the devs at the bottom..",

the crypto world in NYthe regulators are businesses in of themselves getting money both from treasury to do the good deeds of law. and also the corporate money from business to do the deeds of banks..DCG(greyscale) wanted an SEC regulated ETF. but got pushed back. and so DCG and FTX now want to pivot bitcoin away from mommy and daddy SEC regulations and instead get adopted by foster parents CFTC.. even other regulators like the EPA(environmental protection) are a business. they have powers to shut down farms and tell power companies to not service certain industries.. if you stop viewing regulators as some trump/biden grandchild.and instead view them as business parents. where by they bribe, beg, coerce or blackmail government(senate/congress) via \"lobbying\" you start to see how trying to point fingers with \"biden/trump is /was spying on all your transactions\" (facepalm)and instead realise banks dont want competition who has less work but more profits.. the picture becomes clearerknowing the difference between:congress/senate (contracted men that like side deals)paper law (national/state level) which has no arms to punchlaw enforcement(idiots who like guns) employed to do raids and punchregulators (businesses with power) that can call on law enforcementbanks(that fear other financial industries/competing jurisdictions finance)MSB(lower level less elitist financial services) some are family some are outsiderscrypto code(rules of code) which has no ear to hear paper law and no body to be hit or arrestedyou learn the middle guys (banks) are the ones fighting to stay alive.. not the congress/senate......bitcoin itself as code if everyone just ran the same code and never changed. would be unstoppablethe \"safe\" of bitcoin is to not allow any business to coerce or mandate changes to code. not allow businesses to gain power to control the edges of bitcoin where people enter and exitwe need to fear firstly BUSINESSES (like DCG(blockstream devs, NY agreement economic nodes) and their CEO's that lobby to change regulator jurisdiction of the industry over all)then the regulators whom may gin powers to stifle mining locations or which merchants can startupthen lastly \"government\" but more so about how businesses (banks and MSB) lobby said government. rather than thinking that its a top down finger point of government downwards.. its actually the businesses upwards.. because .. \"capitalism\" not \"communism\"congress/senators do not call the FBI/SWAT to do raids on citizens.. thats just bad practice and not good for future election hopes of their careerwhat happens is BUSINESSES watch their customers and suspicious activity or activity one business doesnt like seeing another business do is reported to regulators.. the regulators then call on FBI/SWAT..th electric car industry sees crypto as a threat to the electric availability. if power is going to crypto then people wont want to buy electric cars due to lack of electric to drive to work. so the electric car industry(elon) is lobbying regulators to push hard on bitcoin businesses to be more \"environmental\"its not a biden decision top down. its a business lobby middle upbanks dont like non fiat becoming common money. thus there is a push to have crypto only as investment not money. again (middle up)then there are msb's  they also want to have their other financial products like ETF, sidechains and subnetworks. so they want regulation changes. but dont care about the other effects that can happen due to their selfish wants. heck they have been bribing the regulations middle up.. and also the devs at the bottom..However, I am not talking about the government and those politicians who have limited time in their positions under their 2-4 year contract. I am talking about those powerful people who put those politicians where they are. The real powers of the world. The Rothschild types, the Soros and those old families who really control the world. Those people who ordered the assasination of John F. Kennedy and who can make anyone disappear.",

Those people who ordered the assasination of John F. Kennedy and who can make anyone disappear.now your sounding tin foil hatty(your final sentence).soothe world bank level/ WEF..(the types of people you speak of) do have an agendathey dont care about individual countries fiat. because they are more involved in SDR's of international reserves. which they are migrating into a multi network of CBDC's (asia/euro m-bridge)their other plans are that oil/coal/gas was (even from the 1980's) known to be depleted by 2050 anyway. so they do have fingers in the \"climate 2050 deadline\" argument about national treasuries funding of keeping energy companies in profit while they pivot to renewablesyes they dont want users to have currencies working internationally away from the world bank system. but the world bank system as said previously is lobbied at the middle points of banks and businesses to change the laws of nations above the businesses. to then have more control of their customers below themi dont see the world bank people as puppet masters pulling strings above governments(pinocchio string puppet).. i see them as scrotum ticklers of governments (hands up the puppets bottom(kermit the frog)) reaching inside a government from underneath a government, which then allows them to set up regulatory bodies(businesses) below governmentbusinesses(underneath government) can and do set policies for their customers (contract law) i dont see sam(SBF) as part of the world bank club of soros and rothchild.. but as a business man he has his own wants/desires of shifting bitcoin to a commodity regulator and his other idea'smany busineses have their many different idea's and wants for how crypto affects their business and opportunities/access their businesses have want or dont want. we should not be going conspiracy theory of point finger at a single entity like there is a single master puppet master. but instead realise there are many business interests that want to change crypto to business whims and actually spot all these attemptsby decentralising and not relying on central businesses. we can fight against this. if they dont become important to crypto, they cant gain power over crypto.EG devs not being sponsored by large institutions/businesses that are regulatedEG exchange/gateways in and out of crypto not controlled by just a couple power house regulated exchanges, but multiple smaller ethical services that dont have much % of the crypto community as customers eachwe can as low level citizens/customers/users do thingsthings like protests do nothing. its just shouting at the air.we can lobby governments. again not via silly street parties and protests.. but using petitions(the contracts/methods banks use)wel can do 'bank runs' voting with our feet by taking assets out of exchanges(not your key not your coin events) to not give exchanges too much control of too much assets in one placewe can set up asic farms not in large warehouses of 1exahash.. but in multiple locations of shipping containers, or individuals in their spare roomswe can also more importantly. not rely on one software brand as the \"reference client\" where that reference client HAS implemented a mandatory change of the features without needing users to upgrade first to vote that feature in to then activate it",
