So as not to make the mistake that alot of centralized exchange user made in 2022 that made them loss a lot of the money.  Remember: Not your key, Not your coin",

      "body": "Sounds like good advice to follow in 2023 and beyond! Here are a few more suggestions for things to remember and avoid:- Always keep your crypto assets secure. The best way is to keep them in a hardware wallet or an offline wallet. Never leave your crypto on an exchange.- Don't fall for phishing attacks or scams on social media or email.- Be careful with what information you share online. While it might seem harmless now, it could come back to haunt you later.- Always do your own research before investing in anything new or unfamiliar.- Don't be greedy. - Don't fall for pump and dumps. You should never invest in something that promises a quick return on your investment.Wishing you all a happy and successful crypto journey in 2023!",

Many people thought it will be something that will last for few month but the prediction was not certain. The market this year should teach us not not to predict the market and think the market will just be the way it has been predict,  some people bought bitcoin  thinking the bull market will come in a short time. Before buying Bitcoin we should be ready to hodl bitcoin till the market becomes profitable and not to be in a haste to make profit. Have the mindset that the Market is unpredictable,  the bull Market might not come the way we predict it in our own understanding.",

One of my greatest achievements this year is joining bitcointalk because this forum has changed my life educationally, emotionally, and economically. Among others, I have learned the following:1. Beware of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) because they can lead to irrational decisions 2. Exchanges can never be trusted and you don't own the funds you keep with them3. Hodl as much as you can because there is light at the end of the tunnel4. Keep promoting bitcoin and P2P transactions in your area.",

Hopefully in 2023 more positive things can happen in the crypto space which can make the market betterCongratulations on a better new year and hope for more surprises to come in the next year considering all the points you suggested, because I think these points are indeed worth considering from tomorrow onwards as long as we are still in the crypto space.",

Altcoins can still dip 50% more before things start balancing out, this has been altcoins way since 2018, if you want altcoins make sure you choose the best and gamble with few low-cap gems, the future is too uncertain.",

However, the only thing I need to focus on changing next year is not to be tempted by bitcoin-alternative coins. I'm not completely avoiding investing in altcoins, but I should set some limitations. Perhaps under $1,000 per enticing altcoin. I suppose that being a casino gambler influenced my willingness to take risks with altcoins.",

If you want to diversify your portfolio, you can choose other assets e.g. gold, real estate, stock etc.Volatility, whether with Bitcoin or apart from it, is not a problem at all as it is a part of trading and there is no gain if there is no volatility. The real problem is when a coin reaches a dead-end and almost never gets back to the position where it once was (I gave a couple of examples above). So basically, my advice was not to put all your capital in one coin/token so that even if one of those you're invested in ends badly, you will still not lose all your capital. Bitcoin as we all know is the king of cryptocurrencies, so there is no doubt that it is the first and foremost option if you are getting into crypto, but there is a whole different world apart from it which is also worth trying.",
