  "content": "Hey, I moved my rig and I did some reconfiguration and somehow I have messed up something with setting my clocks and fan speeds.probably something really simple, can somebody point out where the error is ?I use script to set clocks/fans:nvidia-smi -i 0 -pm 1nvidia-smi -i 0 -pl 244nvidia-smi -i 1 -pm 1nvidia-smi -i 1 -pl 244DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState=1 -a [fan:0]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=85DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState=1 -a [fan:1]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=85DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 nvidia-settings -a '[gpu:0]/GPUMemoryTransferRateOffsetAllPerformanceLevels=2500'DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 nvidia-settings -a [gpu:1]/GPUFanControlState=1 -a [fan:2]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=85DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 nvidia-settings -a [gpu:1]/GPUFanControlState=1 -a [fan:3]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=85DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 nvidia-settings -a '[gpu:1]/GPUMemoryTransferRateOffsetAllPerformanceLevels=2500'when I run it I get error:ERROR: Error assigning value 85 to attribute 'GPUTargetFanSpeed' (brigid:0[fan:0]) as specified in assignment '[fan:0]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=85' (Unknown Error).ERROR: Error assigning value 85 to attribute 'GPUTargetFanSpeed' (brigid:0[fan:1]) as specified in assignment '[fan:1]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=85' (Unknown Error).ERROR: Error assigning value 85 to attribute 'GPUTargetFanSpeed' (brigid:0[fan:2]) as specified in assignment '[fan:2]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=85' (Unknown Error).ERROR: Error assigning value 85 to attribute 'GPUTargetFanSpeed' (brigid:0[fan:3]) as specified in assignment '[fan:3]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=85' (Unknown Error).what have I done, what's the fix ?",

      "body": "For the fan I think it is easy,you just use the Nvidia Control Panel and click on the Thermal settings and there you can adjust the percentage of your fan settings.You can see one example in the picture that I am showing here.For the memory clock and core clock those most likely in well known miners like T-Rex,Lolminer,Phoenix etc all offer a possibility to put everything there,also the fan speed but the fan speed I always change it via Nvidia Control panel as shown in the picture.You can check the ANN threads in this very section for all the miners mentioned.",

      "body": "the driver version is 460.91 and I use t-rex miner. in linux t-rex do not set clocks ? or it does ?I dont have screen on that box so I use that script to set clocks, when I first put that box together again I added one 1060 but it ended up being card1 and that script made it's fans run but there was the trouble with card2(third card, 3080) ... so as I had 1060 for couple of days only I thought too much trouble and I removed it (I felt it to be too much jazz to get it running) ... after that the first 3080 clocks and fans were set but the second 3080 had that error and no message that memory clock is set. so I thought that it is coolbits thing and I run a command: Code:sudo nvidia-xconfig -a --cool-bits=32 --allow-empty-initial-configuration  and after that when I ran the script I didnt see that it set fan speed for the first card and I had same fan error with first card ... I think I am missing something small and I wrote here in hope that somebody knows exactly what Im doing wrong",
