What kind of encryption can it be and how can I go about to decrypt it. The paper wallet was generated at bitaddress.org. And oh how I regret encrypting it Could someone please help?",

It looks like a few characters are missing, you're supposed to have 58 characters, and the first 2 are supposed to be \"6P\" That still leaves a lot of options, and BIP38 is heavy encryption, but it should be possible to brute-force the missing characters.Or, since you have a QR-code, you can try that. It's partially covered with text, but it might still work. Be careful though: several QR-decoders steal any Bitcoin they can.Mycelium (on Android) supports BIP38.

If you can read all of that line (I can't quite make out whether you can see \"required)\" under the QR code from the small image you have attached), then you should also therefore have the end of the private key.This would mean that OP's printer has cut off the the first 4 characters, the first 2 of which will be \"6P\", meaning he just has to brute force 2 characters in a known position, which will be relatively easy to do provided he knows the decryption password.Edit: Actually, I've been able to recreate this by trying to print my own page of paper wallets from bitaddress and messing with the scaling factor up to around ~150%. It does indeed only cut characters off from the start. And actually, bitaddress only generates EC multiplied compressed keys, meaning all the keys will have the prefix \"6Pn\". So OP is only missing a single character from each key, in the 4th position, which will be between the characters \"M\" and \"Z\". Given that \"O\" isn't used in Base58Check, then that only leaves 13 possibilities for each key.",

I've tried to start with 6Pn(A-Z) but it says that all of those are invalid keys. It is the key and not the pass phrase because I made a new wallet and put in the wrong phrase and I got a different message. Could it be that the third digit \"n\" could be different as well. I made the wallet in 2020 if that has any meaning. Any bright ideas  ?",

Hence me asking if you are sure the characters you have posted here are accurate. If I go to bitaddress and create a page of encrypted paper wallets, I can brute force missing characters with 100% accuracy. So either the string you have shared above has incorrect characters or is not a BIP38 key at all.Are you able to share a high resolution picture of the key you have shared above (the one you said has no funds on it)?
