  "content": "I have noticed this local board has far lesser activities compared to other local boards and moreover the reason could be it's just acting as a board for asking questions and answers. But, can we make this place more informative as in sharing more about what's going on in India with crypto and any particular Indian based projects or even crackdown on crypto by authorities? Afterall, we cannot just remain as question and answer forum. Rather we need to discuss more regional challenges and how we can fix it or a possible way out of it, and things like is there a way we can avoid taxes while trading without breaching the law of land, etc.If each user contributes even one or two topics in a week then this board will be more informative and have more activity.",

Appreciate your willingness to have healthy discussion on these topics, just want to clarify it wouldn't be the topics I like or based on likeliness of any individual but rather for benefit of this community. Yeah let's ensure we strive to provide the best insights and keep them posted on upcoming challenges. Just hoping that the taxation rule should be reversed for crypto thus it will make the community alive.",

Since you were out of touch from the local board I would like to update you with a contest that we are running only for active India local board members. It is the, Best Topic Contest for the Indian Local Board. Please go through the topic and if you have any questions please ask on that thread. We will be organizing more such contests in the future to encourage Indian members to be active on our local board.",
