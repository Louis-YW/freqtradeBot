So it will be the mobo PCIe slot to a PCIe tab to a USB cableto splitter board to another PCIe slot to another PCIe tab for the riser to another USB cable to the powered riser board to the x16 slot to the GPU.That's a very long route with many potential points of failure. Almost guaranteed to be unstable if it works at all.I wouldn't try to use it.",

We can help you more if you provide us more informationWhich motherboard do you have?How many GPUs are you trying to connect?And how about your PSU?Maybe a simple m2 to pci adapter can solve your problem...",
