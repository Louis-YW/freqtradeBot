But not everyone who goes in there will win; a few will win, and lots of players will fail.\"Eh no favor you no mean say eh no go favor the next person\" What that simply means is that just because the game is not in your favor doesn't mean others didn't benefit from it.",

If you are playing games from NoLimitCity or Hacksaw, that statistic is normal because I have seen streams of bonus rounds where the streamer got 0x after the bonus round.I have an experience playing with  slots by Playn' Go and the game named Moon Princess Trinity.  It is labeled high volatile and I got an experience where it gives 7 good consecutive hits out of 10 spins but often times it gives me 50 consecutive bad spins with 30 of them are dead spins and eventually hitting a bonus round that can recover my balance.  If I take the statistics, it would be close to your statistics but with some of them being bonus round triggered I am able to end up with a positive balance sometimes but obviously more often than not it resulted in a negative.",

Regarding the Punt, I personally wasn't tested the site though they don't have any bad reviews as far as I know.This is what will happened if you can't control your emotions while playing gambling. You wanted to play and you expect to win, and when you lose you'll blame the gambling site.",

One more thing, you said that you play slot but AFAIK the slot in Punt comes from 3rd party providers which most of them has no clear provably fair system like the original games. So you have just made 2 mistakes or you misunderstand 2 things here related to provably fair mechanism. Even if you play slots with clear provably fair system, you may get even worse result if you are unlucky. I guess you are a gambler who cant accept losses then you try to find a way to blame the casino.",

Provably fair means you can verify your bets using hash and node, this is random because they use SHA256. Each games has a house edge, this make the casino has a higher chance to win than you as a gambler, there's a difference between chance and programmed.",

I’m wondering how do you count loss over win on slot games because it’s consider a winning bet too even if small profit, You just trigger smaller payout. This stats pretty normal when playing a slot game with low hit ratio or high volatility. Don’t expect a 50/50 percentage or close to that on slot because it’s payout is random. You can recover all your losses with just 1 spin with big multiplier.",

Much better if you focus your energy on other valuable things since ranting cannot do anything and will not convince any people who's still enjoying to play on any casino. Although I understand your frustration since many experience it, this is also the reason why we should not expect to win any huge amount since this will happen to us.  Just enjoy the game and you will find it entertaining.",

Posting your statistics of wins/losses with no inclusion of balance movements or the amount won in those wins, bet size, etc, renders the whole post useless. Without sufficient data, no one will believe or take your claim seriously.

I experience more terrible result than that on a high volatility slots by hacksaw, nolimit and one touch. It burns me 50$ for a tons of 0.1$ spin while winning only 2$ as highest profit on that total spin.

Therefore, you must be prepared to face whatever the outcome is irrespective of what the stake is that is why it is called a provably fair game. Do not forget that the main aim of every organization is to make profit. So if  you claim the gambling  organization design softwares to favor them I have no  doubt over it so you should expect it because that is the main aim of organizations to make profit.",
