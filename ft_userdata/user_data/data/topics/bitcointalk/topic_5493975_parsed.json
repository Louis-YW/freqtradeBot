No. It is the sign that more money is going in to crypto and those that are existing here won't think about getting out anytime soon. We're not yet on the peak of the bull run and that's why people won't be thinking of dropping out anytime soon. Many are going to leave when we're already on the bear market but as of this time, I don't think that's what on the mind of the most when we're not yet seeing the best of Bitcoin. But it's true that a lot has changed for the last 6 years.",

Nah I don't think people will leave crypto just because the government keeps getting involved as a matter of fact I consider the involvement of government a good factor for the same reason that you have aforementioned. People will not leave because if government is cracking down exchanges then new exchanges will take place, if they are implementing high taxation, then new method to minimize the taxation will take place, if they are eliminating anoynity, security, decentralization factors from the exchanges, platforms then new ones will take there places.This works is full of diversity, means if there are people demanding cringe content then there will be people creating it, same if the people will demand decentralized platforms, developers of the same kind will make those and this is how things will work. And why would you say, only high wealth people will be involved, as it's not about money I guess, its about technology.",

This is a market that moves a lot of money, so it would be difficult for governments to ignoreBitcoin is a long years of work achieved and being put to work. In previous years as you stated there were no KYC, enabling more scammers and rug pulls occuring in the market. In the few moments I've looked into this broad space of monetary investment I noticed the purpose of  government's involvement in the market is to safeguard citizen's money and help investors stay clear from infamy scammers. But, the government's hands on cryptocurrency doesn't make many changes in reducing scam projects. On telegram lots of projects are not feasible, but made up to eat up investor's money. Please, how do you think they'll get punished on platforms like telegram? If the government's hand in crypto is stable and strong. I think more people will get interested in the cryptocurrency market. Thereby, skyrocketing the rate at which illicit players will operate, unless the government also finds a means of regulating platforms like telegram and discord. Where I have seen multiple complaints from users regarding cryptocurrency scam.",

Which entails that regardless of how high the price is, the average or poor citizens in the society will still have the opportunity to buy it. The transaction fees and stringent regulatory laws are making things a little bit difficult but Bitcoin will still be the first choice in the crypto space.

But many people don't have the financial capacity to keep Bitcoin as an investment, they easily sell it to meet their needs. You should also take into consideration that Bitcoin is not legal in all countries and most businesses are not accepting it as a means of payment.",

There are some countries that are crypto friendly and yet they don't tax their citizens because they don't know what the future holds for now if they will accept as it may benefit the economy or not. However, there are some countries that are tax-friendly unlike the US and some other regions that are strict with crypto regulations. I hope you know that some of these people introduced high taxes to just discourage people.As for the exchanges, not like I'm in the support of government, some of these centralized exchanges are known for dubious activity, many of them have stolen customers funds, loaned many of them out and also used the remaining for their own careers and when the customer want their money, they file for Bankruptcy, isn't that pathetic and fraud, sometimes government need to put things in order.",

Currently, we're closely tied to stocks. I believe the hype and interest will wane, and so will these extreme bull runs. As more money enters the market, it becomes harder to influence prices. Those who remain interested will be enthusiasts, early adopters, and institutions, but the new wave of hype will fade.Keep in mind, our market cap is only $1.5T, which is still relatively small. We have a long way to go before public interest fades.",
