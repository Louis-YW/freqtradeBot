  "content": "Hello everyone,I'm here to share an idea that I hope will resonate with many of you. We're in the early stages of developing (with the help of AI) a new cryptocurrency with a focus on enabling financial inclusion, especially in areas where traditional banking has fallen short. Our goal is to create a system that's not only accessible but also empowers users through practical and effective financial solutions.What role do you think cryptocurrency can play in enhancing financial freedom worldwide? Which features are crucial for a token to be more than a digital asset and become a true tool for empowerment?This is a collective effort, and your perspective is key. I'm setting up a space on Discord for us to brainstorm, debate, and build together. This is an open invitation to be part of a project from the ground up, influencing every aspect from our mission statement to the final product.We're transparent about where we stand: finalizing our core values, drafting our tokenomics, and selecting a blockchain platform. This isn't just about launching another token; it's about starting a movement where each participant has a say in how we move forward.Let's keep this conversation focused and constructive, true to the spirit of the crypto community. I'm eager to engage with you all, answer your queries, and take in every piece of advice.I'll be right here, reading and responding. Together, we can build something that has the potential to make a real difference. Your ideas today could pave the way for the financial tools of tomorrow.Join our growing community on Discord to continue the discussion and contribute to shaping this project in real time: https://discord.gg/GXFABuyf - Your insights are invaluable, and together, we can create something truly revolutionary.",

      "body": "You are talking in a general framework and without describing the problem that the cryptocurrency can achieve and whether it has been solved before or are you offering a unique solution with a clear mechanism for solutions or what is the thing that you are trying to develop.Saying that it works to empower users through practical and effective financial solutions is a general description, and the least you need now is a practical explanation of your idea through a white paper, as it is the basis on which discussion can be made.Quote from: Hatois on November 14, 2023, 11:55:55 PMchain platform. This isn't just about launching another token; it's about starting a movement where each participant has a say in how we move forward.I am surprised that you mentioned “selecting a blockchain platform:” and then you said “isn’t just about launching another token.” It is likely that you will create a token. If this is true, then the probability of the project’s failure is greater than the probability of its success.",

      "body": "Thanks for your feedback, Husires. You raise valid points about the need for specific problem identification and solution mechanisms. Our project is currently in the early planning stages, and we're still shaping the foundational aspects, including whether to create a token or use an independent blockchain. We believe it's too early for a formal whitepaper until these crucial decisions are made with community input. Our aim is to address the challenge of financial exclusion with a practical blockchain solution. We appreciate your emphasis on clarity and detail, and we'll incorporate this as we further develop our concept and eventually formalize it in a whitepaper.",

It is better you come out with what you guys are doing for people to buy into itThanks for your input. Our vision is to create a highly distributed blockchain solution that's accessible to all, with a special focus on microtransactions. We're targeting economies with high inflation, where an alternative to traditional fiat is crucial. Fast transactions and low fees are at the core of our design to ensure usability across various economic scenarios. While we have a clear foundational direction, we believe community collaboration is key in refining our approach. Your insights are invaluable in helping us develop a solution that’s not only technologically sound but also meets real-world needs.",

Maybe stablecoin that can have a multi access and works like visa and master card without being restricted and can be used globally. Something like that. Thanks for your thoughts, cryptoaddictchie. We're aligned in seeing crypto as more than just an investment tool. Specifically, we're exploring ways to make crypto accessible for local trade and commerce. This includes creating a user-friendly wallet app for easy transactions, ensuring currency stability, and keeping transaction fees low. We believe these elements are key to making crypto practical for everyday use. Your ideas, especially regarding a globally accessible stablecoin, fit right into this vision. We'd love to delve deeper into these topics with you on our Discord - https://discord.gg/GXFABuyf Your input would be invaluable.",

You raise valid points about the need for specific problem identification and solution mechanisms. Our project is currently in the early planning stages, and we're still shaping the foundational aspects, including whether to create a token or use an independent blockchain. It is almost certain that the project is going to incorporate a token whether it will be developed as an independent blockchain or as a protocol on an existing blockchain (EVM, non-EVM chains, etc) because there has to be a way to create some economic incentives as you can't just expect people to actively participate in your project — be it running a node, staking etc; out of the goodness of their heart so the token part is figured out.As for the core problem that your project aims to solve, I've seen this hundreds of time in web2 and in web3 (It's always like let's bank the unbanked or let's bring the unbanked to crypto) — many if not all failed. I'm wondering what you unique offering this project will propose. So far, I haven't seen it yet.",

Most people are struggling these days and they think that crypto is the way to get out of that poverty. While half of it is true and half is not, half true because it did changed a lot of lives.While the half not true is because, many are exaggerating cryptocurrencies to be the tool for their rich quick dreams to be meant. And what we need to see is the unity of most of the projects, not left and right we see who's better than the others. What if they just all unite and we support one or a few crypto that has real world usage?",

Cryptocurrency can make people more financially free all over the world.It leads people to manage their money without need of any person and it is easy to use. It also makes it cheaper and faster to send money anywhere. Cryptocurrency give people control over own money and give them opportunity to use financial services that they didn't use before.Quote from: Hatois on November 14, 2023, 11:55:55 PMWhich features are crucial for a token to be more than a digital asset and become a true tool for empowerment?To be a helpful tool a cryptocurrency should have some important things. It should be easy for people to use even if they don't know a lot about technology. It should also have low fees and fast transactions so it should be quick and affordable. It should also keep people's money safe.It should have a strong community and have helpful representatives who will listen the users carefully and solve the problem as soon as possible.",

I have created Discord as the place to have the constructive conversations which is more appropriate (and faster) than this thread or any thread on a forum. The project could well be a coin on it's own chain or a token. Both have many pros and cons. Going with a token we can leverage existing infrastructure right away and using a layer 2 protocol on Ethereum like Polygon's POS will provide the low transaction fees and quick settlement times the we are looking for. Not looking for quick profit for myself or anyone else.",
