At this point the best advice I can give you is for you to, go through the forum’s rule[1] and also learn how to use the search[2] function because most of the threads you have created and you’ll be creating (judging from the ones you have already created) are already in existence here and all you have to do is to search and learn from them so that you don’t end up spamming the forum.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5276341.0Edit:Quote from: coinfunda on September 24, 2023, 12:21:28 PMOhh thanks a lot. I will do that for sure. Can you delete thoose thread which seems like spam. And also let me know what is the meaning of (OP) here in my user name?Depending on how you use it, Op means “Original poster” i.e the creator of a thread or “Original post” i.e the first post in a thread. Please try to make your replies in a single post if possible, right now what you just did is not okay so do well to edit your post and merge them together.",

It appears close to your username, when you create a new post.As for your original question, it might seem dumb, but if you still want to know how much is being paid or received from a signature campaign, then you might have to check every spreadsheet on every campaign thread. You just have to visit the service board (link https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0)There, each campaigns has a spread sheet, find and open it. there's nothing hidden on the forum. Here's one, you can check out  SPREADSHEET",

Some of them make threads like \" new here\" and \"eager to learn\" yet from their actions, they don't seem ready.It's okay to ask questions, but there are some that are downright annoying.. There's so much you can benefit from the forum and vice versa but if the Op continues making one sentence posts, either he gets tired quickly of the forum, or the other way around.",

Anyone can see the spreadsheets of those campaigns to know that how much the participants earn for their contribution. It really doesn't matter that how much someone earns for their contribution the only thing matter is that how much valuable information a user contributes to the forum and the payments from those campaigns are a kind of rewards for that contribution. If you also want to earn some money from signature campaigns in future then you should focus more on contributing to the forum than on knowing what others are making for their contribution.",
