  "content": "INTRODUCING MINIMA  completely decentralized network that empowers freedom for all The Problem:Since then, many ingenious and powerful advancements have been made, but in our haste to buildfeatures, one single property, for some the most important property, is being side-lined in favour of scale andsecurity: Decentralization. Bitcoins’ original raison d’etre was for there to be no overarching authority ‘controlling’the network, no single points of failure and no avenues for censorship built on top of a network resilient todistributed aacks; both digital and physical. Every single cryptocurrency operating today has sacrificed some or alldecentralization in their race for increased scale and supposed security. Centralization causes huge eiciency gainsafter all. But if 1 group of users is paid to perform any ‘task’ on the network for the rest of the users (finding blocks,resolving disputes, etc.) this inevitably leads to centralization, as is shown by all of the major crypto networks. Inessence decentralization maers because centralized networks are so easy to aack.Current miner-centric networks rely on a relatively small number of users running full validatory nodes thatprocess every transaction, ensuring that no one cheats the system and no one accepts an invalid transaction. Butthey are not involved in the construction of the blockchain itself, just its validation. A much smaller group of users,normally referred to as miners, run a full validatory and mining node, otherwise known as a Complete node. Sinceonly this small group of Complete nodes is involved in the construction of the chain, only this small group decideswhich valid transactions actually make it into a block or not, and only this small group is involved in ensuring thelivelinessThe Solution:A network where every single user is an equal and Complete member. Where disrupting the network wouldrequire aacking, bribing or coercing 100’s of millions, maybe billions of users. Orders of magnitude more thancurrent crypto solutions. Total decentralization.Can a secure, scalable, truly decentralized cryptocurrency be made with no overarching authority? Canevery user be an equal on a cryptocurrency network? Can mining centralization be abolished? Can the need tooutsource any critical aspects of the network to some third party become redundant?Requirements:• The protocol needs to be so resource-eicient that every user is able to run a Complete node at alltimes, as if it is of no consequence.• It must remove the paid miners. The miner-centric fee-paying model always leads to centralization.• It must be complete. Immutability of the protocol is a desired quality.• Since it must be complete, the Protocol must◦ scale from inception◦ be Quantum Securefor a future where it might maer.• It must be small. It must be powerful. It must remain decentralized. It must be finishedWebsite : https://https//www.minima.global/Whitepapper : https://https//docs.minima.global/minima_pdfs/Minima_Whitepaper_v11.pdfInfo : https://icogems.com/ico/Minima",
