  "content": "I found a micro miner on Indiegogo recently that I think is pretty impressive. It's focused on portability and can be used anywhere and anytime, and it comes with a lot of features. However, no one has backed the campaign yet, which is surprising.Can someone help me evaluate this product? I'm new to the blockchain field. Here's some information about the product:Model: AIminer 1.0Algorithm: Sha-256dCrypto Mined: BTC, BCHHashrate: Up to 1 TH/sPower Consumption: 20W-50WInput Voltage: 5Vhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/aiminer-bitcoin-micro-miner/x/31585636#/This micro miner seems to have a high hashrate and low power consumption, and it can even mine btc with multiple miners at the same time to increase the chances of mining blocks.What do you all think about this micro miner? Should I back the campaign?",
