Today we decided to have lunch at a local restaurant. I was shocked to see the interior walls of the restaurant decorated with Bitcoin stickers, banners and bitcoin wallet ads. I didn't expect to find this in a small town, I was excited to show my friends how practical Bitcoin is. We placed our orders and when the bill came I asked if I could pay in bitcoin. The waiter stared at me with a blank face as if nothing I said made sense. Clearly this guys do not accept Bitcoin payment. I was furious...no disappointed...I quietly asked to see his manager, the lady came to see what the problem. I asked her why they wouldn't accept Bitcoin payments but have the walls decorated with bitcoin stickers, banners and crypto wallet  ads. She explained they have some sort of franchise deal and get paid for keeping the ads on the wall but they don't really know how Bitcoin works or how it can positively impact their business. I could sense she wanted to learn what I knew, but it wasn't the time and place for a Bitcoin lecture. Instead, I invited her for Christmas dinner and promised to teach her Bitcoin. Merry Christmas everyone",

But that is only my speculation, since I do not how much that restaurant owner faces the public.OP just wanted to be nice.PD: I am sure if I spent most of my day delivering giant pizzas for months so I can get enough to reach the end of the month, I would not mind the be one abusing Uber-Eats(R) at least for a couple of days.",

A tight knit community is the answer.But if that happened in a highly populated city/town, it would be a bit different. It took me a while to think of what an answer to the question could be in such a case- in a more populated world (like the western world). But if I had to take a guess: I suppose to either flex ones cooking (kind of a rubbing salt in his face situation) or it would be to brown-nose the owner in hopes of getting special treatment when visiting the restaurant next time.Although having said that, it does make me sound like I may be a bit of a downer with a pessimistic view of the world.",

I can see from the image that the advertised company is skye wallet Nigeria. It’s not a popular wallet even in the country, I did a quick search about the company and the reviews aren’t good at all, numerous complaints of withdrawal issues and customer service not responding to messages. Now I think it’s up to OP to go back and see if he can make them put down the advert as it will also affect the reputation of the restaurant. I want to believe the restaurant owners are ignorant of crypto and do not know about the issues surrounding the wallet, they are simply after the cheque.  https://www.trustpilot.com/review/skyewallet.com",

The manager being a \"her\" makes me think that @OP is trying to hit on her, lol but then the tight-knit community seems a valid reason.  Though I still wonder why invite over your house for a Christmas dinner...  is there a room for teaching during those times?  With lots of relatives and friends coming over, (the tight-knit community remember?  )  When you can just schedule an after job time to teach her the necessity of accepting Bitcoin, if not the basics of Bitcoin ,after work hours.  Sorry, but my imagination got worked up when I read the term.. manager >> she >> and invited over Christmas dinner.,  Anywho, I hope your teaching session with the manager will be a great success!!!",

You should be security conscious. Enjoy your holidays.",

I’m usually skeptical of this kind of “Bitcoin celebration threads” so I was expecting that you paid for your lunch with bitcoin, at least that’s what the title made me believe. It won’t be right to call it a bitcoin restaurant then, its ironic to call a restaurant where the owners aren’t knowledgeable about bitcoin a bitcoin restaurant. Oh well at least OP didn’t lie about his experience just to make his story look good. Good luck with your new manager friend",

I haven’t had this much fun in a while. I hold the opinion that bitcoin education for the people is vital in crypto mass adoption. Thank you OP for your service Even though the government isn’t pro-bitcoin, it’s becoming increasingly popular for physical stores in Nigeria to accept bitcoin as payment in exchange for goods and services. Some even have two price tags, one for payment in naira and another price (usually discounted) for bitcoin payment to encourage bitcoin payments.",
