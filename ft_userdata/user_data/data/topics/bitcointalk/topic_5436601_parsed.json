But some people are using exchanges to trade, but many traders always discourage their fellow traders not to use the amount of money they can not be able to afford to lose to trade, so not to leave the amount of money they can not afford to lose on exchanges.",

      "body": "I don't have an account there so I can't verify the story, but it is definitely worth following. I think there has been many news regarding Crypto.com making a mistake when they transfer some of their cryptos. They even sent more than a hundred million dollars worth of ETH to the wrong address in the past if I remember correctly. Not sure what kind of input are you expecting by sharing this news though. If you're worried about Crypto going bankrupt, then try to withdraw as much money as you can. If you don't have an account and are worried about another domino effect, then prepare for the next dump, if that ever happens. You should not expect Bitcoin price to keep going up or steady forever anyway, regardless if a new exchange goes bankrupt or not. Try to find alternatives, or get familiar with DEX such as Bisq if what you need is to exchange your Bitcoin to fiat once in awhile.",

But reading those tweets shown in the article of the exchange failing to payout a $400 withdraw request really looks bad on their side... because there could be more cases that aren't just reported ! Maybe the exchange is buying time to recover the $10 million that was wrongly sent through fees and all other revenue channels that brings them some money...",

      "body": "That's what I've heard. That exchange could be the next exchange to close, but I cannot confirm it. A couple of months ago, I started trading on my crypto.com app. I have not used that exchange since then. I hope they don't go nowhere, but at the same time, it makes the industry more transparent. In order to purchase outside of DEX, you must use centralized exchanges, but it is essential to take self-custody. When you plan to trade short-term, keep your funds on the exchange, but when you plan to accumulate long-term funds, keep them in a self-custody wallet. It is possible to use a hot wallet or a cold wallet.",

Are such behaviors worthy of trust?1) Crypto.com sent $400 million to the wrong recipient, but got it back this time2) Crypto.com mistakenly sent a customer $7.2 million instead of a $68 refund3) Crypto.comâ€™s Sinking Token Stirs Fresh Anxiety After FTX Wipeout",

Share your inputsFrom the article:QuoteThese complaints raised questions about Crypto.com having minor financial stress after losing about $10.5 million in a transaction mistake. So what's this then? This was news was 5 months ago, and it was reporting incident from 12 months ago, and somehow it's causing a bank run now? Can someone explain me how this got to do with anything. 10 million is almost pocket money for exchanges like crypto.com and they would eventually get properties purchased with that confiscated back as the woman clearly used money that wasn't her to begin with.",
