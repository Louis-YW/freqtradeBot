  "content": "As I have said here many times, the crypto business taking a side in the US partisan divide is a really bad thing for the business.While there is a lot of discussion about US politics here, the discussion is mostly about people and parties, which, in the end, doesn't make that much difference to any real business--and drags in a ton of baggage since our business is at best 1% of what these parties and candidates actually do, and they are otherwise associated with a ton of very divisive things like abortion, immigration, religion and war.So instead talking about parties and candidates, I think an actual constructive conversation for the community would be to talk about the actual policies that will be good for Bitcoin and the broader digital currency business.So without mentioning people, parties or candidates, I invite people here to answer the question: what are the specific policies that people think would be good for our business, and why? What specific laws in the USA would people like to see changed? What specific policies would help grow the business? I am sure there must be a lot of opinions about this, and a lot of counter-opinions too, I hope.And let's keep this conversation limited to just policy: if you mention a person or a political party (or use some stand-in term to connote those things e.g. \"the fascists\" or \"the commies\"), then you are off-topic in this conversation. This thread is for policy only.",

Let's take the points one at a time and discuss.Quotegovernments should not get involved in who owns certain electronic devices(hardware wallets/asics) Sounds sensible enough. Are there any laws like this anywhere? Is anybody proposing such a thing?Quotegovernments should not get involved in who owns certain software(wallets/nodes/pool stratums)Again, sounds simple enough. Again, any examples of existing problem laws here?Quoteany custodial business should be regulated but with regulations concerning more so consumer protections, where the authorities police the business via asking for audits and accounting regularly of the business to protect the consumer/customer.. Totally agree. I would wonder where we would draw the line at \"custodial\" though. Would a Bitcoin node be considered a \"custodian\" of a consumer's value? What about more centralized (PoS) nodes like those in Ether?As somebody who runs nodes that hold value, I personally wouldn't mind being licensed and getting certified, as long as the regulations are reasonable. Ideally this would be voluntary, but something a business could advertise as an advantage over fly-by-night operations.Quotewe shouldnt be using regulations where the authorities defer their responsibility by delegated it over to the business to then police the customers whilst no one polices the business itselfSounds correct--but are there example(s) of laws that violate this principle right now?Quoteas for things like barriers of entry. governments should not impose barriers of entry for small individuals/businesses to start up. there should not be a single large wall barrier of entry requiring individuals/businesses to need to reach a high bar of entry just to get involved. but instead have a tier system whereby a small business can effectively compete against a large institution, but at both levels have to atleast be accountable if they are handling peoples valueAgain, this sounds very reasonable. I also think you could create tiers based on dollar volumes: businesses that hold only small amounts of people's money should have light regulation and the ones hold people's life savings should have a lot more.There is precedent for this: the $10,000 trigger you get when you deposit more than that in cash in a US bank. Also, there is the FDIC insurance, which covers a limited amount. I would love to see the equivalent of \"FDIC insured\" for say $1000 maximum, that would be easier to get.",

In reality many car manufacturers are leaning towards hybrid instead of full electric. One should never go full electric anyway. Elon is an exception. He can always go full electric what a brilliant man.Anyway, the energy prices will come down and less regulations will apply, Gary Gensler will get fired and it will be a nice bright future for us.Remember Kabala wants to make Gary Gensler the treasury secretary.

I think the truly private cryptos like Monero and the \"tradecraft\" add-ons to Bitcoin are going to have an uphill battle against regulators for a long time. When children's hospitals are being attacked by hackers using these currencies, the public is not exactly going to be very sympathetic. And meanwhile, there's billions of dollars to be made in the market outside of the \"ultra-private\" coins / tools. 99% of people don't want or need \"terrorist-approved\" privacy, and the negative politics from this can diminish other policy goals the industry might have.

No \"special crypto taxes\", because \"the crypto miners are polluting the environment\" or any other BS excuse. No business should be discriminated by the law.I agree, but in the US at least, power companies exist as government-protected monopolies, and as such are driven very much by politics. It's not uncommon for localities to vote for, \"somebody else should pay a higher power bill than me\". If crypto's reputation is not good, then it can make this much worse (see the comment above). I think the best miners can hope for, though, is to be treated the same as other industrial clients.",

The only thing any government can give to Bitcoin is friendly policies. These policies include but are not limited to the following - Friendly Tax: the current administration had plans to increase crypto mining tax by 30%. If not for the lawsuit by Texas Blockchain Council and Riot Platforms that halted survey by US Energy Information Administration, the tax law would have been implemented. After all the tax was already included in the 2024 budget. Crypto-related businesses should be taxed like other industries. -Sensor-free law: The government should stop attacking privacy tools like  privacy tools. Assuming that Bitcoin is used mainly to sponsor terrorism and promote money laundering is wrong. Fiat is the best money for criminal activities. The present administration is attacking these privacy tools with draconian laws-Friendly business laws: Centralized platforms should be regulated but the government shouldn't consciously suppress them. Any exchange that breaks the law should be punished but the government shouldn't make laws to make their business difficult or just to make money from the through fines. Recently, the president of the US said he would veto an anti-crypto law proposed by  SEC chairman Gary Gensler that would have deterred banks from handling crypto customers. This is a good move by the present administration.In summary, policies that will make the Bitcoin industry enjoy freedom and express its decentralized nature will be my ideal expectations.",
