I hope that Theta will be listed on top of the market cap. But it needs more exposure for this project to catch the attention of big investors.",

      "body": "That's impossible prediction for now. The price of theta may go even lower than one dollar. How can it will even reach $5 at the end of this year? are you doing your prediction accurately or what? no bull market means everything will be staying at the same place like this. Crypto will not be moving to the somewhere. It will remain in the same possition until a few years later once bitcoin done with another halving.",

      "body": "the current price is actually down at $1.04 , I also think it's just a prediction and analysis isn't it, so it could be right or wrong, so back again we are just waiting for the market to be bullish because all cryptocurrencies will be bullish when the bitcoin price is also bullish , so you can buy it cheap now $1 or $0.95",

Almost impossible because the last time Theta price is on 5$ mark was Bitcoin is around 30K but now the market seems more bearish while your target is x5 from the current price and only 3 months left for 2022.  Although Theta is a good project because it focus on entertainment industry but the main problem is the general sentiment of crypto which is stopping it to grow further to the level that you are speculating on this thread.",

It's hard to be pumped during the bearish market like this. I think that anyone aware about what happened with market. Are you still expecting theta to go to the 5 times from the current price? believe me if that doesn't even make sense",
