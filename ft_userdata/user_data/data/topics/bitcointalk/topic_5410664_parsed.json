On Chrome:Manage extensions -> click \"details\" for the extension you'd like to check -> ensure that the \"Source\" is \"Chrome Web Store\"",

Even not newbies still can be caught if they are careless at some points.It is like in cryptocurrency, I learned an important thing. Don't trust, verify and double check. Even you receive email that looks to be legit, you must go to an exchange and double check for latest announcements, news from their official site. If there is nothing relates to the email you receive, be careful it can be punny code, homograph attacks.DMs from strangers, simply ignore, block and report them as scammers.",

It reminds us to always being very careful with extensions, plugins, add-ons, patchs and anything modifying the initial code of a software. I try to avoid them the more I can because I don't even totally trust the official branded stores of softwares I use to deal with cryptos.",

A few months ago, I was stupid enough not to doing my due diligence believing that everything was real until a few hours later I see my wallets getting drained for a grand total of $12k+. It might not be big to you guys, but it is for me as a 3rd world country guy. And also when it comes to emails, I usually do not really believe in them as I definitely go to the official website and social media channels to make sure if its really from them or not.",

Polkadot really needs to solve such issues or it will result in ppl losing Polkadot coins and tokens build on Polkadot supported by web3. Infections can easily happen and we should be aware to store our coins mostly offline, not in hot wallets and foreign party manufacturers. Internet and digital space are still very insecure and experienced hackers will exploit flawed code. It's a very big risk.",

When adding any extension you really have to be very careful because you have no idea if it is a front for a fake service created in order to access/steal your data.",

Most of these extensions are not the original extension for the wallet or the exchange, but rather a fake extension with the same name, so everyone should be careful, the simple solution is to put important sites and their extensions in the bookmark and avoid Trust any messages that come on the mail because most of these messages contain links to fake sites.",
