      "body": "I think it is important to set New Year’s resolutions and really keeping those goals realistically. Traditionally there would be an endless list and none of the goals would be accomplished. There are goals that you can set for yourself. Look ahead at the big picture for the year. Staying focused on the goals that you have the time, cash flow, and energy to do. There is that circle of friends even family, a network that can help achieve goals for the new year. Goals like maintaining health through continuing to exercise and eating healthy. Spending more time with peers and friends can be a goal to strengthen the bond. Setting aside ten minutes a day in silence can help the heart and spirit. Planning and starting out small can be a start and even make you a better person.",
