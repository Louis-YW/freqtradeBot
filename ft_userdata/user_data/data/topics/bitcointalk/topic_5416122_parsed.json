      "body": "Would you mind accessing the miner through other devices like an Android phone or trying to access it through incognito mode? Are both fans spinning when connected?If the above doesn't work one of the fans or both fans might be shorted. You can test them one by one if which one gives you a socket connection fail.Then update here I will give you few suggestion to fix it.",

The error of socket connet fail is usually due to wrong entreis like pool URL, worker or password, what do you mean by \"enter\", do you mean the miner gets no IP? Or does it tell you the login rejected? Post some pictures.",

      "body": "It is not inconceivable for a bad fan to cause a connection error. Each control board has a Minimum of four voltage sources plus the fan power supply. Being so tightly interconnected it is possible for a short in the fan to cause a brown out or voltage drop somewhere else in the control board leading to a unexplained error. Try fans plugged in one at a time, maybe even different locations. Let us know how that goes.",
