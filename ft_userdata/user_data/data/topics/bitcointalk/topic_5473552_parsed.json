USDT is the most widely used stablecoin but I never heard if anyone needed to mix the USDT to stop its traces and i never come across any service/ways to mix the USDT.Any suggestions on USDT mixing are appreciated here. Looking for direct USDT mixing, i know converting to XMR and back will serve the purpose.",

Anyway, I've searched a bit and read about The Crypto Mixer and also USDT-mixer-obfuscator.com. I haven't tried both, so this isn't a recommendation. I don't vouch for them. I can't even access both of them from my location. But you might want to learn more about these two USDT mixers.But if conversion to XMR serves the same purpose, why the need for a mixer?

You change your USDT (ERC 20) toUSDT (polygon), but indicate a different receiving address.Then change back and indicate the desired address. This is not mixing, and specialists can easily figure out where the tokens were senthttps://rango.exchange/",

USDT is the most widely used stablecoin but I never heard if anyone needed to mix the USDT to stop its traces and i never come across any service/ways to mix the USDT.USDT is the most widely used stablecoin in terms of storing fiat but in terms of transactions, USDT is not your best bet. People rarely make USDT to USDT transactions. There is not enough demand and it's not practical to mix USDTs, that's why USDT mixers don't exist. Bitcoin mixers exist because it's a very popular cryptocurrency. We call the rest of them altcoins, so, if anyone wants to use altcoins, they have Monero that doesn't need a mixer and offers the best possible privacy.Quote from: virasog on November 09, 2023, 11:56:08 PMAny suggestions on USDT mixing are appreciated here. Looking for direct USDT mixing, i know converting to XMR and back will serve the purpose.If I were you, I wouldn't use direct USDT mixers because if there exist any, they don't represent themselves on this forum and in case something goes wrong, you'll less likely be able to solve the issue and most likely the ones who exist, might be scam projects.",

I also skeptic whether OKX wallet is really non custodial and fully open source since there's a part in their github is closed source.While I had failed to mention KYC (can't recall what I had to do to register other than create the wallet on my app) the principle remains of sending multiple transactions in moving them to the exchange's wallet then send from there to multiple wallets.  (In reality, they wouldn't have to be USDT in or out - e.g. litecoin and doge in feathercoin, ether and usdC out)apps have the capacity for numerous wallets in app, so a person can have multiple bitcoin, USDT, ether wallet addresses and shift between wallets / exchanges at their leisure.I've seen one betting site ( nitrogensports.eu ) will accept BTC, LTC, ETH, USDT/tether, usdC and binance and change them to BTC for betting and withdraw.  In essence they will buy your coins and change them (yeh, yeh KYC etc, but still a paper trail can go cold quite quickly - specifically if withdrawn BTC is sent direct to a mixer (or via a secondary in app multicoin wallet))As ETFbitcoin pointed out, you only need a P2P instant exchange to shift coins from one in app wallet to a second as a different coin, then P2P to a third in app wallet back to the original coin type.",
