At https://bitcoinfees.net/, each fee rates range displays how many transactions were made, and if you know the average number of transactions in a block, then you can estimate in which blocks your transactions will receive confirmation, based on the fee rate you choose. It won't be completely accurate, but at least you'll get a close estimate of the time.",

Now actually I don't understand that how can we estimate or guess the time on these transactions?Like if I give 10sat/vB how and where can I find my estimated time ?If I get your questions correctly, then this could be the answer that you were looking for.It depends on how many pending transactions are waiting on the mempool and how many new transactions are coming with how much fees. Let's say you have paid 10 sat/vB fees which has low priority and the current fee is around 30 sat/vB. Now, you have to see how many transactions are waiting to be confirmed that paid more than 10 sat/vB. The average block time is around 10 minutes. If there are more than 100K transactions, it will take a long time to get confirmed if new transactions keep adding to the mempool with higher fees. So, you cannot guess the estimated time. It is better to use RBF so you can bump your transaction fees when needed.",

Maybe at 1-2 sat/vbyte to come up first in line.Sure this can change and might take longer to confirm but it’s pretty accurate. Just remember to enable RPF and you can always increase the fee.
