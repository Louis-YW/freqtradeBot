  "content": "In the world of cryptocurrency, investing can be a challenging feat especially for the inexperienced. With so many coins to choose from, and fluctuating prices, it can be difficult to decide whether to hold on for the long haul, or seek quick returns with short term investments.Long term investment in cryptocurrency refers to an investment strategy where investors buy and hold onto a particular coin for an extended period of time, with hope of realizing substantial profits in the future. This strategy requires alot of patience and self discipline, as the investor must be willing to hold onto their assets for years, even through market downturns, in order to reap the benefits in the later on.One of the most important advantages of a long term investment in crypto is that it minimizes the risks associated with volatility. Rather than getting caught up in the ups and downs of the market, long term investors use the ‘set it and forget it’ strategy, allowing their investments to grow over time.Ethereum is a good example of a long term investment. The coin has ranked among the top cryptocurrency investments and has shown alot of potential for growth in the future.On the other hand, Short term investment involves traders buying and selling cryptocurrencies within a short period of time, with a view to making quick profits from market volatility. Short term investors take a more active role in their investments, constantly monitoring market trends and making quick decisions to close their positions before any price changes occur. One of the advantages of short term investment in crypto is that it offers quick returns on investment. Traders can buy low and sell high in a matter of days, hours, or minutes, allowing them to take advantage of market volatility and earn their profits. But these quick returns come with alot of risks. Sudden price fluctuations can result in major losses for the investor as well.Bitcoin is an excellent example of a short term investment. Day traders have made quick profits by buying and selling bitcoin within a single day.Honestly, the choice between long term and short term investments in crypto ultimately depends on an individual’s investment goals, risk tolerance, self discipline and patience. Each strategy comes with its own sets of advantages and disadvantages.  As always, it is advisable to do your own research before deciding on which is best for you.For those willing to hold their investments for extended periods of time, long term investment may be a great option, as it comes with fewer risks and higher potential gains. While for those looking for quick profits, short term investment may be more suitable, as it allows traders to capitalize on the volatile nature of crypto markets.",

I think you got it wrong there because just like other pump and dump Alticoins ethereum is just one of them, it just that it is slightly better than the rest of Alticoins in terms of liquidity and market cap/supply but that doesn’t make it any far better than the Alticoins. In fact ethereum is considered a centralized coin since its transition to the POS mechanism where the biggest stakeholders are the manipulators. If there’s any coin worthy of being tagged a long term coin, secure, non manipulative and by far less free of risk then that coin is bitcoin. Although experience traders use it for short term trading also. With bitcoin you can hold for longer years as a of ROI but that will be hard to say for Alticoins",

Day traders have made quick profits by buying and selling bitcoin within a single day.Are you not wrong to write, that ethereum is a good crypto to be used as a long-term investment asset and while bitcoin is instead used as a short-term investment asset. In my opinion, your opinion is not quite right, because actually it is bitcoin that is more suitable to be used as a crypto asset for the long term, not ethereum. Because bitcoin has so far been proven to have the most stable price among other cryptocurrencies. Indeed, bitcoin can also be used as a short-term investment asset, but in my opinion it would be safer if bitcoin was used as a long-term asset. And your opinion about making money fast from investing in crypto, I don't agree, because in my opinion investing in crypto is not an easy way to get fast results, even if it's investing in the short term. Indeed, there are some people who get fast results from investing in crypto, but you should not follow the path of little success. In essence, you have to think realistically.",

Day traders have made quick profits by buying and selling bitcoin within a single day.Aside from being an excellent example of short term investment, Bitcoin is more superb in being a long term investment.  Actually it is better than your given example for long term investment (ethereum).  It has proven that Bitcoin give more profit to people who are into a long term investment.  If you wanted to give an example for short term investment, I think memecoins, and shitcoins are the best example for it.  They often surge in a short period of time due to hype and pump& dump a few weeks/months after it was release in the market then become in hiatus mode for so long until most of them goes bankrupt or worthless...This is mixed AI generated with some human modification.Quote from: uchegod-21 on April 27, 2023, 08:07:00 PMAbout the subject matter,  a shit coin is determined by their road map and value and not necessary by market cap which can also be manipulated. Nope, for shitcoins, roadmap is just a decoration and has nothing to do with the value of the coins.  Shitcoin market as you stated is often manipulated and subject to pump and dump before withering away.",

But aside from how this writing is created, In fact, we already have many clearer sources and details to tell the difference. But what is certain is that someone can be a short or long term investor, depending on what coin or how the strategy is. Because usually, different coins can also have different strategies, especially for hype coins, maybe this won't be good for the long term. Meanwhile, there are certain coins that are very potential for the long term, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various other top altcoins. But for those who have small capital, it seems that the short term might be more valuable, but it still depends on how our strategy is in executing.",

That's because it doesn't need a broad knowledge to start, you just buy and hold patiently for longer period of a year or more as the case may be, without having to deal with technicalities as in the case with short term ( minutes, days, hours or a week's).QuoteFor those willing to hold their investments for extended periods of time, long term investment may be a great option, as it comes with fewer risks and higher potential gains.If anyone want to take on a long term investment plan it should be on a coin you're confident about and not just a random coin as most alts don't even survive a year before going extinct, so to be on the safe side bitcoin is most preferable for longer investment.",
