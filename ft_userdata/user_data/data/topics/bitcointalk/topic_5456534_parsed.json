That's the case always with the US government.  QuoteThe reason why all this is happening with crypto is the money that crypto is capable of generating, the fear of crypto growing bigger and them America, not being the biggest benefactor scares them. Could be one of the reasons why American government is behind all centralized exchanges. But unfortunately, US government will have to face defeat once again. Because the world have moved to a free trade zone. If one country becomes restrictive, others open up. So if US continues to scare crypto companies, they will just shut their operations there and move to a crypto friendly country. New Innovations in crypto space will happen somewhere else than America. That's simple!",

While those political pockets have been fat thanks to Sam, there goes those trusting and innocent people that have lost their money.",

The government is rather candid about their plans regarding regulations.If you want to get into the conspiracy theories, you can look at larger motives for the activists and politicians that are advocates against crypto. New World Order? Globalists instilling their agenda? Perhaps something more inauspicious is going on. What could these people gain from ensuring you and I don't have access to decentralized currencies -- presumably wealth and power.What happened with FTX and campaign contributions happens all the time in American politics. Seemingly people are surprised that the wealthy pay off politicians through indirect donations when that's been the status quo for many decades. The average net worth of the U.S. politician is 1M+. They're not gaining this wealth through their public salary alone.",

The reason why all this is happening with crypto is the money that crypto is capable of generating, the fear of crypto growing bigger and them America, not being the biggest benefactor scares them. I really agree with what you said, that if we review and examine further how SAM seems to be able to move freely and doesn't like being under close supervision. My point here is of course that this kind of treatment does not reflect true justice when the US government is silent so that no names are leaked to the public as a result of involvement in the flow of campaign funds and politics from SAM. With clear evidence, SAM should be completely defeated but how come the news is now dim? Mastering the media does not necessarily create commotion involving many parties and indeed this confusion must be answered. The lingering unfinished cases shows that the US legal system is elusive. The controls behind the scenes are tighter than they might appear on the surface.",

What the USA has contributed to the health, peace and stability of this world is unmeasurable and will never be forgotten, and if they stop today, I can assure you that the whole world will be in derision. That war you called will now be truly obvious when many countries started fighting themselves over little differences.

I don't know what Sam's funding of politicians and others has to do with his and FTX's probe, after all, those politicians are not running the affairs of FTX. They, I believe, would have presumed Sam as a CEO of an approved multibillion dollars company. So, why should they be probed or indicted? Sam was running a dully registered company and even if he is sent to jail, it's him alone unless with any persons and politicians that connived with him in the fraudulent act, not those who merely spend the money he gave them.People and companies will continue to fund anything or persons they want to, as long as the recipients are not involved in their direct criminality, they are good to go.",

America is definitely scared, and this time their fear isn't capable of being solved with physical war. This time, the war has to be won digitally.
