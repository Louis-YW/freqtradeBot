It means it saves it somewhere and can back it up even without your agreement if needed.",

For the issue of the seed phare, I've always been wondering if wallets could truly be truthful in their saying that they did not know your seed phrase. Although this is the first place I would read about this, it was the ordinal consideration that was my headache with Ledger before I read this.If it's true, then one should be so careful of their Bitcoin in wallets, it will now be the integrity of the wallet you are using that can safeguard your Bitcoin. And it would surely prove that many of the supposed hacking of the past where BTC were stolen might not be truly hacking but the wallet propaganda to steal coins from one's account.",

This decision kinda break the trust that has been built over years with their users.I know that there's no funds have been stolen yet but this move is concerning because many people rely on Ledger devices to safeguard their life savings in Bitcoin. It's not something to take lightly; these users prioritize security and privacy. Personally, I prefer using an air-gapped device that I own and have full control over rather than relying on a hardware device released by a company that introduces updates that could potentially putting my funds at risk.I value my ability to secure my funds and protect my private keys/seed phrase.

There will always be a risk that the custodian, if he has the opportunity, will want to take someone else's.Big hardware wallet manufacturers are gradually turning into a kind of banks. It looks like you are giving them your crypto for safekeeping and you have to trust them completely. Just for a word. In the light of recent events (news about Ledger and Trezor), it seems that the time has come for people to reconsider their attitude towards hardware wallets. Where once these were reliable storage devices, security is now at risk. The most unpleasant thing about this is that the danger doesn't come from intruders or hackers, but from the manufacturer itself. It would seem that it sounds like nonsense, but we are all eyewitnesses of what is happening.Only the owner should have access to the seed phrase and no HW device manufacturer has any right to claim it.
