  "content": "I showed garage mining in Russia, and now some information about legal mining in Moscow.In this case, I rule out theft of electricity, because in the Moscow region control is very serious and mining farms operate there legally.The police transported miners worth about 1 billion rubles (11,25 million dollars) in several trucks. According to the source, no documents, including investigators’ certificates, resolutions and protocols, were presented to the owners of the equipment.https://newsiteworks.com/rezonans/item/89214-u-maynerov-iz-zvenigoroda-otzhali-oborudovaniya-na-milliardhttps://t.me/NewsSoleniy/8593",

Please clarify.Once I heard of thieves coming to steal ASICs machines in a mining farm and the owners of the farm fighting back with fire arms.",

Please clarify.From what I understood from the article shared by OP (using Google Translate), it seems like the police just seized a mining farm that is not registered or has any documents supporting its operation at all. I think it shows that running a mining farm without permission (if I understood it right) is quite risky since the police can easily seize it all.",

In the Moscow region, mining is safer than in Siberia, because you do not need to fear bandits and private security companies will arrive very quickly in case of an alarm. But the police can take away the mining farm.In Siberia it’s the other way around. There are no security companies in the taiga, and you protect your property on your own.",

Is cheap electricity the only reason, or is the registration process quite difficult to do so? What sort of reason can make the government take down your mining farm other than running it illegally?",

Probably the main reason is that in Russia there is no law on mining, so all mining farms violate the laws and can be confiscated.Another reason is rumored to be to free up electricity capacity for more important production. Or maybe someone will take away someone else’s business.",

      "body": "https://t.me/KartavKanaLL/10500This picture shows how Russia plans to combat home mining.The first 2 lines are tariffs in the city. The cheaper tariff is for apartments with electric stoves and line 3 is tariffs for rural areas.If an apartment or house consumes more than 2100-2400 kilowatts per month, then the price of electricity increases. This is a bill from Bashkiria, but in Russia the authorities in each region may have their own consumption standards and prices.they even impose restrictions on garages and summer cottages",
