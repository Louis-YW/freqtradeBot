There are many alts with really nice chart structure that have been waiting to pop but haven’t due to weakness in bitcoin and ethereum. Today we are starting to see those go. Also since we shorted Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) there’s an update on how that trade is going as well! Lastly, I'm going to keep track of the profits we make on this channel so you can see if you might be interested in joining the pro channel. So far we just closed our first trade - 51% in the green!https://youtu.be/F3BhOGoyboA",

Details in the link below.https://youtu.be/CtsNwQDDBQgLUNC becomes weak since the day the big attack happened on the Terra UST tokens. Shorting a almost dead project is absurd while there’s a lot of project out there that already hanging by a thread like Celsius that obviously on the process of bankruptcy yet there are still users willing to purchase it just because most of its supply is locked on Celsius dapps. This token is like a ticking time bomb that only waits for the official announcement of the team about completely shutting down.I already learned my lesson on investing Luna before for not shorting it while everyone is already in doubt but shorting it now will just give you small profit percentage since it’s down a lot on its normal price.",

We have got enough of this scam coin and we won't repeat the same mistakes again. I think one is enough. So you found out that the coin is getting weaker and my guess is that you see that as a good opportunity to invest in? Ok fine that's your money so you can take the risk but you only gotta make sure that you will sell immediately once the coin recovers some of the value that it lost last time.You are already lucky when this happens so don't waste it just because you got greedy. You drop some analysis there about eth and btc. I will take note of the btc one but for eth, I think it can sustain its good momentum.",

Luna is a project that has caused huge losses to many crypto investors. Now Lunc has pumped up a bit so op is thinking of taking a short trade. When there are more coins in the market and positions to trade in those coins, I don't think there is any need to risk your money by trading high risk coins like this one. Whales know very well how to trap traders. So I think the op should look at the market situation more if the trend changes.",
