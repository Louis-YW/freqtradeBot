  "content": "Quote from: ¬† ‚û• The cleanest coins from the Cutest Bitcoin Mixer /][Mixy Clearnet] & /][Tor Mirror]  &  /#faq][Mixy FAQ] & /#contacts][Contacts]/]/][banned mixer] is the best BTC mixer and is built on a unique self-written algorithm that provides real cleaning of your Bitcoins. We actually purify bitcoin, not send coins from one user to another. All the coins you get, come directly from exchanges, pass any purity tests, and completely anonymize your actions. üê±¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Summary‚û• No logs (no logs at all).‚û• You do not need registration to work with us. You are completely anonymous.‚û• We do not use KYC in our work. We dont care about AML, cause you came to us to clear them.The coins you want to clear go to our props. Within hours, they are mixed by repeatedly sending them to thousands of different addresses. After that, the money is sent to the exchanges for the final break in the chain of ties. After 3-6 hours, you will receive back absolutely clean coins that cannot be associated with the coins you sent earlier. We guarantee that all AML tests are passed and that the coins received are completely unassociated with you.We charge between 3% and 5% of the amount + a flat fee of 0.0007 BTC. The minimum amount to clear is 0.003 BTC, the maximum is 50 BTC. If you need to clear a large amount, you can do it in several transactions, or contact the operator directly, we will definitely find a solution, (you can use the telegram bot or write to us at [banned mixer] (at) proton.me).We issue digitally signed letters of guarantee, which is a one hundred percent guarantee of safety of your money. The letter of guarantee is insurance against disputable situations. It consists of two parts: the guarantee text and our digital signature. Be sure to keep this letter, you may need it in case of disputable situations, (do not send a letter of guarantee to us on Bitcointalk).Our site is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. If you have a disputable situation - our technical support will promptly solve any of your questions, (our operator will help you as soon as possible). Please note that our corporate account on Bitcointalk cannot handle any disputes, so use telegram bot only, or contact us by /[banned mixer]@proton.me]email.____________________Code:Contacts: https://t.me/MixyMoneyBot, [banned mixer](at)proton.meClearnet: https://[banned mixer]/Tor Mirror: http://[banned mixer]/Quote from: [banned mixer] ¬†  ¬† /]",

But they (the company) would have contacted the first account user to give them the login details instead of creating double jeopardy for the same purpose. Now that the former thread can't be locked and can't be use, what do you think will happen to the two account? Now @mixymoney representative of the new ANN account will be trying to stop people from using the old account but they can't because the thread there is still open and the website contained the link of the old thread so if people clink on the link in the website they would be directed to the old thread and not the new one. So I advise that they should insert the link of the old thread in the OP of the new thread and advise people not to engage themselves on the old thread but for the new thread.",

Are you worried that they overloaded the server? First of all thank you very much for understanding my side of the comments, I have said that also for them to change it. And I have not rejected what you told me earlier about accessing the old account, I accepted all you said, but I was also making some contribution for the development of the website and the company but icopress misunderstood me and judged me from his anger. Yes I am not from English speaking country, but I can communicate with someone with English for the person's understanding, though in the process of communicating I would make mistakes. Since when I came, I have not engaged user for a long discussion like I am doing with you. Because I take you and someone who understands me. I never say anything bad about Mixy Money, I was only saying what they should do and also trying to know why And I don't know that had offended someone. Sorry for that if I have done that. I was only trying to create a conversational scene because that is the most interesting part in the forum. Forum without discussion is boring.icopress I am trying my best.
