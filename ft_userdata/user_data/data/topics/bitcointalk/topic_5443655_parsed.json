Most of newbies are confused to use Bisq isn't because how it's hard to install and create the new account, but they're doesn't know how to get Bitcoin to fund his account. In your tutorial, you're not explain about it, so you're completely miss the most important point. Few ways to fund his account is trade with user in this forum, through direct or other sites P2P, if he use his coin from centralized exchange, his privacy will be compromised.Someone already create this guide before [2].[1] https://docs.bisq.network/getting-started.html[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5430964.msg61480963#msg61480963",

      "body": "I commend you on the work you have done to put this tutorial through to readers, and Bisq is a decentralized exchange that anyone that wants to maintain their privacy and anonymity will not regret using.But I believe you put this tutorial together in a hurry, the single image uploaded is not helping, you should have used several images with captions and written words to back them up in a more simplified manner.With the way you did it, it might even be more confusing to a new visitor than how the site is really. You might also want to improve the image quality too.Just make an adjustment, you have done well.",
