Anyways, I hope they throw the book at this guy big time, he deserves to rot in jail!",

I was always clueless why they would venture into fashion when it doesn’t make adoption for crypto any easier. FTX spent so much money on brand-ambassadors and endorsements. It is estimated that the firm spent over $375 million on these promotion spree. Tom Brady, Shaquille O’Neal, Steph Curry, Naomi Osaka, Larry David and other were paid heavily to promote the firm. Sporting organizations like Miami Heat, Major League Baseball, Golden State Warriors, Washington Wizards and many more in US and other countries signed very expensive promotional or partnership deals with FTX. I might not be able to indicate the positive effects of these huge expenses to the firm, but I am sure Binance is spending moderately (this is not an endorsement of any centralized exchange}",

SBF was never worth 10's of billions of dollarsit was all 'paper' valuations not real coin/assets he owned outright nor fiat he had outright of his own ownership in his pocketbut you continue beleiving in the articlesthat saidrecently ... for about one day, i beleived some article that SBF was trading bitcoin on mtgox in 20113-14 while interning for jane street.. but i realised my mistakeif you want to spend months beleiving SBF actually personally earned 10's of billions.. well thats on younow lets just rub it in further and translate the link you provided which YOU think is SBF profiting from korea's kimchiQuote In January 2018, at only 25 years old, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), who had just left Wall Street, discovered an incredible arbitrage opportunity when trading cryptocurrencies-due to the enthusiasm of local investors, the Japanese market Bitcoin price has a 10% premium compared to the United States./color]At that time, others in the crypto market were being distracted by another even more amazing thing-Bitcoin on the Korean market had a 30% price difference (the so-called “Kimchi Premium”)[/color] than the US, but South Korea restricted The sexual monetary policy makes it difficult for the Korean won to be converted into US dollars. SBF himself had thought about taking advantage of this opportunity in the past. He even once calculated whether it was feasible to build a plane and fill it with people and fly to Seoul to buy Bitcoin directly.After discovering opportunities in the Japanese market, SBF decided to take action. Large-scale arbitrage execution is quite complicated. SBF and his friends founded a trading company called Alameda Research in Berkeley, California. They set up a series of intermediaries, including some small banks in rural areas of Japan, and used a month-long Regional premium arbitrage can generate up to 25 million U.S. dollars per day.if you are just trying to poke at electric rates as if your the rate king.. japan and germany both have the same rate high electric. where hawaii has even higherbut there is no good exchange in germany compared to japanalso other euro exchanges are not rated at germany rural price discovery, but euro average which is since 2013 been priced into the us rate..scale of sheep following the ups and downs at a forex adjusted amountEG if you look at the us market of bitcoin and then the eu market for bitcoin they shadow trace each price movement up is up down is down. sheep followhowever japanese bitcoin market had a different community of bitcoins thus a different price discovery sentiment thus japan was nor tracing us.. which meant there was an opportunity.",

IDK if it's true that he is planning to venture the fashion industry but that seems hilarious. You are right, it wasn't his field but his expertise is only at crypto or trading.Maybe that was also the reason on why his primary company got bankrupt. Another thing where SBF spends his money is through donations from a government. I think this can be considered as a dumb move because governments are already rich, more if they are corrupt.",
