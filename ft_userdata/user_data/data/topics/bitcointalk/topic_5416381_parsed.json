  "content": "Time has changed, and scammers change their scamming method as well. Most scammers have used fake photos and plagiarized websites previously. But now a lot of scammers scam with the real photo or KYC. So investing in a brand new project become gambling. It's because it's no more easy to detect scams nowadays. Scammer rugging investors with KYC or real team photos/video. They don't care about anything. Who can take action even if they skip with funds? Who will find them? They just raised funds and enjoy. After a few days, all investors forget about it and start new gambling. So how to detect smart scams? To be honest there is no way. Whether the project has KYC or Audit doesn't mean it's safe for a team that isn't a scammer. They just don't care about everything. Although we can't prevent scams we may try at least to save our funds. Here is how. 1. Don't invest in a brand-new project. 2. If you invest assume you are gambling with your funds. 3. See if the project has live utilities which are fully functional. 4. Don't believe the KYC report, because there are a lot of people who sell KYC. 5. Check the project's Partnership and verify if it's real and potential. Once again, don't invest in the brand new project.",

Some believe that having low marketcap would make the price pump, that could be right, but in the process, some coins become exit scam, some become pump and dump, and some may become like old luna in the future. If everyone has preferred to just go for bitcoin, it would have been better for scam avoidance.",

Various projects actually use Bitcoin as bait, not to mention various fake online and desktop/mobile wallets that will either steal everything that is deposited to their addresses or their security is so bad that sooner or later hackers will get to the user's coins.Of course, with investing in Bitcoin and proper storage, every person can avoid various scams, but this whole game is too tempting for the majority of young and inexperienced people who want to become millionaires overnight. Telling such people to ignore all the dubious projects that are offered to them every day is like telling children not to eat sweets because it is bad for their health, while at the same time putting those same sweets in front of them.One of the methods that everyone should adhere to is the one that says \"if it's too good to be true, it must be a lie.\"",

I agree that don't be too quick to invest in new projects because it's mostly a gamble. Even if they have the best PR marketing and the best proposal, still, analyze and verify if that's the project that you like to buy. Don't just rely on how they make announcements and advertisements because that's how they get a lot of investors easily. There's a sense of approval and trust if they're going through that way of convincing investors. But as someone who knows how to be vigilant before trusting, you know what to do and don't be a gullible investor.",

All this, of course, misleads newcomers who are deceived by flashy advertising and promises of fantastic payouts.It was, is, and will be. As soon as people begin to understand one scam, the scammers will go further.The race will continue as long as there is demand.But newcomers who have arrived here on the forum have an excellent opportunity not to get involved in various scams, but to learn from the experience of others, and trust those coins that have earned trust over time",

Whether the project has KYC or Audit doesn't mean it's safe for a team that isn't a scammer. They just don't care about everything. Believing that every audited project is legitimate is the worst because there are hundreds of audit companies that are only after the money and do not care or do any research into the project they are auditing; nowadays, you get addicted as long as you have a website and a token, no background check, road map, or project capital funds. I've worked on some projects that were audited by a reputable audit team and then went awry after a while. Never accept an audited project; always DYOR.Quote from: The Cryptovator on October 08, 2022, 08:27:02 AM1. Don't invest in a brand-new project. Being a new project does not imply that it will scam in the future; every project began with one customer before growing to millions of users, and the rules of crypto have always been to enter early and exit late. Every investment is a gamble; you either win or lose; there are no middle ground options. But, while I understand that investing in a new project carries a higher risk than investing in a proven project, how can we tell if the project is a scam without investing in it?Quote from: The Cryptovator on October 08, 2022, 08:27:02 AM5. Check the project's Partnership and verify if it's real and potential. Is this really important?

There were some highly rated projects that went on to become shit after a successful ICO, and there were projects that received no ratings and went on to become great.

If you invest assume you are gambling with your funds.I don't agree. Investment means do your own research before making decisions to spend money or skip it. It is not like gambling but I guess your point is \"Don't invest if you can not afford to lose\". If you implied about people who invest without any research and consideration, they are gamblers and what they do is gambling, not investing.Quote3. See if the project has live utilities which are fully functional.It is the point. Utilities and use cases create values for project, then its native token.Quote4. Don't believe the KYC report, because there are a lot of people who sell KYC.KYC is better than anonymous but KYC itself does not decide that project is non-scam.Quote5. Check the project's Partnership and verify if it's real and potential. Sometimes, it is a good indicator but even so, projects can turn to scam very quickly.
