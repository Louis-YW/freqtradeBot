I'm not entirely sure if they had another domain but most likely not given how their exchange screamed tight budget. What happened back then was coinsmarkets exit scammed but they first tried to stall users by giving loads of excuses which went for weeks or months (?) until they finally went MIA, see this mega thread about it: CoinsMarkets.com IS DOWN!",

I just don't think that coinsmarkets who took their time to stall users before disappearing completely would show up using their old name-- because the redirect links them with one another. But yeah, a quick look at bitcoinsmarter.net and it screamed shady af lol.",
