Don’t post here if you don’t play this particular slot provider.I'm always complaining about this slot provider for being very hard to give a win. I knew that this slot game pays a lot if you are very lucky but I never won any huge amount from this provider as normal slot player that play 500+ spin every game. Bonus round is very hard to hit and it usually give a penny payout even you hit it for tons of spin. The only reason why I'm still coming back playing on this provider even with bad experience on results is due to its very good game graphics.Anyone here having a good time on this slot provider? Just making sure someone here having a good time on this hellish slot.",

Sometimes i will have like less than 20 spins and I will get the bonus. And then days that are totally lost all my capital winning hitting the bonus or even getting a good pay/multiplier.And perhaps it might have been discussed here by a thread by @mu_enrico Slots 101: Basics, Strategies, and Discussion (with poll).",

      "body": "Yes, @panjul was correct come to 101 Slot Thread.In there you will learn from experience and overview of each slot or provider. HackSwa Gaming is one of the slot provider who can provided you a big multiplier, however the volatility is really extream and cannot be predictable comparing to the provider like \"Pragmatic & PlayNGo\" they can easily to be predicted (example: hitting scatter around 100-120 spin).But they have a shitty max win multiplier. Meanwhile a slot like HackSaw Gaming, Push Gaming, Relax Gaming, No Limit, and other have really a random pattern we cannot make a prediction but once you hit a lucky moment (your multiplier winning can get really high) comparing Pragmatic & PlayNGo.",

      "body": "Honestly thought that they were just ripping me off cause I never won anything in their games which doesn't really faze me that much cause I'm not gambling for profit but after a while you'd think that their games will be much more lenient on you, only to be disappointed cause they'll never let you win at all! I switched to a different slot provider after that cause Hacksaw's basically a hack for me lmao.

Good for you then if you're able to win something lol cause as someone like me who never really pushes for a large bankroll especially if I'm not feeling like investing a lot in a game, Hacksaw's not going to be your best friend. Although I would agree with you, their visuals are definitely on a whole another level.",

But for those who have a good experience with Hacksaw then good for them I guess,  .",

Perhaps, I can still have fun playing slots from this slot provider, even though I'm still not lucky. I prefer Pragmatic Play, Red Tiger, or even Play'N Go over this provider because the difficulty of winning is lower than other providers.As for the game graphics, I think it's almost the same as other slot providers. But it seems like we need very high luck to win and even win a little money from slot games from this provider. Perhaps, I will try to play one or more of the slot games later.",

Perhaps, I will try to play one or more of the slot games later.It’s really not the same in terms of graphics. Nolimit, Hacksaw and Relax Gaming are the top 3 slot provider that provides slot games with cool graphics and style that other slot provider failed to deliver. Playngo and Pragmatic are both same normal style slot games but they have the best hit ratio among slot providers based on my experience.I understand the frustration of OP with this provider but Hacksaw did pay me huge multiplier by playing Anubis. I believe it’s all about luck on who will get that massive payout.",

They will make you experience win but too little of chance. When there's a bonus spin it was actually like coded not to give you something haha. Idk maybe I'm just unlucky too  but my experience with H.Saw Gaming compare to other casino is just abit off for me.",
