The address is theirs, although associated to your account. Since it's not yours, you cannot sign with it.You can download Electrum (it would be good if you would make sure you get it from Electrum.org and also verify it), make a new wallet, make sure you keep safe the seed of that wallet, get one of the addresses and sign a message with it.For Ethereum I can't help.",

If you can't provide that then you should at least try sort the ethereum one out. Maybe the OP (his friend) can try it if he has never posted a bitcoin address from a non-custodial wallet.@OP, I've tried to create an eth address sign message: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3383051.msg35709111#msg35709111.

Like on this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=996318.0Quote from: Panglima Perang on September 28, 2022, 02:31:45 AMAny one have ideas how to signed message trough Ethereum Network? my friend used metamask address for post proof on several bounties campaign.I do not aso know much about ether and ethereum wallet, but probably these guides below could be helpful. You can follow this guide: https://www.independentreserve.com/blog/knowledge-base/how-to-sign-a-message-with-metamaskThis guide should be of help if you import the seed phrase on MyEther wallet: How do I sign a message with my Ethereum address?",

The OP said he could send some coins from his friend's wallet.Here's an archive of the OP's post before he deleted it:https://ninjastic.space/address/0x2F474a12871C847F4C717b3CDCF84C3Df19c78A5",
