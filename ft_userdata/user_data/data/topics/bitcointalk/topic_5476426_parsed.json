Just kidding.You are just JNr-member, you can't add a picture. Once you rank up to Full member, you can start adding custom pictures to your profile, which is called Avatar.

I think it is too early to add a picture to your profile, and once again point of clarification: this is not what'sup that you may set a profile picture, and it's called an avatar not a picture, and before engaging in that stage, you must first accumulate some merits and activities in order to rank up to full member.Nevertheless, Just keep learning and exercising patience, and more experience will arrive after you rank up to full member. Not that I'm a senior or full member; I'm still a single member like you, so bear with me. Everything in life is a gradual process, we can also achieve the privilege as well.",

You have to get ranked first, it is in the rules of this forum that to wear an avatar you have to become a full member first, and to become one you have to get around 100 merits and I think 120 activities. Here you can find more about the rank system: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5170032.0 I hope you already know the process of wearing the picture in your avatar, if you already know then all you have to become is a full member.I checked other replies and it seems that many members had already replied the same thing and you also confirmed that you know the answer now. So it would be better for you to lock this thread because if this thread served the purpose for which it was made then the best practice is to lock the thread.

I am sure with time, the Op will get used to the terms that are being used on the forum here. Op is using the terms that is been used on social media in forums, but this is not a social media. I hope the OP is not trying to post his picture on the forum here, the forum is not a place where you should post your picture. Let’s make everything anonymous, you don’t have to reveal your identity. Most of the avatars people are wearing are promoting a company, a few of them decide to design their own avatar and upload it, they do decide to make any design of their choice and upload it, but not their real picture.",
