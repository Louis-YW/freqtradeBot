Then i'd probably look at the product they're trying to sell: do they look legal or are they probably hacked???Only if the seller has a lot of trusted positive feedback (not feedback coming from untrusted newbies), is around for a longer time and (preferably) allows escrow, is selling legal accounts (to the best of your knowledge), i'd consider buying from them..",

      "body": "The low rate/fee is not the problem here but the genuity of the service, just find the genuine ones and leave the rest. This is often a partnership arrangement if it's genuine, those companies/services are buying it in bulk and at a subsidized rate after negotiating with the originating companies.They are to do more marketing for the real company to sell their products and it's a win-win situation for the two parties.But be careful about how you make your payments, genuine or not, they could still hide under that to scam people of their data and money. I love to use an account or cards that are strictly for online payment for such a service. I don't hold much money in such accounts.",

I have experience on Netflix but yours is pretty cheap I bought a Netflix account with 1 monthly subscription for $3 from a legit seller I don't have any problem except many users use the same account meaning it is shared accounts I'm not the only one who uses the account.As for me, I've never had any problems until now. However, if you buy a Netflix subscription for $1.5, you might get some issues in the future such as a login issue or movies unable to play because many users use the same account at the same time.I'm sure ChatGPT has the same issue if many users are using the same account.Except if you are the only one using it and if it's not a hacked account.",

Purchasing discounted air tickets is risky since you will need to input your name on the purchase and the bank can track you if ever the original owner of credit card report the unauthorized transaction.Premium subscription typically acquire through purchasing hack cc. Those premium accounts is a risk of losing premium in monthly basis since the cc owner can stop the subscription anytime. I think just enjoy the premium while it last. I have Netflix premium account that I purchased for 20$ with 1 year premium subscription as per the seller but it’s already 5 year since I purchase and still working until now.",

Because of low rate? I would avoid every account that's created with hacked cards, that's morally unethical and you may end up in trouble.From my experience, a lot of companies offer cheap prices to Turkish customers, including Playstation, Netflix and some other famous companies. You can get legit account from Turkish resellers that won't be hacked. Overall, it's not really legal to use Turkish account if you live in another country but you won't have any problem, it's like a gray (grey for brits) zone.Just keep in mind, when deal is too good for you and too bad for the seller, then something is definitely wrong there. Before you buy any account, always check what can be the minimal price if it was legit for you to buy from countries where it's cheap.",

Except for air ticket selling I have dealt with many dealers who are selling all the other tools and services you mentioned in your post. And to be honest, if you get your hands on a decent and trust dealer then you could really use these services for a lesser amount and at a good deal. Let's say I wanted to buy Semrush one time but the budget is so out then I remember a dealer who could provide me a screen of the account because such tools have the option to add members in the team.Once the members are added they all could use the tool but some might have more authority while some will have less. Point is all that makes the buying of such tool safe is getting them from a trusted seller and belive me it is very hard to find them but once you will be among the people of same niche or field then you will find them easily.

Most accounts are likely from gray market so there's always a good chance something could go wrong. This is why most of these sellers offer replacement if you encounter a problem -- at least from what I've seen in the past.I've also seen sellers come and go so for monthly subscriptions like netflix, you wouldn't wanna avail a 12-month subscription right off the bat lol.

I was able to get that license key for cheapbut after a few weeks then it started out to show up that \"This copy of Windows is not genuine\" which i did really promise myself not to deal up with cheap things. There's always catch up into it.In speaking whether you would really be buying or not with these things then its up to you but you wont really be that so dumb on not to know about the probabilities about whether these things to be legit or not.Safe? Its never been that known unless if you do buy into those legit stores who do really offer with those real prices but who wont really be get tempted if you do able to get 70-80% off into its original price? I cant really blame them out on why people would really be that interested on dealing and buying with these things without trying out to look out about the potential risks.",
