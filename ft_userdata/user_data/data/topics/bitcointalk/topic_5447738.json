Being a solo miner means trying your luck these days. If you have a few miners, You may try it by running one of them. But, Be informed that you won't earn anything until you hit a block. It may take more than a month to find a block, or it may take longer. Depend on your miner's hash rate (More hashrate= More chances to find a block). But, Sometimes, lucky Solo miners find a block within days. If you run your miner solo and lose patience without finding a block, all your effort will remain unpaid. There is nothing you can do and no one to blame. So, be careful when you run your miner. Do your research before you invest in solo mining. It may lead you to financial damage if you cannot continue mining due to impatience.",

But, I believe Mining is not all about making money only. Whoever gets started Mining at some point gets addicted to it. You are a miner, so you know what I am talking about. Some people will continue Mining if their Mining becomes unprofitable. I used to mine ETH when it was POW. But, As you know, Almost every GPU Minable algorithm/coin is unprofitable right now. Still, I mined a couple of weeks before some of the rigs got burned, and I didn't bother to repair them. Mining is making money and fun at the same time. I don't know how you will take this in your life. It was fun for me. I used to Mine ETH and Exchange them for BTC. Whoever comes new to Mining and hoping to make too much money, I won't suggest them as old miners are getting unprofitable, and energy costs are increasing daily in my area. So, I don't recommend any new miners to start solo mining unless they are extreme passionate about mining.",

Your best bet is still to have multiple miners running because you don't earn anything from validating blocks on bitcoin, you earn something when you find a bitcoin block. Not saying that solo mining is not goox anymore. For all I know it's still as profitable as ever, but the problem lies in whether your rig is powerful enough. If it isn't, you're toast.",

Whether solo or in a pool, the miner (or a pool's miner in the case of pool) needs to solve the block to receive the block reward.So those who mine solo enjoy the block reward without sharing it, but the probability of getting it is slim (as others have said it depends on hashrate and luck, it's totally random)Many people mine solo with a small percentage of their hashrate, this allows them to keep a more or less stable income and have a small part of the hashrate left over like a lottery ticket. OP, here is an quote from the following link that sums it up correctly: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pool_vs._solo_miningQuotePros/ConsPool Mining ProsPooled mining generates a steadier income.Pooled mining can generate a 1-2% higher income (before fees, if any) due to long polling provided by the pools.Pool Mining ConsPool mining can suffer interruptions from outages at the pool provider.Pools are subject to DOS attacks and have other downtimes, too. Backup pools and solo mining can be configured for these cases.Pooled mining tends to generate a smaller income due to fees being charged and transaction fees not being cashed out.There are zero fee pools. Until now, transaction fees are not cashed out by any pool.Pools might be part of attack scenarios.Solo Mining ProsSolo mining is less prone to outages resulting in higher uptime.Solo mining doesn't incur any fees. For each discovered block, 6.25 BTC and the transaction fees are paid to the miner.Solo Mining ConsSolo mining tends to generate more erratic income.Solo mining wastes time due to only supporting getwork pull.",
