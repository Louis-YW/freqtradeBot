  "content": "Greetings, looking to sell my Poker Mavens Gold key. Purchased late last year as I wanted to start a new poker site operation, however plans fell through and the key is currently sitting unused. Retail for a new product key is $500, I am willing to part with mine for $200, 60% off retail value. Also willing to throw in a custom card package with 4 color deck for more variety in your game offerings. If you would like to speak further please contact me on telegram at @tryTOKEepUP , thank you.https://www.briggsoft.com/pmavens.htmSoftware has been around for over a decade and works flawlessly, a wide variety of game options to suit almost any poker player or operators needs.",
