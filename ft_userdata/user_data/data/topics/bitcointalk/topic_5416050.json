  "content": "First of all I really thank to him who whitelisted me and allow me to post here. This is the post, where my name is listed.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5355092.msg57719904#msg57719904Special Thanks to him/her who just allowed me to post here.Thank you sir. Upgrade00Let me explain how I learn how to post. I registered on 14 Sep, 2022 and whitelist on 22 Sep, 2022.After that I go to every board. I saw this board too and learn a lot. I saw Bitcoin Discussion, trading discussion, gambling, Wall Observe, Local Boards and many others. But still didn't get that how to post.Then I found the quot button and saw that how a person post. And where I saw image and open that in quote and saw that how he/she posted a link of an image.I know many threads are available on this forum which are telling how to post but I learn it by own and now I think I have some knowledge to post here.I learn these points step by step. 1. Qoute Already mentioned that at first I touched this button and saw that how anyone has posted. One post I saw use this.Code:[quote][/quote]I learned that in between this, the text will be qouted.2. Image Insertion Code:[img][/img]This feature is for image Insertion. In between you can post an image link.Here is the example.Code:[url=https://ibb.co/VVTzBD1][img]https://i.ibb.co/rkHzyMj/images-17.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://statewideinventory.org/ford-0-60-times]2014 ford escape titanium 0 60[/url]2014 ford escape titanium 0 60I know my image will not be shown because I am newbie.3. URL Insertion with textThis is the code.Code:[url][/url]And to show text on front we use like this. I am showing my profile with( My Profile) textCode:[url=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3503706]My Profile [/url]This will look like.My Profile 4. CodeI have used it many time above.Text in between this will show as code, likeCode:My Profile.I am still on learning stage. I will try to my best to learn.Hope I will get more suggestions from others. There can be mistakes but hope you guys will teach politely.Thanks.",

      "body": "A warm and special welcome to the forum mate, posting is easy, and it's good that you are already learning, all the examples you listed are correct, but there are still many more to learn, for example...1. Making a table2. Resizing images using the height and width attributes3. Aligning images horizontally - i.e, posting images side by side. 4. Using the list attribute to make a list, and even make lists inside a list.5. SOME important Bitcointalk guide for beginners - is a thread which I found and I think will be good if you read through it as well.Wishing you all the best.",

      "body": "Welcome to the forum @OP and happy to see that you have brainstormed these things and learnt to post in different ways which is every newbie must focus upon like you have tried to do so by explaining the things with examples you have learnt about.Speaking about whitelist then your proxy ban was removed as there is evil fees attached to your IP if it's been banned before and there are evil units attached to it but your account was whitelisted so you are able to register here but it you want to learn about the same here is you can find the  details Speaking about image insertion then you have done it in right way but as already pointed out you have to copy the Bbcode from image hosting site and then insert in img tags and you can url tag if you don't want image to be clickable.Code: [img]Bbcode here[/img]Also remember to resize the image and you can do it in this manner :Code: [img width=300 ] Bbcode here[/img]But you will learn slowly if you are dedicated enough for it and have made up your mind.Also long time ago I have created a thread about posting techniques to help members you can check it here : Posting techniques for newbies on the forum",
