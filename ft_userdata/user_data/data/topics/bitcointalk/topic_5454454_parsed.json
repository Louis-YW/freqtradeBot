I was interested but been a student I wasn't with any tangible fund so had to seek my parents help.

Let them decide for their own and if they have knowledge om stock then let them be since for sure they know the risk and dom't have huge chance to lose all their money compare to investing on bitcoin where volatility is so high. Timing is also important factor on bitcoin so w you need to see the market condition before introducing to your parents so that they will not buy this asset at the top price or what we called ATH.",

You will be unofficially responsible for your invitation and if they have something bad with investment, you will feel part of responsibility and it's not good.Anyway your parents are wrong about this because bank transfers are kind of online transactions too. So do they think they will lose money with bank transfers?QuoteThe FTX bankruptcy that lead to a massive dip in Bitcoin didn't help either.Dips are terrible for gamblers who use leverages and get forced liquidations by exchanges.Dips are great discounts and opportunities for people who don't use leverage, have cash or stable coins in hands. They don't have to be experienced people, even just by luck, if they can buy dips, they get good profit.Generally it is a great lesson for all, gamblers, newbies to understand more about this market.QuoteThe loss affected my confidence in BitcoinIf you did not store your coins at FTX exchange, did not use leverage, were not get forced liquidation or did not panic and cut loss by yourself, you are not in loss now. What is your case?",

After you sold, there's a chance that it might go down thus, you will not regret your decision because you sold at the right time. On the other hand, there are times where after you sold your Bitcoins, it goes up even higher. You will feel regret, but take note that by the time you sold it, you don't know what would be the next move of Bitcoin. I guess currently you already moved on with that regret. Just be contented with your profits.Quote from: She shining on May 29, 2023, 10:21:31 PMMy country is known for some group of guys called yahoo boys who deal sometimes in crypto scam(a reason crypto is banned in my country) now if you tell most people in my country that you deal in crypto you are branded like one of the boys.

The loss affected my confidence in Bitcoin (cut me some slack knew nothing of this forum) and my parents who I almost convinced took it as been unprofitable and filled with losses. Feel sorry for your losses because of the FTX drama I guess.I also feel sorry that you're living in one of the few countries in the world where crypto is banned.I also felt that way when I was starting. Like you, I also have huge losses in my total crypto portfolio back a few years ago. I also lost confidence at that time, but you know what I did. I believed in crypto. I believe that I can recover those losses in the future, so I choose to hold it, and that's one of the best decisions that I've made. Convince your parents that losses are just impermanent, and tell to them that it will recover soon.Quote from: She shining on May 29, 2023, 10:21:31 PMThey are close to retirement and still believe in saving in banks and buying stocks.

Thanks in advanceBuying stocks is still a good thing since you're investing still, but on a less volatile, and a safer type of investment than crypto. Saving in banks is a no-no unless it is for emergency funds.If you can't convince them to buy Bitcoin, at least just convince them to just focus on the stock market. In that way, they're still investing. It would be a lot safer compare to crypto, and better than just saving it on banks.Planning is useless without action, and capital. Save money as much as possible so you can stack Bitcoin as many as possible. Where can you buy Bitcoin? Centralized exchanges are the ones that I can recommend.",

I don't really know how I could go about convincing them to invest some idle funds in Bitcoin since my father is kinda headstrong.The problem lies here and they understand and trust the pattern of saving at the bank and prefer to buy shares. So forcing them to buy Bitcoin with all their pension funds is completely not right because it talks about volatility, even though Bitcoin is good in storing values sometimes not everyone matches Bitcoin. You must be able to make them enjoy retirement happily and peacefully, leaving them involved in Bitcoin votality will be far more problematic especially their assumptions regarding internet investment are scams.If you intend and insist on this way then you should make a percentage for investing in bitcoin. So you don't use all of their retirement money to buy bitcoin because after all they need money to support their life in retirement.Quote from: She shining on May 29, 2023, 10:21:31 PMI am also planning on buying some Bitcoin when I have some free funds rather than using them for something with no real benefit.

Thanks in advanceDCA is the right way if you intend to buy bitcoins consistently and don't have to wait for the amount of free funds you have, bitcoins can be purchased with any percentage of capital we have and investments should not be made haphazardly without careful estimates. Don't complicate and complicate things when the opportunities are much easier, use simple methods and DCA will help you collect bitcoins consistently.",

My parents are not different they frown against it thinking crypto is a means of scamming others thus biased to stocks. There are very clear differences between scams and cryptocurrencies. The only reason why people assume that there are no genuine crypto businesses is because of ignorance or lack of information. For those that care to know teach them the difference but for others, leave them. The Bitcoin industry is not for everybody so you don't need to convince or force people to them to believe or join the space.QuoteThe FTX bankruptcy that lead to a massive dip in Bitcoin didn't help either. The loss affected my confidence in Bitcoin (cut me some slack knew nothing of this forum) and my parents who I almost convinced took it as been unprofitable and filled with losses. The fall of ftx affected the price of Bitcoin because it promoted FUD. But ftx is an exchange and not Bitcoin. The only relationship ftx has with Bitcoin is that people carelessly keep their funds with exchanges instead of holding them in a self-custodian wallet. Dealing with exchanges is risking your funds.QuoteThey are close to retirement and still believe in saving in banks and buying stocks.

Your parents need that funds to take care of themselves because there will no longer be salaries or wages. Therefore, upmost care should be taken while choosing a sector to invest. Don't force them to invest in Bitcoin because the sector is not also predictable. Let them make their choice of investment by themselves. If you force them, you will be blamed for anything that happens. I will only invest what I own and teach people about my investment. I will always pass the decision to invest to the intending investor.QuoteI am also planning on buying some Bitcoin when I have some free funds rather than using them for something with no real benefit.
