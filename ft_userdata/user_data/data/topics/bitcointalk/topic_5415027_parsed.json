But if your players are from other countries that are regulated, you will need to block these countries right?By doing this, they will have limited patrons. Been meaning to ask also when you want to create a casino but have a low budget for it. It would need a lot of money. How will one acquire a license upon creating a casino without going to Curacao?",

Before a casino can be given licence, there are certain things that would be considered before giving the casino a licence which it qualified for. Any person can set up a gambling site without a licence, it is just a means scam can easily be done.

Just search if you need one for your country. People do not need one if they are in countries that banned gambling and the casino is operating illegally. It is still illegal. Or is there any country you know that has government and regulators that legalized gambling but did not make it mandatory for their casinos to get a licence before operating? If there is, such casinos should be avoided.I know that not all sites are licenced though, which means some gambling sites may not also be licensed. But that is bad to use.The first thing I checked about gambling site before I proceed to further investigate if it is worthy to be used is its licence.",

Now it has to be clear that having a license does not mean that the casino is reliable and that it will not rob people, because we are talking about an online casino where there is no company headquarters and the owners can be anonymous, so the license is not this is about to punish casino scam, at least I have never seen the government of curacao say that it will punish casinos that steal people's money, of course in legal terms people can report to the police when they are robbed and the court will decide the next steps and the government withdraws the license of the casino scam if the court so ordersQuote from: Streetknow on September 27, 2022, 12:22:11 AMI have heard that a license only allows to put users in confidenceWhat do you think about this?as I explained above: license is to be legal, license does not guarantee that a casino will be reliable",

However, similar to Defi exchanges, if it does not have a license then it will be considered to be subject to regulations by the government.Confidence from users comes from trustworthiness of the company or service. I will use Defi exchanges as an example. Uniswap and Cakeswap are Defi exchanges that do not have licenses but they are very much trusted by much of the community.",

If you want your casino to be legit and not a scam one, you need a licence for it.Like freebitco.in you mean?You have quite a few casinos without a license here:Information of Crypto Casinos License and KYC requirements That are not scams AFAIK.Quote from: jackg on September 27, 2022, 12:28:25 AMYou need a license to legally serve gambling products to some jurisdictions like the UK and the US.You don't need one if you open a casino in a territory that doesn't require you to have one (I think a lot do though) and serve countries that don't need you to be licensed there in order to operate. Just search if you need one for your country. What you say is quite useful for the OP but you forgot to say one thing: in the UK and many other countries, especially in Europe, it is not enough to have a Cura√ßao license to operate in them. You need to acquire a country specific license:Apply for a licence to operate a gambling business.QuoteYou need an operating licence from us if you want to provide gambling facilities to players in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). What many cryptocurrency casinos do is to take a license from a tax haven and then put in their TOS that they do not accept people from England, Wales and Scotland, and many other countries, when in reality they turn a blind eye.",

That is ignoring all the stuff about reputation and security and whatnot since a license is a kind of like a basic requirement (for most people) for casinos to be at the minimum trusted. Not all casinos without licenses are scams though, it just took time for said casinos to actually be trusted and have a good enough player base, so if you're prepared for that then you can go.",

The license is useful for the casino that you manage to become legal, and maintain user trust so that your casino is crowded with visitors. You can take the example of several casino sites on the forum, these sites can last so long because they have the full trust of all forum users, while 1xbit is banned on the forums because the site cannot provide comfort and security to the visitor's balance.",

Before any casino receives there license, the body responsible for such has to check their games if they are valid and they are not skewed to favour only the house, they also check if have are valid team so they don't run away with player's money and also cross check if they will require KYC and how they will take care of players documents in their custody.Playing in a casino that is not licensed puts your money at risk because should in case they refuse to pay your withdrawals, you cannot sue them or do anything against them since they are not even registered in the first place, this is why a license gives players self-confidence with casinos.",
