  "content": "So, I was just opening my email today....and browsing through the spam and the unsolicited junk email and phishing scams, when my eye caught a name that I have not seen in a few years. I clicked and opened the email and saw that it was a site that I joined over 5 years ago.. but I totally forgot about it. This email warned me that the site are going to delete all the dormant accounts, so I navigated to the site (manually... not clicking on links) and tried to login. I obviously forgot the password, so I clicked on the \"forgot password\" option and it allowed me to change my password. To my surprise, the account was still funded with coins that I deposited almost 5 years ago... and it was worth considerably more now... than what it was worth back then. (I think the Bitcoin price was around $7000+ at the time)This put a huge smile on my face, because it is the EXPENSIVE holiday season and I need all the money that I can get to fund this silly time of the year. Have you experienced the same thing..... please share your story with us.",

Lolz... And, I understand the joy you must be feeling right now, knowing you have an extra $7000 to spend this forthcoming Christmas, as it's really something worth to celebrate, and I'm very much happy for you. But however, there are two lessons I got to learn from this, which include;1: To always diversify your funds and not storing it all in just one basket, because if only had you not diversify your Bitcoin asset into different wallets, you never would have discovered this whooping huge sum.2. To always store your coin on a very secured wallet, because only if had you not stored this amount of Bitcoin on a reputable wallet, I'm sure by today the exchange or wallet is likely to have gone bankrupt or shutdown and you losing all your funds.",

It is a \"crash\" type gambling site and I think a lot of people are getting these emails from them, because they are busy with house cleaning. (I checked my other webmail addresses and found another email from an Alt account that I created on the site... but that account was empty.) I also had a small amount of Dogecoin on faucet site... but they closed it down. (Freebitco.in also had a dogecoin faucet) ...would be nice if I found that info.... because Dogecoin was shit back in those days. (The whole Elon Musk thing... hyped it a little... but I cannot seem to find anything I kept.. from the account I created for that)",

Given that I started collecting dogecoins almost 10 years ago and that at that time 1000 of those coins were worth even $0.14, at one point I collected them all in one pile and discovered that I had enough of them to buy a car in a medium range. After that I remembered another \"forgotten project\" and dug up another forgotten treasure.The bad news is that I didn't sell any of it because I simply didn't need the money then, and if Mr. Mars doesn't perform his magic again, it will just be another in a series of stories that I will remember. I won't regret it though, it's just money",

I know all my accounts, and I still have their username and passwords. What I only remember is a cloud mining website called Eobot, and I remember that I did put some Bitcoins there. Those Bitcoins are the ones that I got through doing some faucets back when I was a newbie. By the time I saw this thread, I tried visiting that website, but it wasn't existing anymore. I was a newbie at that time, and I don't care about it anymore because, after all, I got it for free. TBH, you're lucky that you still have those coins that you deposited 5 years ago. Most of them either forgot it already or if they kind of remember it, they already forgot the username and password that they used. I guess I need to congratulate you because you will have some money to be used in this upcoming holiday, or you will have some coins that you can sell when the bull run happens.",

That was his mentality. He basically forgot about it but around April 2023 he has to retrace and could manipulate and succeeded access to the account again after all the pros and the cons of Bitcoin. Then he said to had been shocked over the rate of accumulated Bitcoins in that of his account and then he was impressed and had to accumulate more and sets to hodl for a long term.I think at most cases in long-term investors runners, something experienced impressively are triggered them with the courage to hodling for the long periods of time and not mostly like they just want hodl for a long term.I have heard a lot about this and hello, I keep my private keys to myself and hover along them after some periods of time and hoping if related testimonies would happen too 😆.",

Have you experienced the same thing..... please share your story with us.  First of all, congratulations on your treasure discovery... I have seen beauty of holding Bitcoin for long, I guess the website just helped you to achieve that. From your impression, the holiday season is settled for you and that is something amazing, after all,  what is wealth without enjoying it? However, I will suggest you don't blow all away, just discipline yourself to use half of the funds and you will still have enough fun while holding some Bitcoin as we enter the halving year. The portion you are holding might just yield as much profits as the money you saw in that account. Just my suggestion, it is up to you to do what is suitable for you.",

I found over 0.06 BTC and had no problems withdrawing it.

I too had a similar incident couple of years back on Litecoin. I had an account with Litecoin foundation when the price was in cents and we used to get a good amount of litecoins from faucets. I had stored my entire faucet earnings in the wallet and due to low price, I didn't care much. When I discovered that account, the price of Litecoin was around 30 dollars. So I had recovered them and moved them to my secret wallet. I am holding them still today. It's feels great to find such treasures sometime. I totally understand the feeling.",

I have a story like yours but not about BTC assets but about altcoins, more precisely on ETH. I remember at that time eth was still cheap and there was no BNB. At that time, most altcoin transactions still used ETH and the fees were still cheap at that time. I often use transactions using the eth network, I remember very well I used an eth address and I didn't save the private key properly even though there were still eth assets in it, it's just that at that time the price of eth was still cheap, and at that time I didn't get any education about saving private keys is important I underestimate this problem. In the end when ETH rose and reached ATH I couldn't access the wallet anymore, the assets weren't much but it was very painful to remember.However, from that incident until now, I keep all my private keys or wallet phrases, basically everything related to my wallet I keep carefully. because I don't want to repeat the same mistake I made before, namely not being able to access a wallet that still has assets in it.",
