Yes bitcoin can protect one against inflation beca it does not work by the fiat economy system, bitcoin has a coordinated unmanipulated decentralized network with blockchain, this is not applicable in the cases of some other cryptocurrencies because they are not decentralized, inflation affect the fiat currency and the value is being affected over time due to government regulations and policies.Quote from: songyan0400 on September 25, 2023, 02:30:36 PMBitcoin puts a hard limit on the total number of coins that can ever be created. This is a good advantage why we gave a specific target on the amount of bitcoin to be mined and how this would have circulated among the people and remain in the market while it value always rises as people keep making demands on it even after the whole blocks had been mined.",

Inflation is not the only reason and by that you can see, a national government can not simply stop printing more money to increase value of their national fiat currency.QuoteMany people believe that cryptocurrency can protect them from inflation.If cryptocurrency you mean is altcoin, it's worse. Because minting new tokens into circulating and total supply is even more easily than printing more fiat currency.QuoteBitcoin puts a hard limit on the total number of coins that can ever be created.

Bitcoin is unique because of its decentralized network, strong network, no censorship on on chain transactions, strong developer community etc.",

Just to clear things out, in cryptocurrency, there are more than 20k tokens or coins but all of them can not be used against inflation. Means, that not every token or coin is deflationary and can be compared to the potential of the BTC. BTC is the king and is the deflationary coin, many legendaries might not agree with this statement, but for the understanding and a proven hedge against inflation, We can say it is a deflationary coin. You are totally about the scarcity of the BTC, due to it's limited and fixed supply, BTC is a great hedge against inflation. But not all cryptocurrencies are, because many crypto token and coins are increasing their supply over time, and can not be compared with BTC. I hope you understand my point.",

Let's understand it with an example, If you had $10,000 in 2010, and if you have BTC worth of $10,000 at the same time. Then tell me, will your $10,000 dollars in fiat be the same as of today? Can you bought as many products today as you can buy in 2010? The answer is no, you can not. Now compare the price of $10,000 worth of BTC bought in 2010, and now they would be worth $284,986,000 as of September 25, 2023, at a price of $24,000 per BTC. Now tell me, is fiat a good hedge against inflation or BTC? Think wisely.",

I think you have some knowledge about Bitcoin and you joined this forum to learn further about it. Yes, Bitcoin won't lose any value due to inflation of fiat instead it will get higher in value because it has hard limit of 21 million and every year some people lose Bitcoin. When supply is low and demand is high the value gets high and that's why Bitcoin will get higher in value after each four year. Although, volatility is present in crypto market and that will always be present, but still Bitcoin won't lose much of its value as compare to fiat.The main factor that works to increase the value of Bitcoin is the halving event that takes place every 4 years. During the halving event the number of Bitcoin decrease by half for each block that miners find and that's why it gets harder to find more Bitcoin due to half reward for each block. The investors always wait for halving event and soon after halving event we have bull market that increases the value of Bitcoin and all crypto-currencies. During bull market the investors get positive about Bitcoin and continue to invest in it as much as they possibly can. A few investors make a lot of money during the bull market.I recommend you to learn more about Bitcoin from this forum because it's the best source for the ones who are interested in Bitcoin. You should read topics in Bitcoin discussion board and from that board you will learn a lot of things about Bitcoin. The more time you give to this forum the more you'll learn about Bitcoin.",

It did really just turns out that there are people who do really goes into the point on which its not something that true or ideal anymore which makes them that too numb on whats around and whats the reality that they are missing.Its true that Bitcoin/Crypto could save up your @ss on this worse economy where it do involves with that nonstop or inevitable inflation with the current fiat system and there's no stopping with that and with this then it would really be just that normal that you should really be taking up some action for you to be able to survive or sustain.",

Many people believe that cryptocurrency can protect them from inflation.I consider this opinion very real and the facts are clear. The reason is that one of the crypto currencies called bitcoin has proven that all these opinions are true and not just empty talk. A simple example is the money invested in it. Even though the currency invested for example is subject to inflation, by saving money in bitcoin, the money is not affected at all. This is all proof that Bitcoin can indeed be said to be a store of value asset that is able to protect against inflation.Quote from: songyan0400 on September 25, 2023, 02:30:36 PMBitcoin puts a hard limit on the total number of coins that can ever be created. For example, as the growth of the money supply outpaces the growth of the bitcoin supply, the price of bitcoin will rise. Many other cryptocurrencies employ the same approach to limit supply and act as a protection against inflation. Â Yes, one of these factors is what makes Bitcoin the best crypto asset and one of the factors that is able to maintain the stability of Bitcoin's value. Namely because the available supply factor can no longer be disturbed (21 million bitcoins). So with these factors, bitcoin can be said to be a very limited and very valuable asset, and can be categorized as a special asset.And, there are now several altcoins that are copying similar steps as applied to bitcoin (in terms of supply). This is indeed a good step. But even so, I think replicating Bitcoin's success will definitely be very difficult. Because you need to remember, it's not just about supply that makes Bitcoin as successful as it is now. However, there are other factors, such as a decentralized system. And in my opinion, this decentralized system is what is difficult for altcoins to imitate today. Because even though the supply of coins is limited, if it is still centralized, I am sure the results will not be as special as bitcoin.",
