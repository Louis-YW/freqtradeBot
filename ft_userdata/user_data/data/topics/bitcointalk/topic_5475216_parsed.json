  "content": "KARLSEN NETWORKWhat is the Karlsen Network?Karlsen is based on the Kaspa blockchain introducing a GPU-centric solution to the dominance of ASIC mining farms, aiming to empower small-scale miners and enhance decentralization.With Kaspa, our approach is one of friendly cohabitation. We operate under the same protocol, enjoy similar advantages, and face unidentified issues. Any significant improvements in the primary codebase will be shared back.The Karlsen Network team believes in decentralization and we will ensure long-term GPU-friendly mining. We initially started with kHeavyHash and blake3 modifications, resulting in the creation of KarlsenHashv1. However, recognizing that kHeavyHash and blake3 are not future-proof in terms of ASIC resistance, we have launched testnet-1 with FishHash. This marks the world's first implementation of FishHash with Golang in a 1bps blockchain.Current Kaspa ASICs are not compatible with Karlsen, and we will enforce this resistance in the roadmap with the upcoming FishHash/KarlsenHashv2 algorithm hard fork.Coin Specifications- Name: Karlsen Network- Coin Ticker: KLS- Type: Layer 1 BlockDAG- Algorithm: KarlsenHashV2- Max Supply: 4.961.000.000 KLSEconomic Model:The monetary policy of Karlsen closely resembles the Kaspa model, yet it incorporates a more gradual deflation rate to better suit the scale of small GPU miners.It has two phases:Pre-deflationary phase: During a six-month period, each block yields a reward of 50KLS. The intended block creation rate is one block per second, although this rate varied during the mainnet's first weeks.Deflationary phase: The block reward undergoes a halving process annually, but this reduction is gradual rather than abrupt. Each month, the reward decreases by a factor of (1/1.4)^(1/12). This calculation is based on an initial block reward of 44 KLS.### Project Links- Official Website: https://www.karlsencoin.com/- Whitepaper: https://www.karlsencoin.com/docs/karlsen-whitepaper-v1.0.1.pdf- GitHub: https://github.com/karlsen-network- Top Wallets: https://www.karlsencoin.com/addressdistribution.html- Tokenomics: https://www.karlsencoin.com/tokenomics.html- Smart Contracts: https://www.karlsencoin.com/smart-contracts.html### Explorers and Dashboards- Explorer: https://explorer.karlsencoin.com/- View Karlsen Block & DAG Visualizer: https://kgi.karlsencoin.com/- Karlsen Rest API: https://api.karlsencoin.com/docs- Dashboard: https://status.karlsencoin.com/- Transaction CSV: https://report.karlsencoin.com/- Faucet: https://faucet.karlsencoin.com/- View Mining Pools: https://miningpoolstats.stream/karlsen### Social Media- Discord: https://discord.gg/E5mBsbr8eR- Twitter: https://twitter.com/karlsennetwork- Telegram: https://t.me/KarlsenNetwork- Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/KarlsenNetwork/### Wallets- Web Wallet: https://wallet.karlsencoin.com/- Desktop Wallet: https://github.com/karlsen-network/karlsen-desktop/releases- Mobile Wallet: https://github.com/karlsen-network/karlsen-mobile/releases### GPU Miners- SRBMiner: https://github.com/doktor83/SRBMiner-Multi- LolMiner: https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases- BZ-Miner: https://github.com/bzminer/bzminer- RigelMiner: https://github.com/rigelminer/rigel- GMiner: https://github.com/develsoftware/GMinerRelease/- Team Red Miner: https://github.com/todxx/teamredminer/releases- Stratum Bridge: https://github.com/karlsen-network/karlsen-stratum-bridge/releases/tag/v1.1.0### Testnet- Public Testnet: https://github.com/karlsen-network/karlsend/releases/tag/v2.0.0-testnet-1-fishhash- Testnet Dashboard: https://status.testnet-1.karlsencoin.com- Testnet Wallet: https://wallet.testnet-1.karlsencoin.com- Testnet Explorer: https://explorer.testnet-1.karlsencoin.com- Testnet Block Inspector: https://kgi.testnet-1.karlsencoin.com- Testnet Faucet: https://faucet.testnet-1.karlsencoin.comPlease be kind to the team; we are working hard.

There is still a lot to build. ¬†¬†‚Äî 12/09/2024 4:46 PMSuccessful Hard Fork and Introduction of KarlsenHashV2 Algorithm ‚ö°We are thrilled to announce that Karlsen Network has successfully completed a major hardfork, marking the introduction of our revolutionary KarlsenHashV2 algorithm. After 9 months of dedicated work‚Äîcoding, testing, and thorough validation ‚öó‚Äîthis upgrade represents a monumental leap towards greater decentralization and network inclusivity. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èKarlsenHashV2 was specifically designed to empower small GPU miners, making mining on our network more profitable for everyone, not just large players. This transition ensures a more distributed and resilient network, while reinforcing our commitment to decentralization. The algorithm is based on the FishHash üêü algorithm by Lolliedieb, the developer behind [Lolminer](https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/releases), which has proven to be extremely GPU-efficient. We are especially grateful to IronFish Blockchain developers and Lolliedieb for their incredible work on this algorithm, which laid the foundation for KarlsenHashV2. üß∞We are extremely proud of this achievement, as it is the first time a Kaspa-based BlockDAG has completed such a successful transition. This upgrade was a mandatory step for the exciting developments we have in store for Karlsen Network.Now that this major milestone is behind us, our team is fully focused on expanding the Karlsen Network ecosystem. This includes integration with new exchanges and the Cosmos ecosystem, providing even more opportunities for growth and innovation. üöÄ",
