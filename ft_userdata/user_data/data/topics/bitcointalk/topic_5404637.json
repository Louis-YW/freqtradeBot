      "body": "question first to get your mind prepared for the answer:if you have $100 in your pocket. does it have to be categorically only in the format of a single $100 bank note. or can it be a measure of a allotment of smaller amounts? if you had a tonne of gold does it have to be a single brick weighing a complete tonne. or a measure of smaller amounts like kg, ounces, grams that total a tonne?answer:in code/value in binary of actual data relayed/stored, whether its stored in the UTXO, mempool, blockchain databases or relayed.. wait for it..  there are no hard data \"btc\" it is all relayed and stored in units called sats..it is the software GUI(display) code that then converts it to convenient formatted number for easy reading. what tadamichi left out of the quoted code in his post. is the part where COIN is just an expression of hard data in blockchains, utxo's, mempools converting into COIN by doing a /100,000,000 of the hard datahttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/consensus/amount.h#L14Code:/** The amount of satoshis in one BTC. */static constexpr CAmount COIN = 100000000;(i hope tadamichi sees my example of how i, someone that is in full adoption of bitcoin can atleast be open and honest about how bitcoin actually works without having to pander to uptopian stuff, and maybe he takes this as a lesson that trying to slide things under the rug can be misleading for his favoured network)anywaysnone of the unconfiirmed transactions relayed around or put into mempool databases.. nor the blockdata containing confirmed transactions nor the utxo data for easy indexing of the unspents remaining are in btc denominations. but then again. do people care about a tonne of gold if its not in a format of actually being one single lump of hard gold or do they still call it a tonne of gold if they have 1000 bricks of 1kg of gold or 35274 ounces of goldwe are actually approaching an epoch(point in time) where people are not even able to afford to \"buy a whole bitcoin\" where people naturally are going to use different terms like sats(single units) and bits(100 units).much like no one really cares about the \"Tonne\" when they are buying ounces of goldbtc is not and does not have to be a physical single lump. just like a gold \"tonne\" does not. its just a measure for easy conversation and display and easy accounting for human eyes and brains to understand using less long numbers...now with that said..blockchain, utxo, mempool databases and relay data streams all show actual units. (yes measured in sats) but they are actual units. that can be seen. and so if someone has grouped together an allotment of 100,000,000sats then they do indeed own a bitcoinif you gather together 35274 ounces of gold, then you do indeed own a tonne of gold.if you have in your left pocket 7 bank notes different denominations of 1x $20 and 6x $5. and in your right pocket you have 500 dimes in your right pocket.. you do indeed have $100 in your pants.... it does not have to be a single $100 bank note to be called $100 in your pocket",

However, it's going to be difficult to convince the masses of this. However, I do see one benefit of Bitcoin being around right now, most people are becoming more accustomed to digital money, since pretty much the whole world is shifting to using credit cards, bank accounts rather than dealing with physical cash. The more that progresses, the less cash is being used, and the less people will focus on it being something physical.",

Do know the meaning of Crypto ? If you don't know, then google it. Now let's see what the word cryptocurrency means. In my language crypto currency is an invisible economic system. Read it to understand better: QuoteCryptocurrencies are digital tokens. They are a type of digital currency that allows people to make payments directly to each other through an online system. Cryptocurrencies have no legislated or intrinsic value; they are simply worth what people are willing to pay for them in the market. This is in contrast to national currencies, which get part of their value from being legislated as legal tender. There are a number of cryptocurrencies – the most well-known of these are Bitcoin and Ether source: linkMaybe you know the definition of it. Even then again I gave this just because of this \"Is bitcoin really  exist\". Not just bitcoin their is no others altcoin doesn't exists physically  in real life. And if it exists, then it does not fall into cryptocurrency. That means, no cryptocurrency has any physical assets. These just exist virtually in some numbers.",

I will try to explain it simplified and not too technical on purpose.Bitcoin is a network, mostly run on Bitcoin core(a software), anyone can download it. Each computer that runs this software(you call them nodes), builds a connection to other computers that run it too(but not to all of them). Forming a network. Right now there are 15.000 or more of them(the precise amount is unkown). Anyone who wants to participate can join this network voluntarily, by also running a software that gives them access to the network. Each of these computers stores every Bitcoin transaction ever made. For this, a special kind of database is used that is called blockchain. The basic concept is that around every 10 minutes a new Block with new transactions is being appended to the chain, forming a chain that goes from Block 0(2009) till now Block 743053(2022). And will continue to grow as long as the network exists. Now if each of these 15.000 computers has the same database and we need to add new transactions, how can we do it without chaos/ and manipulation and keeping everything the same? Were creating an adapting difficulty to find new Blocks(which contain the new transactions) and pay a reward(newly created Bitcoin, until 21 million have been created) + transaction fees, to whoever can find it first. This creates a competition and a monetary incentive for everyone who participates(miners) to stay honest. Its more costly and difficult to attack the network, than to just work for it. The cheaper your energy and the more efficient the mining rig(asics), the more profitable it will be for a participant. Everyone in the network then appends the newly mined Block to their chain. The result is a database that is exactly the same for everyone, without a central authority in control. You can simply broadcast a transaction to your node, or use someone else node that does this for you, and then wait until its taken into a new Block. The space there is limited(usually around 2000 transactions fit in), and you choose a transaction fee you want to spend, to get taken in. You just type in the address you wanna send/ receive Bitcoin to, usually in another type of wallet software. This wallet stores your private keys(the thing you need to prove ownership and to spend Bitcoin), and this key always needs to be kept secret. Each of these 15.000 computers \"store\" your(all) Bitcoin, you can always recover them from anywhere, if you still have your private key. Imagine you could recover your money from anywhere with just a cryptographic key, you can now. Also they(the nodes) make sure that the rules of the network are being followed and that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin being created for example, like we showed above.Note this is just the tip of the iceberg and this goes in way deeper, take this as a light introduction that can maybe spark some interest, but you should verify everything i told you yourself and theres way more to it.Quote from: franky1 on June 30, 2022, 03:30:32 PMQuote from: kasunrandil on June 30, 2022, 03:21:25 PM no. ia  am asking what exist as bitcoin?? it isn't physical i know. if it is a code or script , are there 21 ml  scripts??the actual code works like this.the initial release of the genesis(first) block. has a value or reward of binary: 100101010000001011111001000000000which translates to 5,000,000,000 units (satoshi's) or for easy human GUI display converts to 50btcthe rules are that every 210,000 blocks that amount halves. its done by simply taking a binary bit off the end. and this is a hard rule all nodes follow to ensure all blocks comply to half the reward given per blocks every 210,000 periodbinary: 100101010000001011111001000000000which translates to 2,500,000,000 units (satoshi's) or for easy human GUI display converts to 25btcas you can tell there were 33 binary bits. meaning 33 halvings until nothing is left. which doing the math totals as being209,999,999,769,000 satoshis ever rewarded in total by blocks at the end. which converts to just shy of 21m btcThe use of bitwise is genius for this.",

The right question should be, how long will bitcoin exist? We have already seen that bitcoin is existing. Many has acquired lands and building with bitcoin. Some bought cars with bitcoin. We have converted bitcoin to any currency(fiat) and bitcoin has given employment to many. How much more do you want bitcoin to exist before you understand that it is existing?Obviously, there is nothing that exists today that would be in existence without value. The value is the core essence.  Bitcoin is valuable just as fiat is valuable. Anyway that a law is passed in your country and the value of your fiat is removed, that is when you will realise that the fiat is nothing but a paper which can be printed as much as you want. Then you will realised that a fixed bitcoin is more valuable than your fiat.",
