This will be valid and confirmed as shocking news. Including the date, El Salvador as a Bitcoin-adopting country is already on the list in June. This is quite interesting because it can remind me personally of other big news stories about Bitcoin.",

Does bitcoin has holiday? How? Does it mean those days there will be no mining and transactions? Those holiday days indicating on the calendar are for Nations and international holidays. I have not experience bitcoin holiday, I have only experience bitcoin pizza day. Probably the days in which Countries adopt bitcoin, the date bitcoin was created, and other great things (events) that have happened in bitcoin, but those events are not holidays but just an events therefore, if I am to suggest a title, I have used \"Bitcoin Event days calendar\". That not withstanding, the Creator of the site knows what he is doing. Also thanks for bringing this to the forum. At least we have known the major events that that to bitcoin in the time past and will know the ones to come.",

For me, such a calendar is superfluous, because when all the important dates of Bitcoin come, someone here will definitely create a topic or write a comment, which means I will know about it. Not infrequently, competitions are held in honor of the celebration of such days, held for more than one day. So, anyway, this news will fall into my field of vision. Is there a topic dedicated to the remarkable dates of Bitcoin on this forum?",

I looked through all the events, and while some are famous and familiar to me (Mt Gox, Pizza Day, Lightning Pizza), there were also many I've never heard of. On the calendar, it also seems like July is the most uneventful month, with only Shitcoin day being there, which isn't even a Bitcoin thing. What I think could make this calendar better is more events. If they have Mt Gox, they could do dates related to some top exchanges or a date the firt exchange was opened if it's known. Also, days when major Bitcoin wallets became available (if such dates can be traced) would be nice. Finally, if there's a day when Bitcoin reached 4 figures, why not add the day with 5 figures as well? A Bitcointalk date should also be there, as Maus0728 pointed out.And given that there are only two countries where Bitcoin is legal tender, the second one (Central African Republic) can be added to the calendar as well since El Salvador is already there.",
