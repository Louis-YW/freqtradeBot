Sad to say your friend has been scammed, don't put more investment to increase the amount, accept your loss and try to spread awareness of that scam exchange. This might be under the HYIP category scam. Most commonly they promise high returns or guarantee money back with little to no risk, but in reality, they're designed to take money from unsuspecting victims and disappear with the funds.  Just move on I think and learn from this costly mistake.",

Let me take a guess: your friend met a girl on one of those dating apps, and after some time she suggested him that exchange? Anyway, I do hope that your friend didn't send money for the 3rd time because if he did, they will just keep milking him for more money.Quote from: sheenshane on March 06, 2023, 10:47:50 PMThis might be under the HYIP category scam. Nah it doesn't look like HYIP to me because from what I can see, they don't promise high returns or anything similar and instead they go with that ridiculous \" loss insurance\" feature that doesn't make any sense.This is simply one of those fake exchanges where once you send the money, you never see it again.",

Then they say he needs to add another large amount for taxes before he can withdraw.This won't end. So you better advise your friend to stop feeding the scammers once and for all. Your friend has the choice to remain hopeful and send them more money and risk losing a much bigger amount or face the reality that he/she fell for a scam and lost money and that he/she won't risk any additional amount. Although this insurance scam is not really common, it is almost a standard among scammers to withhold withdrawal unless money is sent, but when the money is sent withdrawal is once again put on hold until additional deposits are made. This will go on and on and on. Nobody should be falling for it anymore.",

How can they just pay you back for funds you lost without any fault from them? Nobody does business like that. Hope you read the \"terms of service\" before continuing because a lot of these scam website include stuff in their terms of service that lets you know that they're a scam knowing fully well people wont read it so they can have some sort of legal backing to whatever they're doing.",

Users that are new to trading would think that such things may exist in cryptocurrency trading but it's not true at all. You are the one who is responsible for any loss that occurs once you take a trade.All a legit exchange would do is warn its users that trading has significant risks involved with it and that they should trade with care as it can cause them to lose money. So there is basically nothing like Loss Insurance in trading.",

Stay away from this nonsense and do not believe any of the temptations; only trade with the popular and reliable platforms in the market.",
