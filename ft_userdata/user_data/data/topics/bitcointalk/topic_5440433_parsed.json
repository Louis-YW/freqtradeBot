  "content": "There has been a lot of talk about Artificial Intelligence’s chat GPT. I also try to discuss about it especially it's negative aspects.Currently, people's trust in artificial intelligence is increasing rapidly and in the same time providing better services to the people. But no matter how advanced this technology is, it has some demerits as well.Chat GPTs are trained through trial-and-error methods, they are only as accurate as the data and algorithms. If the data information is wrong they will provide wrong information. Where the users may get confused.Although chat GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is used for customer service, they cannot answer complex questions in many cases. Many GPTs are only trained for basic conversation. Moreover, it is unable to understand human emotions. They may not be empathetic which makes it difficult to provide customer service. Chat GPT's discussion scope is limited. Since GPTs are trained on specific datasets, they only provide solutions or suggestions for problems within their domain.",

      "body": "There's no problem with combining Human Intelligence (HI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I think you could take advantage of both.AI is an increasingly popular trend that can have both benefits and drawbacks. By combining AI and HI, individuals can benefit from the increased efficiency and accuracy that AI can provide and the creativity and problem-solving that humans are capable of. However, there are also potential risks involved in the use of AI, such as the potential for bias or for taking away jobs from humans.Pros:Increased efficiency and accuracy—Businesses and individuals can benefit from more accurate and efficient results using AI to automate specific tasks.Increased creativity—AI can help humans come up with creative solutions to problems that would not be possible without AI.Increased problem-solving ability—AI can help humans develop better and more efficient solutions to problems.Cons:Potential for bias—AI can be programmed to exhibit bias, which can have serious consequences.Potential loss of jobs—AI could potentially lead to the loss of jobs for humans as automation becomes more prevalent.Potential for misuse—individuals or organizations can misuse AI for malicious or unethical purposes.",

I have heard many people say that as technology improves and gets better, humans are at the danger of becoming duller and more unable to do things for themselves because of the dependence on technology. As technology improves do not neglect trying to improve yourself as well.",
