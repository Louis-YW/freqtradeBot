I know you used to be able to do this with cgminer like 10 years ago, but I'm struggling to find anything that can do it on modern GPUs. I think it would make for a fun comparison of how far ASIC mining technology has come in a video on my Youtube channel.If any of you guys have any tips for a mining software I could do this with I'd be very thankful! Basically any help I can get at all would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: Yes I am very aware this won't be profitable  I run a Youtube channel and a lot of my viewers have been asking about solo mining BTC on their GPU rigs now that GPU mining isn't profitable since the merge. I wanna show them that yes technically you can do it but it's not really a good idea.Thank you so much!/Seb",

And You won't mine anything if you want to go for the SHA-256. I think that you should go to for Ethereum mining with GPU with 10 Plus in numbers and in this way toy would be able to generate good amount of money.

About 45 hours? How about to walk? About 3 years if you walk non-stop?So that's only a tiny factor of about 584 - not an enormous factor of 3333333.Starting to see the picture?If you get in a fist fight. do you strand there lightly touching the other guy 10 on the shoulder with your little finger?Then when he punches you 10 times hard in the face - you lose.The probability of a CPU ever finding a block is so small that it would be a waste of electricity since it wouldn't help secure the network.Chances are pointless at that level.",
