Imagine paying close to 200sats/vbytes for single transactions. This amount can be used to pay for five or more transactions before This insane congestion of the mempool QuoteOf all the options I read on dealing with the high fees someone suggested making a transaction at night time or during the weekend because they believe that the network will be less congested and the fees will be lower. Has anyone attempted this? I have also seen this advice from Charles-Tim on a thread before. Although it is logical that people will make less transactions in this two periods than the other periods. But I doubt this will work at this period at the moment because even the pending or unconfirmed transactions that will be left in the mempool won’t go down then. More so bitcoin is a global currency and the time varies for each locations, the night period could be the day time in another location.",

Has anyone attempted this? Don't believe everything you read online...That part was likely written by the unqualified. Bitcoin derives it's security mostly from decentralization... Its users, developers, developments, softwares, infrastructures, miners, etc are supposed to be decentralized. The more decentralized, the better. Decentralized mining actually keeps the Network secure. The incentives & competitions are meant to keep them on the network, growing & in decentralized manner to prevent a hijack by central forces. High fees will only drive away much needed users and consequently reduce the number of miners on the network.  If the users are all driven away, there will be no fees for the miners and bitcoin will be worthless for them to value. In regards to prioritizing on high fee transactions which it calls \"valuable transactions\", that makes little sense as low fee transactions could as well be considered valuable and should be taken seriously. An attacker with unlimited money printed out of thin air can just spam the network with bitcoins it does not value using high fee to delay important transactions.",

      "body": "Pools (miners) can push cheap transactions when they find blocks. Normally this is can be used to pay the individuals who contributed hashrate to find the block, and there have been pools offering \"acceleration service\" so if you got one transaction stuck, you can pay them to push it for you. Unfortunately it appears more recently this has been used by some pools for the currently ongoing spam attack.So while normal people who want to use Bitcoin for actual bitcoin transactions (pay and be paid with) aka: circular economy, have to use outrageous fees, they (spammers) do not, since those pools are collaborating with them.Now if the high fees were the product of worldwide bitcoin adoption, we would be fine with it. But it being from an external non bitcoin source from an exploit found by the relaxation of consensus rules which opened this vulnerability, and its now being abused in practice sabotaging the use of bitcoin for the masses (which large corporations don't care about) it is naturally causing a commotion in social media. I have seen people correctly identify the problem and proposing actual solutions, and others clearly not caring about Bitcoin as a project just getting some extra fiat out of this mess (and some even participating in it) while laughing and ridiculing at the misery of others who dared used bitcoin for its original purpose.If the spam flood means miner benefit at the expense of people being unable to use it for normal coin transactions anymore, one of the key fundamentals will be broken. Contrary to the lies some involved parties in the attack spread, these are NOT real transactions, they make a normal transaction and attach trash to it which is how they found a loophole in the protocol and is currently being exploited.This loophole wasn't there in the past, which is why people on social media, etc, are addressing the current Bitcoin \"core\" developers.Remember that high fees product of real bitcoin adoption is a good thing, but not when its not bitcoin transactions. It is very dangerous instead as it opened the floodgates for all sorts of abuse which we are witnessing right now. From the list of the currently involved, you can clearly see which of those companies were never bitcoiner in the first place, and where their real interests lie. And some are even blatant about it \"Bitcoin sucks anyway\", \"high fees are good\", \"come to us instead\"... So yeah, interested parties that need Bitcoin success to dwindle down because to them means more profit. Should you support those companies? Check twice who you engage with. Names are being mentioned in connection to this DDoS spam attack... Names that belong to a list of shame.And doesn't this also benefit some States and their CBDCs? So don't be surprised if some of those powers are behind the attack as well. Some people are saying the timing is too convenient, we are witnessing the USD getting in trouble which could easily pull the other fiats and cause the next economic crisis.",

Mining rewards are paid out in the form of newly minted cryptocurrency and transaction fees. When transaction fees are high, miners earn more revenue per block they mine. This can incentivize miners to prioritize transactions with higherfees, leading to longer confirmation times for transactions with lower fees. also, high transaction fees can make it more profitable for miners to continue mining, even if the overall network has lower transaction volume. This can help to maintain network security, as there are still incentives for miners to continue validating transactions.However, its important to note that high transaction fees can be also a double edged sword for miner. If fees become too high, it can drive users away from using the network, reducing overall transaction volume and therefore reducing the revenue earned by miners.",

Which astonished me since I assumed it would be very challenging for him to meet with his participants and yet it would still take some time for those transactions to be confirmed.

Has anyone attempted this? Yes it looks like there was a spam attack happening on Sunday and Monday, though it seems to have mostly subsided by today. Still, ordinals and i guess these brc-20 token things and perhaps some other reasons are still causing fairly high prices that we've seen since the start of the month, $6-$9 fees instead of $2-$3 dollar fees that the network had since ordinals started a few months ago.As to your question of whether this is an attack or it is good for miners. Those things are not mutually exclusive. Miners get paid more anytime tx fees goes up, doesn't matter whether its a spam attack or something dumb like NFTs and tokens, or just higher usage of bitcoin, they get paid more when blocks are full and people are trying to do stuff on bitcoin. So NFT jpegs, meme tokens, spam attacks, yes all these things are good for miners and bad for bitcoin at the same time because they crowd out actual monetary use of Bitcoin for stupid useless fad stuff. It'd be like if someone figured out a way to take over Apple's manufacturing plants to make beanie babies instead of computers but paid the workers more...sure good for the workers (miners in this case), but bad for all actual users. And while miners love high tx fees, mining is a thiving business so they are doing just fine without this spam on the blockchain. Just look at hashrate, it was continually rising all through the bear market as weaker operations got knocked out and stronger operations expanded, thus making mining more efficient.",

The past two bull markets fees peaked for a little bit over $50, and if we have to account for a bunch of useless stuff like tokens and NFTs crowding up the valuable block space then yeah it's likely fees will go over $100.
