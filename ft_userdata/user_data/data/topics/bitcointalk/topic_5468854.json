  "content": "The world is full of great ideas. Many people have brilliant ideas but only few can bring them to action. This is what really separates a successful entrepreneur from a dreamers. Some can read 100 of self-help books but all they know is the theory aspect of life because they have failed to put all or part of what they have read in action. They keep saying \"I should be the first person to have started this business in this community\" after seeing people making it from such business. Reasons why people may fail to put their ideas into action: ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Fear of been a failureFear is one great factor that can easily kill dreams. Failure shouldn't be an obstacle for you to achieve your dream. Alot of billionaire today has once failed in the history of their life. Check out this my article (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5412780.msg60900070#msg60900070) on Rejection, failure and disappointment, its impact on ones achievement... From this you will see that sometimes one needs to fail in life to grow.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Failure to embrace riskTo achieve in life, you must learn to embrace risk. Everything in life is risk. Mr Johnson has $2000 and he said to himself. The economy doesn't favour any business and I don't want to lose my money, so let me just keep it in bank . He has forgotten that the bad economy system will also hit the money in his account. ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Laziness and procrastinationLaziness and procastination may work together to kill ones dream. Some aren't too lazy to work on their idea but just that they keep delaying things by proponing the development of their ideas till tomorrow. They always say\"I will start it tomorrow\" but their tomorrow never ends. Always remember someone may has same idea you have in mind. Being early to enter the market before the person can be an added advantage for you.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Sharing ideas with Idea KillersIdea Killers can be anyone. It can be your close friend, family or neighbour. Telling them your ideas may easily kill your dream. They easily give you hundreds of reasons why the idea may not work and this may therefore kill the idea in you.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Fear of losing their money.Fear of losses is a great threat to success. This can easily stop you from being able to think clearly about that your good idea. Sometimes you need to lose some money to later make it big with your idea. Never be turn down by your failure. If you lose money to a business, all you need to do is to analyze the reason and the mistakes you made for such to have happened. This should teach you a lesson and not to fall into such mistake next time.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Holding on past experiences and beliefs Some people kill their dream through their past experience or experience they got through someone close to them. They said to themselves Mr Charles did thesame business and fail after investing alot of money. Instead of analysising the mistakes Mr Charles had made that had lead to the downfall of his business, they just easily conclude that such idea may also not work for them.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Lack of self confidenceSome people don't have confidence in themselves. They never believe they can do it alone. Self confidence is highly needed if you want your idea/business to be successful.CONCLUSIONAlot of people today blame themselves for what they have failed to do some years ago. The idea you failed to develop year ago may be the success story of another person that turn him/her to a rich person. Life is just about risk. Risk that money in your account into your ideas without minding what people will say, put in all your possible best for the idea to become successful and become a successful entrepreneur rather than a dreamer.",

Those who don't do anything yet think about the result immediately usually have negative thoughts in their minds. They are afraid of falling and of others saying negative things about what they are doing.In these situations, when it comes to \"success,\" there are only two things you can say: \"Are you a dreamer,\" a type of person who \"will do whatever it takes to get it,\" or a \"daydreamer,\" who \"will do\" your best,\" which in the end is \"your best wasn't good enough.\" Which one are you here or two?",

This is the risk they forget to include among them, without risk there is no potential and if you refuse to take it, you will regret when it grow because by the time everyone reap the fruit of their labour(patience), they will not get the chance to enjoy it.Procrastination is deadly, it's one to avoid as a serious person, if that masters your body system, to do even a simple task will be like a load of laundry you want to do with hands, you will miss many of opportunities because you refuse to take them and those that are successful today never give procrastination a welcome hug in their life.",

It is okay to have plans but if actualization wonâ€™t be there then that plan will just be a story you could tell to other people. We hesitate â€˜coz we donâ€™t have enough courage to do so. Indeed, the consequence which is losing, is the biggest wall we should first break in order to meet success in our roads. And with regards to other peopleâ€™s judgements, it is valid if you would react into those but to rely into such subjective viewpoints wonâ€™t push you to achieve more. Things are all in our hands for sure. Every struggle as well could be resolved as long as we qould have the drive or eagerness to do so. With regards to failure, there are just people who cannot handle such consequences but if youâ€™re aware of it then you should have not continued in the first place.",

Ideas without having any action would really be just pointless or useless. No matter how great the idea is on what you do have in mind but if it wont come into fruition just because you didnt make out any action then it would really be just remaining to be a dream like forever and this is something that a must avoided thing if you dont really like on finding yourself that having no progress at all. To those who do made out some act and hard work on trying out to achieve their dreams are the ones having the chance or the opportunity on which they could really be able to have those kind of those possible change if they have done it right and having a little bit mix of luck which we know that there are really things in life that no matter how hard you do work but having no mix of a little luck then it would really be still leading you nowhere.",

There is no way he'll lose his family because of business. Unless, he traveled and left his family behind. If he leaves enough money for his family before traveling, he may not lose his family, even. Planning, consistency and courage fuels business growth and ideas. Not anybody can do it alone. Many would need help in the process. Hence, working together with the family can be effective. They could be your best business advisers, partners or participants. Depending on the level of understanding in the family. But, its common among business people, their family joins them. So, a family man who cares, can't fail his family for business. Unless he's working to set up a fresh family. A successful business from an unsuccessful family, in terms of cooperation, will suffer losses. Personally, I'd say that a man can as well work with his family on a business and end up being very successful. In accordance with what he offers to the society. Some locations may be lacking out on some services, and would need special services on the utility, and no one to handle or sell it to them. These are important research to make, before setting up a business. Not just filling up the brain with thoughts and no action. Once a person is sure that what they're about to offer the society is on demand, they shouldn't be scared of setting up the business. Fine it may not start immediately, but he'll gain customers. I don't see family as a hindrance.",

There are breadwinners who are just giving up their dreams because they need to choose earning money over their passion to support their lives and bring food to their table. But those people that have dreams and despite the situation that they're facing, they won't just give up their dreams. They find a way to support their families and at the same time, they're pursuing their dreams. This doesn't just happen in movies and films but also in real life. And even when they reach their goals and dreams, they're not going to stop supporting their family because it's like in the blood of those family-oriented people and will do whatever it takes to do both things, to show the love to their family and also to reach the dream that they're wanting to achieve. IMO, these days, most of the families are changing their mindsets and parents don't want to pass the burden of theirs to their kids and letting them do what they wanna do.",

For instance, there are people who used to excel in the academe but was forced to stop their studies because they had no choice for, they are the only one that is expected to provide for their families. This is a matter of family over dreams, and of course, family is still the top priority (for others) even if it means that you have to give up on your dreams. So, I think the support of your family plays a major role in pushing you to succeed in this field, and that will help your ideas to be taken into action. This is quite sad, but this is really happening in real life as I have known a lot of people who share the same narratives like this.Â  But there are people who gave up their dreams for a moment, and then continue pursuing it and become successful entrepreneurs.",
