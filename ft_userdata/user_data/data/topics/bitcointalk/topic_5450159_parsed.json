  "content": "Necessity: I want to connect my wallet softwares to my node. I use BlueWallet (mobile) & Sparrow (desktop).Problem: I am running Bitcoin Core and it works perfectly fine. However, I want to connect BlueWallet to it, but it needs Electrum Server. But, I use Windows and Electrs seems difficult to set up on windows.Solution needed: I need you to guide me to run electrum server on my windows machine please.I am pretty sure, that it must have been asked before in this forum. If so, please feel free to close this thread as duplicate and guide me to the older post. I haven't been able to find any older posts however.",

Quote from: NeuroticFish on February 27, 2023, 08:29:36 PMSo... one major advantage of Fulcrum comes on Windows: the user can just get compiled binaries for Bitcoin Core, Fulcrum and Electrum, configure and run them all, without the need of stepping into Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Another good thing is it's performance: it's processing the requests significantly faster than Electrs. Just in my experience (HDD, infrequent use for rather short tasks) Fulcrum gets in the state I can access it significantly slower than Electrs.But, tbh, I don't like Fulcrum as much as the other option I have (Electrs)* Fulcrum is made by somebody with BCH ties and it may be much better optimized for BCH (to say the least)* As I said, Fulcrum starts/syncs slower than Electrs and that's not OK for my use caseFor further information, just go around on the threads:Electrum server on Windows: FulcrumBitcoin + Electrum server + Block explorer under Windows (with WSL and Debian)",

Thanks! For the time being, I want to configure Electrum Server and I will see how I 'll connect my android later!Quote from: vv181 on April 25, 2023, 09:41:24 PM@NeuroticFish made a complete guide on how to install the Electrum server on Windows.There is two option, you can use Electrs or Fulcrum.

For access from outside, probably router configuration should be checked, if static ip is used (or dynamic dns solution). Or server should be configured to use TOR. Anyway - it means computer must be switched on the whole time. I think sooner or later OP will come to the conclusion that a separate machine for that purpose is a better solution (PI or NUC etc).",

Both for performance and privacy reasons, I believe I should have a dedicated system to run as a bitcoin node.Moreover, I am thinking of buying a machine and running mynode software to it... We 'll see. But thanks for pointing that out.",

Don't know if you've tried it, but I have tried connecting to my Electrum server multiple times, with various implementations, some of which were tested in different versions, and it still couldn't load up. It either does nothing or returns a connection error after a minute.",
