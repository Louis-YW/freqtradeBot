  "content": "Bitcoin acceptability as a parameter for the modern economies called the digital economy, is usually low. It was envisioned that , by vision 2020, the world will be moving into a cashless society but, what seem to be missing in that plan is how the government was going to implement it.To implement it in a traditional way, government was suppose to provide ATM or POS machines in all the cities and communities with a policy to stop cash payment and transactions.However, beyond vision 2020, the idea of a digital economy came into the scene and it was first adopted in the west through the introduction of virtual credit cards and virtual currencies like Bitcoin.The place of religion in making sure members , both old and young accept Bitcoin as part of the vision 2020 cashless economy is essential. So far such efforts have been recorded. One of the good examples is the ZUGA COINÂ  which is owned by Bishop Samzuga who accepts the coil as a means of payment and appreciation.Religion has a role to play in the acceptability of digital currencies by member and also in ensuring the practice of the global vision 2020. There is Bitcoin apathy created by wrong perceptions of scam placed on Bitcoin die to the activities of scammers. These scammers are members of churches.What is the Essence of this Post?Religion has a role to play in the achievement of a digital economy.Religion can help in building the level of acceptability of digital currencies.Religion can help strengthen a cashless Society.",

This is community where we are discussing some updates and general conversation about the bitcoin and crypto market as whole but what's there with linking up with any religion? See i won't go further details about what you are trying to convince member here with your content but will say if you understand bitcoin you won't come up with baseless talks of your as this is the only decentralised currency which is not restricted by any border or differentiate on basis of religion.",

I guess whatever we do today we can't reverse the established idea. We can get more accurate results if we try to talk about these issues when the conspiracy theories predicting the collapse of the financial system are realized. :) Today's historical conditions are not mature enough to talk about such matters. We can get into an argument that we can't get results.",
