Because there are 2 kinds of exchange.A normal exchange is a company which exchanges fiat currency with cryptocurrency, and vice-versa, taking a small fee in the process. And that's it. Nothing else. I believe these exchanges hardly need to be regulated, because most often they don't store any funds.

Those exchanges need strong regulations, to protect investors.So because one exchanges your money and the other allows you to trade make them different in the view of regulation? Well, I don't agree with you, neither do I think any serious government will agree with you. Maybe the points below would change your view on this:1. Have you forgotten that it's human beings you are dealing with? Crypto aside, it's a matter of time before they would hide under that to launder money.2. When they are not regulated, how do they sincerely pay taxes despite making money from people?3. What if they just disappear with the customer's money?4. Even if they didn't disappear, don't you think they can still be cheating people when they are not answerable to anyone?Regulation is not always bad, it helps the economy and protects the assets and rights of people. And every company dealing with money are entitled to be regulated, not otherwise.",

And that's it. Nothing else. I believe these exchanges hardly need to be regulated, because they don't store any funds. First we have to ask \"why do governments regulate exchanges in first place?\".The answer is for a couple of reasons but the main one is to monitor people's financial transactions more. In simple terms: for more surveillance. Now back to the quoted part, the government that wants to monitor how much money you have in a cryptocurrency and how much profit you make (to tax you) where your coins come from and where they go, etc. needs to enforce regulations (KYC and other restrictive measures) to gather information on you and monitor you better.",

      "body": "I get what you're trying to put up here and for a while that has been the case with basically everything that could be traded in the market. A separate platform for exchange, and a separate one for investments. But there is a definitive reason as to why these two were merged into one eventually, and one of which is convenience, which is inarguably one of the best features one can offer as a platform. \"You entrust your money with us when you deposit the money you want to trade for other commodities, so why not cut the middle man, let you keep the fees you're going to pay for investing your money on a different platform, and just entrust it with us? That way you can conveniently manage all your tradings and holdings at the same time!\" Is basically what happened in the past that led to this moment. Don't get us wrong, it is a system that is far from perfect, considering the numerous backlashes it has received over the years following the scandals that came up left and right, but it is a system that is welcomed by many and is a necessary one at that too. So as much as you hate the current paradigm, there's going to have to be some major shift in the convenience department of things before you could convince people and business entities in this industry to separate these two.",

Well you would have made great sense if you have giving us some real example of this type of exchanges. And also those exchange that has to do with trading and so on are to you called investment exchanges.You said that the former doesn't need regulations and the later does need regulations, I would be very interested in knowing why you think so. Exchanging funds like from fiat to crypto and vice versa is also as risky as trading. One of the purpose of regulation is to make a safe space for everyone and if you think regulations should be you self explained investment exchange then it should also be in the normal exchange.",

We shall have the same discussion with cryptos exchanges.Many legislators around the world are talking about regulating exchanges, this is what they should talk about first.It is true that there are two types of banking systems, one for investment banking and one for ordinary consumer banking. The products they offer are completely different from each other, and the regulatory requirements are also very different. I can understand the arguments that these two system should be kept apart from each other to reduce the risk for the customers. Investment banking is much more risky than the consumer banking that just offers loans and savings account. The thing is that traditional consumer banking seem to slowly disappear with technological advancements. Do we really need an institution in 2023 with many offices around the world and thousands of employees that only collects money and lends it out? The crypto community shows us that the is huge potential for p2p networks without a big institution in the middle. The problem I have with crypto exchanges just for buying and selling, and investment exchanges with more advanced products is that we usually want as many traders as possible on an exchange to get the best possible price. The higher the number of people buying and selling on an exchange the better it is to find a counterpart for our transaction. If we divide exchanges for their different purposes it could be hard to find some buyer or seller for our alt coins.",

And every company dealing with money are entitled to be regulated, not otherwise.  Regulating Exchanges only poses one advantage to the government which is the tax and that is not entirely bad. But the government regulating an exchange will somehow defeat the purpose of total decentralization of cryptocurrency. The government will definitely argue that they are after the citizen’s protection, I still think they just want to monitor people holdings because even banks that regulated the government still aren’t able to control the crimes or scams there. Moreover some countries government have made it clear that cryptocurrency is volatile and somewhat a Ponzi scheme, so I ask will this regulation make it less volatile?. Just like others Exchanges mostly centralized ones that wants offer direct bank transfers should be regulated since they are involved in taking benefits from people like fees they charge but I wouldn’t advice any to keep there funds on them because it is regulated and the government feels they are secured after registering with them. FTX seems registered and yet they still got in a saga and people the government claim they protect are yet to recover there funds",

And so far as I know, I don't see anything different between them other than the name you want to give them; they all possess the same purpose. So you can just say centralized exchanges should be regulated, but decentralized exchanges should not, since they are not involved in any form of customer money control, nor are they there to lend out money or perform any similar banking service other than business as usual. In as much as we all don't like the centralized exchanges, saying they should completely be regulated is absolutely out of the question for me, because it will make no difference. Aside from the taxes that the regulatory body will want to charge from customers, they will want to have full control over the exchanges, telling them what to do and what not to do at any given time, which will really inconvenience the way crypto currency is supposed to be used. If you want regulation and your finances to be controlled by government bodies, just stay with the banking system.",

Should we not apply similar rules to these crypto platforms? While 'regular exchanges' could use lesser regulation, high-risk ones require tighter frameworks! Universally accepted, right? But, here's the problem: Can traditional rules accommodate the crypto's fluidity? Given cryptos superior potential, duplicating regulations might restrict it! Thus, cryptos call for a sophisticated approach. The core challenge? Balancing innovation and investor protection. That's the pivotal issue, folks!",
