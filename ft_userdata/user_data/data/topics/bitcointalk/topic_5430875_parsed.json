Of course that would be flagged even if the exchange is non-custodial.I will explain in more detail as I use a ledger wallet myself.In Ledger Live, you can change one coin for another, but there are not many coins there, like on a centralized exchange. The exchange takes place in the Ledger Live interface, which is secure, but the exchange is done through centralized services.You can also connect via metamask to Uniswap or 1inch, but these are the risks of losing funds through vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Therefore, I use the first wallet on Ledger Live to exchange coins, and the subsequent ones only for storage.If you do not know how exchanges work, then it is better not to use them, or send the minimum amount at a time, like I did for $ 1,000. It may take a long time, but it will take even longer to return your money for months later. You will have to answer dozens of different questions about your financial transactions and where you get your money from.",

This is a user error. There is even a warning that the exchange will be through a partner, but apparently people do not read this. And after sending money, you agree to the Terms of Use.https://changelly.com/terms-of-use",

Though I haven’t try their swap option because I think the fees will be more expensive compare to the normal trade. If you are not ok with the KYC then try to use DEX more often, used ledger or any hard wallet only for storing crypto and not for your swap option.",

Plus I have found ways to easily change my crypto to my local fiat actually. Anyhow, this is another lessons to be learned again in this market. Having that huge amount will definitely attract attention.",

For fast payments, it's usually more convenient to use the Electrum Wallet interface if you don't like Ledger Live. And for Ethereum and its forks, a full node is not needed, and the ledger is compatible with many well-known wallets.",

Also, how can a person who owns nearly 3 million dollars not read the policies and terms of service of the exchange platform through which he will exchange his wealth, this indicates his foolishness without a doubt. I do not blame Changelly because these are their policies that everyone who will use their services must read and agree to them carefully, and these measures that they take care to prevent suspicious money resulting from money laundering, terrorist financing, and others, and this is what makes the platform legal and far from criminal charges, for me, I haven't tried Changelly before and I can't trust the exchanges that the accusations are made against, I can only try a small amount.",

The fact that they have $3m to begin with and do not understand that there might be troubles along the way tells me that they just got lucky, and that they don't know much about crypto, exchanges, and how these works in general.

The default recommended platform is Changelly, as it stated the process will be quick and no registration is needed. Unfortunately, Changelly held the transaction process, and ask KYC and the source of funds. He complied will all the required information, but Changelly does not give any further information about the funds.So, in short, As also noted above, Changelly sucks. Everyone should not use the platform.",
