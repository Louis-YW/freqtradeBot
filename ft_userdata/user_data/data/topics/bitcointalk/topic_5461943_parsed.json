IDO are holding on to stay in the market, and many projects still want to be listed on these platform so they can raise more funds and attract more investors. DAO and POOLX seems to be a solid one, if you’re a long term investor better to do DCA so you can lower your average cost.",

Most new projects are hard to convince even if IDO platforms with the reputation they have before. IMO, there are new forms appearing in the future to attract investment in this market, and it is also possible that the platforms will also upgrade with new changes. Personally, I remember participating in a few IDOs before, but honestly, I always feel unfair in the process of using it.",

For example, regarding the advantages offered by IDO platforms to developers and the absolute security offer that will be given to investors. For me personally, there will be only a few IDO platforms that will survive in the future, it can happen because of several things such as the IDO platform being out of competition with the fundraising platform which has more advantages like what is being developed by Cardano.",

And i agree with you, either IEO or Private sales, where you need to know about the company and it isn't targetting noobs for their money, but actually people who are interested. But those are harder to find.And ideally CEXes should weed out scammers from IEOs they host, while IDOs are for anyone with photoshop skills.
