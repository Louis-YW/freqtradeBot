Those are horrendous numbers.Those coins might not be permanently lost, buddy. Some addresses might have unused coins not because the owners lost access, but due to reasons like passing away or being unable to use the internet. Many investors choose to keep some coins untouched for privacy reasons. the price of Bitcoin is influenced by these lost coins. The more coins are lost, the higher Bitcoin's price tends to be in the market. In the case of Bitcoin, its value goes up due to its limited supply.some analyses are just estimates, and given the rounded figures, we can't be certain those coins are truly lost forever. As @hugeBlack mentioned, Bitcoins sent to a burn address are more likely to be lost permanently.You should read this article on lost coins https://originstamp.com/blog/how-many-bitcoins-have-been-lost/",

Since I really witness last year lost but not really sure the exact amount of BTC was lost in that bear run but I know that 6.3m BTC lost which is among some of the things that affected the gas fee of BTC to increase higher.I know that there will not be too much lost in this season, because they will not allow those things that made them to experience those lost to occur again than to make it in a way they will increase their gain and to make hodlers to feel the same way too in this 2024.",

Anyway coins that are not in circulation anymore definitely affects the price of bitcoin less supply and more demand that kind of concept so even intentionally people really do take bitcoin and send them to addresses that are inactive so that they can manipulate the market",

The coins that one can confidently say are lost are the ones sent to a burner address and the reward for genesis block. Even those address are a thing to get hold on, because they are different and plenty of those addresses currently. A thread here was once created for burner addresses and it is not active again. So this seriously a huge task to combine those addresses. One thing I am certain of is the number lost bitcoins yearly will certainly be reducing as move on because back in the early days when bitcoin wasn’t that expensive was the reason why lost bitcoin was common. Right now people take their bitcoin security seriously and one can hardly lose or burn his bitcoin this days except if they got hack which is not lost or forgotten private key which can still be recovered of the private key is later been found",

Also, I'm curious as to how they make this estimates because it seems to me that the most obvious way which is checking the addresses that have these bitcoins or counting the current circulation of bitcoin in different exchanges are a little bit too on the nose for me.

If you know a reliable source, please share!Not likely. Bitcoin's were readily lost in its early days when it was worth nothing or barely anything because it was just an experiment used by a few thousand people and people didn't take it seriously enough to store their keys safely. These days losing Bitcoin is very rare, and certainly has no effect on the market when hundreds of thousands of bitcoin are traded every day.I've never seen the 6m estimate, but yeah that is horrendous. It is likely 2 million lost bitcoin, maybe at very most 2.5 million. Might even be less than 2 million, even with 1 million lost from Satoshi. People get the absurd lost estimates like 4m or 6m because they like to pretend any bitcoin that hasn't moved for a certain amount of years is lost. So if they keep that length of time the same, say 10 years, naturally over time that will come to include more and more bitcoin, despite them not being lost but simply held long term.",
