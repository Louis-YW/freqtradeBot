  "content": "As usual, scammers don't miss a target on an opportunity of people especially when it involves places where people want to get money. There has been a message with a link that has been broadcasted and forwarded in WhatsApp groups and individuals, it is about the federal government cash transfer program palliative to ease 15 million from the current high cost of living, but there is a fake website that are been share around for people to click to have this palliative but upon my investigations, the website is fake and they are only extracting peoples such as their email, names, state of origin.This was the screenshot from the WhatsApp message that was sent to me, you can clearly see that the website is on the forwarded text but there is more to the link when you click on that link. When I clicked on the link that was shared on WhatsApp, the URL changed and redirected me to another URL like this common online scam with cheap domains. As you can see from the image below, I used an arrow to indicate the URL that changed on my browser. Code:https://popuyam.com/fg-25000-cash-transfer-ng =====> Code:https://25k-households.trust-jobs.online/Another Observation In the footer of the website, where I marked with an arrow, there is a hidden counter that counts the number of people that visit, which means the scammer is not only collecting just the data, the website is also counting the numbers of people that visit the website. You can hover your cursor on that arrow, it will take you to the website counter and tell you exactly the people that have visited this website since it was launched.Last but not least, after filling your data into the website, it takes you to another page with fake testimonies where they ask you to enter your account number and name and tell you that you are eligible for palliative. It then asks you to share the link for people to groups and individuals to be qualified and after 24 hours, you will receive an email of successful application.In summary, what this website does is that they collect people's information, they collect names, states and account numbers. What they do with the data is they resell it to companies that survey, and they sell this information to them in huge amounts. This is how valuable your information is to those companies, don't fall for all these kinds of scams and fake websites.",

      "body": "The hard times people are facing make it easier for scammers to use this means of people getting free money, people easily get convinced, and the circle of hardship people go through makes them see everything has an opportunity, I also see the link shared with me but am always scared since it even involves me putting my bank details on the form, and before the government start anything the information must have gone round and people will be expectant and this is not the first time I have seen something like this so please we should warn our love one against things like this because a lot of people might fall victim of this the major problem of Nigerians is they never learn that's the problem. This information is something to be warned about.",

      "body": "Thank you for sharing this information here, make we know say for Naija anything way involved in sharing links with 10 people for WhatsApp after registration is fake. Scammers just want to get people's information so that after some time they can start calling those people who registered for their fake website and tell them they are eligible for the money way Tinubu they pay 15 million households for Naija, they go tell you to call so so phone number to get the money. If you call the number way they send as text message, the person way you call will tell you to pay money way them go used to process your payment and so many people dey fall into this scam.",

My fear is the number of people that will fall victim for these scam because of the hardship we are currently experiencing in the country. People don’t need much convincing when it comes to money, people go to any length andbeven risk everything just to get money. It is good of you sharing this post with us here but i still don’t think it will be enough because i fear for those who are not opportuned to be here, they will easily be misled by this people as everyone will be seeking to try their luck to be one of the lucky people to get the palliative.",

      "body": "Well, nothing surprising here as you have said it all, and this is the fact that scammers never will rest, the same way people who are into business take their business very serious, so also, we have some group of people in the country who have chosen to become scammers by profession, so this set of people will never allow any opportunity to scam people pass since it's what they do for a living.It is rather up to us to try as much as possible to verify every piece of information before believing it.And besides, WhatsApp and telegram have proven to be the den of fake and misleading information, it is wrong to outrightly click on link received or posted on any group on any of this two social media apps, governments have their official handles on X (formally twitter), every information believed to be from any arm of the government can always be verified on that government's verified social account before believing in such.",
