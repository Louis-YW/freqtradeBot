The tendency of these kids to imitate that as they grow old will be like a normal day to them. Another one is the influence of surroundings and as well as their online presence, you see that a lot of kids are online today and that's not a good thing that parents should't patronize.",

Don’t smoke, don’t take drugs, limit alcohol use near the kids. Send them to a good school so they get a good education. Just show them love & care for them. I don’t have kids but children have been born & cared for since the beginning of time, it can’t be that hard if you are a good, loving parent.",

Therefore, upbringing from the family, especially from the father and mother, must be better and have high discipline for their children. All good upbringing must be accustomed to and taught from an early age. Because children at an early age, are likened to still a blank slate, which will certainly be filled with many things, which are in their life habits. So as much as possible don't fill it with bad or negative things, but fill it with something good and positive. So when children grow up, the lessons or upbringing given to them from their parents since childhood, will definitely be seen clearly. Is the upbringing good, or the upbringing bad.So a family or household, indeed plays a very important role for everyone in the formation of their character. And all of that is not just words, but is proven and real.",

If a couple has problems, their children would suffer from it, if there is a divorce or the couple fights too much, the children will notice and suffer from it psychologically. I dont know how we could improve those sorts of problems in society, the only thing that comes to mind would be to make counseling, parenthood programs and psychological attention to be more widespread in those societies where they are more needed. So we can break the chain of transmitting our traumas and problems to the coming generations.",

Do not start a home when you know that you are not responsible enough to raise children. Bad parenting and irresponsible parenting increases the number of kids that become a problem to the society. To solve this issue, people about starting a home should really come to the reality that they have to become responsible for their children.",

A large number of spoiled children in society can be ascribed to a lack of parental guidance and monitoring from a young age. Family is the initial fundamental and first step of socialization in society; if that is lacking, you will end up producing a nuisance in society. Peer groups, religious groups, and organizations enter the picture after the child has become acquainted with the family; there is little or nothing these bodies can do to change the child if they have already been spoilt at home, and there is more for them to do because they can easily spoil the child if they already had a good upbringing at home. They both have an impact on each other and must be addressed accordingly by educating the child on the proper way.",

This keeps your path intact and helps you in many things but honestly good upbringing is extremely difficult in this time .",

These children look up to their parents as their role model when they are growing up and parents should consider this when they are bringing up their children. If you behave weird and you are arrogant,your children will feel that is the best way to live life and they will grow up to imitate you. You should also take them close to God to guide them to the right part of life.Those children that can be influenced by their environment,if their parents have good morals and they brought up their children in that way,these children will not be influenced by the environment that much,because there will be limit to it. If we want our children to have good morals and to have value to the society,we need to reflect on our own way of life to see if these children imitates us it will be the right path but if not then we need to change our lifestyle and be discipline with good morals.",

They will copy what their parents are doing be it good or bad. So every parent must behave the way they want their children to behave. Society is made up of a combination of homes, which means society will always reflect the quality of our homes. But the current crop of young parents are not helping the society. Some of us are not well groomed or were influenced by materialism and  peer pressure to engage in some societal vices. There is an increase in drug abuse, internet fraud, and other crimes because of poor home training. Materialism is pushing some parents to encourage their children to engage in crime. Just recently law enforcement agencies in my area discovered a secret internet fraud school. This school specializes in teaching interested youths how to carry out fraud successfully. And many of these students confessed that it was their parents that enrolled them in the school.",

Tell them what's good and what's bad and then tell them the consequences if they do what is good or what is bad....That's my thoughts though...",

As a parent you should spend more time with your children and get them to trust you so that it can involve you in certain decisions that will be confusing for them to make on their own.
