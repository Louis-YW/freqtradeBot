I hope that you can withdraw your funds at some point, but remember that if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Yeah the ops need to work out modalities to get the deposits out of that site if they refuse to honour their promises because if the bonus is only meant for first-time deposits why then is the feature available in the deposits,  meanwhile the ops have a very simple way to resolve this issue and that is to either make a withdrawal from the site and if he can withdraw without wager that means it truly a technical error from the sites. But if his deposits are subject to the bonus conditions which is wagering before withdrawal that means the casino is out to play games with the ops and that should be seen as a big red alert to others.",

If casino stated somewhere in the bonus conditions like to wager before the bonus can be activated for withdrawal depending on how many times to wager then whoever is entering for such should be aware of such conditions.I'm only reacting based on if there are conditions to the bonus yet to be met. I think either some one else having same issue can corroborate op's challenge or the team response. I have seen op has also made a post on their ANN. Hopefully, it will be resolved for him.",

That you could make your deposit, and therefore have the right to get the entire bonus right away plus availability to withdraw? Because if it's the casino's mistake, I believe you should be entitled to your bonus. BUT for such a small deposit, I would just probably warn the casino that some people might take advantage of the technicality.Consider that a public service. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",

This is a lock, no wiggle room).Reading through your post and see this makes me think you have a point that their bonus notification is really confusing because it doesn’t indicate quantity it can be claimed.I’m not sure either why the support doesn’t acknowledge your report while it’s valid concern. There’s no warning that it can be claimed once or they should just remove that note once already claimed. But since the casino has the right to remove bonuses, I think the support reply will govern. I just hope that their devs will remove that sticky bonus note because it’s really confusing to those bonus hunter that typically hunt for bonuses. Maybe update your OP and compile all the necessary details and evidence to make your case easy to understand.",

My big question is, even though you not successfully gotten the bonus is your deposit amount still credited or not? and did your deposit get turnover-based the promotion?If your deposit still getting credited without any requirements like a normal deposit.

Where the problem is now is where they OP did not receive the second deposit bonus as he already believed it would have been credited to him as he meet all the requirements, but it now appears that the casino might have made a mistake of not disabling that bonus offer notification after the first bonus has been given to the OP and I believe that’s where the problem is coming from. Taking some other casino bonus terms into consideration i believe the bonus is usually done only in the first deposit although exceptions and other seasonal bonus do comes in line too.",

I see red all day (in terms of bugs, not red streaks..) - at the end of the day I enjoy relaxing, which includes throwing a few bucks around.If i were to suddenly change the behavior of any code that I developed, I would do so by changing prompts and the user experience - not by tucking something away 'at the back'.I do this even for my own sake, to prevent the phone lighting up.Many sites I've used in the past have had deposit bonuses, where it certainly isn't limited 'to the first deposit' (which also conflicts with support saying that instead, 'you must deposit on Tuesday or Thursday').I've since heard that there are quite a few people who are less than happy with the unexpected change at bc.game; unfortunately I don't think I will see a resolution.james",

And this is likely not his first deposit too. OP likes BC.game so much, he's loyal. The casino has the right not to have the credit since the bonus expired. Since he hasn't lost anything anyway, he can just withdraw the coins or just bet it in the casino. Coins are already there so you might as well just enjoy the ride.
