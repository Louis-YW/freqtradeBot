But I checked the coin market information.Maximum supply: 1 billionCirculating supply: 492.59 millionTotal supply: 325 millionIt has a good marketcap which is $495 million, but why is the circulating supply higher than the total supply? All the coins that I have checked before, either the circulating supply is lesser than or equals to the total supply, why higher this time?",

All the coins that I have checked before, either the circulating supply is lesser than or equals to the total supply, why higher this time?I don't know exactly, but maybe it has something to do with the stacking of coins? Total supply is calculated as the number of coins in the stacking. Circulating supply is possibly the number of coins, including %APY, which is very large, unlike other projects. Or it could be a source error where you got these figures from.",

But I checked the coin market information.This looks like a solid project in the Cosmos ecosystem, one of its leading DEX I assume. It has been around for years and has a respectable TVL at almost $200 million. I'm not a regular user of Cosmos chains, but it is safe to say that this isn't a random scam coin. The platform fulfils a specific use case, i.e. interchain DEX in the Cosmos eco.Quote from: _act_ on February 06, 2023, 12:28:00 PMMaximum supply: 1 billionCirculating supply: 492.59 millionTotal supply: 325 millionIt has a good marketcap which is $495 million, but why is the circulating supply higher than the total supply?

My guess is the total supply information is not up to date while the circulating supply data is updated in real-time based on API (i.e. https://api-osmosis.imperator.co/supply/v1/osmo)",

That would be cool but probably not the case here.My guess on the supply \"discrepancy\" is the same above that the data from market aggregators is not up to date. It's also possible the team behind Osmosis are still unaware of the fact so better ask them to talk to Coingecko or CMC.",

Which means the circulating supply is higher on Coingecko. Maybe both sites are not getting the value right.Quote from: dbshck on February 06, 2023, 02:24:02 PMYeah that's interesting.

Probably what happened, thanks for bring it clear.Quote from: Yogee on February 06, 2023, 03:14:53 PMSo you earn just by storing the coin or token in your wallet without joining any staking pool? That would be cool but probably not the case here.It is the case here, there are some coins you can connect to a node and stake directly on your wallet, some of other coins like solana, zilliqa, atom and some others can be staked like that too.",

      "body": "Its like the top 1 dex on cosmos ecosystem. I could compare that to dex of bsc such as pancakeswap and uniswap of erc20 tokens. What is goof is that osmo got some free airdrop when you stake it. Though I dont have that, I always seen a lot of freebies from staking osmo, too bad I didnt cause I am holding atom recently which i envy those who got drop of this when given to atom holders.",
