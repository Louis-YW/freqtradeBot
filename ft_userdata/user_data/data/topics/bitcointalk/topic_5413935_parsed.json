  "content": "hello all,   has anyone heard of bypassing the power supply and just using DC power to run a miner?   we are able to adjust the wattage the S9s can run on.. if we turned an S9 down and had a few hundred watts of solar panels \" without a battery bank\" would they fire up when the sun was giving them enough watts?? I know there is a lot more involved with making the power \"steady\" but I am just wondering if I could spark some guy who know a little more about this than I thanks ALL..",

      "body": "Could it be done that way? Yes.Should it be done that way? Probably not.You need 12V and at a bit more then a couple of hundred watts per board to run a downlococked board + a few watts to run the controller.And you would have to make a custom power supply to get the panels to put out a clean 12V.Would probably be better to run a stock inverter on the solar to get to 120 / 240 AC then plug that into a UPS and then that into a regular power supply.That is all off the shelf stock components. You could probably build a custom setup to do what you want to do but it's going to take a lot more time and effort and since it's custom you will be doing all the troubleshooting.If something is not right on the custom setup as the sun moves and power changes you could be seriously underpowering or overpowering the hashboards. And that is just going to damage them.-Dave",

The control board and the hash boards couldn't care less where the 12V DC comes from, so ya, you could bypass the miner's PSU but then you will have a lot of issues to deal with.You will need to stabilize the DC input which can't happen if you want to supply the miner directly from the solar panels, and then two, you will need something to attach those 6-pin connectors to, you can't just a run couple of wires from the solar panels and attach them to the miner.So technically, this can be done, practically, it seems like a terrible idea.",

      "body": "ok ok.. yea nobody is selling me anything.. i was just thinking \"what if?\" I was given a burned up S9 and the computer and only one hashboard worked. and I noticed the power supply wouldn't even break a sweat so I unplugged the two bad boards and it still does fine. I am going to see if its just the one port for a hashboard working on the computer?? Im not sure if they all will run like that. thanks for the reply!",

      "body": "this is a great idea! Mining chips are fundamentally low voltage DC devices, just like solar cells.As others have said though, it will require some extra equipment in addition to the solar panel.Solar panels have a maximum power point for every different level of light shining on them. Solar Inverters / Battery chargers will have Maximum Power Point Trackers (MPPT) in them to adjust the solar panel output voltage and current to stay right in this maximum power point. Outside of the maximum power point you'll see dramatically lower power output. Sometimes even crashing to zero power (not so good for mining).Basically this means that if you hooked up a big enough solar panel to your miner via a 12V DC regulator, it _might_ work for a little bit. But as soon as a cloud goes by or the light changes in any way, the panel output power could crash and shutoff/brownout your miner. At best it's going to be *very* inefficient, and likely very unstable.When you're charging batteries with solar it's a relatively simple task of regulating the charging current to get into the solar panel's maximum power point. Batteries are fine with reducing the current -- they'll just charge slower. Not so much with a bitcoin miner. When you're running a miner (like the S9) you put in how many ever hashboards you want and then configure it with Braiins. The miner's current requirement is going to be pretty static with a given hash frequency (and maybe chip voltage).What you really need for solar mining is to have the mining chip's (it's called an ASIC, yo) mining frequency as a part of the MPPT control loop! I call it Maximum Hash Point Tracking (MHPT). Basically the miner firmware is constantly looking at the solar panel's voltage and current, and adjusting the hashing frequency to keep the solar panel from crashing and keep it at maximum power. You'll extract the maximum power that's available from the solar panel at any given instant, and use that to hash as much as you can. You'll avoid the inefficiency of high voltage inverters and rectifiers, which just means more hashes. I think there are some other efficiency gains to be had by changing up the DC-DC conversion inside the miner and changing the number of ASICs in series, but that's another project.",

I think you don't need it if you want to control the speed of both exhaust and front fan then you can control them like other said on different firmware. BraiinsOS is mostly one of the firmware that you can use to control power voltage, fan, and other features and options. If you want to install this firmware you can find the official thread here below- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5036844.0",

I think it would be amazing if it did exist though. Solar is the best decentralized power we have so far. It’s a perfect match for decentralized Bitcoin mining.Speed controller doesn’t sound like the right term. If you’re trying to charge batteries with solar, look for a “Solar charge controller”",

Also, May June July August would be the best month that can produce high-quality power.",
