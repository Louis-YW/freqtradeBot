The only way to prevent noise from spreading and disturbing others is to soundproof the space where such devices will be placed. I am saying this purely out of some logic, because I have no experience with mining, but if you look at some smaller mining farms (homemade) then you will see how it should look like.For more information, I suggest you visit the Mining board",

Bitcoin mining rigs get so hot and noisy, so you need to be careful when selecting soundproofing materials you want to use.A well-designed mining box will get you 15- 20 decibels of noise reduction when closed.Line your mining box with a fire rated, sound absorbing material can reduce the noise level by an additional 5-10 decibelsSoundproofing a Bitcoin Mining Rig is a good guidsee this thread as well: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5024125.0",

He had to declare a craft activity with the authorities in order to be able to open a shop, and thus people would not suspect the noise he makes on the grounds that they are machines that serve the craft activity.I do not recommend adopting this method, but I will only list what my friend did.  And each person according to his circumstances.",

Any help would be appreciated You're in a bad situation because you're downstairs; even other noises will seem louder than usual if you live downstairs.It's better if the miner(s) are in the basement where the noise will be less noticeable upstairs, you can offer the space to your neighbor if you have one.But without proper ventilation, the space will be quite hot.",

I quoted the exact part of that post.  By understanding the specifications of your room, you can choose the right one from the miner. But if in that case you have objection or problem of profit then you can follow the noise reduction method by selecting any of the above mining machines.

Any help would be appreciated Ok, so is this about reducing the noise from mining, as your own mining gear or your neighbor's gear that is bugging you, or are you talking about general noise? Everyone was focusing on reducing the noise from miners but it's not like the OP has asked how he can do that, nor does he seem to bother to buy such noise and more like the noise coming from his neighbors upstairs.So before everyone jumps to conclusions and gives the same advice, is this really the question or you're asking to soundproof the entire ceiling from all the noise? I doubt that if OP was mining to date in such a location wouldn't have had problems before or would he be able to sleep at all with something like an S19 screeching 24/7 in that house!Quote from: Lucius on January 23, 2023, 02:19:03 PMThese machines are usually very noisy, although I may be wrong and there are exceptions. The only way to prevent noise from spreading and disturbing others is to soundproof the space where such devices will be placed.It's pretty simple:- the more power the machine draws for hashing the more heat it generates- the more heat you need to blow out the faster and larger the fans and thus the bigger the noise- sound insulation in a box works but you don't solve the heating issue so you need soundproof ducts and you need more fans for the airflow and that air to be blown somewhere where the noise will also be unleashed.My advice if you're thinking of mining in a flat, think twice before doing it! Or twelve times, far better!",

You can sell the noisy miner and try finding another that works more quietly, for example jasminer x4, but you never tell us the type of crypto miner you are using, I am guessing it's an ASIC? If that'd correct there is nothing you can do than to change location.",
