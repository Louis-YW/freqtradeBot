However, the enforcement of this ban is practically non-existent.If someone wants to insult you based on your gender; if you're a woman or transgender, the insults will mostly be allowed.This is because the people who operate reddit are a bunch of neckbeard incels who never have talked to a woman, let alone be allowed to continue to interact with her for more than an hour.To repeat again; Reddit is a transphobic platform!",
