The merit remains, but getting merit o this forum is not determined by you, rather it is by the person reading what you're saying and feels it worth deserving a merit, if that post is being deleted and was the only one that helps you maintain the activity required for the rank you are, then you will be demoted except you have enough posts to cover up for your activity for that rank while your merit still remains provided that you get any.",

Thanks for the Answer Awesome Human being!!!!Merit (your earned merit) stays forever. It won't be decayed or reverted if you don't abuse it seriously.

Oh that's sounds nice. i haven't heard about this that someone merit can be reverted also. I think very few unlucky users have lost merit after achieved.

I think in this this thread will be add to recycle bin and then admin will delete it.",

I would suggest just locking the thread vs deleting it.Some users do it to remove track especially if they start to realize that the merit transactions on the post are not really worth it.

Other people have already given you some good answers to go about the merit system and also to go about it.

Thanks for the Answer Awesome Human being!!!!No mate, your merits would not be deleted but rather your activity would drop and once there is any drop in activities too it also affects your rank because you will have to acrue some certain numbers of activities to qualify you for the next rank irrespective of the fact that you have enough merits. Nevertheless, deleting that post of yours is not the best option though just as Yahoo62278 has said, that there would be some one in the future maybe a new be who would want to ask similar questions but for the fact that that question exist, they would see the response from members and possibly knowing what to do based on the response gotten.",

Thanks for the Answer Awesome Human being!!!!Once a post is merited and a profile is merited, that merit will not be removed in any way. even if you delete the post yourself or a moderator deletes your post, the merit will remain on your profile. but if someone abuse the merit then in that case he can get a natural or red tag and there will be no other problem. but an admin has the power to edit someone's account and has the ability to remove merit from a profile. but such a thing has never been seen done by the admin, nor have I seen it, and I do not think he will do it",
