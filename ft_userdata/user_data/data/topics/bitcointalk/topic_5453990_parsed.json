Some gambling websites consist of wicked owners that willingly plan to defraud their users using the ToS against them, or is this normal? Have such happened to anyone on this forum before? Using ToS against customer that commit violation is normal but changing the rules just to use in favor for the casino unethical. Do you have any references on the actual event of this kind scenario because this is diabolical just to take advantage on their customer. I know that some casino have a special written rule on their ToS that they can change some rules without notifying customers but changing it right after the case of the user is a not fair despite they have that special rules.Only scammish mediocre casino do this since a reputable casino will always honor the players profit if this is acquired in fair manner.Quote from: KiaKia on May 25, 2023, 12:48:32 PM Have such happened to anyone on this forum before? My only known case related to this case was @efialtis issue against Betfury which the casino change the commission percentage without notifying all the user and even include the commission that is acquired before the changes happened. It’s indeed same scenario to your description. Reference: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5400484.0",

Not normal, that's why accepting TOS is a thing. But are you sure that you didn't just remember the TOS incorrectly? I actually didn't know that people even read those. I skim those and assume that they are basically same everywhere. It's not like they want their users to escape elsewhere with a better TOSMaybe you can you give me an exact examples since you have memorized parts of those modified TOS:es?",

      "body": "Many online gambling websites have clauses in their terms and conditions that allow them to change the terms without notifying users or gamblers. This can be frustrating for users who may feel like they are being taken advantage of or unfairly treated. However, this is not unique to online gambling websites. Many companies and services have similar clauses in their terms and conditions. Is it legal? The short answer is yes. Most countries have laws that allow companies to change their terms and conditions without notifying users. This is because it is assumed that users will read the terms and conditions at least periodically throughout their use. If users do not agree with the changes made by a company, they can stop using that service and go to another provider. While this may not be the most ideal situation for users, it is still legal. However, there are some countries that have laws that prohibit companies from changing their terms and conditions without notifying users. This means that gambling websites that operate in these countries should not use such a clause.In my experience, gambling websites usually notify users of changes to their terms and conditions via email or on the website itself. This is a good practice because it allows users to decide whether they want to keep using that service or not. If a user does not agree with these changes, they can simply stop using that service. Any company that cares about its reputation should have such a standard. However, every company is different. Some companies have a bad reputation for not being transparent about their business practices while others have a good reputation for doing the right thing.",

If you comply with the ToS that you agreed to from the start in the bet and you play and then win, they change the ToS for various reasons and they violate the original agreement and do not want to pay or hold your withdrawal on the grounds that changing the ToS is a ridiculous action taken by the online casino that you are playing at, it is truly a disservice and fraud. they have bad intentions of not wanting to pay your bet.They shouldn't give you that ridiculous excuse by reason of changing the ToS on the basis of the rules and betting agreements that have been agreed upon from the start, cases like this are rare and this is the first time I heard of changes to the ToS when a user wins, it's bad if that's what they do. you should sue them for fraud.",

Terms and condition can change from time to time and casino indicate it in their ToS that they are allowed to change the casino terms any time they want. Things will change if the casino used it against you. Things aren't right if casino won't let you withdraw because of history you have in the past before they implement the new ToS. One example of this is country eligibility, If you did play on a country that recently banned online casino and you of course withdraw your funds because you can't play there anymore. Then suddenly casino barged you with KYC prompt and tell you that you are now illegal to play in their casino because of the country restriction which caused you in forfeiting your money because of a rule that you don't have any control at all. Things are plain wrong that way. It's just an hypothetical example and I hope that no one became a victim on that kind of scenario.",

It's unethical and they have a plan to scam their users, they should notify their users if they have a change of their terms, so the user can adapt to the changes, and make necessary adjustments, so far all the casinos I'm playing notify their users through pop-ups when you log in or through their newsletter if there are changes to their TOS.Casinos that do not implement TOS notification should be reported to warn other users of these casinos.",

Therefore, every serious casino will inform its players if there has been a change, and it is nothing strange if some abuse such changes to their advantage, because not everyone plays a fair game.However, I think that a much bigger problem is that most players do not read the terms of use, and then complain later because they were uninformed. Just as every online casino wants to protect itself and its business, every player needs to protect himself and his interests, even if that means reading all the fine print.",

So far I have never experienced a case like that let alone my closest friends who are also crypto gamblers, but I often hear on this forum about cases like you said, usually problems due to TOS or TOS changes that are changed without user notification, if there is a casino. those who commit such fraud are sure that they only want to steal and take advantage of users' money.I'm not sure if that's the case with the big casinos because as far as I can feel any changes to the rules the big casinos will notify their users by putting a notification on their account that there's a change in TOS or some other change in requirements. if you have a problem at a particular casino and it makes you uncomfortable just leave.",

I have not seen someone that make this kind of complain before, this is the first one that I am seeing this. This kind of things should be with evidence, the name of the gambling site and the terms and conditions that was edited and changed that did not favoue the gambler. Some gambling site can change somethings and make amendments to their terms and conditions, but if you are following the old conditions, the new conditions that can affect gamblers should not.lead to what will affect their gamblers. If it will affect their gamblers, they will message the old gamblers to let them be aware of the new conditions.I do not see this as any issue because I have not seen complains about this before.
