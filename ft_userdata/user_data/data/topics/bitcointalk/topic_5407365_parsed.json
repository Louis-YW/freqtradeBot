As a person who is seeking to save money, I recommend that you consider gold, in addition to gold being an investment, gold is a good saving due to its stable price and lack of depreciation, as compared to fiat currency.Also, if you are interested in investing, you can learn about bitcoin, which is a good form of long-term investment and a safe place to store assets anonymously.",

It is interesting to hear the opinion of the members of bitcointalkI don't have any future views regarding stablecoins because in truth, stablecoins only act as assets that have little fluctuation and are good to have when a bear market comes along. As we know that some time ago the crypto space was shocked by the collapse of one of the leading stablecoins (UST), then later the price of USDT began to weaken.Maybe you should know first the types of stablecoins, there are several types of stablecoins, including:- FIAT Backed Stablecoin- Crypto Backed Stablecoin- Gold Backed Stablecoin- Algorithmic StablecoinUST itself is an algorithmic stablecoin whose value depends on the algorithm they have (related to $LUNA). So, if you want to own a stablecoin, I advise you to only have BUSD and also USDC, because these two stablecoins are 100% FIAT Backed stablecoins. You don't have to worry about their future.",

The first is that the FIAT currency undergoes a devaluation and your investment decreases \"by its nature\".The second concerns precisely the computational aspect ... behind a stable coin there are companies that claim to have a certain number of deposits / payments, in short, collaterals.Do you trust it? In our crypto field... we always say \"DON'T TRUST! Verify!\" This should be approached to everything.How do you verify the existence of such deposit? how can you trust that from one day to the next they do not move everything and you are left with only one match in your hand?Personally I have always been skeptical about this type of product since they were born. And over the years I have witnessed several \"collapses\" and scandals in this sector.No, I honestly don't find it a good way to invest and protect/save my funds.",

Keeping stablecoin will be safer if what you are worrying about bear market yet its also not safe when it comes to inflation, confiscation or freezing by the companies that made it. So there's the scandal. Auditing is also a problem with stablecoins.",

When I say the word rest (earlier) what I mean is the stable coins such busd, usdc and dai. I don't mean ust and other algorithmic based stable coins because they are risky. All of them are collapsing now. Quote from: minairia3 on July 23, 2022, 02:40:12 PMI will tell you no, stablecoins are not good for long term holding and saving moneyFor hodling long term yes because they are stable. You can't get anything from them but you can always use them for staking and lending. The purpose of stable coin is not for hodling but they can be use to buy more coins later on, or when the price starts dipping. You can also use them like a money for paying and gambling.",

It is interesting to hear the opinion of the members of bitcointalkI was once not fond of stablecoins but after an experience where my crypto holdings crashed really hard, from $120k down to $12k, I learned that shifting them to stablecoins could have saved me from the crash.  So I can say, converting your holdings to stablecoins can preserve your crypto's current price value from a bear market price crash.",

However, it should be remembered that investing in any cryptocurrency involves risk. The safest stablecoins in my opinion are USDC and USDT, but I wouldn't keep everything in one stablecoin. I think it's best to diversify your money to at least two stablecoins.",

It is interesting to hear the opinion of the members of bitcointalkI suggest not to trust stablecoins that much, you have to learn from what happened to LUNA and probably, it can happen again. I’d rather hold with my BTC than to stablecoins honestly. If you want to save your money go with the banks but if you want to take the risk and you’re ready for that risk, go for Bitcoin instead. Once you are in cryptomarket, there’s no safe money here everything is at risk so better to be more wise on handling your finances and buy only the good coins.",

I had some UNI tokens which fell from 12 to about 3.9 of which I just have to use at that point in time, so I made a loss. I think if you have some future project which at moment the money is in some crypto other than stable coin, it is better to keep the money in stable coin to be sure you can execute the project at the appointed time, more so during the bear market to avoid being disappointed. I think it is wise to keep in some selected stable coins like DAI, USDT, BUSD, not in only one stable coin. However, for long term saving, Bitcoin is preferable, IMO. The LUNA & UST experience is a BIG lesson learnt in the crypto space.",

Apart from DAI, you also risk your money because the issuers (companies) of these stable coins can freeze them at any point even if it's in your non-custodial wallet. That's a pretty scary thought especially if you're trying to keep them for a very long time. So yeah, you have to put a complete trust on these companies that they do not do something that will destroy holders.Someone already touched up on staking stable coins. If you have no problem with the issues we've mentioned, you might as well stake them. Platforms like  mycointainer.com offers 10% annual return for USDT, USDC, and DAI.",
