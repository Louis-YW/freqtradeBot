      "body": "Bump, I was bookmarking this thread because I also wonder the same thing and like to hear someone's response.One thing I know for sure is that Monero is not incorporated with any governmental entity, especially the US. And also likely Zcash as far as I am concerned. The other project you mentioned, I did not know much about it. Looking a few years back, IRS has a bounty for someone to crack Monero transactions, but I don't know if it is still in effect, so it is highly unlikely for them to stand behind the government's backs. Regarding the subject, based on my observation it looks like the news hasn't covered an update yet again regarding the developer, so there is nothing much to know about the hearing case.",

These others are just developing protocols for confidential transactions and studying zero knowledge proofs. That's not illegal. On the other hand dealing with currencies that are used to escape regulations can be declared as illegal because of AML laws. But not yet as it doesn't really matter as long as you are converting it to fiat money you get to deal with regulators. And if they are not happy about your explanation where you got the money, they will just confiscate it.",

And that it is more likely that ETH has good potential at the government level. So the government did not allow such a mixer to operate and taught a lesson to the rest. Other private coins are of little interest, oddly enough.That's an unlikely reason. Some bitcoin mixers accused of money laundering were also shutdown by the authorities before.",

The attention it has got was extreme to the point that they've focused on it for that matter.Remember when Monero was delisted into exchanges in South Korea and also likely other offshore exchanges? It's because the eyes from that moment was only for Monero.I guess the government is doing a one-by-one step for tracking all of them down and can't do much things based on the resources they have.",

Do you really think the Tornado Cash developer can be considered criminal where in fact he just developing an open source tool?",

After all, it was a favorite place for hackers to launder money, and the amounts there were huge. Of the last major hacks where this mixer was used, we can recall the Ronin hack. Perhaps the too frequent mention of this service in the news related to the theft of funds was the reason for the regulators to pay close attention to it.",

Well there’s a lot of issue against Tornado and most probably it’s founder will have to face that issues legally or else he will be in jail for years to come. This is not a biased movement from the government, they are just implementing the law, better to file a case if you see the founder of Monero to be in jail which I think should have enough evidence.",
