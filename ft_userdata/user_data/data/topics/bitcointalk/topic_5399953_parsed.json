In fact investment should only be associated to stable coins like Bitcoins or some non/less volatile altcoins like Etherium and BNB. Although these coins too can also suffer dips time to time. But with there long time potential they have the ability to recover after every dips.But those volatile altcoins like Luna are just like gambling coins where one can loose everything but also has the ability to bring out quick gains. And this actually lead greedy people into pouring out all the income into it.Investment should only be on stable or less volatile coins only",

Altcoin is not the best choice for long term investment but just a speculative investment that is, get in at the right time and dumping them off at the right time too. I go with your opinion mate.",

I do agree the luna's case was decreasing the trust from the investors to the crypto but again this is luna team's fault. We can't judge the fault that already made by the team would be destroying the whole of market.

If you are expecting this to be less risky compared with another instrument and why should not you invest in the stable token? During the bearish market altcoin become even more volatile than before. I think that if you are aware about this and then you must also try to think if the more pain and more gain.

If altcoin can't become a good investment during the bearish market and why do people still buy altcoin instead of blue chip coin in the market like bitcoin? It's caused by when you are buying altcoins and it's possible to get more return compared with the bitcoin and another major coin. People in the altcoins are seeking for the big profit. If you are dealing with the big risk and you will be getting more profit. If you didn't wanna deal with the risk and why don't you go to the staking stable token?",

This event that we are experiencing now are normal. We are only in the bear season but sooner or later the bear can also end and the bull will take place, and that's the time the market will recover and rise.You might be new here, that's why you are still worrying but you should get used to this market, if ever you want to stay longer. As you know, this game is not for the faint hearted and for the person that don't have a big patience. Not all altcoins are like luna that is centralized and have a greedy team but most altcoins here are decentralized and are built with a good quality so yes you can always trust them.",

In this scenario, can we still trust a high and unpredictable volatile I investment such as altcoin in this bear season?I guess there are still some good solid projects that you can 'trust' and invest right now, specially in the top 5 or at least 10 altcoins. But remember, just invest what you can afford to lose as their is a huge risk involved.The Terra Luna might be the biggest bust of the year though and it  really put a lot of strain on the altcoin market. Nevertheless, since we are in a bear market, this might be the right now to invest because they are so cheap and then just HODL and wait for the next bull run and hopefully your invested money will multiply in the coming years.",

We have like nearly 20k coins/tokens in crypto these days and that's just in CMC/Coingecko, we have plenty that didn't get listed there as well.So, we should not be really believing all we see, because in over 20k+ projects, we only have like 20 really decent ones, I wouldn't invest into any other of them because I do not believe them to be that great. This is a big problem that we all have, and we should be very careful when picking any altcoins.",
