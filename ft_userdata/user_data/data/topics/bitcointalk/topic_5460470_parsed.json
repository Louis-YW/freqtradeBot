Presently na 820naira, things the on increase with addition of fuel increase, you can imagine wetin go na happen when naira enter 1k naira per dollar. Na murder be that nah. The funniest of it all be sae, civil servant salary remains the same, no salary increment for them and the FG no get plan to increase minimum wage. How are we to survive in this kind situation, where work no d, insecurity d, corruption na call of the day and those in power no care for the masses except for their pocket and family",

The price of fuel was increased by the marketers due to the increase in naira to dollar price in the parallel market. Since Nigerians, the marketers still refine their fuel out of the country, they’ll have to convert their naira to dollar to buy those products. Naira was diminishing against dollar, hence the increase in the price of petrol. I hope when naira appreciates again against dollar, we’ll see a decrease in petrol prices.Quote from: Yaqman01 on July 20, 2023, 06:32:28 PMSeriously, if Nigeria doesn't protest this time, it's a horrible situation, and no one should complain. Can you please acknowledge that even with our money, we are still hustlers?After all, no matter how we protest, they won’t change anything. This is not the time for protest but time to double our hustle and look for means to earn for ourselves since the government can’t do that for us now, you can’t be waiting forever. Even the government workers are still hustling, do you think their pay will cover for their expenses in this current economic situation? Don’t snooze now, work hard and pray for better days ahead for the country.",

The problem for we country today be say we dey consume more than we dey produce, we wholly depend on imported goods thereby increasing the demand for dollar. Nigeria needs to move from consumption into production, that way it will bring down the price of things and reduce the high cost of living that we are experiencing today as a result of inflation.",
