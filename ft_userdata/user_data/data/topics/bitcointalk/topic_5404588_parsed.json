The only thing he can provide is screenshot which might be fake and edited. I believe the buyer itself will not send the funds without escrow and checking the ownership of the domain.OP, you should try selling it on Bitcasino because the domain name has a resemblance to them and they might interested to use it as a proxy website.",

Someone who want to buy this domain must spend so much money and I guess it is not worth it for people who want to start a new casino as they can register a new domain which is cheaper than the old domain name.Maybe @OP needs to give another thing to attract potential buyer to buy his domain because if that is just a domain, people will think twice to buy it. But if the potential buyer really have a lot of money, that will not be a problem.",
