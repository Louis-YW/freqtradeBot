  "content": "This topic is about the phony \"Texas Bitcoin Foundation,\" which established in Richardson, Texas in November 2021 with the EIN number 87-3669781.Any information about it or its \"funders,\" Natalie Smolenski, Avik Roy and Blockstream advisor Tuur Demeester, should be posted here.Twitter handles:https://twitter.com/NSmolenskihttps://twitter.com/Avikhttps://twitter.com/TuurDemeesterThey \"website\" txbitcoinfoundation.org is littered with phrases like \"we will\" and other similar promises. To me looks like the Texas Bitcoin Foundation is a scam.",

They do not sell anything or promise return on investment or anything of that sort so I don't know how you got the impression that they are scam.",

I see people in casual clothes drinking coke & bear from a can and eating donuts.

      "body": "Now that you mention it, the \"Texas Bitcoin Foundation\" is actually working with the CHOLLA PETROLEUM INC, not the Texas State Technical College; they use the TSTC as a cover for their thriving OIL and GAS business while \"certifying\" Bitcoin miners.Cholla Petroleum Inc's CEO is Gideon O. Powell.Also, the \"programs\" that TSTC offers have nothing to do with Bitcoin education, but rather with training workers for Cholla Petroleum Inc, who want to mine Bitcoin and claim to be super sustainable by using a grid they own.My fart generates more green energy for Bitcoin mining than the criminals at Cholla Petroleum in Texas who have been fracking for years. https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2015/10/23/fracking-fears-surface-florida-panhandle/74464786/",
