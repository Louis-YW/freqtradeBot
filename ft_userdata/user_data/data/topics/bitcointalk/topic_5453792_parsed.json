The background colour in bingx is black but I think a white background would be better for me.. 1. Make a feedback/recommendation to BingX about a light mode.2. Try playing with the CSS (or install an open-source light mode forcing plugin).",

I will advise you to buy some screen protectors for your PC, and since you like trading with white, you can try reducing your screen brightness. Most of the PC screen protectors also come with color reduction, which will also be helpful. Or if one of those options won't be a better help, try to get yourself meditation blue-tick blue-ray glasses, which will also reduce eye contact with your PC.",

Some platforms does have their light mode on which background could really be changed up to white but if there's none then to minimize eye stress then you could really be having these options or you could check this one out https://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/irritated.htmHaving some Anti-rad glasses would really be good but basing up on the link given above is a good practice to make your eyes not able to have that stress.If you dont like to follow those things above then you can simply look for another platform because if we do speak about platforms which does havewhite background charts then there are several ones and im assure of that.It is really just that according into your own preference but personally saying thati do prefer black backgrounds than white.",

You have to visit a Ophthalmologist and get special advice for your eyesight issue.Generally you can find preventive solutions for your computer, screens and your eyes like wearing blue anti-light glasses. I know it is inconvenience for people who have never wear glasses. You can spend more budget for better screen which has less blue light.QuoteAlso is there a way to change the background colour in bingx when trading? The background colour in bingx is black but I think a white background would be better for me.. Exchanges usually have two modes: Light and Dark modes. If BingX does not have Dark Mode, ask them to add it.Alternatively you can install extensions but use them with risk awareness.https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/dark%20mode?hl=enhttps://github.com/darkreader/darkreader (open source)",

Trading itself is flexible, you can be a short-term or long-term trader, but it doesn't matter. What matters is what you know about your trading style and how you put it into use to earn you consistent income.So, if you are such that has issues with your eyes, you might want to avoid the short-term trading that would be causing you to stare too much at the screen. While those with minimal effect could still reduce their PC's light to the lowest just as I always do. Eyewear is another good option, the recommended or shaded ones should be able to stop the blue ray that often affects the eyes.",

      "body": "Hey there! When it comes to combating Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) while trading, a few tips can definitely help. First, make sure you have proper lighting in your trading environment. Avoid glare on your screen by positioning your monitor away from direct light sources. Secondly, take regular breaks and give your eyes some rest. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This helps reduce eye strain. Lastly, consider using blue light filters or glasses that can minimize the harmful effects of blue light emitted by screens. Now, about changing the background color in bingx, unfortunately, I'm not familiar with that specific platform. But you might want to explore the settings or preferences section to see if there's an option to customize the background. Happy trading!",

It is better for you to see your doctor, it is probably nothing but it is better to discard that possibility as soon as possible, now assuming there is in fact nothing wrong with your eyes then maybe you could buy a monitor which can reduce the blue light that emits or you could also wear special glasses which filter this light.Finally you could try to modify the way those websites are displayed, while this will require some level of knowledge about coding, it is not something that hard to do once you learn how to do this.",

Salmons, oysters, sweet potatoes, broccoli are a few examples. You should also avoid engaging in habits or eating any food that has the ability to make the condition worse.",

I'm prone to eye strains whenever I stare on my monitor/tab/phone in an hour or two and this setup greatly helped me - I rarely get eye strains after this. Couple times it happend are when I was already sitting for 10 hours and above.Similar to you, I wasn't fond of pure black dark themes like bingx. I'm not sure what happened but after a few weeks or so, I think I got used to it and did not mind it as much as before.",

When it comes to the body and the organs, their efficiency is reduced by age and you need to understand this. Your age matters to how effective your eyes will be because at older age you can find it difficult reading through letters that are smaller and far from you and as you stay closer to the system while trading, it gets worsen. So you need to reduce the brightness of your computer and go to the eye doctor for prescription on eye glass that is appropriate for your eyes.",
