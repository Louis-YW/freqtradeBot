  "content": "cttoDate: May 13, 2023Venue: TBAI think this title fight deserves a dedicated thread for us to discuss the boxers involved.With the series of upsets by a non so popular Filipino boxers, i think this one we should not miss. Vincent Astrolabio will go against Moloney for the vacant WBO bantamweight title, the latter chooses this path as he thinks that this is an easier path to a title rather than facing Nonito Donaire for that WBC version.But we know how risky it is if you are facing a Filipino pug, especially on this stage because we all know that Filipino boxers will bring their all just to win this fight.Current odds: Moloney 1.72   Astrolabio 2.00Bookies though that this is almost an even fight with the odds they are releasing.What do you think of this fight guys?https://www.boxingscene.com/jason-moloney-vincent-astrolabio-wbo-title-fight-13-co-feature-alimkhanuly-butler--173289",

Jason is a good technical fighter but in his fight against Inoue, Inoue just eats his punch he has no respect for Moloney's power, if Astrolabio can take his punches he is in big trouble.Moloney's chin is a big suspect here, this is going to be an exciting fight because both fighters are not afraid to engage.Based on the article Astrolabio opted to fight Moloney instead of Rodriguez because Rodriguez is a tough fighter to deal with than Moloney, his team has a good decision to fight Moloney but they still have to train Astrolabio hard, even if they think their chances are good. QuoteAstrolabio and Rodriguez were ordered to enter talks for a title fight that seemed all but certain to make its way to the schedule.Astrolabio’s team instead fancied a shot at Moloney in the second official bantamweight title fight in the post-Inoue era. Fittingly, first up is the April 16 vacant WBA title fight between Takuma Inoue—Naoya’s younger brother—and Liborio Solis in Tokyo.",

      "body": "Might be better to give a Filipino again a good chance against Moloney. We all know that Tapales recently upset Akhmadaliev, so I wouldn't be surprised if a fellow Filipino will pull another big win here.Jason Moloney is good no doubt, but he shouldn't underestimate Astrolabio here. Sure Vincent might not have a good resume, but he has the heart and the power as his last two fights were in a knockout win. And I agree that Moloney chin is not that good, and for sure, he will be tested by Astrolabio and see if he will hold or will be broken into pieces.",

      "body": "I will be rooting for the underdog here and this will be a good opportunity for Vincent Astrolabio to become a champion at 118. It might be a tough close fight but I believe he can do it because talking about chances, he got literally got a decent chance on upsetting the favorite because Jason Moloney doesn't really have anything special within him.And it's quite funny for me because out of all boxers that are inside the WBO's top 10 at 118, he picked Astrolabio who is ranked #2 and is a fellow countryman of Nonito Donaire. I'm sensing that Moloney might've another reason why he chose Astrolabio, but anyway, as I said, Astrolabio got a decent chance in cracking Moloney..",

      "body": "Moloney is advantageous in this fight;record and KO percentage. But Astrolabio would be more eager I guess for being in lower ranking also this fight could open a bigger spotlight for his career. Vincent is from the same country I was born with but Jason has the edge in this fight if we would base on their previous fights. What's nore likely to happen is a victory by means of KO simply because of their fighting styles. Both has power in their punches which could knock each other cold if it would be precised. However, I'd probably not bet on this one simply because odds of winning bet is close with the other outcome which I think is risky. I'd rather enjoy this fight as a fan to enjoy how this match up would end.",

Nonito has moved as well, Richard Schaefer bolted out of Probellum already.And with that Moloney chooses to go on the other direction, but still have the chance to fight for the belt. However, he might still choose the wrong path as he will be facing another Filipino, maybe not as big as Nonito Donaire's name, but equally impressive fighter and rising in the ranks as well in Vincent Astrolabio. So he shouldn't feel the any advantage here, on the other hand, this could be as tough as facing Nonito because Vincent has power. So clearly, I will have Vincent here by ML since he is a slight underdog in this fight. He just need to really focus and train 100% and let's see if we will have another Filipino champion, following Tapales big win just 4 lbs higher division.",

Though in terms of talent/skill, Vincent is a little lower to that of Moloney but with that Filipino heart and against the odds, i have high hope that this would be another upset in the making.I'm waiting for how much we will win if we bet for Astrolabio via KO/TKO, that would be juicy i think.",

But once he matured, his career really took off and his last 3 wins is very impressive indeed, that's why now he has that opportunity to level up and become a champion in the bantamweight. And as what others mentioned, do not underestimate Filipinos as they might look weak or something, but they can deceived their opponents.On the other hand, although Moloney has face tough opponents, he always feel short. Meaning he could not be in the caliber of elite fighters in bantamweight, more of a gate keeper boxer.",

This has been the case for a long time, but it is no longer the case.In the Philippines, there are a lot of things that go on in the media, like political correctness, fake news, etc. The most popular shows are the ones that have nothing to do with politics, but are a part of the entertainment industry.So, you can see that there is a lot of hype going on in the media, but that is not enough to get people to pay attention to the fights and make a judgement based on what is going on in the media.I am going to try to answer your questions in a way that you can understand, and I hope this will help you in your decision.1. How much money do you have to pay to get a fight?2. What is the difference between boxing and boxing-related fights?3",

But I would like to add that Moloney's defeat against the Japanese monster will be a good thing in Astrolabio's camp as they will have a better understanding how to upset the favorite compared to the opposite camp where they have to dig old archives because Astrolabio's defeat was way back 2018 when the Filipino boxer was still in super-flyweight and I reckon that it's not really usable because Astrolabio has improved since that loss.",
