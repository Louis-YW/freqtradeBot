And here is where the employment level comes into place.So, I'm sure that everyone knows Europe is doomed, we're out of gas, 90% of our companies are bankrupt, we've frozen to death last time, our GDP is down by 99%, the euro is worthless and we have eaten our last hamster but in reality:Europe has broken all 20 years' records, in both the lowest unemployment level and in the percentage of citizens employed.And it doesn't stop here, from 10 years ago in 2013 the number of people with a job has grown from 181 million to 197 million, that's 18 million more workers and jobs in a decade!On top of that, we have to add to this 3.5 million work permits issued this year for foreigners that want to work in this craphole called EU.Can't wait to see the usual Russian muppets trying to twist this as being bad!",

There have already been a lot of throw-ins about \"total bankruptcy\", \"terrible unemployment\" and almost \"total decline in the standard of living in Germany\". Fortunately, the fans of such throw-ins do not understand what the German economy is, and how uncritical the impact of the changes in the hydrocarbon supply to the German economy really is. By the way, from this area, yesterday there was also news about a noticeable decrease in the unemployment rate in the USA. This is connected with the global process of migration of high-tech production from China to the USA.",

How many are making 1000$ a day?How many can make that constantly each day all year long ?Also, 100$ per day for a self-employed person in the EU...is...surviving! We're talking about 90 euros a day in 20 working days that's 1800 euros, while the average wage in Germany after taxes is 2600 euros. Double that at 200 a day and you can't even reach the median wage.",

You can get a job next hour!Of course, if you don't know how to do anything other than loading merchandise into boxes or washing plates it will be a crappy job that barely lets you get though, but if you know how to drive a truck or to weld or you know which cable goes into each socket without starting a fire you're set.

There were also predictions that the European economy will collapse because of the gas and oil crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but it has continued to grow stronger.
