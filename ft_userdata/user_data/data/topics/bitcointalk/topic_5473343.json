I remember a time I was new to trading, I traded bitcoin with leverage and I lost so much.Yup.. Trading with leverage is very risky. Especially if I do it on altcoins, I'm not exaggerating but that's the reality, this is also based on my experience like yours too. Even though Bitcoin experiences an increase in price, not all altcoins will experience the same thing, there are alts that rise, there are alts that go sideways and there are also alts that experience a decline in price. There are several factors that cause things like this, especially when it comes to altcoins. Projects and their progress can influence prices, not to mention if Bitcoin dominance is very high, a pump and dump in Bitcoin can shake Altcoins even more severely. My advice is the same as yours, it's safer to switch Bitcoin and just buy and hold. It is better and safer than trading with leverage. Don't forget to eliminate stress, throw away thoughts of revenge so that your mental health returns and your emotions don't control your trading or investment behavior.",

Features trading is not for everyone and very risky. You must learn the skills before attempting to do it. What I will suggest is buying and holding Bitcoin for long else he will loose more. Long term hold is a safer way of making good money with little efforts. Now the price is low, not up to the ATH, imagine how explosive the rise will be when ETF is approved next year together with the Bitcoin halving... that will be a massive gain for those holding.",

Stop loss should be use to limit losses and not use to stop when the funds is almost depleted to zero. He should take a brake and learn more about trading fundamentals before he start trading again.I’m not sure his goal on this kind of stop loss that stops near almost liquidation price but he should learn how to hedge risk by setting it by percentage loss and not by feeling. I wouldn’t recommend to start again before taking a deep understanding on trading because he will suffer the same if he will use stop loss like this.Stop loss is crucial on crypto trading because the market is volatile which is brutal. When you have a position with tight liquidity margin. Your friend should learn how to setup stop loss and use a proper leverage to not suffer this kind of losses in the future.",

Maybe he should stick to Bitcoin though as we all know that altcoins is more volatile so it's hard to make money out of it as in just matter of hours, it could flip.Quote from: Wakhid Mukti on November 08, 2023, 12:33:03 PMAnd I suggest that if it starts again, it's best to just play Bitcoin and don't play with too many different types or play too many altcoins.

Bitcoin could be a good practice for him specially if he is a beginner in trading. And just like what I said previously, trading is not for everyone. It might take years for others to make great money as it will take a lot of time in your part to learn this craft. So he might reset everything and see where his mistakes.",

Request your friend to take some time off from crypto and then start fresh with clear mind. Trust me he can achieve whatever he has lost if he follows certain future trading discipline and he should start with Bitcoin with a maximum leverage of 10x not more than that because Bitcoin is one of the safest asset for future trading which don't have sudden fluctuations, he should aim for multiple take profit of lesser amount, instead of waiting for more than 100% profit he should do 10 such trades of 10%. I have done this and achieved success but it will take some time and patience is the key here",

You should do freelance work or find higher salary jobs to increase your revenue. Then, work with larger capital and then time given in all this investment will be worth it. I think $150 is already huge to start trading as your capital, It is also good to start with that amount of money so you can gather experiences as well, cause imagine this you can't even make profits from your $150 so what would happen if you are trading with larger amounts right. It's not only about the capital as well, these days you could already call anyone who's investing in this industry short-term as a trader, but without sufficient knowledge and skills, it would be just a waste of money. But you are right, it's much better if you have extra funds when you are trading so if you learn from a current mistake, you can make a comeback. If you already know that you can't really profit from short-term investment or trading, just go to long-term and you can start with the DCA method.",

If your friend followed the right course before starting trading he should be aware of the risk involved in it and the market is not always favorable all days so he should expect that there are days he will make loss. He probably is making wrong decisions and not using the right strategy. If he is so uncomfortable with losing while trading then it would be best for him to invest and hodl rather than trading. Be it alts or Bitcoin i think he is not ready for trading yet. Bitcoin trading is just as risky as alt coins trading but the only difference that bitcoin is more stable than altcoins. The probability of altcoins providing greater profits is still the same as them providing greater loss because of their high volatility than bitcoin. I would suggest your friend quit trading and hold bitcoin instead.",

My friend dared to take a long position in several altcoins with capital of $150, and after hitting a stop loss the remaining funds were $12.Generally, we know trading is really risky, and the chances of you losing money is kind of high. From your post, I can say your friend is not yet a professional trader. The first mistake that your friend makes is trading futures. I do say that future trading is not for beginners, if you are still learning how to trade, then just focus on spot trading and avoid future trading. We all know that sport trading is less risky than future trading, so it's better to trade on spot than trading futures. Your friend shouldn't have chosen altcoins, since he is trading futures, he can still do his analysis, and either long bitcoin or short bitcoin will have been better than altcoins, but generally, I don't support future trading.Quote from: Wakhid Mukti on November 08, 2023, 12:33:03 PMI told him to stop and close the entire position he had just made. I want my friend to stop for a moment to calm his mind and emotions so as not to add to the existing losses.If your friend didn't stop trading at the moment, I am sure your friend is going to lose the remaining $12 that is left, and after losing the $12, your friend is likely going to deposit more money, which he might end up losing everything again. Future trading is kind of addictive, it once happened to me. I was addicted to future trading, which i wasted a lot of money. I had to force myself to stop future trading. When you lose, you will want to keep on trading, trying to win back your loss. You will start increasing your leverage and the amount you are trading with just because you want to win back your loss.Quote from: Wakhid Mukti on November 08, 2023, 12:33:03 PMAnd I suggest that if it starts again, it's best to just play Bitcoin and don't play with too many different types or play too many altcoins.It's better your friend stop playing with altcoins and also stop playing with future trading. Those two things that I mentioned can easily wreck your friend, so it's better to avoid them and take a rest from trading for now. He should at least acquire more knowledge about trading.",

To build the experience,  quitting is not an option but applying the right approach which is to trade with the sole aim as a newbie to build experience and not for profit making for a start,  and until they become well skilled in trading then they can focus on profit making.

I also want to say that there will no risk,  but here the risk will be much lower than the short-term. So my suggestion will be for your friend first he should know the trading analysis and risk management then he can invest on Bitcoin for long-term with his lazy fund. But always should keep in mind that always invest as much as he can afford to lose. So suggest him, take a long term strategy with a proper DCA mangement/",

It is obvious your friend is very skilled in trading, if he was, he would have known how to set a stop loss and know not to use high leverage on futures. What you’ve told us is a newbie mistake in trading, a seasoned trader would not lose over half his capital on a trade. I suggest your friend takes a break to improve his trading skills before he starts trading again.",
