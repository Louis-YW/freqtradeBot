  "content": "Omo my people we need to be very careful this happened to me today this guy sent me bitcoin but before he sent it he asked me for my blockchain address,I sent it to him and after he sent me the bitcoin($300)and after few hours the bitcoin disappeared I tried texting the guy and I discovered I was blocked on WhatsApp I don’t really know how we can work on this to know some of this guys are scam they only want you to send money to them after that they block you,and this don’t only happen when they send bitcoin or usdt but they also convince you to credit you huge amount of bitcoin after you invest,these scams often involve fake websites, social media posts, or messages that encourage people to send their Bitcoin to a particular address, promising huge returns in a short period. It's important to exercise caution, do thorough research,I will advice us to be very careful not to be involved in such scam.",

If you have received a coin , how did it disappear from your account, go and check the explorer. Another question is that, did you use an exchange to Recieve it or a non custodial wallet. Did you take note of the logo of the coins sent to you?. Give us the full update of things, where did the coins appear at the first instant before disappearing.",

Because I'm sure what must have lured you to this is still what \"Adbitco\" said (i.e Greed), as those scammer were able to convince selling you BTC at a discounted rate, and you fell for it. So for me, the only advise I can give you and other newbies is to stop falling for people who claim to sell you BTC or USDT at a cheap price, as they are always scammers.

      "body": "I understand you clearly; they sent you $300 worth of fake BTC, and you have yet to send back the fiat worth based on your agreed price, right? If yes, then you have not yet been scammed, but you were almost scammed since you have not sent money over to the scammer. It will serve as a lesson to you to be careful about the kind of person you want to trade with next time.The rate at which small P2P exchanges are increasing these days is becoming alarming, as most of them are just out there to scam either the buyer or the buyer is out there to scam either the seller. I was added to a Telegram group a few months ago by an unknown contact; I don't know where they got my details from, which made me change my Telegram privacy settings. In their case, they were trading USDT on a price less than usual, where someone acts like an escrow and the other two people are buyers and sellers. After looking at how things are moving, I just realised it's just some kind of scam method that they want to use and scam victims who are too greedy and want to take advantage of the price difference.So I will advise you to be careful of whom you will want to buy something from next time in order for you not to fall victim to scammers. Next time it might come in a different way and method where you might not even realise it's a scam. We should all be careful in this crypto space because most people are just in it to milk the others. @Philpsticks Quotes within 24 hours are wrong.

The only way I see this happening is when a double spend is been done by the scammer but I no think na wetin happen so unless him send you fake website to use check the confirmation, I no believe say Bitcoin wey enter your own wallet go comot. Fake Bitcoin can't be sent on the main bitcoin network, so must be an alternative network. Make we dey always use the right block scanners to avoid all this yahoo boys tricks dem. No believe any investment platforms wey dey dem try sell you because Investing in Bitcoin can only be done through buying and trading or hodling.
