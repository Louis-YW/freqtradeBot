  "content": "I was sent an email today that Kucoin users can use wire transfer to send money. What I know about wire transfer is that someone from aborad can use it to send foreign currencies to you in Nigeria. This is why it can be useful on Kucoin to send foreign currencies to your Nigeria account. One of the reason I hate it is the time it would take before the money would be sent to you, it can take two weeks or more, although those are free wire transfers.Kucoin wire transfer will take 3 to 5 business working days. The withdrawal fee is 80 USD.The parallel market rate is getting higher than the I&E windows. Wire transfer will use I&E windows which is another reason this is not a good alternative at all.",

If that is what you meant, you are correct. With CexP2P, there is no fee. This may differ from one exchange to another but the centralized exchanges that I have used before, it has no fee.

If you are the type that is using the exchange to withdraw, there are better options. The best that I have seen is OKX if you want lower withdrawal fee. I still also prefer Bybits and Binance.About wire transfer, if Binance will support it, likely it would be of high fee as well. CexP2P that I know do not charge any fee for P2P.",

Do not get this wrong. The KucoinP2P have no transaction fee, just like BinanceP2P which is also CexP2P. What I am just surprised about is that Kucoin can send such email of wire transfer of $80 fee which will use I&E window or CBN rate which is just stupidity when we have CexP2P and P2P.Quote from: Asiska02 on August 09, 2023, 11:15:54 PMIf this transaction goes through from the bank registered with them.

      "body": "This service is likely not to be used by many people because of its drawbacks. I wonder who will pay the $30 fee just for top-up first and will still have to wait 5 days for processing, after which the user will still spend the $80 fee for withdrawal and still wait an extra 5 days for the process to complete. That's about a week and some days. So, despite this high transaction fee, if they can't even make the deposit and withdraw to be instantly, then what's the need for such a feature?      Even the 3-4% bank charge for international transfers is far less than the charge Kucoin is taking for this wired transfer, and for bank international transfers, the transaction is smart in some cases, depending on the bank. Although the bank says it takes 1–5 days, but ones I have carried out, even before 24 hours, the transaction has been successful.This new service is just rubbish, as you said, @OP.",

It means that Kucoin will help you convert your crypto to your local currency and send it to your bank account. In this way the bank would know that you are using crypto apart from Kucoin. This is what I understand that wire is on this. If it isn't done this way then it will be a problem to the person because the banks will know that you are using crypto and can lead to freeze of account. The delay is annoying but I know that if it is a normal bank wire it takes three working days.",
