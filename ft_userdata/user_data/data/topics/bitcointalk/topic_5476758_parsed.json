Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code, Inscriptions bypass this limit.This bug was recently fixed in Bitcoin Knots v25.1. It took longer than usual due to my workflow being severely disrupted at the end of last year (v24 was skipped entirely).Bitcoin Core is still vulnerable in the upcoming v26 release. I can only hope it will finally get fixed before v27 next year.",

This has been a major issue right from the beginning, and this issue is just for those who still don't want to realise that all this NFT, ordinal, and any form of token that could be generated as a result of this is just value based on the hype that the creator can be able to give to it; it's really not worth it, but yet people find it convincing to invest millions over a piece of work that really doesn't have a real value attached to it just because they are called NFT or just because they are under the bitcoin network does not make it valuable. Very soon, many people who are rushing to buy and hold these ordinary tokens will soon be crying out loud, just like those who are already filing a lawsuit against CR7 for the NFT they bought due to its being promoted by him.Quote However, we absolutely should not be censoring transactions.

If censorship is the only option that could be used to defeat this ordinal madness, then it's not an option at all, as it will make bitcoin not different from altcoins, which are centralised and holders funds can be frozen withheld or whatever word could be used, but it means users not having access to their funds as a result of it being censored. We now have someone to decide if our coins are clean or not, and if they don't like it, they can just block it from passing through.

      "body": "The title of the topic is a bit misleading.What Luke said is that they will work to correct a vulnerability that allow inscriptions to bypass extra data limit configured in the Bitcoin Node software.That means that if the inscription contains data that is bellow the limit configured in the nodes, they will be relayed and mined, if they pass the size limit, they will not be relayed by nodes and therefore will have lower chances to be mined.The idiots that create Inscriptions have an option, though. They can negotiate with miners to increase their group limit size and relay between themselves until that miner/mining pool finds a block and mine their shitcoins/shittokens. -------What that implies is, if most of the nodes set an extra data limit very low, it will prevent Inscriptions from been relayed and mined, but that would be a choice of the majority node runners. And that is amazing, cause that is how it should work.If the majority of node runners organize and configure their nodes to avoid Inscriptions, that's it, no discussion, the network came to consensus and decided.QuoteMiners are making money from transactions and to solve this, a proposal might be proposed. If proposed in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, did you think that miners will agree? Remember that miners have their own nodes. I do not think any mining pool will agree to this when they are making more money from transactions.Miners do have heavy weight in those kinds of decisions, node runners throughout the network also have. If node runners decide to lower their extra data size limit, but miners keep their limit high, it would still increase the difficulty to Inscriptions to be relayed and get to a miner.-------Bitcoin Blockchain space is scarce enough for serious Financial transactions and real world settlements, artificially increasing mining fees with these spams only make things more difficult and noisy. The solution proposed by Luke in his post is too soft, in my opinion a more radial proposal should be raised to avoid kids playing with Blockchain space, otherwise the purpose of Bitcoin is at risk.There is no efficient second layer solution for micro-payments yet, the mining fees as they are now is prohibitive for people to loading their Lightning wallets without paying 10$ to get some money in there.I think those idiots exploiting the blockchain and Taproot to create shitcoins and shit tokens and shit 80's looking images should be blocked as soon as possible and Bitcoin used for its main purpose which is to be A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System",
