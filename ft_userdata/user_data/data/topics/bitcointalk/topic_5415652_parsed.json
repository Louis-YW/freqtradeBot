You will have to buy another copper membership for this account if you want to post images.On the other hand, it would be better if the other account has been around for a while, and you want to get customers to say which one it is or point it out with a neutral tag. Nobody is going to hire a newbie that nobody knows and who doesn't speak English well to manage bounties.",

Since you already know about posting images and copper member possibilities (I assume this is your alt account), why don't you pay for that membership? So your ANN threads will look completely different. Who wants to pay you for opening a topic, where the images are actually just URLs?if you really want to manage bounty campaigns, you have to put in more effort.",

But for having that account which cannot post a picture with no experience show I doubt you can get one here.To avoid misconceptions about your main intention better use one account and build a reputation since from that more projects will came plus no one will think about how shady you are.",
