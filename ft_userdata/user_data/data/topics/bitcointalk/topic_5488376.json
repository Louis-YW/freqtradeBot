The Bitcoin network is mostly about anonymity and optimum privacy. so I see no reason why any person who knows a person that was into Bitcoin mining during early times of the likes of 2010 and 2011 should disclose such crucial info.Incase you don't know , block rewards at that time was massive compared to now therefore miners that still hodl from that period are theoretically whales and disclosing themselves puts them at great risk.Besides what are you looking to do with such information?",

In that case, you might want to use https://ninjastic.space/search to look for old post. Otherwise, you might want to ask your question on different Bitcoin or WoW community.",
