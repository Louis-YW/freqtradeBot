      "body": "It's generally inadvisable to use a network share for your Bitcoin Core data directory. Bitcoin Core does a lot of disk I/O and it depends on files existing on disk where it expects them to be and at all times. Since networks are not always reliable, any hitch in the network can cause Bitcoin Core to crash unexpectedly and possibly corrupt the data in its data directory. You just shouldn't try doing that.",

      "body": "Also, SMB connections tend to close unexpectedly. And I have tried to get samba shares to automount during boot but it was only after I mounted the shares manually that I was able to access the files inside. Of course, part of it might have been because of my use of Kerberos (because it is, you know, a network share), but even if that concern is excluded, SMB read and write speeds are horribly slow, much slower than HDD drives.",
