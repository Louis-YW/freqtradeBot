The truth is that BRICS is a quite heterogeneous organization with inner disagreements and problems among the members, while they continue to be that way it will be unlikely for them to face the USA and the European Union to change the balance of power on the planet. Also, these kinds of arrest threats do not have much sense, they are a symbolic measure so people who are against the war can exclude Putin from visiting their countries and do not deal with the Russian State, etc. We all know that Putin being arrested is a very far away possibly, even if he visited South Africa, the authorities and diplomacy there would think twice before doing something.",

It is just diplomacy in action, but it certainly sends the message very clearly: Stay in Russia, China, North Korean and Iran. All the rest... well, at your own risk.Honestly, arresting Putin would not be a good idea. He has achieved for NATO what they could not ever have dreamed of.",

Yes he was very interesting in attending, Putin is in dire need of international recognition and would have liked to have a picture with the \"block opposing the US\". Now that I think of it, I wonder what short of indirect route would have Putin's plan follow to get there avoiding the air space of all signatories of the treaty that may put him in jail.There has been no attempt on Putin's life, that is a lie from the official propaganda. Putin was not in the Kremlin when the drones struck near the flag (if you are referring to that as an \"attempt\"). It is nearly impossible to kill anyone other than by mistake doing such a thing.Yes, I am sure he likes the heads up, as South Africa appreciates that he has installed Zoom in his computer, so that they do not have to arrest him and create a problem for themselves.Quote from: yhiaali3 on May 04, 2023, 10:32:14 AMI believe that the arrest warrant is primarily a moral matter[...]They know that they cannot bring Putin by force [...]They cannot bring Putin to justice for now.
