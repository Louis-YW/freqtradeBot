Sorry for the newbie question. Thanks!SSHave you tried to import that privatekey to other native litecoin wallets? I haven't used litecoin in ages but i am guessing most of them have an option to import a private key like in every native crypto wallet out there. Just remember use a wallet that litecoin community recommends so you don't get your wallet drained by some scam wallet.",

But if you have the private key, I suggest you try to just import the key into a known Litecoin wallet, for example, the Electrum-LTC. If it is recognized, then it's good. If not, then you gotta find out what kind of file/key you currently had.",

I will try to export to another recommended wallet and see.Have you tried to import it? If you had, trying it out on another wallet will likely have similar results. I suggest you use Electrum-LTC to test it out. I don't know much about Litecoin's private key characteristics. I have tried to generate a wallet on liteaddress.org, it seems there are four popular formats for LTC private keys, the examples are as follows:Private Key WIF51 characters base58, starts with a '6'6vNaLdpupbtZc8YLnqsWhwpLArBtj7VCqubHCwoCzkiCQpAXvNpPrivate Key WIF Compressed52 characters base58, starts with a 'T'T8aE9fYU96zav4HLMLhx7iwucU75JsdVGs8JXirwwuvqMfaS1XxQPrivate Key Hexadecimal Format (64 characters [0-9A-F]): A4BFB9504C0A839EC1D15493C34346E0119B679EB68B39367BC9F8A60C8933E0Private Key Base64 (44 characters): pL+5UEwKg57B0VSTw0NG4BGbZ562izk2e8n4pgyJM+A= Though, note that there are still other formats.",
