Second, I don't have that much Bitcoin worth gifting to anyone I love. Now, I do appreciate what you have just done and I am sure that your wife is a happy wife as she now realized that you think she is valuable enough to be worthy of your trust...and of course, love. I am wishing both of you 100 years of happiness and abundance - you deserve each other and may your family increase by a hundredfold.",

You must teach her to do this and importance of wallet seed, private key and backup. Tell her that if she does not have any backup, she can lose her bitcoin anytime.She can create a new wallet, sweep Bitcoin from the current wallet to a new one if she does not want to keep it in a wallet you created for her.",

Have any of you gifted bitcoin to a wife like me?It's amazing of you to keep your promises, and it was best for you to have a wife who believes in bitcoin as well. However, I think some wives would prefer a surprise giftâsay, a carâthat they can immediately put to use rather than holding onto bitcoin for such a long time. You did a great thing by giving her gold as she requested because you can't just give her bitcoin to hold for a long time some wives may be feeling something or sell it without you knowing because they don't prefer it. As for me, it wasn't a bad thing to gift a wife bitcoin as a surprise, but I would rather do something else, get her something physically not all our women will like holding bitcoin if even they have heard the name before.It seems really ideal to gift a wife bitcoin, but in this case, if it were me, I would use the money to get her into a business because it is the greatest thing i can do. We all did what was best for us, and you did the best for your marriage. I didn't think you would actually be able to fulfill your promise when I first saw your post a few months ago about giving your wife half of your investment, but you went on to do the right on it.",

Good luck with holding and your marriage.I recently learned the reason behind that. Women will do anything for the man of their lives, even learning about Bitcoin. Without interest, no one will allocate the time to learn and understand about it unless the girl is really into it or someone who is really important to them, like their husband/lover, is into Bitcoin. Women are something as they will do everything so they can get much closer to their man and understand the likes of each other. I also saw that show, having not a single idea about Bitcoin and choosing $100 over it. The reason as I said, they are not interested in Bitcoin. They only know how to have fun without thinking about investment. There might be someone supporting them financially. Also, my message to OP,Good thing you found someone who chooses to understand and learn what you do. It's a good start to have an investment and you both discussed it. It is really uncommon and really inspiring.",
