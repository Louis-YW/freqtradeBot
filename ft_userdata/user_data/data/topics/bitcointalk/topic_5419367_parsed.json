You can change your vote, of course only up until the contest ends.  IMPORTANT NOTES:Once the 7 days is up, the voting will end, but the final results will possibly not be the actual tallies/winners until Theymos comes in and implements a few things to make the voting more fair.  Those things are, as stated by Theymos..“ 1) only Member+ votes will count, where copper membership does not on its own count as Member; and 2) users who haven't made a post in the year between the time of this post and 1 year ago will not be counted\".In the unlikely case of a tie, we'll run another poll which will be set to run for 3 days.No manipulation of any kind allowed. If I see you trying to manipulate the votes in any way, I reserve the right to disqualify you. Please no alt-accounts, no begging for votes etc.",

After all this is the first time a pumpkin contest has ever been held in this forum though the turn up were amazing  but we hope the next one will be better.",

I’ve reached out to Theymos so he can put the finishing touches on the results, so stayed tuned for the winners to be revealed!  (Please note moving day comes for me tomorrow (lucky me lol), so my communication may be limited over the next couple of days)",
