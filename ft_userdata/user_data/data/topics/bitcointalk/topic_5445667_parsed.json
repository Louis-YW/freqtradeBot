  "content": "Xi Jiping the China president is on a two days visit in Moscow ,Russia. This is his first visit to Russia since after Russia invaded Ukraine. His visit is a sign of love and care on Russia,because China has beings in good business relationship with Russia after the sanction of Russia from international business dealings. Xi peng also want to know the present state of the country and the ongoing war. I think will make the US government and other countries to suspect China in assisting Russia with the supply of weapon to continue with the war.Therefore, Xi Jinping needs to be very careful with his dealings with Russia,so that this will not cause an alarm or lead to sanction of China companies operating in the US. Russia economy is one-tenth that of China presently and China is a good ally of Russia. From my own perspective, don't you think that China president might be the only one who can talk to Vladimir Puttin to bring the war to an end.",

I just wonder what the consequence of this meeting will be especially since the recent ICC judgement on Putin declaring a war criminal.",

I just wonder what the consequence of this meeting will be especially since the recent ICC judgement on Putin declaring a war criminal.America might be the most economic powerful nation in the world, but there are other powerful nations and China is one of them. Both the US and China depends on each other for certain goods and services so both nations can sanction each other. During the sanction war between Trump and Xi, both nations suffered adverse effects. it is also important to know that China have gradually reduced its investment in the US and America have also done the same. China is pushing to get trade partners from Africa and the Middle East. While America have relocated most of her industries back home or other countries close to China. China, Russia, US and some other nations like Egypt, Iran, Israel and Sudan are not signatories to the Rome Statute which means that the the ICC have no jurisdiction over the nationals of these nations. China sees Russia is its biggest allies because both of them must stay together to survive. They need each other to support or block vote based on their personal interest in the United Nations.",

I don't think so, and that's the same with China when they're placing some disputes yet they can't make China bow down to them and follow the orders. Well, just having these two allied countries make them already one of the biggest alliances in today's time, and AFAIK, they're also allied with North Korea. I just don't want to see another war happening.Quote from: Queentoshi on March 20, 2023, 03:05:42 PMI do not think that the Chinese president is concerned about what other countries especially the United States thinks.

Kishida told Zelenski that his country will support Ukraine in humanitarian service,rebuilt of infrastructure and medical care. This is the first time Japan prime minister will go on a visit a country in war without announcing his visit.

That’s why the government is printing money and handing it to their friends by the truckload. They know the dollar’s time is running out and are trying to get the most out of it before then that they can. Have to hand it to the Biden crime family and its handlers (Victoria Nuland, her Russiaphobe husband, Anthony Blinken etc) they are pretty clever. By extension some powerful democrats with the backing of Judenrat George Soros are included in this mix of Nazi related crimelords.They managed to rope the entire west into thinking that Trump was the one who would start World War 3 when that was the exact thing on their minds to do all the time.The projection is easy to see in hindsight.3-4 years ago the American president was meeting the North Korean, Russia, Chinese, Saudi leaders etc, had mutual respect, an understanding, a peaceful outlook for the entire world.Fast forward to 2023 the Biden crime family has managed to completely isolate the west from the rest of the world (can only imagine why the UK and EU are behaving like pathetic lapdogs, is there is \"something\" in it for the criminal banker leaders such as Rishi Sunak and Ursula Von Der Lies). They've done this through forcing policies on the west and terrorism (Nordstream sabotage). Just look back at the ridiculous angry outburst Biden gave during the state of union address \"Name me one leader who wants to be like Xi Jinping, NAME ME ONE!\" Xi, who then went onto broker peace between Saudi and Iran! Madness, that the media (I admit it's mostly propaganda but stil...) didn't point out either the sheer stupidity of Biden or the sheer evilness or is it both?Endless sanctions placed on the rest of the world and money printing are making the western citizens poor through inflation.BUT there is some fight back.I think the pro farmer party winning at the senate elections in the Netherlands may be a turning point in indicating that the citizens have had enough of WEF style imperialist policies, which under the cloak of \"net zero / climate change / covid overreaction / Putin is Hitler / China is bad Mmkay / pro transgenders & dragqueens in classrooms / whatever\" are trying to destroy the family unit, farmers and most of all: economic freedoms.Just because Biden thinks it is the 1960s, doesn't mean the citizens of the west want to return to that era.Also, the further down this rabbit whole we go with de-Dolarisation, the more Bitcoin will be the only remaining economic lifeboat left for the west.The citizens of the west and Bitcoin will eventually help to turn this ship around I reckon.Hopefully the Biden crime family and its friends will end up in The Hague eventually.",

But ten years is long enough to go the other way as well.It took the US banking cartel over 100 years to...Build Biden up so that he could destroy America and bring chaos to the world in two years...After it took Trump 4 years to bring peace to America and the world.It would probably be wise of Putin and Xi to remain friends to better stand up against US Imperialism.",

But the problem with Biden is his family loves to dabble in dodgy business in which his son is the beneficiary of lucrative Chinese business deals. The Chinse know this.

Because of this, he cannot simply ask Putin to withdraw the soldiers and ignore the whole thing.He may try to push some ideas for the future into Putin's head before telling him not to go further with the invasion.It is still unlikely Putin would accept, tho. The political cost would be huge to his image.",
