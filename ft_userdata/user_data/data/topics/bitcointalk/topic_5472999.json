From the  article the test was first carried out June this year which it was predicted that the price will get to $45k by the end of the 2023 year, and on the 3rd of this month of November 2023 another query test was carried out using 6 different AI chatbots to inquire what the price of bitcoin could be by end of the year and they all gave predictions that points to $45k at most. And the most intriguing thing about this which caught my attention is that it was same price prediction range it gave sometime June this year when the first test was conducted.QuoteFour months ago, Bitcoin.com News engaged with six generative AI chatbots, prompting them to forecast bitcoin’s value at the close of 2023. The collective consensus of these AI systems anticipated BTC to land between $40,000 and $50,000 by the conclusion of the year. With the year now winding down to its final two months, we repeated the experiment. The updated predictions from the AI chatbots have arrived slightly more conservative than the June estimates.So I decided to bring it to the forum to know about what other forum members think about this AI prediction. Is it a prediction you can rely on or it's just one of those common bitcoin  price predictions of the decade we are used to from different angles, is there anything special about this one .",

Those AIs are also using information from the past price history of Bitcoin to make their predictions. The fact that those AI predicted $45k doesn't mean it's very accurate; it's still speculation, just like humans have always speculated. Nothing special. The AI is not speaking with a guarantee that Bitcoin must get to $45k before December 31. When we speculate about prices, it sometimes doesn't work like that because the market is not in our control. The same is applicable to AI; they don't control the market.",

Just imagine what can happen if another ETF-related positive news appears online again. I guess if it's Blackrock related again then it might push the price up even more.Bitcoin during the final months of the year usually is going up, so these AI's just based their prediction on the past movements of Bitcoin.

If six different AI chatbots should make similar result then it's something to watch out for, even as that if any one decides to run analysis and study of the market on his own he's still going to make use of past bitcoin historical chart to guide him to conclusion, similar way these AI followed in gathering the information to arrive to the $45k prediction.

We are already that 2 months left for this year on which it is really that short already and if we do really trying to look into the price movement then it is really that too hard to tell that we could be able to reach that but if we do have that kind of positive news then it might be possible but it seems that it is really not able to reach out that point but well who knows?
