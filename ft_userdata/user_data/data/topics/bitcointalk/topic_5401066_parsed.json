I think the OP is confusing these two remotely different thingsThe first one is like checking a device whether it is running or not. The second one is predicting whether the device will run for the next two years or not.Hence if an audit is giving good results, it should not be reason to invest. Scams always exist in this market and to avoid that you need to learn how to check the background of the people behind the project, dig out information that they are not giving away, check their whitepaper and see if the project is actually feasible in the mainstream market - most are not.",

I would also like to invest in something, but I have not decided what. But I understand that for this, I need a very good investment plan. All my friends invest in different fields and have a very high income, and besides, they have good wealth management, and I am sure they will be successful. I think that's pretty cool and something that has a nice future. Maybe I'm thinking of investing in the name of AUDIT.",

I don't think it will always be profitable.It's not about the profitability but about checking the project itself by an entity to have it certified on its own. Whether it's certified and checked or audited by a firm.That doesn't mean that a project is safe to invest in and as well as guarantees a return. The decision is still in you on how you take these projects seriously and you use as many references as you can to check if it's worth your money.",

One thing worth mentioning is Certik audit doesn't mean that the teams are thoroughly checking the smart contract code line by line, in some cases, surely that is needed to be done, but I'm sure that will increase the cost of the audit since it requires more thorough audit services plan.In most cases, Certik audit only automatically verifies the smart contract based on a known vulnerabilities. So yeap, as in results, it's like the saying goes, no system is 100% secure.",

Remember that some old projects that become scam even they were revealing their face to public. People are seeing revealing their face to the public to give more guarantee if they will not scamming the investors but these days those garbage scammers were using soft scamming method to scam investors. There are so many projects that died slowly as already programmed by scammers. Scammers was a scammer and audit was not fully preventing the project to become a scam but at least public can know what already contained in the code.",

The feeling is more rewarding when you are being honoured to be an honest company because not all cant possibly do that. If a company that is known to be legit but tries to do something fishy, they will be caught later on. Like for example in the case of an auditing company here in crypto, if they will let a bad project pass in exchange of money.It will eventually find out by those people who trusted that project only because it was audited by a famous auditing company when the project collapsed later on. That will be more shameful if the world finds out the real truth. Their company will also collapse. That is why it's always better to be honest and fair if you want your company to last longer or to become successful.",
