Other times, when I open the app, a security notification pops up for me to tap \"send code\". When I do, a code is then sent either to my mobile number or email address whichever option I may have selected. And I would have to input this code to gain access to my account. Sometimes, I get worried about it. While at other times, I brush it off as one of the security measure put in place by Binance. My question is, do Bitcointalkers who use other exchange apps like KuCoin, Coinbase, Luno, Kraken have the same experience. Secondly, If I were to move all my coins from Binance, which exchange is the next best alternative?Thank you very much.",

      "body": "Having that login verification and 2FA is just a standard procedure, IMO. That's a good security practice not only for the users but also for Binance itself to prevent unusual or suspicious activities of hackers that might have gotten some ID or something that could affect a user's experience. 2 weeks is fair to login after because it's better to do that rather than being it open and easily accessed by someone on your phone. As for moving to another exchange, FTX is a great exchange that offers a lot too. I think that would be a great alternative.",

They don't require such verification for nothing. You be more worried if the exchange you're using doesn't require those verifications.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on July 25, 2022, 11:30:36 AMSecondly, If I were to move all my coins from Binance, which exchange is the next best alternative?Binance is the best for now.P.S.

If even you use another device to login, you will be asked to provide the one time password from the 2FA app that that you are using. I have noticed this on reputable exchanges as well. Email and text message verifications are not secure like 2FA.As long as you have your 2FA on a different device, 2FA remains the most secure and the best for now to be used on exchanges. But know that this does not mean exchanges can not be hacked generally as a result of security flaws from the exchange itself, the reason not to leave your coins on exchanges.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on July 25, 2022, 11:30:36 AMSecondly, If I were to move all my coins from Binance, which exchange is the next best alternative?To hold your coin, use cold storage like hardware wallet or wallet on an air gapped device. But for altcoins as well, you can use hardware wallet.",

It's only protect against average Joe who want try to steal someone coins without any hacking skill, with this verification, they have no idea to know such code. Since Binance and other centralized exchanges hold their coins on hot wallet, then it's already over when the hacker can gain access to the hot wallet.Bisq aka decentralized exchange wouldn't hold your coins on their hot wallet and you're safe without using any extra security.",

And if it's about just holding your fund, just as they suggest, get a hardware wallet. I've got a ledger hardware wallet and have been using it for years.",

It's a standard procedure and a healthy one towards security at that but, be sure to ensure you don't miss your number or fail to have access to your mail otherwise, accessing your binance account might be impossible.When it comes to moving your coins to other exchanges, you might want to consider the phrase, \"Not your keys, not your coins\". Exchanges are not the best place to store your coins. Non custodial wallets are the best for that purpose as they stand to be decentralized with you being completely in charge of your coins.Keeping your coins on an exchange simply means you aren't the owner of those coin and is only permitted by the exchange to have access to it and that could be revoked at any point following certain company policies.",

What made you decide to give up binance to switch to another exchange, it can be said that binance is the most worth using exchange today, you won't find a better exchange than binance from customer service to security.

If a thief who somehow got access of your email wants to reset account then he can not because he will be asked for 2FA. It means you have less risk to lose the funds unless Binance itself become the victim of any hack.

Yes, i am giving you the answer plainly, I use binance, kucoin, gate, luno, I have account on almost all major exchanges, and I can tell you that the experience are all the same.The thing is, when you login on your Binance or Kucoin app, and after sometime, you go offline, there is a set time programmed for you to remain offline, if you return to the app before that timer is reached, you will be allowed to easily continue from where is stopped, that is, you won't be asked or required to re-login again. But if you are offline until the set timer is reached, then anytime you open the app, you will be required to re-login. This is a security feature which I believe is put in place to prevent other people from accessing your account when they some how or for what ever reason gained access to you phone. Quote Secondly, If I were to move all my coins from Binance, which exchange is the next best alternative?Well, for me, I would say Kucoin is the best alternative, but I must emphasize the fact that Binance remains the best as a cryptocurrency trader, but if you are an investor, do not leave your coin on an exchange platform, withdraw it to your private wallet, hardware wallets are the best, but in a case where you don't have one yet, withdraw your coins to a wallet you control the keys or seed phrase.Once again, do not leave your investments on an exchange, exchanges can be hacked, and when that happens, you are likely not going to get your coins back.",
