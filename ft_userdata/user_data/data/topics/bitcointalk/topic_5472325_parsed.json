      "body": "I wouldn't want to disrupt your taste and hunger for this project but this is where investors are being deceived by the promise and sweetness of many projects knowing too well that bullrun is around the corner and it's always tempting period for investors since most projects offers a higher returns to investors. Well, I haven't made a concrete research about this project to know their originality and their true intentions towards their investors as most project always uses this period to launch with the mindset of scaling along with bull run meaning after bullrun we see worthless tokens.",

For investors, you should be wise in your choices, and don't forget to research first before deciding to buy coins to see if they will provide a good return on the capital investment that will be used.",
