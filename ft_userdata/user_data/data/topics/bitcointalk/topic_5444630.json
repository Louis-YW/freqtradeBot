      "body": "Isn't there an option to register an account in the name of a company for coinbase? Looking at the QA on the site, they say they can buy crypto with a mercury accountQuote from: https://mercury.com/web3Can I buy crypto with my Mercury account?We don't have express restrictions on buying crypto through your Mercury account. When using Mercury, wires sent through your account will include your business name as the wire sender, which helps crypto exchanges (e.g., Gemini, Coinbase) process and credit wires.Fyi, binance has a separate exchange to serve US residents.Another way is to buy bitcoin p2p without kyc. Your bank card has a mastercard sign, it should allow more universal payments.",

      "body": "Mercury is a business banking account. How do you think you can buy crypto from there?If you are not a US citizen, your life is actually easier, because there are a bunch of exchangers and OTC options out there that 1) do not accept Americans and 2) let you send money from that bank, and receive crypto, such as The Bitcoin Reserve. Binance also won't care I believe.",
