Posts that have little value rarely earn any merits. So, read as much as you can so that you can write posts and replies that others consider to be worth awarding merits.",

If you come to a forum that has \"bitcointalk\" in its name, and you don't show that you have any interest in Bitcoin or altcoins, my only advice would be to ask yourself \"maybe I'm in the wrong place?\"Not that I want to discourage the OP, but I just want to say that if I'm interested in football and not basketball, then I won't go to a basketball game, pretty simple.",

Your focus now shouldn't be to grow but to gain knowledge. If you have sound information about Bitcoin and the forum, you will naturally grow. However, growth in this forum is a product of merit and activity. You can get merit when you do quality posts that give information, answer a question or solve a problem. Merits are like likes on social media and the more merit you get the higher your membership level. Activity is determined by your age and consistency in the forum. Your activity grows as you spend more time and make contributions. Just  ba patient and learn.",

Op this your thread would have been posted on the first or second post of the account but this is 14 post and that means you are not totally newbie in cryptocurrency even though you are new in the forum. As examplens your breaking down of politics is not bad and here you are trying to contradict your knowledge. You are good in Politics and economics. Probably you might need the knowledge on Cryptocurrency. And from you posts, you can read and write therefore I recommend you to make some research on Google and read more on Cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. With that you knowledge will also be centered on bitcoin.",

How is growth measured here?As for what is not allowed and what is allowed, of course you only need to look for the rules that are in this forum or those that have been pinned on every board you post. And in terms of growth, it is measured by how smart you are in making good contributions to this forum, both through brilliant ideas and also through knowledge that you already know. Because here everyone is required to always learn more about every thing that is needed and is not yet known, so you also need to study outside the forum so that you can provide good ideas through your posts here.
