We'll use this thread to drop updates, stay on topic of questions and comments, and get feedback from all of you on your usage of Passport.What is Passport?Passport is the new standard for Bitcoin hardware wallets, built from the ground up to make Bitcoin self-custody more approachable without sacrificing security or features.Passport brings best-in-class user experience via QR code scanning and microSD transaction signing, making it easy to use Passport at home or on the go with the wallet of your choice. We've also built an easy-to-use companion app for Passport in Envoy, a mobile app that helps you manage Passport, perform firmware updates, watch your wallets, and send and receive Bitcoin transactions easily.ImagesKey FeaturesAirgapped security with both microSD and camera for QR code scanningFull T9 keyboard + directional pad to make PIN entry, passphrase entry, and navigation of the UI simple and fastStunning color, IPS glass display makes it so much easier to navigate, confirm transaction details, and handle QR codesEnvoy, our mobile companion app that lets you send and receive Bitcoin, manage, and update Passport from anywhere, anytimePower-only USB-C to ensure you can charge up easily without fear of compromising device securityRechargeable battery, with replacements available widely online in a standard form factorLinksFoundation's WebsitePassport, the new standard for Bitcoin hardware walletsEnvoy, the simple Bitcoin wallet and mobile companion app for PassportPassport and Envoy documentation and tutorialsReviewsA fantastic and detailed review thread by forum member n0nceReviews Megathread (Twitter)Where you can find usTwitter: @FOUNDATIONdvcsNostr: @FoundationTelegram Group ChatEmail: hello@foundation.xyzWe look forward to hearing more of your feedback and answering any questions you have in this topic as well.",

A dummy phone mode is definitely on our to-do list still, though, and we'll explore bringing that to our users in future versions!",

You must install the beta pubkey (attached in GitHub) using the Settings -> Advanced -> Developer PubKey menu item before you can install this beta. If you are not comfortable with this, please wait for the official release, which should be available shortly. Detailed instructions for this process can be found here.Mainly usability improvements in this one, full details of which can be found in the GitHub change log. Most notable are:Improved memory management when signing via QR codes (sign larger transactions)Added the ability to export existing multisig configs via QR or SD card (Passport can now act as an additional backup of the wallet data which can be super useful in disaster recovery scenarios)Improved transaction detail display when conducting self spendsPlease test it out (if you're comfortable with a beta release) and report back with any issues, feedback, or suggestions you have! The official release should go live in about 1wk, pending any issues that are discovered in the public beta testing.",

Sure! You can find all of our docs on the integration here, but the core of it is that Bitcoin Keeper is a multisig-centric wallet with a focus on helping users setup tiers of Bitcoin storage (including singlesig and multisig) with a proper plan for inheritance long-term. They have a pretty clean UI and UX, and have been great to work with on the integration front. They've also done good work integrating the latest interoperable standards for multisig, which has been helpful for us as well as we're laser-focused on interoperability and embracing emerging standards in the Bitcoin space.We also did an interview with them on our podcast, Journey to Sovereignty, that you can find here:EP #5 - Is multisig for everyone?Edit: Realized I didn't even link their website!

On future devices we'll explore testing to specific standards, will bring this up to the team today as a reference!Regarding both topics that ETFbitcoin brought up, I would like to highlight[1] my initial discussion with @zherbert regarding the way shipping costs are calculated when talking about other countries besides USA and how (perhaps) it could be improved:Quote from: RickDeckard on February 14, 2023, 10:29:04 PMQuote from: zherbert on February 14, 2023, 02:58:35 PMCurrently we just display the estimated import tax, but we don't charge the customer. The customer then needs to pay it directly from UPS (or whatever carrier they select) upon package delivery. I think there is a way where we could pay the import tax on behalf of the customer, and therefore charge them for the estimated tax during checkout. I'll explore if this is possible, because I like your idea. The only downside would be if the estimate is consistently lower than the actual tax; that would eat into our margins and we aren't quite as big as Amazon So while the client is making the purchase he was to directly pay it to UPS instead to Foundation as a company? I may be thinking this wrong and I would love your input but, from a user perspective, this operation seems like it's a bit confuse - If I'm willing to pay for such a premium for such a device (considering the offers in the market), the least that I would expect is that I would pay whatever had to pay to Foundation and then the order would eventually come to my house - no need to make two separate transactions, one for you and one for UPS. I may be wrong on the following assumption, but doesn't it mean that by paying directly to UPS it makes me the one responsible for the package, thus it would be me who would have to argue with them if something went bad as opposed to being Foundation the ones responsible to care and making sure that the package arrives with no problems?[1]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5421713.msg61764293#msg61764293",
