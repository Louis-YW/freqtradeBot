Just yesterday,  CZ the CEO and Binance Founder Pleads Guilty to Violating Money Laundering Rules and agrees to pay a $50 Miliion Fine and to also step down as the CEO  as part of his guilty plea. And that same yesterday cZ officially resigned and bid goodbye to his office as the CEO of Binance, Although still making himself accessible to the company. It might also interest us to know that  Binance itself was also found guilty and charged as well, and also agreed to pay a $4.3 Billion fine and restitution to the government. So my Question is, with all the tension on ground, is Binance going to survive this or would this be the end of Binance even after naming a new CEO, since the news surfaced online, people has been repeatedly taking out their funds from the exchange with the fear of the exchange crashing. So what's going to be the impact of this tragedy on Binance??",

So what's going to be the impact of this tragedy on Binance??We cannot be sure what will be the outcome of Binance in the long run and also what is the future of the BNB token (the native token of Binance). However, if we see, the impact of this news on the overall crypto market is not so bearish. Bitcoin didn't dump much and as of this writing; it is again recovering and trading near 36300$. Since people know that we have some major upcoming bitcoin developments including the bitcoin ETF and the Halving, no one is willing to sell their crypto holding on this Binance CZ news.The news is more relevant to the CZ, as the money laundering charges are on him and he stepped down as a CEO, for the present I do not think there is anything to be worried about the Binance platform itself.",

Rumors are around that Black Rock can be the entity behind the scene and they did something seriously to take down Binance. For now, it's rumors but time will tell us whether Black Rock engaged in this action from US. authorities.With their perfect successful rate of ETF approval (approved 575/576 ETF applications), they are like a branch of US. government. Chance for a Bitcoin Spot ETF approval in the USA will become bigger when Binance is taking down and Black Rock will take advantage of it to dominate this cryptocurrency market, take overthe leading position of Binance.",

Despite CZ can’t work anymore on Binance, I’m sure that everything will continue as usual since the exchange is not dependent to CZ.

The repercussions of this decision may affect the price of BNB, but it is good that it came early because the market may receive it with a little negativity, especially if this matter is followed by the sale of many Binance currencies and assets. The price did not react negatively to prices.",

Whether there's a hidden agenda to make BNB holders feel secure or it's genuine support, I don't know. What's certain is that CZ plays a central role when Binance dominates the exchange industry. The evidence against CZ and Binance could be a significant source of FUD for the cryptocurrency market, even though the exchange and CZ have never been linked to the BTC system.The reason FUD might not be too strong is that CZ handled the situation gracefully. He didn't take away other people's money and continues to comply with regulations and the law. I believe this won't severely shake the crypto industry in the long run; recovery might come in the next few months.",

In my opinion, their case is not like FTX so I think we don't need to panic too much. Furthermore, if they have accepted to pay fines to comply with the law, there is no reason to close. But Binance's position without CZ will certainly be more difficult, that's what everyone can see. With this news in the long run, I think this is good for the market because binance is gradually becoming a monopoly in the exchange segment and they have great influence on the market. So the fact that they need to share market share is a good thing for the market. But it looks like Wall Street is going to be the new boss of this game and I don't know if that's good for us or not.",
