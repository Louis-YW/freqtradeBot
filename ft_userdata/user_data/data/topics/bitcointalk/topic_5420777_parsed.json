  "content": "So this is one of the few tokens that seems to be in a hurry to get back up. Of course the market will push it down like it is doing right now, but it will bounce right back up as soon as Ethereum or Bitcoin hint an upward move. I've compared it's behaviour with other \"highly volatile\" tokens like Solana and Helium and Band manages to outperform these most of the time. So why is this happening ? I don't see LINK or other Oracle projects pumping ? Or is it because people think BAND could be the next Matic or Quant ? I personally don't think so, but I got me a solid position in it  because I see it as a strong project with at least 10X potential.",

      "body": "I haven't traded BAND ever and I am not aware. The pump would happen for any reason. They might have some good news or something like this. Try to find their social media. If nothing is there, means it was manipulation. A group of traders plays this way. Project hire to pump, so projects and the team of traders make money. And small traders lose this way when they enter the green candle. So don't be over-excited when you see the pump of any tokens or coins. Think deeply what is the reason for the pump.",

      "body": "I also not traded and aware of band. I think this could be a manipulation to cause pump and dump so that those who manipulate the price want to earn money from newbies because of its increasing price. As I have noticed that if this time is beark market then other crypto also decreases its price. Didn't we just see BTC reach new ATH where other crypto also done the same. It could also be just a pump of the price and no dump situation but if it is not then we have no choice but to accept it as pump and dump scheme by investors.",

Such rises should be positive news or shares related to project development, as his friend said. Otherwise, it is very difficult to rise in this period.",

      "body": "Well Band Protocol is an Oracle project, so like Chainlink it's solid technology that is not likely to go away even if Bitcoin goes to 5K. Let's also remember than the crypto market is fairly irrational sometimes, like when Cardano introduced smart contracts and everybody thought the price would at least double after that, and it just kept going down like it had before. So you can have great news or events happening and your favourite token can still go down... but you can also have the opposite happen in a bear market. Of course it will never take off the way it would in a bull run, but you can still have a 3X sometimes, like what we saw with Quant a few months ago.",
