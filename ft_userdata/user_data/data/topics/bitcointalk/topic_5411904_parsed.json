I am running HiveOS. Not much you can do,it depends on the memory they have the cards,there are four types for this cards,Samsung which is the best and does easily that 31 Mhsh,than there is Micron,Elpida and Hynix which can or cannot do that,the most stubborn one is Hynix which is well known to not respond as better as Samsung memory to the overclocking and under-volt that we do.In Windows you can see which type of memory you have by installing GPU-Z,of course Linux has its counterpart which is easily searched in google.I believe you to have the Hynix memory or not the best overclock and under-volt,check the most well known flight sheet that is widely used for your cards in HiveOS and use one of them,from the community I mean.",

SK Hynix and Samsung are between 30 - 32MH. i don't have Elpida.Check your memory straps. You can try using amdmemtweak --REF 20 in the advanced config box, try 20 or 30. Some cards accept up to 240. wich will increase your hashes significantly.You can also play with the core and memory state to lower your power consumption a bit.",

I am running HiveOS. Show your settings in Hive OS.27 megahash is not a bad result for a beginner, because some of my rx580 video cards had problems with overclocking after 27 megahash, and the mining farm crashed.You can try to flash the BIOS by changing some timings. There is a lot of information about this on YouTube or use the miner settings to increase the hashrate.",

      "body": "Yes it varies per card. Some cards are worse memory and some GPUs have a worse ASIC quality % and they can't clock as high. You can try and force it to 31MH/s however you will run into hardware errors and it'll keep freezing on you. Eventually it'll freeze in the middle of the night and you will lose all profits on 8 GPUs just because you overclocked it too much.Good quality looking rig, reminds me of my old RX 570 rigs.

Congratulations on your first rig build as it looks like a great one!  You seem to have gotten a good deal on the hardware and got it running, so you're off to a great start.  I hope this sparks something in you to keep going.  If you can make it through the downturn as a miner, you will certainly emerge stronger on the other side.  Good luck with maintaining the heat!",

Good settings and you're lucky with your memory. Memory can be increased to 2150-2200, but this may affect the stability of the work. If the mining farm is stable, then I would not change anything. Some miners increase the memory to 2250 and get almost 32 megahash, but this is probably just for showing off. There will be no stability with these settings.",

Your problem is with the raiser supplier, not the raisers. The raiser is not such a complex detail that it has many problems. Raisers with regular motherboards are cheaper than dedicated mining motherboards without raisers. And for premium boards without raisers, expensive cases are needed.",
