The early pump will always be triggering a huge pump caused by there are no lots of sell orders in the market. The volume was also quite small as well. I think that you will be seeing the price may worth even lower than 5 or even 3 in the future.",

Yeah that's right and I don't trust that site because maybe there's anomaly happening there and any small exchange can do manipulation where they fake the volumes of some tokens listed so that they can get demands or curiosity from people who think they can earn if they stay trading at this platform. Also newbie need to be careful since if what OP said is true I think that's the peak already and for sure those people who buy at the top will get trap and became a bag holder.",
