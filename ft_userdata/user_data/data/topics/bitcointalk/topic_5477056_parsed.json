  "content": "Lightning network is perceived to have zero fees, but this is not true. In fact, still exist and add up over time.As an example, for a 0.027BTC transaction the fee I paid was 0.000164BTC which is comparable to the on-chain fee.Is there a way to minimize those fees somehow? For example, has the coice of node on Electrum (ACINQ vs. Electrum trampoline vs. trampoline hodlistreco) any effect on future fees paid?",

Does it at least show you the fee before sending the payment? You paid 0.6% fee, which is a lot. From what I've seen, most LN node owners \"complain\" that they don't make any profit.

I'm not sure if there's a way to dig into the wallet option to find out what the fee is before even sending. But I guess that's a question for the Electrum devs",
