With Google 2FA and some like Authy, you can have your 2FA backup online on the cloud, but the best are offline on a paper (like a book). Recommended 2FA examples are Aegis (Android) and Tofu (iOS).

But I think privacy app and pattern password can solve some of these issue.Privacy app : gives you the permission to hide useful app or content on your phone which no one can access except you. [Pattern password: we all know the function aswell it's also another security that still require your concent.Like me I always save password automatically because I don't have that time to be inserting my password manually.  Your mobile phone is a personal property and requires privacy. you alone has the access to it.especially the one used for important online businesses.

This is a result of me always forgetting the exact passwords I use for a particular thing. Even as I try as much as I can to use fewer passwords for different things in order for them not to be complicated, I still happen to miss them most of the time.So what I do with auto-save password is this: I create a new email that is connected to my device, Chrome, and I make it my phone's primary email to enable me to save passwords on it. So what I do is for those sites, for which I do use a random password, I save their password on it for easy remembering, but his sites are not in any way concerned with anything regarding finance; they are just something relating to school portals and all of that.And for the 2FA backup, that's actually a bad idea. I don't know what Google thinks of such features, but I doubt anyone who truly wants to protect anything where they enable 2FA will not consider using the backup option, as it will give hackers a point of direction on where to attack in order to penetrate you.",

It is not something I do often or maybe I might have clicked in a brink of fastening the process of what I’m trying to do. Having too many passwords to me is not a nice idea especially when you have a very sophisticated password that can be very hard to memorize. Writing them down in a safe place could be a solution to this but I’d prefer I save it in my brain, so having similar passwords (1 to 3 passwords) is okay than having different passwords for every logins online. Passwords saved offline and written down somewhere can be breached or even get lost, so it is better you have few passwords for online logins and try and memorize them in your brain.",

Most people see saving passwords online as making it very easy for them to access the site whenever they want to without thinking about the password that they use, but it’s a wrong idea. Any of your private information shouldn’t be saved online, make sure it’s saved completely offline. Anything can happen to the browser that you used in saving the password, and your password will be leaked, which a hacker can end up using to access your account.

My exchange accounts uses 2fa no auto safe as I do insert the password myself. Online accounts are all different passwords written down separately. I had to do away with anything cloud ever since my experience years back. To be on the safe side, if you are using Google cloud to save your password,Ake sure that google account is well protected by a strong sophisticated password that could hardly be memorised. If you can hardly put up with the password, it would be nice you save it separately so you could get hold of it if you are having issues logging in that particular Google account to access the auto fill password option.",
