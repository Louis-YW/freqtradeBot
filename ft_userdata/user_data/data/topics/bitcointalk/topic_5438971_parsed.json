So you can actually just use any popular AES library such as [Open/Libre/Boring]SSL with one of the standard key lengths and you should still be using an NIST-compatible implementation.Quote from: stanner.austin on February 09, 2023, 05:31:53 AMAES-ECB-128AES-CBC-128AES-CBC-256AES-CTR-128AES-CTR-256AES-GCM-256etc etcYou can use pretty much any cipher.

      "body": "That's quite a reaction. Asking questions is normal because to be able to give the best answer, more details are needed. Most of the time when someone asks weird questions like this, it's because they have a goal C in mind, and is trying to get from A->C and is blocked by something in A, while the best way to reach goal C would actually be to do B->C instead. Asking what C is helps us give the correct answer to how to get to C.If you had started with something like \"I want to learn the inner workings of the AES algorithm and is trying to create my own implementation, but for some reason I get the wrong answers. Here is my code, do you see any obvious errors?\" - then that would explain your goal and your problem perfectly, and we would be able to help better. But for some reason you don't want to reveal what you are trying to do, and is offended when people ask for details.",
