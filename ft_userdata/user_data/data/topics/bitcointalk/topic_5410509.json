  "content": "QuoteRussia’s oil production is unlikely to recover to pre-coronavirus levels, according to a government strategy document cited by Kommersant.In a strategy document outlining prospects for Russia’s critical oil and gas industry, the government said its “base case” — or most likely — scenario, is that Russia’s oil production will never again hit the record levels recorded in 2019. In the last full year before the pandemic, Russia produced 560 million tons of oil — equivalent to 11.3 million barrels a day. But output dropped for the first time in more than a decade in 2020 as Russia agreed significant production cuts with Saudi Arabia and other members of the OPEC cartel in a bid to support oil prices at the start of the pandemic — pushing production down 9% to 10.3 million barrels per day.In the scenario labelled most probable, the Energy Ministry predicts Russia’s oil output will grow over the rest of the decade — but fail to hit the record output of 2019, with production hitting a post-coronavirus peak of 11.1 million barrels a day in 2029 before decreasing to to 9.4 million barrels a day by 2035.Russia vies with Saudi Arabia to be the world’s second-largest oil producer, behind the world-leading U.S. The Russian economy remains heavily dependent on energy exports, with revenues in pre-pandemic years accounting for more than a third of the government’s total budget and all extractive industries — covering oil, gas and other commodities — accounting for almost 40% of Russian GDP, according to the country’s statistics agency Rosstat.In its most optimistic scenario, the Energy Ministry expects production to pass pre-coronavirus levels, peaking in 2030 at 12.8 million barrels a day before starting to decline. In every scenario presented, the Energy Ministry said Russian oil production had either already peaked, or would hit its maximum level within the next decade, Kommersant reported.Russia remains poorly positioned to take advantage of the global energy transition to cleaner and renewable sources of energy, experts say. While countries in Europe and the U.S. have put clean energy at the center of their post-coronavirus economic stimulus and investment packages, Russia is reportedly planning to cut state spending on green energy. Analysts estimate that if every project currently in development is completed in time, Russia’s electricity generation from renewable sources, excluding hydro power, will be just 1% by 2024.“While international oil [majors] are falling over themselves in their business transformation potential to become ‘clean,’ Russians are unlikely to compete with them in this renewables drive,” VTB Capital’s deputy head of oil and gas research Dmitry Loukashov said in a research note last week.He does believe, however, that the Russian oil and gas industry could capitalize on so-called transition fuels, like hydrogen or ammonia, as well as take a leading role in investment and research into carbon capture technology. The Energy Ministry strategy outlines that government tax cuts to high-potential oil fields, such as those in the Arctic region, will be crucial in helping the country maximize the potential of the vast energy resources it still sits on. If oil prices lag, it estimates that only a third of Russia’s proven reserves will be profitable to extract, while even in the most optimistic scenario, with higher global oil prices, only two-thirds of Russia’s recoverable reserves will be taken out of the ground.https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/12/russia-may-have-passed-peak-oil-output-government-a73558....Should peak production of oil have been reached. It could be defined as a deflationary commodity. Similar to bitcoin's reward halving. Every successive year would be defined by average decreases in production. Accompanied by rising scarcity of resources.What would the expected performance of such a trend resemble?It also appears that russia is poorly situated to transition to green and renewable sources of energy. With a whopping 1% or less of its electricity generation being derived from low carbon footprint sources. Putin it seems does not approve of environmentally friendly, sustainable and renewable power.Peak oil has been a hot topic since the 1970s. Our last era of inflation and high fossil fuel costs. Some analysts conclude that too much of our lifestyle is built upon fossil fuels for them to be replaced. Others claim the opposite is true. Today we can synthesize organic waste products into fossil fuels and manufacture plastics from soybeans and other sources. Perhaps we have better alternatives today. But at one time the peak oil debate was one of a doomsday scenario. Where peak oil was correlated with peak civilization and all humanity could expect afterward would be a decline.",

Russia unleashed a war in Ukraine, began to blackmail European countries to make the necessary political decisions, using oil and gas as weapons. This blackmail has already been repeated many times, and therefore this time Europe has firmly decided to get rid of Russia's dependence and abandon its oil and gas. This process has been launched and in a few years Russia will lose the main buyer of its carbohydrates.In addition, many states, due to global climate change, have developed a program for a gradual transition to alternative energy sources, and this is also irrevocable. Demand for oil and gas should fall and Russian in the first place.",

The differences listed in the article don't seem that big though; it's clearly not a dramatic decrease. Unfortunately, it might also have little effect on Russian economy and profits because if they get fewer oil but sell it at a higher price, it can compensate for the lowered amounts. But overall, it's important to start moving away from oil and start building economy on something that doesn't cause lots of harm to the environment. It doesn't seem that Russia understands this simple idea yet, just like it doesn't understand that waging a war is bad. Hopefully, the understanding of both will come sooner rather than later.",

This is not tap water, when you want to drink, you open the tap, and when you don’t need it, you close it.And this is a product that cannot be taken and simply started selling in a completely different direction - the logistics of oil and gas is a very difficult decision.And it is worth disturbing the usual balance of this market, as the \"old\" supplier has problems:1. Gas or oil that has been abandoned must be stored. Question - where and how, and how much? There are no huge storage facilities in Russia.2. In Russia, it is very primitive, from the point of view of the flexibility of supply directions, both the gas system and oil pipelines.They simply cannot begin to drive the oil that went through pipelines, for example, to China. The situation is exactly the same with gas. At the same time, remember - China always twists the arms of the weak, and now Russia is selling excess oil (tanker oil) at a dumping price. No, not at the low price set by Russia, but at the price at which China ordered them to sell. While the cost of transportation has increased markedly.3. Temporary stop of production - impossible. Only conservation of wells is possible. It is very expensive. But this is half the trouble. Even more expensive and technologically more difficult - deconservation. It's not like corking a bottle of wine and then opening it. This is essentially to develop a well from the beginning. Commensurate in complexity and cost. And given the technological backwardness of Russia in these technologies, the depreservation of wells becomes almost impossible. This is not nonsense, it is a fact, no matter how idiotic it may sound, but Russia uses 75+% of imported technologies and equipment from developed countries in oil and gas production!",

I don't know if this is true or western propaganda.I don't believe that Russia doesn't have any gas storage facilities, all countries in Europe have such facilities(usually underground) where they store their natural gas reserves. Most EU countries will have to replenish their gas reserves for up to 85%.

First of all, even now EU remains the top importer of Russian crude and finished products. Out of around 6 million barrels (3m crude, 3m products) exported per day, more than 50% is directly purchased by the EU nations. And even more end up in the EU, in the form of \"blended products\" from countries such as India and Turkey. They are planning to phase out Russian oil and products by end of this year. Even that looks doubtful, as some of the EU members such as Hungary have claimed that it will be impossible to secure supplies from other sources. If Russia want, they can redirect most of these exports to Asia and Europe. But Europe won't be able to secure supplies to replace all the Russian imports.",

I am not sure, but from what I heard it costs $6 per barrel or above to store crude oil for one year. If the crude needs to be stored for 5 years, the storage alone will cost $30-$40 per barrel. So unless it is required for strategic purposes, crude oil storage can't be used to make profit. It can be very risky as well. For example, now crude is trading at $100 per barrel. What will happen in case the prices go down to $40 per barrel all of a sudden and stay there for 5-6 years?",

From the latest news below indicate Russia can now offload its oil at 30% discount to customers and still see a profit from it. If they keep their oil in storage, it'll hurt their overall balance as the amount of money to upkeep it as you've said. If the oil price keeps going lower, their profit margin could be lower as well so they can't keep hoarding oil in their storage or reserve.QuoteRussia mulls up to 30% oil discounts for some Asian buyers: Reporthttps://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/russia-mulls-up-to-30-oil-discounts-for-some-asian-buyers-report-122082401057_1.html",

Let me repeat, if you don't understand, in the first seven months of the year, Russia has a budget surplus of almost half a trillion rubles, against the backdrop of unprecedented economic sanctions and additional spending on a military special operation in Ukraine. These are facts, as opposed to your wet fantasies.Russia lives within its means and earns more than it spends. And this is what the entire civilized world, mired in debt, should learn from her.",

It will be interesting to see whether they will be able to maintain the budget surplus then. And there is some disturbing development from India. The Americans claim that the Indian government has given them assurances regarding the price cap on Russian crude. If they do that, then China will remain as the sole major importer of Russian crude. As of now, India imports around 1 million barrels of crude per month from Russia. The accumulated funds of the National Welfare Fund make it possible to compensate for the budget deficit up to 20% within three years without the risk of complete depletion of financial reserves. The financial system of Russia has a large enough margin of safety to feel confident even with sharp changes in market conditions.",

EU for instance still hasn't found where to get gas this winter. Asia also has to buy from Russia also. Even if Russia have passed peak oil, do we have an alternative source?  Saudi is also not willing to cooperate with Biden. Gas drilling countries including Russia are just not working with EU or US since they were trying to kill this industry thru that kid Great Thunberg.China drilling the South China Sea for gas is about to happen, by the way, I recently read the news about it and they were to partner with a drilling company from the Philippines.",

Like who would be the one that could provide something to the world when it needs it the most. Also we have to accept the fact that cars are just one part of the problem, yeah we use oil/petrol for our cars, you can name it anything you want but it is definitely tied to crypto in the long run.On the other hand, we are talking about something that is a bit more careless with Russia who still attacks Ukraine in the face of all the upcoming problems, they are \"not afraid\" but they should be, it is going to hurt them big time.",
