Miners compute hashes using their hardware, that means as long as their hardware is constant (eg. the miner has 10 ASICs) the number of hashes they can compute per second (aka hashrate) is also constant.Don't confuse that with the total hashrate, that is not constant since the number of miners is never constant.

There is nothing different about encrypting your wallet, to backup your wallet file using password, you encrypt it with the password. If you want to recover back the wallet from the file, you will need the password to decrypt it. You can see this on wallets that support it as an alternative to seed phrase backup. But you should know that the file can go corrupt.But it is advised to backup your seed phrase instead. Far more reliable.Also you can encrypt a disc or memory card or flash drive on airgapped computer which you used to generate your wallet. That can be seen on a computer if you insert the disc, memory card or flash drive after you go to the external device and right click. Some people can go for this option to encrypt what is stored on the disc or card with password. But we should know that this can go corrupt, I mean the disc or card used for it.Quote from: Nheer on March 23, 2023, 04:58:04 PM I looked through the forum but was unable to locate an understandable tutorial on how to encrypt a message.

When mining a block do miners' hash rates varies as blocks are produced, or do they remain constant. I don't exactly understand the question but I think I've got the point. New block is be generated in every 10 minutes, so, if overall hashrate for example is 400M TH/s and you join the game with 50 TH/S, mining difficulty will increase and old equipment will become unprofitable while the competition will increase so much that it may become hard for a lot of miners generate profit via mining, or, depends on their equipment, even with free electricity some may not profit. But when total hashrate increases and mining becomes unprofitable, either people shut down their miners and companies with advanced tech and free or very cheap electricity stay in the game or usually bitcoin price increases to balance the situation. If people shut down their miners, difficulty will decrease and mining will become profitable or if they stay, bitcoin price has to rise. When bitcoin halving happens, blocks generate 50% less bitcoins and miners get 50% less reward, that's why price increases after the halving.Quote from: hZti on March 24, 2023, 08:31:38 AMI think you need First to understand how mining works.

I may hit a block reward with my GPU but the probability is so enormously low that solo mining doesn't worth, it doesn't even worth with the latest antminer, unless, you are as lucky as this guy: Tiny Bitcoin miner defies massive odds to solve a valid block.",

Does that make sense?Definitely bitcoin adoption plays role but here is a fact, bitcoin's price significantly increases after halving and that's because even if the demand stays the same, reward is half.Let me clarify: Imagine, there is a company that produces 100 gallons of milk per week and has 100 buyers every week.

If it has nothing to do with reduced reward, then why does price increase after that event?Also, please explain, why doesn't bitcoin goes to it's old price after halving? Bitcoin was $600 pre halving in 2016, it went up to 20K and never went down to $600 or even $1000. It was $9300 in 2020 but we haven't seen it lower than 16 or 15K after halving. It never returns to its pre-halving price. It isn't only because of demand, it has to do thing with reduced block reward too.When the mining becomes unprofitable, miners demand more for their bitcoins but one of the major factor that contributes increased price of bitcoin is that actually, there is a proposal that everyone has heard and has seen results of 'Bitcoin halving leads to increased bitcoin price'.  Then doesn't matter demand/supply, people pay higher and higher prices because there exist this expectation among everyone, it's like an invisible hand.",

But yeah, they impact the price the same way you and me affect it if we submit buy and sell orders. It's obvious that miners who sell their block rewards want to keep earning the same or more when they dump their coins on the market. If they earn $30k today, they aren't going to be happy earning $15k after the next halving. The solution: They request higher prices from those buying their coins. But all other market participants have to play ball and also ask more. But it only works if there is enough demand and people are interested in paying more. So, it's a combination of supply and demand, the fact that miners earn less for the same amount of work, more interest and adoption, bitcoin getting some positive media attention due to the halving, which results in new investors coming in, etc.",

The total BTC volume on exchanges is something like 500,000 BTC per day and miners sell only 900 BTC per day.All other market participants do not \"have to play ball and also ask more\".

You are looking at trading volume, that's misleading.The number that CMC and similar sites report (like 500k per day) is total trading volume and it is usually trading volume of all pairs involving bitcoin not bitcoin against fiat only. Bitcoin/Fiat pair has the most effect on price, Bitcoin/StableShitcoins has less effect and Bitcoin/Altcoins has no effect. As an example the volume on Coinbase in the past 24 hours and was about 18k bitcoins.Trading volume also doesn't completely show demand so it is not the most accurate thing to look at when analyzing \"new sell pressure\". For example people buying and selling the same coins in a tight price space makes up a lot of volume but they can not and will not resist sell pressures.900BTC sold per day may not be significant but it is in no way negligible. It indeed has an effect on the market. After all we are talking about $24 million per day, in other words on average people have to inject NEW $24 million into the market every day, and that's just to keep the price the same as before.",

Furthermore, I discovered that encryption can offer strong protection when keeping our private keys and other sensitive data to prevent hacks. I looked through the forum but was unable to locate an understandable tutorial on how to encrypt a message. I need a little guidance on how to encrypt a message. Hashrate is the rate at which a computer of some sort can find solutions to the current puzzle. This rate is ALWAYS estimated because there is always a possibility of the current solution being found earlier or later than expected. That being said different hardware can produce different results in computational speed so the generic results can be used to estimate real time hash rate, just not 100% accurately ever ( see: https://www.makeuseof.com/silicon-lottery-why-no-two-processors-are-the-same/ ).Thus yes, hashrate will ALWAYS vary no matter the algorithm. Not to mention that the propagation of Blocks happens asynchronously of mining entirely.As for encryption, the Bitcoin network is optimized for payment security. It is not optimized to hold on to strong ciphers for encryption, ElGamal for example requires 2048 bit ciphers or higher to guarantee some level of long term discrete log hardness. (see: https://www.di-mgt.com.au/public-key-crypto-discrete-logs-3-elgamal.html | https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0914.pdf ) You do not want to save your cipher-texts on the blockchain forever because this means eventually they may be deciphered by some attacker who now has free storage of the attack surface. Instead maybe just include a reference to a hash of the cipher-text if you really need something like that synced to the blockchain. Similarly if you publish them online make sure you can remove the data completely from all public channels once they are not needed anymore. Don't leave obvious trails of encrypted data. (Not to mention a small 2048 bit ElGamal ciphertext would not even fit in a block)",
