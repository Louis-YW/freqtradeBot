  "content": "I have been on bc.game since a couple of years.I have a successful affiliate campaign on there with over 40k+ commission made. But recently they decreased my affiliate percentage from 35% to 9.8% without any prior discussion or intimation.I offer 10% to my referrals on their wager as a bonus to encourage them to use my link. Now that my affiliate % has been cut down to under 10% I virtually made 0 money on the last 4 million wagered under me as I still paid my referrals their 10%. It's insane how BCGame threw me under the bus like this without any discussion with me.I think this is part of their cost cutting campaign which began with them removing rakeback completely from the site followed by now slashing affiliate percentages. I tried reaching out to BCGame staff in so many ways but to zero success.I don't know if there's any legal or ethical grounds I can pursue here, but if anyone knows please let me know.With every dollar being wagered on my referral now, I'm losing money.",

Cost cutting is not the problem since every business does that but they should at least be more transparent if that was the case.",

Do you think that this is the first time that a crypto casino \"changes numbers & terms\" without any notifications or explanations? I can only say, welcome to the \"crypto wild west\"! And many got away with that. I play at BC, I am not an affiliate but I play for one, under Gosu! If they really did this (and I hope there is an explanation for this case), I will simply stop playing there.",

I would advice people to stay away from the site as it seems like this is the start to something worse happening. The fact that the term and condition of the term of service states that the casino have the sole right to make any change makes it difficult to place blame on the casino since their already made the law that will protect them against the player in any of their programmes and services. But the reward disparity between your old affiliate payment and the current one is too much and I suggest you reach the team to explain to them and ask why so much significant decrease in your percentage payment as an affiliate payment. And on the other hand, you will have to communicate the change of payment rate to your downlines that tho pay 10% to unless you want to continue to service them out of your own pocket since the reward is no longer coming as before.",

'efialtis' won't take it easily if BC.Game has really decreased the affiliate commission rate from 35% to 9.8%. BC.Game is at the top of GOSU review, it will highly effect on their ratings if they have made such unpleasant changes. A forum member has made a long dissatisfactory post in BC.Game ANN thread yesterday (it was a copy paste from Trustpilot review).",

Well, honestly, there is no legal ground to hold BC.game accountable on such an issue, and BC.game doesn't have to discuss anything with you before their decision to slash the affiliate commissions, since they did not hire you directly as a their affiliate marketer, or their promoter, or even ambassador, you probably saw their pay rate for referrals, got interested and hopped in, and now theyve decided to change the affiliate commission, it's up to you to either adjust to the new rate and keep going or hop out and look for another casino with better pay rate again.BC.game didn't know the decision or agreement you made with your referrals, it is your business and not theirs, and if going by the new rate, you are no longer in profit after paying your referrals, like I said above, it's up to you to adjust with the new rate, or quit and look for another casino with better pay rate for their affiliate program.",

I don't know if there could be legal action for it since most of the policies they made are subject to change. There have been incidents like this to affiliate marketers who are not related to crypto or casino and it's the same thing that happened. The most tedious part of this is you have to take down or edit the articles you have made to promote them. It's worse when you have a domain that is closely related to BCgame.
