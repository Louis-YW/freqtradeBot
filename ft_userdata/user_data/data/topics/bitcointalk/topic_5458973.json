Are you worried about the potential bugs or abuse by others who develop the script? As far as I can understand from the article, the tool is basically targeted at developers who use AI to lower the cost to launch/maintaining their apps. For end users who don't plan to use it, I don't think anything is going to change that much. Is there a new attack vector from this tool that you know of?",

As folks who are bitcoin bullish do you have any concerns or worries regarding this development? AI is a relative complex form of applied statistics in computing. So basically it isn't much different to earlier approaches where also \"an algorithm\" decides, based on certain statistics, to buy or sell Bitcoin. (Almost every Bitcoin transfer is also a \"buy\" or \"sell\" action - for goods or for fiat -, aside from some special actions like \"UTXO consolidation\"),I generally don't have major fears related to the implementation of these features for Bitcoin software. However, I think AI (more precisely: machine learning) could be relevant for the trading bot technology, because it may find new trading strategies which in pre-AI times were \"hidden\" and never used as chart patterns. I guess however that that approach may not that new, as machine learning is around for almost 70 years now. However the current AI boom (since the introduction of ChatGPT) could lead to more investment and refining of these techniques. For example, distinct kinds of statistics (not only price info) could be combined by an AI trading bot for investment decisions. And maybe we will witness eventually, due to these developments, the first \"AI-generated Bitcoin crash\". Or bull run, of course. The technology mentioned in the article (LLMs) is much less of an issue, as it's simply a new form of user interface. You could let a LLM \"manage\" some micropayments, for example, to save time. But for bigger investments LLMs are, in my opinion, too dumb - and may lead to losses of money.",

Since I don't speak tech I thought the AI being talked about in the article, would act like humans that can do bitcoin transactions just like we do viz a viz storing bitcoins in a cold wallet, making payments for goods or services on command etc. Since this is just a new form of user interface as mentioned it means that it may be available for businesses only.",

No. People who've tried chatbot (such as chatGPT) already know AI sometimes can produce wrong information. Imagine what would happen if the AI send to wrong recipient, send wrong amount or set wrong amount of transaction fee. So anyone who value their Bitcoin wouldn't let AI manage their Bitcoin.As far as I understood, these AI tools are developed to facilitate developers to create more robust AI infrastructures with LN because earlier they were using credit cards due to which the cost was high.It's not meant for use of regular users and in no way it mentions that regular users should give away their private keys to these AI tools. That would be a blunder in itself and nobody with a sane mind would ever commit this mistake of giving their private key to any 3rd party.",

Why would it be a problem?Regardless, we already have computer-driven payments. When Netflix wants to charge you, they don't have a person that calls up the credit card company. It is all done by computer.Many of my bills are handled completely by computers. The power company's computer figures out how much I owe and sends a payment request to my bank's computer. Then, my bank's computer does an ACH transaction with the computer at the power company's bank and the money is transferred. Finally, the computer at the power company's bank tells the computer at the power company that my bill has been paid. All of this is done without any human involvement.",

I think there so much to AI that some people don't know that AI was in existed before the overhype of ChatGPT which is an AI chatbot with some drawbacks cause of its lack some quality algorithms, human expertise, model architecture, and especially data that determine the good functionality of an AI.As others have said, the idea introduced by the lightning team is not something new but AI can success handle holding wallet balance, and send and receive payment without mistake, Besides, there's a certain no KYC exchange I used which executes instant withdrawal and one of the faster crypto deposit through the use of AI before ChatGPT was announced.What I am trying to say is that everything OPÂ  said is possible if the AI used by the team has quality algorithms, human expertise, model architecture, and data with the inclusion of constant development.",

So anyone who value their Bitcoin wouldn't let AI manage their Bitcoin.I tend to agree with this and I think this picture out that no one will trust AI to hold funds.IMO, trusting an AI system with the custody and management of Bitcoin may we feel uneasy, we might worry about the potential for errors or malicious actions that are made by AI.Â  We prefer to have full control over funds by holding their private keys. So I think this is impossible to happen because AI isn't capable in the Bitcoin system.",

I think it's too riskyYou're right that AI or anyone else can't be trusted in a way that we allow them to have control our assets because any error or wrong information could cause huge losses in long term. I would also say that AI technology needs a lot of improvement in order to be at its best levels because in current state the AI isn't mature enough to take financial decisions.

Yeah, I also believe that in future AI will be much better and the amount of errors and uncertainty will be reduced to very low levels. I think it would be far better to learn machine learning yourself if you want to build a good AI software because if someone knows what he/she is doing then things can be according to his/her decisions.

Yeah, I also believe that in future AI will be much better and the amount of errors and uncertainty will be reduced to very low levels. In the future, I have a positive view of the development of AI technology. That AI will probably work very well and be able to analyze massively. Maybe like a super-sophisticated trading robot, able to analyze technical, market trends, issues, global developments, interest rates, inflation rates, etc. so that they can make comprehensive decisions to execute trades. The next question is: what if everyone uses the same AI? is it still effective for trading?Then, if AI is a technology that can learn itself, is it possible that if we write a lot of wrong opinions in the media it will have an impact on AI analysis errors?So, even though AI can be very sophisticated, it would be wise if we only put a little of our money to be managed by AI technology. The main amount of assets or money we still have to control ourselves",
