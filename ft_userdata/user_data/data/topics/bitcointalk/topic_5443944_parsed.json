Is this your official twitter? https://twitter.com/firedao_?lang=enThese days incentive is always become the main reason why people were supporting the project. I can't deny the fact that if how big communites were also affecing how big the hype that can be gotten by a project. You can try to offer some incentives to increase engagement for your project. - Try to create collaboration with good project with massive supporters (expecting you can get some users and followers from there)- Try to give incentive tasks such as bounty, crew3 or galxe. (increasing your audience)",

      "body": "Based on my experience as bounty hunter, I've seen many projects do these steps to  promote their project better. Try to consider the most suitable one for your project1. Create a Strong Online Presence: A strong online presence is essential to promote any project effectively. Make sure you have a well-designed website that is user-friendly and provides detailed information about FireDAO's features and benefits. Besides, consider creating social media accounts on platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, and LinkedIn. Regularly posting engaging content, responding to user queries, and interacting with your followers can help build a strong online community. Bounty could help to reach this achievement.2. Develop a Comprehensive Marketing Strategy: Consider developing a comprehensive marketing strategy that includes both traditional and digital marketing. For instance, you could consider paid advertising on search engines and social media platforms, influencer marketing, press releases, and other forms of content marketing. Ensure that your marketing efforts are consistent, cohesive, and focused on your target audience.3. Leverage Community Building: Community building is crucial for the success of any blockchain-based project. Consider engaging with your community members, conducting AMAs (Ask Me Anything) sessions, and hosting meetups and events. Encourage community members to share their thoughts and feedback on FireDAO and incentivize them to contribute to the project's growth.4. Collaborate with Other Projects and Organizations: Collaborating with other projects and organizations can help expand your reach and build credibility. Look for opportunities to collaborate with other blockchain-based projects or organizations that share similar values or goals as FireDAO.5. Emphasize Your Unique Selling Proposition: Lastly, make sure you emphasize FireDAO's unique selling proposition (USP). Highlight how FireDAO's DID system and SBTs offer a better solution compared to other projects and how they can solve real-world problems. Focus on the benefits that users can derive from using FireDAO, such as transparency, security, and cost-effectiveness.I hope these strategies provide you with some ideas for promoting FireDAO effectively. Good luck!",

There's a lot of projects that I've encountered with unique way of promoting their projects like giving games thru discord or twitter but I suggest twitter since many projects started with discord. But if you want to have a healthy community I think twitter is the answer. Don't forget to add follow your social media accounts whenever you're doing some events and post.",

I have also participated in some projects based on arbitrum that have even issued their arbitrum future tokens and these tokens can be exchange for the real arbitrum once arbitrum launch its own token. These projects were using arbitrum futures token as incentives too. since you were based on arbitrum and it would be so good if you were trying to reach arbitrum to make a partnership with it or at least have some projects that launched in arbitrum as your partner.

Thanks.Social media platforms can do better but of course, it never works so easily and it needs to spend more money. Some developers are using influencers to work and focus on the promotions which I see has a huge impact, it can be so much useful in your case as it was a new project. But it won't just stop there, investors will do the assessment and make their decision not only because of these influencers but also the potentiality of the project. If you have this, success is certainly on your side in the long run.",

Yes, there are some influencers that are promoting some scam projects, but overall, paying them to promote your project isn't a bad idea at all especially if you don't have any intention to scam investors.2. Communication - as a new project, expect lots and lots of question from investors regarding to your project. It's your project so you must know the in's and out's of it. If you can answer all or most of the questions of the investors, that increases the chances of them investing to your project. This isn't a guarantee though, same with the first one.3. Social Media - use the power of the social media. Paid advertisements from different platforms will help your project be promoted. When ICO is on it's hype in 2018, I often see some new ICO projects in my timeline. They are paying to increase their chances of the project being seen online.4. Honesty - show your honesty to your investors and to your community. If they felt that there is something wrong with your project or somebody with the developers are lying with their answers, the investor will just go out immediately and will not invest in your project anymore.There might be some ways still, but these are the things that I know.",

We are open to any advice and also questions that relate to FireDAO. Please share your views. Thanks.Like the things that you're seeing in the forum, make campaigns and bounties that will surely attract more users to your community. Yeah, it's a hard thing to build up a new community coming from scratch and it all requires a lot of effort for you to make it.But not all campaigns and bounties become successful, you as part of the team and project still need to play an important role in making legitimate and bold to what you're promoting. If investors and people that jump from communities to communities see that your community is worth, they'll stay on your side and will even support you if they find your project as a good one to stay with.Agreed and building a community is worth all the time and effort. Bitcoin Forum will be a great part of our community so we are starting from here and hope to attract more people like you who share the same value. Thanks.Yes, you're in the right forum to start it out and you just need to work it out in the best that you can. This forum is a mix of different types of people coming from enthusiasts, investors, traders, and every other type that a community is looking for. You're welcome and I wish that your hard work will be worth it for this project that you're working with it's not just all about attraction because of your marketing but because of how good that's been seen on your project based on what you're projecting and proposing.",

I agree with some members' suggestions, social media outlets should be one of your targets. This forum too because you can interact with investors or those who are interested in what you are building. You can try by also bidding on the first page advertisements. I don't know what is the normal price now but I am sure it is not that expensive. Signature campaigns are also a great help to promote, proven by old companies that stayed here. Just one click away from the investors in our signature and Voila! they are on your page.",

This forum too because you can interact with investors or those who are interested in what you are building. I believe they have money enough for market promotions but what they need is to find an effective way to do that so they won't waste their money. I agree social media is the best venue for promoting their projects but of course, it should be properly planned and let some influence work on it.

However, if we are targeting more investors, we should maximize the use of the internet, not just in this forum only.",
