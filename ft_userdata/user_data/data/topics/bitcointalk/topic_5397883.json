  "content": "House in Portugal sold for 3 Bitcoins in a historic crypto-only saleQuoteIt was reported on May 5 that a property in Braga, Portugal was sold exclusively on the basis of Bitcoin (BTC), with no conversion into euros taking place. With this deal, the real estate business will have seen a first of its sort.The T3 apartment in Portugal was acquired for three Bitcoins, which is equivalent to around 110 thousand euros. Witnesses to the signing of the deed for the apartment house were representatives from the real estate business Zome, the legal firm Antas da Cunha Ecija, the Chairman of Notaries, and other partners from Crypto Valley Switzerland. This is the first time a house is sold in digital asset directly without any conversion to euros. I can't wait to see this replicated in other parts of the world. I sent the link to my friend who is a realtor and asked her if their organization has ever considered selling properties in bitcoin only, she said it's in the pipeline and but it will take a lot of time to achieve. I hope this is proof enough for them to make their decision promptly. I will update this thread when I get more information from my friend.",

I think the buyers are not after short term profit, as it seems they don't care about the loss they are optimistic.Sure thing is that Bitcoin will sure gain its Value. They should have known better of how the market is before making such moves.This should even be the best time to get such, a big profit they'll when Bitcoin price increases ain't it ? I think they did them own research!",

Maybe all the big crypto investors will buy a home now in Portugal   if I had the pocket money I would buy a vacation home there. Also the price of 3 bitcoins seems quite reasonable. I have a Portugese friend who bought an apartment last year for 120k euros which was really old so he had to completely refurbish it. What he told me is that financing is a bit of an issue in the Portugese market right now. Banks are taking very conservative appraisals of properties which results in much smaller loans that will be granted for the purchase. Buyers who can pay the full sum at once are very attractive for the sellers. And with the rising number of crypto investors it makes sense to use bitcoins as a means of purchase.",

The increase was twice what it was in 2019,” said Todd Teta, Chief Product Officer for ATTOM Data Solutions. “Fortunately for recent homebuyers, they have mortgages with super-low interest rates that somewhat contain the cost of homeownership.

But this is really great news compared to the uncertainty and promises from UAE airlines -https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5398471.This is not the1st time that a property has been bought for bitcoin, but in all past cases it happened through the conversion of BTC to $ and the sellers received dollars. But the event that took place in Portugal is undoubtedly unique. This time, the seller received exactly Bitcoin as payment, which indicates a high level of confidence in this financial instrument. This is the perfect visual illustration for all the haters who claim that nothing can be bought for BTC. Here, look, the day has already come when expensive real estate is bought for Bitcoin, and this is just the beginning.Yes, crypto market crashed, but that's just the price of BTC, which will recover over time. But I want to draw attention to something else, that confidence in bitcoin is increasing every day and with every similar event, like the purchase of real estate from the news in this thread.",
