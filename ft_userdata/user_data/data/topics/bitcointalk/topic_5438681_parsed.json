I take it as an entertainment expense, with the difference that from time to time I come out with more money than I put in. So, I don't have to set out to stop, and in fact, there are seasons when I don't gamble, simply because I don't feel like it or because I'm busy and don't even think about it.",

As a kid back then I was into gambling due to the influence of my friends, nothing big, I only played with my friends anw but with money involved but I did realize back then it may lead to something worse if I kept on going on. My girlfriend then also pushed me to stop since she didn't really like me gambling with money, so I stopped that is until at least my 2nd/3rd year of college. Slowly got back to it and here we are now, still gambling but in a balanced way (imo anyway).",

I am sure that most of us hear this coming from a gambler who has intense emotions due to losses and is complaining to the casino that it is not fair, but after the emotions calm down, you see him again depositing money, and after winning some games, he wouldn't be saying anything. Though mostly the reason for this is that they are just addicted or they just can't quit due to their need to earn money.",

I just want to know if this phrase is common among everyone or its just he catch phrase whenever you experiences a big loss. Many people see gambling as a very serious business because it is their full-time job maybe because of unemployment or greed. They put more than what they can afford to lose. The truth is losing in gambling is very painful but you don't need to invest more than you can bear. Like every other form of perceived unethical behavior gambling is addictive. But it is not all gambling addicts that are bad losers. Some people play gambling often, when they lose or gain you might never notice. Betting only on the sports you know doesn't free you from gambling addiction. You can bet only on one sport and still be a strong gambling addict, just ensuree you identify when you are going off-limits. I have never tried stopping gambling because I might have been addicted to other things, but I have never been a gambling addict.",

Before I thought of stopping, I have never thought of stopping gambling before. Some gamblers might tell some people that they have stopped, but not from their mind, maybe that is what happened to your friend, not being truthful with you when it comes to gambling.

But, I always intend to moderate how I play games not to get addicted. Gambling is always fun and I don't intend to make a living through gambling, so it's not something I'm doing too often to an extent of advising myself to stop playing again. Hence, your point has to do with self control, and people with such attitudes gets frustrated from the same game that makes others get happy. I think it's a personal experience and people differs, similarly, we see gambling differently. A player can decide to play black jack and slot games randomly and studying how it works at same time. In the process, they won't get fed up from playing, even while losing funds, because they want to know how the machine works.",

For someone who had just become addicted to gambling and then wanted to stop, it may require willingness. Be it a teen or an adult, to quit gambling after they have been addicted requires willingness. The problem that most addicted gamblers face is that they are not welling to stop, once they think that this is not helping them and can destroy their life as they are addicted and willing to stop, they will stop.Quote from: bittraffic on February 08, 2023, 06:37:56 AMI do gamble with dice and blackjack from time to time but when I lose the amount I allocated for that time, I also quit and let go of the loss. You let go of the loss, but you did not quit gambling, you only stop gambling for awhile for a bad mind not to build up within you at the time which can make you to lose significant sum of money in gambling.",

Some gamblers who are addicted in gambling has a bad habit of going back over and over again despite their claims that they will not gamble anymore. This is because of lack of professional intervention and medical help to get them over their addiction. No necessary treatment and rehabilitation was done in most cases, hence, they end up having a relapse whenever they want to cut gambling off their lives.Some gambler addicts can surpass this challenge all by themselves and with the help of those people around them, but in most instances, they don't fully recover and overcome it because once they decide to flush it from their system, sooner or later, they'll feel the need for it and thus crave for it even more. With this, the outcome is them going back to their old habits and repeating the cycle.",
