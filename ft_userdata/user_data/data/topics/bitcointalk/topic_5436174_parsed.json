How things be dey cheap during their time. How our papas dey tell us with joy how them buy black & white TV for N2, how dem buy motor for N10, how dem buy fridge for N3 etc. Say life been dey sweet that time. I know say when I been dey primary school if you carry N50 go school you be big boy but now things no dey like that because of many reasons. As I go through this table I come see how the fuel prices don increase over the years in the different military and civilian administration. We know that there's high inflation rate worldwide, but could it be the major cause of hike in fuel price in Nigeria? Do you believe that fuel price at some point might go down? is the hike in fuel price in recent years justified?",

The pattern is clear and easy to read as a nigeria.A: FG tells NNPC to increase fuel pump priceB: NNPC refuses and blame marketers and cause artificial scarcityC: Marketers blame FG and sell at exorbitant prices leaving citizens with no alternativesD: FG comes out as an avatar, increase pump price and act as the saviorE: Rinse and repeatHopefully, the people do justice at the polls in february",

The only bad thing be say na d poor masses dey suffer pass 4 everything. God go help us.We Nigerians know that with the way things are in the country already,there is nothing we can ever do about it,and the price of fuel being the way it is,all depends the gains our political leaders are getting from it.Most of them have a share in what is going on in oil sector,and so when the fuel price is this high is when they make much gains,but only God knows how to judge them.We the masses are suffering from it,and infact I can say we are now use to it,we are suffering and at thesame time smiling.God will help us.",

Only last year and this year, we've had 3 different prices majorly because we don't have functioning refinery in an oil based economy like ours and this is because we've not yet prioritize our major source of income as a nation, we are heavily depending on imported products not until Dangote decided to build one refinery which is not enough to satisfy the entire country of a population of over 2 million people. So the government needs to do more in bringing the dead refinery back so we can have a stable PMS pricea at least.",

Fuel has been the driving factor in our economy, we only depend on that particularly across the country and it has landed us in deepest frustration. The price of goods and services, cost of transportation and purchasing power of the Nigerian Naira has failed and is still falling.

I am worried with what you mean by sweet, the only thing we have better than before is only just technology. When we talk about living healthy, back then we barley see cases of financial slavery where a person needs to work for how long to end up earning peanuts, still surprised with you saying life now is better than before, if only we could return back to how it was and enjoy same privilege's.",
