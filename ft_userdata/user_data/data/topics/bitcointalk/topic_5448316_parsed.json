      "body": "You do realize that selling stake accounts is against the ToS right? If caught they will close the account and have the right to keep any and all funds on the account. You also cannot guarantee no other verification/kyc will be requested. Someone could buy an account and 6 months from now win 50k and stake asks for id again to be safe.",
