Well sometimes it is also related but the cryptomarket ecersince has no tally on other field. Its isolated and not tied to any of the stock market but we can always see some conincidence that stocks also go up when this one increases too. People or investors om those also can be the same people for bitcoin.",

That is what happens every time when we see the price in the bitcoin price, but to me, the effect is not completely reflected over every cycle. In the previous cycle if Bitcoin jumps 30% then most altcoins will surge 30% in average but now its not even 10% but random coins jumps 100% in 24 hours and in the next few days it will bleeds out which means the altcoins are only used by bump and dump investors and not for any real use cases.",

Crypto market has always been stirred by the price of bitcoin. Some years ago, bitcoin was the only trading pair for any currencies for the exchanges. Now, USD is more popular but the emotions and trends are still lead by bitcoin. The upcoming bitcoin halving has been one of the reason for the current bull and there ought to be some correction exactly after that. But on a long term there have been ultimate bulls that made bitcoin and most of altcoins hit their all time high.",

It's only whales who will be investing into bitcoin by shelfing off their investments from other sectors.",

Just cant understand what type of bullrun we are really having for now though the price of Btc has risen significantly ,most altcoins are yet to make the move this time which makes me question whether BTC still has the same effect it has in the crypto-market like it has a very years ago.",

We were already at the levels of 44,000 several months ago and we have returned to the same levels again.

BTC makes up more than 50% of market much larger than tens of thousands of other coins combined. And BTC would require to move in order to have an overall trend on the market.There were and are alts that are increasing or decreasing due to their own reasons but when bitcoin moves every of the alts follow. Up or down.It's been predicted that the bitcoin would lose it's market cap superiority for years now but they be holding.",

We know that many are still bullish with Bitcoin and they are expecting a higher price before the year end, so maybe some investors are selling their stocks just to buy Bitcoin.",

I mean, it's something that has happened more than once already I don't think there's much to think about it anymore? I wouldn't necessarily make it a guarantee that when Bitcoin goes up everything goes up, that's just a ticket to losing money but it is expected that the general trend for most coins will go up. The scale may differ though depending on the development of the project still and who knows, some coins might just drop it's price simply because of how bad it is. It's still dependent on the quality of the project behind the coin itself before it can even get swept by Bitcoin going up.",
