  "content": "Closed, as generative AI has made this type of service no longer economically viable.Above image was generated with Stable Diffusion AI, on a gray background, removed by me and photoshopped with the logo&text.Services providedBackground Eraser ServiceWhile other online background erasers require you to purchase a set amount of credits to erase a background with a questionable quality result, my background eraser uses cutting-edge erasing software together with the GIMP editor to erase backgrounds directly. I have a wide variety of tools available for erasing those pesky backgrounds.Laser Eyes ServiceThat's right. I can make laser eyes for your images in ANY color, with variable intensity and adjustable flare length.Pricing (new)New prices!For Background Eraser Service:You pay $5/image. Also I accept batches of images.For Laser Eyes Service:You pay $10 per image. Batches of images are also accepted.For paying: Bitcoin, Lightning Network BTC, ETH (but not stablecoins) and Monero are all accepted.Interested people can contact me by PM or this thread directly.Terms and conditionsThe object you want the background removed must be a closed curve. In other words, the background must not \"leak\" into the object. This is common sense to ensure that the background erasure makes a natural image.Examples of requests that will be rejected:I will not accept graphic/violent or NSFW images.You pay up after I deliver. If for any reason I cannot remove the background, then you don't pay. Unless otherwise communicated in correspondence, you have 48 hours to pay after the result is delivered, otherwise I will classify you as a scammer and take appropriate action.A gallery will be placed here soon, and as a special offer, you can request a free image job all the way through January 1.",

You call it a background eraser, but you could actually also remove writings from a background right? Let me post you an example here, but no need to adjust it just yet. Could you remove the \"lorem ibsum\" stuff, but keep the same background and then even add some writing below \"Innovative Technologies\" with the same font color? Again, nice work and thank you! Edit: And would you be able to move the knee closer to the writing? Like cutting out a little bit more than 1/5th in the middle of the picture such that the left side of the knee is a little bit below or very close to \"Innovative Technologies\"?",

Unfortunately, it is pirated, because Adobe won't accept any of my prepaid cards and also because I also need this for work. I'd really like to pay for it, but it is what it is Recent versions of Photoshop have a button \"Select Subject\". This uses AI to detect a person and select it. It's part of a module called \"Sensei\" that's bundled with Adobe products.They have a promotional page about it apparently: https://www.adobe.com/sensei.htmlQuoteDo you accept only Bitcoin, or Lightning Network payment is also possible?I have LN support in my Electrum wallet but it says I can only send coins in channels, not receive them.

I tried it, but the result looks unnatural and... weird, because the two tendons become thin lines not attached to anything.So going forward, objects are required to be closed curves in order for me to remove their backgrounds.Also, I'll probably charge an extra fee if I have to clean up items on top of the object, like that line w/ circle in the original image. Took me two hours just to get rid of it with the clone stamp and also make sure its pixels were completely gone.Still two demo orders left",
