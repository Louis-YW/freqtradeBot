Shouldn't you be considering a scenario where prices will be lower?In that case, how would BTC perform?

It appears there might be a soft landing instead of a crash and when they cut it , it will be because employment is still strong but inflation is under control.Will this work? It’s hard to tell.

Take note that they continue to do this despite the fact that the situation is ATH. However, when we get to the bottom line, the relationship between liquidity and volatility is complicated and nuanced. While there is a historical link, different circumstances can impact this relationship, making it critical to assess the larger market situation and do thorough analysis before making investment decisions.",

This is the trouble I had, well I had plenty of troubles in my life financially and I am in by far the worst financial situation of my entire life right now, but even I would spend some money on something if I think that I will need it in the future and I will end up spending more later on.Why not make a 100 dollar debt today, when you know you are going to spend 220 in 8 months? That's why people spend a lot more, anything like 10%+ increase in price for something means that it would be smarter to buy earlier, because rates would be lower, and you would be able to pay a lot less interest and yet save money anyway. I have done this many times, maxed out my credit card, had a huge debt, but had nothing else to buy but food, that's it, just food, and that's the most important thing a person could have in that regard.",

Money is always moving around in markets somewhere, but you may be overlooking a large correlation that takes place and is the impetus for rate cuts - recession. The fed mostly raises rates when it looks like the markets are overheating and there is too much money sloshing around, credit is too easy to come by. The aim of raising rates is to slow down that easy cash and encourage savings, but this often goes too far the other way and can trigger a recession. So there may be another recession around the corner, but that is likely the real reason the stock market crashes but could also be independent from rate changes. When rates fall, people start pulling money out of bonds and savings in search of better returns, that cycle often starts a long time before when it comes to professional traders.",

I think that when it comes to some basic needs and a little more than that, we cannot expect people to refrain from spending money and buying something even if they know that in x months the same thing or service will be xx% cheaper.No one can wait to buy gifts for the Christmas and New Year holidays, or to repair a leaking roof - but they could definitely think about it when it comes to buying a new car or some expensive device.Quote from: takuma sato on December 14, 2023, 04:07:48 AMIn that case, how would BTC perform? Will it successfully decouple from the markets, or is it going to mimick SP500 and just crash harder? Will the ETF hype + halving be enough to counteract these dynamics? I believe that the next year is specific because of the halving and the possible approval of the spot ETF, so I personally expect that the price of Bitcoin will achieve a new ATH considering that this year (so far) we have had a growth of over 100%. Taking that into account, I believe that $80k to $100k by the end of next year is a realistic price to expect, even if the spot ETF is not approved.",

But those rates are insanely high if you consider the current amount of debt. How realistic is that interest rates goes to double figures? It's not the same as 20 years ago, now debt is higher, the higher the debt, the less leverage they have to make higher rates viable, this is why I think the market is betting on the rates going low, and even long term rates are considered to be good enough to start going low, meaning that people are buying TLT at current prices because they see it going lower, they don't believe the FED is going to be able to sustain anything above 4% for any longer. And as you can see on the link I posted, whenever rates have gone down, a recession kicked in and SP500 dumped. I want to see how will BTC perform in such scenario, considering that BTC has just followed SP500 more or less so far. Gold used to perform well in those scenarios, we'll see how BTC does. I think a TLT+BTC+some SP500 just in case we have a soft landing, would be a good bet.",

They said they will leave them high for as long a needed, but you already know if the market starts crashing, specially during election years, they are going to lower rates again, which will cause inflation to go up, which will make the FED raise again, but this time even higher, and that will as well cause an even bigger recession. Im not sure 2 figure inflation rates are sustainable at the current debt levels. Who knows how much shit will break at these rates. So the FED has to pick their poison at this point.",

Let's take a first example with those who invest in the cryptocurrencies as they buy the currencies when the prices of the crypto is low and with that, they have the advantage of buying more money to hold and having the opportunity to get it cheaper than the upward trend. These investors they wait until the market is saturated and have decided to rise in the upward market trend before they come out to release those coins for transactions. The same thing applies to the forex market.Secondly, this is seen in the commodity exchange market where countries and individuals go out to purchase more commodities when the prices of those items shoot up in the market. You find people buying goods to stock because they heard a news of the prices going up and need to get the more quantity of the same value than they will get if the market rises.Lastly is seen in the oil and gas industry where people rush to buy PMS when the are pretty cheaper you will find get to see situations where people store more on their cars especially as seen in developing countries during festive periods.",
