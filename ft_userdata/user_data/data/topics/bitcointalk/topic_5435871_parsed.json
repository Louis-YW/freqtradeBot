There are 2 answers to the question, depending on how you look at the question.1 answer, which you can get a reasonably close guess to is how much work of SHA-256 hashes has gone into the blockchain that we can calculate. That you can get a reasonably close answer to.What we can NEVER know, is how many miners spent how much time hashing away never finding a hash that solved a block. Can't even reasonably guess since we don't know what we don't know. i.e. I could have 1PH sitting here mining to a private solo pool for a year and never found a bock so nobody outside of me would know it existed. And if it DID find a block you would never know if I had a massive farm or 1 USB stick and just got really really lucky.-Dave",

And if it DID find a block you would never know if I had a massive farm or 1 USB stick and just got really really lucky.Of course, you don't know with mathematical certainty, but when it comes to 1 PH, it is 10^15 hashes. For such huge numbers, mathematical probability is very close to reality. So, based on chainwork, you know that it is very unlikely that there are million solo miners with 1 PH each, because it would be 1000 EH, so some of them would find at least some blocks (and they would collectively have more power than the whole network).Also, SHA-256 is not a pure random hash function, based on ideal conditions. It is pseudorandom. You can test it, and you will discover, that when you calculate a lot of hashes, then doing it in a brute force way will give you results, that are close to pure luck. And of course, it is possible to find some faster way than brute force, but then we would need a new hash function, rehashing the chain, and things like that.So, even if it is impossible to reach 100% accurate results, it is possible to estimate. And that estimation should be sufficient for everything we need. Because you don't need to know, how many physical particles are in a ton of sand. You know that it has 1000 kg, for example with 1 kg accuracy, and you don't need the exact result in the smallest physical unit.",

But, I [wait for it] can't prove it.We know about the big pools, we know about the small pools, we know about the occasional unknown block that pops up. Most people think that the number of people solo mining to pools they setup themselves is small as in dozens at most. I think it's way higher then that. But we never see them because the \"paranoid tinfoil hat brigade\" that does not trust mining pools and thinks they can do better themselves because all the pools are out to get you are a lot more common then we see here. But, we will never see them get a block or even know they exist because their crap setups could never find a block even with all the hash in the world. But they are doing it themselves because they know better. You see these people pop up in the hardware and pool board now and then.In terms of BTC itself they really do not matter, but and I guess we will have to disagree here, saying that you can use stats to find them is not a realistic thing because they are hashing to find a block but they never will and cannot and there is no way to even know they exist. I can take you to a data center in NY where someone is paying probably close to $1k a month to run a bunch of S19 that mine to his super special custom coded pool that is going to get a block real soon now.......-Dave",

But, I [wait for it] can't prove it.All of the hash power that is out there is hash power that we don't know about. Miners don't report their hash rates. They only way we can estimate network hash rates is by looking at how fast blocks are being produced.We can infer that the expected number is relatively close to the actual number because, for example, if the actual number were twice as much, we would expect to have twice as many blocks.Think of it this way: The difficulty determines the expected number of hashes needed to find a block, regardless of who is doing the hashing.Here is a simple example: suppose you have a group of people, each rolling a 6-sided die as fast as they can, and in order to win a round a 1 has to be rolled. Because the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, we know that it takes an average of 6 rolls to roll a 1. It doesn't matter who is rolling their die, or how fast they are rolling it. It will take an average of 6 rolls. Sometimes it takes more and sometimes it takes less, but the expected number of rolls is 6 for each round.Now, the actual number of rolls is probably very different from 6 for each round, but as more and more rounds are played, the actual number is likely to get closer and closer to the expected value. That is the purpose of the standard deviation. The standard deviation measures the probability the actual number of rolls being different from the expected number of rolls by a certain amount.Again, none of this is actual measurement. It is all probability. When you can't know the actual count, you can still compute the expected count and you can compute the quality of that value (in terms of probability).",
