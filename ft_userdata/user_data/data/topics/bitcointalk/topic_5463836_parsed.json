On the same time you can visit multiple tarckers to obtain a wider range of results because as I said every tracking platform have some policies to list the project. Loss & Gains in the 24 hours can be easily obtained by visiting a few platforms but when you are looking for the top gainers and losses in your desired timeframe here things are not that easy, MEXC is one of those exchanges list new projects regularly you can also look there for pump and dump trades, most of the meme coins are listed there. Please explain the term given time.... Also Wy London time SUI... cant understand what are you trying to ask or explain.",

Even if its not, it should come in handy for you. Since we're still in the bear market, most large - mid caps barely do any quick moves enough for a clean scalp so you might one to look at those ultra low-cap altcoins. If you know what you're doing, you should be able to milk as much as possible since you'll only do quick trades on them. Its worth noting that this category of crypto assets comes with additional risks as their prices are very volatile on either sides.",

It's good platform for me to determine the most gainers because there are lot of coins or tokens in this site.QuoteI doubt if there is any. The crypto market especially the altcoin market is very unpredictable and easily manipulatedI would suggest that if you want to scalp in crypto other than Bitcoin, choose only in the top 10 altcoins in the Coinmarketcap because these coins are very strong and has low volatility. I just want to say that Bitcoin is the best for scalping.",

In the crypto market, people implementing strategies in trading, whether it's for altcoins or Bitcoin, of course have their own references, be it commodities, securities or types of crypto/altcoins they want to trade.But I haven't seen and found a crypto trading platform that leads to Scalping, what else leads to a form of manipulation of the crypto market or the creation of a bid-ask spread, as far as I know there is no notice or gap from the exchange owner.",

So you might find day trading much more rewarding than holding. With Bitcoin it's the other way around. But then again it all depends on how good of a trader you are.",

However if you need strong warning, you can see Terra, FTT and Solana tokens as well as more tokens which were considered very potential in 2021 to 2022 bull market.In bear market, what we are in, pump and dump games are more easily to cause you losses.",

It also has an integration of the fundamentals along with the projects and any coins. Not only the change in price,  there's also news, and crypto related updates. Well of course, the market cap of new coins will be lower compare to top 10 coins, that's why small movement of it will be a lot of returns compare to raw BTC.",

While it may be tempting to take advantage of the price fluctuations of these coins, their low liquidity will prevent you from selling your coins at the desired price. In addition, low liquidity can lead to an increase in the spread between the bid and ask price, which will increase trading costs. Usually, traders are engaged in scalping on coins with good liquidity.",

I think the best chance you have is the last 1 hour, that is available everywhere, even in cmc you could see it happen and in the last 1 hour you are going to see some of them grow a lot. Yes the 5 minute logic could work, something that went up highest for the last 5 minutes, may continue to go up more and you will be able to get in and get out before anyone else that way to make a profit.But also you should remember that buying something just because of hype means that you could be buying a pump and you would be left with the dump as well and you would be losing a lot of money. You should be careful about it and not risk too much of your money to it.",
