      "body": "That depends on what kind of return you would like to get in long term or short term. If you can take risk then look into meme coins, otherwise look for layer two projects that are making big difference. Meme coins are for short term gain if you can hold them for 180 days. Layer 2 project for a long term gain for about 2 years. Before making any investment always do your own research and don't follow anyone blindly.",

But if you want to play safe then there is no safer option that ETH when it comes to altcoin, though the growth wouldn't match up to other altcoins which will rise and fall during this period but ETH will have extended bullish run like we witnessed during 2018. Better to monitor the market rigorously and take the right call at the right movement and stick to the principle of risk management as well by using stop loss and take profits effectively.It won't be same coins like BNB, SOL and etc.",

You already made the right choice to hold those reputable coin but if i were you I don't mind still doing DCA to accumulate more bitcoin before comes the halving if you are only concerned about the profits that is come during process.ETH BNB MATIC seems very cool with me but if you don't mind I will always tell an altcoin investors not to hold for long because the lost after halving are always not bearable, to remain at the safer side learn to keep increasing your portfolio before next year.",

Any altcoins in general will sky rocket but your safe choice will be the next altcoin to Bitcoin when it comes to marketcap. You can use coinmarketcap or coingecko to check altcoins ranking and purchase the top altcoin to have a better chance that it will pump along with Bitcoin in long term.Just remember that altcoin pump usually delayed when Bitcoin is rallying hard but it will follow later on once Bitcoin dominance already weaken.",

These two are also didnt experience the bull season so chances that they gonna do a solid movement and probably new ATH. But theres a lot of other choices much better scattered the funds to most choices or alts. Of course dont forget to bag some bitcoin too.",

While bitcoin will keep its momentum high before and after bitcoin halving, some highly potential altcoins will do the same. However, I can't pinpoint which will be the most profitable altcoin that will go along with bitcoin this time, but if you want to play safe and invest safe, I suggest that you prioritize ethereum over other altcoins. Ethereum is next to bitcoin when it comes to its security, although some random altcoins may offer bigger profits than ethereum at some point.As always, research is the key. Don't just jump to investing, but know first the background and history of every coin because that could also help in determining which coin is safe to invest.",

Unlike BSV, bitcoincash has a large userbase. I have personally  seen merchants  accepting bitcoincash as payment. The transaction fee are low and the speed is quick. They are in the top 20 coins by marketcap and even if it's not as large as bitcoin, it surely has a larger potential for growth.I'd not recommend ETH, BNB and SOL as ETH is already high and difficult to transact, BNB is struggling with Binance controversy while SOL is already x3.",

If you plan to hold long term, it would be okay to go with any coin you believe would work. But if you plan to hold for selling around the next halving, you should consider investing on the altcoins that haven't had a significant price boost last too months. One of them is Litecoin, they haven't increased more and whales are accumulating it. Another option is BNB, with the controversy around binance, it could stay low for further 3 months but the current price is good enough to start accumulating.",

      "body": "Well, Ethereum is also increasing in value and I guess Bitcoin has a lot to do with that. Most of the time that coin is being pulled up by Bitcoin whenever it is pumped. That's your best next choice if you are looking for altcoins. I'd choose BNB next to it, I actually have some of it in my stash just to be ready in case a pump happens again and if it will also be pulled up. BNB has a working project and it helps traders to have a cheaper trading fee so most likely there's a high usage of the coin which is why its value sticks with 3 digits. I'd stick with those three for now. I lack funds to buy others and I am trying to just focus on Bitcoin for now. Many things are about to happen so it's a good thing to hoard as much as possible in the legal way. ETF is just around the corner, halving is also happening, and so it means more eyes will be on Bitcoin and maybe more investors will come and buy to avoid being in FOMO.",

But if you like to diversify your investment then first you have to know that there is risk in altcoins than bitcoin and as you mentioned Ethereum, BNB and USDT are some of top altcoins alongside with bitcoin which one can invest to see in the coming bull market. I have not heard of SOL coin so I can't recommend that for you. But if you know it very well and you know that it will not disappoint you in the future and it will appreciate in the future even not in this coming bull market but later in the years it will make some value in the ecosystem then you are free to invest in it.There are sometimes you follow your instincts to invest or do something and not necessarily that you must follow people opinion. General opinion in some cases might even confused you what to do so follow your mind.",

All of those that you've mentioned are good, as long as you think that you've got a bunch of Bitcoins that you're satisfied to hold until the halving.

In such a scenario investors who have been holding it for years will be able to recover their losses. Looking back its historical performance, XRP has achieved all time high of $4 approximately, which can be broken in future. However, the major concern lies in its substantial supply of 100 Billion tokens.Regarding BNB, it seems prudent to stay away from it, until its legal issues are completely resolved.",

The thing with altcoin is that they pump in price with hype and trends. Bitcoin halving is a great thing for those altcoins to get a decent pump but that's just it. After that is over, it will kiss the ground in no time. Some will survive but hard to tell which one it's going to be. Not to mention that they are all centralized. So whatever you do, learn to read the hype, trend and market pattern. Then you can have a decent profit out of it. One advice from me is that it's Bitcoin halving. So focus more on BTC. ALtcoin season comes after the BTC pump. Make a good profit from BTC then use that profit to make more profits from altcoins. More profits means you can take more risks and diversify your investment",

There's still some gains but the impact will be little because the other altcoins that you might choose could be dropping.While some of yours are pumping.
