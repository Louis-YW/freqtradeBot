  "content": "There is no way you will think about this current economy in Nigeria you will not share tears for Nigeria. I thought I have seen it all for poor economy until I saw this new economy that is coming like what will end many people lifes in the land and, the new officials are not coming with minds of fighting some of the things that caused all those things to happened in the past government. I thought that what we saw in Jonathan economy is a worst economy to the citizens of Nigeria until I seen Buhari economy that turned to fire into the lifes of the citizens, were the price of commodities increase double, and cashless politics was like fuel pumping the hardship that made many youths to start finding their way to other countries to save their lifes, and many Â industries stopped working for Buhari regime because of the huge amount of taxes the government officials was generating from the companies that was accommodating some citizens to have something to earn monthly to fend their families, and it caused many companies to fold up and many citizens went with frustration.I thought, I have seen it all until I begin to see some things that is worst than the previous economy. I used to buy a liter of fuel #180 in Buhari regime but, since we entered this new regime the price of fuel hit #500 that made many things to went wrongs in the Nigeria economy and the worst thing is that the new government is not bring any strategies that will improve the weak economy. This is my question, How will Nigeria economy look like when this new government is approaching her second tenure? Because the way the new government economy look like now show, that we are about to enter disaster that will make other country to take over the country.What is your opinion my Naija people.",

We don dey use to this system for some time now. I no think say Nigeria go get better anytime soon. Because the curruption wey you see so them don plant am since and now e don germinate come spread every part of the country. And now the country rulership dey for some set of people hand. When democracy don turn favouritism wetting you expect. Party system cause many problem for the country. If not corruption how Tinubu go talk say na him turn to rule Nigeria and him definitely show say na him turn. You know why? him don plant people for every sector so any sector you dey go gum body him don already get there. So for me the best way na to desolve the system. Even when Nigeria protest for lekki tole gate, wetting happen? Dem open fire and kill innocent people. And nothing Dem do about am because the judiciary sector also dey in control of see catel. If you want peace to dey for Nigeria na if you go fit Eliminate each an every one of those set wey keep Nigeria for this situation.",

Buhari took over, we realised that we missed an Angel in Goodluck Jonathan. Now Buhari has finished dealing with us and handed us over to Tinubu to finish us kpata-kpata.To make it worse, this government seems not to know how to get this Economy right,so I think we're headed to more doom. APC will really deal with us",

Before now we complained of past economies and after every administration, the complaint increases, this current complaint won't be the last. A more disoriented economy will still be faced if we continue to have this mindset of chop make I chop. Government use opportunity to loot our resources when they are in power. This will lead us to nowhere if we continue with this.Â  The hardship we face on a daily basis alone is capable of leading one to depression, we say the leaders are the problem, but how are we sure that we'd ever have a better leader because as it stands, the situation is every preceding leader tends to be better than the current leader. Who knows the leader that awaits us after now? Nigeria is really in a state of jeopardy and there's no help coming. Back then when life was easier, yet still we complained. Saddest part is economy depreciates, standard of living gets too high, income remains dormant. How will one live through this hurdle?",
