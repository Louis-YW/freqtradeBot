Looks like a scheme to scam donations on his weird page he made. Just to clarify-We never held this user's money-Itâ€™s all fabricated, fake emails etcSo you are a proven liar and scammer, and you want high rollers to contact you because you have an \"offer\" for them? Well, good luck with that!",

I don't think that anyone on this forum will fall into trap of such scammers because everyone knows that newbie account if trying to do something without any valid proof is a sign of a scam. I have seen so many such newbie accounts on lending board where they are asking for non-collateral loans, and then claiming that they will give 20% to 50% interest for a weekly loan which is totally unthinkable by lenders because such type of interests are just shown to scam money out of the pockets of those lenders. The guy is trying to find a Stake high-roller who is doing $100k daily wages, but he doesn't know that those high rollers don't have time to reply to such useless threads because they are already earning a lot of money using gambling, and they don't need anyone's interference with their earnings. I hope that @OP has understood that he won't get anything by creating such posts and soon he will stop doing such kind of activities.",

If you want people to consider your offers, you should consider building an accounts reputation and not be a pop up guy looking to make a quick buck on the forum. As already stated, high rollers are not going to really read this offer as they likely do not even visit this section of the forum.",

With all of those inconsistent threads made by OP, he did even claimed that stake had an agreement with him and the issue he has thrown to them has been solved which isn't likely because stunna left him negative trust rating saying that he has made a fake news. I think that with this offer OP trying to do has something to do with bonuses that he wants to take advantage of those gamblers that has this account but @sam is right, those high rollers are most likely not even active in any place like this.",
