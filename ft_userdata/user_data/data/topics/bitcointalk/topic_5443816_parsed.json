I'm pretty sure that you don't even know that there are other parts of this forum, you're only interested in the lending section because you somehow thought that free money is being distributed here.You've already been told countless times that you won't get a loan here, and anyone with at least a little bit of personal integrity would give up asking for money here after that.",

If someone needs/wants a loan and can repay, then he has the right to ask for it. Same as if someone trusts him to repay it is their right to loan him. Either way it's none of your business.Exactly, it is none of the OP’s business why someone wants a loan every week. It may not be good for a lender to continue this with a customer unless they get collateral as “payday” type loans are typically rated as high riskThe payday lending business is huge, lots of people live payday to payday and if you are living like that all it takes is to get behind 1 or 2 weeks and you will need to take a high interest payday loan just to pay the rent, keep the lights on or food on the table. The problem usually lies in that once you start with very high interest loans, you may need to take a few before you are back on your feet again, they are designed to trap people. At least the BTC payday type loans here are low interest compared to payday lending.In most occasions it’s probably for gambling, but so what, you are not the lender so why care?",

      "body": "mnightwaffle has been taking regular loans here for years now, as far as I know he has always repaid, so if I was a lender I would consider giving him small non collateral loans, but would request collateral for any amount of 0.01 BTC or greater, this is based on what I am willing to risk and what I can afford to risk. If someone else wants to give him 1btc as a non collateral loan big deal, that’s between themAnd yes, lending a non reversible currency on an internet forum to a gambler is high risk, no matter which way you try to spin it.I must say that in no way do I know if mnightwaffle is a gambler or not, he may just be like a great percentage of the population living payday to payday and can’t find a way out of the situation. He may even lack ID and this is his only possible way of getting a loan.At the end of the day it comes back to the same question, what business is it of yours?I know you are just asking out of curiosity but that information should remain private between the lender and borrower unless they both agree to share it, like in a public post",
