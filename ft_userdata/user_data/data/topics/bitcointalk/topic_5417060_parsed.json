The intended purpose of this thread is to give constant updates of the progress and receive your feedback on how to develop various areas better. The current progress is as follows.The name of the project is CryptoWildy and we have currently acquired all the social media accounts for this project. The most activity is taking place on the Discord server. The total number of the tokens have been created on the Polygon blockchain. We will run the game using the Polygon blockchain because it has proven itself to be the best so far. Currently I am working on launching a landing page for the project to get the first sign ups for the project news going.",

      "body": "You can also add your announcement thread. Since it is a token, add it on Tokens (Altcoins).However, you mentioned it as a game, so it's most likely an NFT game which could also be on the same section I have said. And post all of your updates on this or new thread you will make on that section. That's what most of the projects do, they are using that thread as interaction to their possible investors ans holders.",

I think it's best for your project to be known so posting links regarding your social media is a must for it to be followed by people. You mentioned discord group maybe you can add that too on your opening post.",

Honestly, you don’t have to post here your every progress, better to post here once the project is already ok and that is a good time to create a more attractive ANN Thread. I see this as game, it can be more good if it’s a play to earn game. Just keep on working for this project to be more ok, many will surely appreciate this project.",
