The cryptospace is a comedy show that never stops to give us funny jokes and it is being run by the most funny jokers, hustlers, weirdos and criminals. Someone might tell me that I am being antagonistic again and they will say that Wall Street also being run by criminals. Agreed, however, there is a difference. The criminals in Wall Street are those who rule the country, the criminals in the cryptospace are the jokers and the hustlers who founded crypto companies.Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the founders of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), are hoping to raise $25 million to start a new crypto exchange called GTX, according to two separate pitch decks obtained by The Block.News of the fundraise comes two months after exchange giant FTX imploded, leaving more than a million creditors out of pocket. The new exchange takes advantage of the situation offering depositors the ability to transfer their FTX claims to GTX and receive immediate credit in a token called USDG, the pitch deck said. The exchange’s name is even a spin on “FTX,” with one of the GTX pitch decks opening with the line \"because G comes after F.\" Read in full https://www.theblock.co/post/202589/3ac-zhu-davies-new-crypto-exchange",

Imagine if it was someone ordinary, they would be behind bars by now.",

On the other, we have Sam Bankman-Fried, Do Kwon, Su Zhu, Kyle Davies, among a number of others who misuse and even steal people's hard-earned money not only free but also able to plan or even pursue new projects to probably steal some more. This is another confirmation that our justice system has never been about justice. But if this is the result of the market being unregulated, then by all means I welcome regulation.",

This kind of thinking is what makes crypto market a shit show. People is still taking the risk even with the obvious scam attempt just because the people behind came from huge company.I’m sure this project will still raised that max capped considering how dumb the crypto community just to chase profit quickly despite the high risk involved.",

But this is the essence of the market itself that they're free from restrictions if they're clear from the past ruckus they've made, although are they really free?I understand your sentiment and it sucks that these companies will just to relaunch after getting f***** with their customers fund. I'm sure that many have learned the lesson the hardest way.And in good will that they'll just stop supporting them because the government can't do such if they'll reason out they've gone through the process of their relaunch legally.",

When people throw million at Ponzi schemes, investor bail out three times in a year a company with no product whatsoever, what's $25 million on a project like one hundred others? Just wait for it, in a few months we will get the news about successful funding and I would not raise an eyebrow if in the list of those backers you'll see companies that have lost money over FTX.",
