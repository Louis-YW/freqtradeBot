Such messages are often available on Telegram, but do not fall for them. There was nothing about coin flashing But I think by coin flashing he means he will increase your coins amount  But don't rely on them all your money to invest will be lost. From this you put your coins in staking. It will gradually increase the amount but it will protect you from scamming.",

Pretty sure anything that asks for money in return for profit (that is guaranteed) already screams a scam, no matter the type or form, any investment would always have the risk of you losing money. So if someone approaches you with a \"foolproof\" strategy of investment, then it's basically a scam. It seems that in this case though, they'd ask you for money and send you a transaction proof they did by using Flash BTC I think? Found the same source as Maus, not familiar with it though nor do I actually know how it works. Just ignore the person who approached you OP.",

What I know is that in cryptos there are flash loans but I think they are totally different from this one.Anyway, if someone approaches you and asks you something (preferably coins) then that is suspicious as they can be a scammer and willing to empty your wallet so please be careful with random people as you don't really know if what is their true intentions. Just stick only on the common technologies in cryptos as they are already proven.",

This means that someone who is targeted will continue to be promised to multiply their coins or give a discount on some transactions made. it's better to avoid all that. a stranger who suddenly opened a chat certainly had a hidden meaning. I never trust someone who sends messages on social media like on telegram and twitter. it is a nest of scammers.I hope the OP will not fall about the promise of this coin flashing.Which, is not really a normal practice in this crypto market, because it is more on the scam side.People are getting trapped because of this type of promise, getting attracted with high profits at a short period of time.There are so many sites now offering high percentage of return in short period of time, but mostly, you won't get even your initial investments.As this site will give you your earnings in the first few payouts, but later on, they will find excuses or worst, their site will be closed down.",
