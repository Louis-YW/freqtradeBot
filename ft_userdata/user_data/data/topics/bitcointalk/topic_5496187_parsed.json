If you invest $20, 000 you can expect big profit.¬† Also, Bitcoin investment makes you feel you will not experience third party issues.",

And it's still running? That will definitely be the longest scam running, assuming bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large wasn't real.",

Please construct a better post next time. There are so many kinds of investments and they all look different especially not all investors are the same.Some of them invested only a little while some a huge amount. Some invested in short term while some for long term. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with asking questions but please do research a bit before you do.",

The only people who might have totally different feelings are those early investors who have invested in Bitcoin long enough and, in fact, have made Bitcoin part of their lives as they enjoy both the investment benefits and the information shared among the Bitcoin community.¬†Anyone who wants to invest in Bitcoin and enjoy their investment should invest in it with money; they might not need it anytime soon. That way, they won't be bothered and worried about how the market moves, and when it drops, they will just see the ecosystem and things happening as fun instead of dropping down emotionally with every price drop in the market.",

If yes you should know what it is already or you want to know how it works before you would invest? Sometimes we should try as much to keep a straight forwarded question so that we can also be clearly be responded to.I would only tolerate with this because this is a Bitcoin discussion board and a learning investment platform so anything is expected.Up to your question, Bitcoin is a digital currency created in a blockchain of a non-custodial network which is served for alternative source for payments on a P2P digital networking.Concerned Bitcoin holders can as much hold the digital currency for assets due to the fact that it is a volatile currency that has the potentials of enrichment scheme but not in a sudden quick riches.You can as well trade your Bitcoin to fiats in an exchange platform.The contexts to your question was lik asking to know about Bitcoin network in a general overview.Here I got on a research for you if that would offer what you expected.What is Bitcoin? How to mine, buy and use it",

Bitcoin is very real, it's adoption as one of the best investments is because of the reputation that it has built over the years, that it's an asset that will keep increasing in value and on the long term continue to give it's holders increased ROI.",

If you really want to invest and start on it take your time and learn it, I mean you are already here in the forum, there is already enough information here just to learn the basics.I always advise this to newbies, one thing that they should do is learn what is Bitcoin investment and then if they already have the knowledge and they think that they know what they are doing already they should start investing right away because the best time to invest is right now if you're going to wait for the right timing, it might not come since you cannot predict the movement of the market, I mean your not really going to buy only once the key here is to accumulate Bitcoin overtime, Dollar Cost Averaging is always the best strategy to lower the risk of your investment except of course if you have a huge money where you could buy a huge amount of Bitcoin at once.",

Because I know there are so many people that want to get into it, but they fill is not real, so I want to get some ideas from anybody that know how it's work please üôè.You can invest in Bitcoin in mainly two ways which are as a long-time holder or trader. Those who keep Bitcoin for a long period until the price goes up are usually long-term investors. While traders buy and sell based on daily, weekly, or monthly predictions. Investing in Bitcoin is just the same thing as putting money into other businesses. The only difference is that you need to understand the Bitcoin ecosystem before investing. If you are a long-term investor, you just need to seek a means of acquiring Bitcoin, maybe from an exchange or P2P and keep the money safe on a decentralized open-source wallet. A hardware wallet will be a better option if you can afford it. The next phase is to learn how to keep your investment safe. You would have to keep the coin for a long time until the price gets to the level you want it before you sell and collect your profit.",
