Only the reboot command exists on the FMS tool.About remoting a miner outside your home I think you will need to set up a VPN for this to be able to access it even if you are far from home.",

I'm interested in building something similar to those Box. thanks for design ideas if there tips based on your experience, I'd love to hear them.In my case, it's currently profitable for me to mine, so I'm looking to optimize my setup.Regarding remote software for monitoring and control, do you have any recommendations for software that allows me to control my ASIC miners? I've been using FMS, but I've encountered limitations with specific commands. I'm considering developing an automation script to schedule mining during high-performance hours and power off during the night. Any insights on which software might work best for this purpose would be greatly appreciated.Thanks again for your help!",

I'm considering developing an automation script to schedule mining during high-performance hours and power off during the night. Any insights on which software might work best for this purpose would be greatly appreciated.I think Awesomeminer supports this unit model but I don't know if it supports schedule/automation for this unit. Another problem is this tool needs a paid subscription so not worth using if you only have one unit.So only the FMS tool that I could recommend if you can't find other commands from the FMS tool there is a list of commands that I know check my post below also check the link for APIs you can maybe able to use them in your unit.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381842.msg59012568#msg59012568Take note you still need to set up a VPN or SSH tunnel if you want to connect to your home network while you are outside I think TeamViewer is fine if you have an extra PC that you can run 24/7 in your home or only run it when you go outside.",

Another problem is this tool needs a paid subscription so not worth using if you only have one unit.Awesomeminer is free for 2 units but with limited features, I don't know how limited those are but he could try, and then the paid version is $4 for every 2 miners, I don't recall how the free version works but with the paid subscription you can do pretty much everything you can imagine with it, besides, Patrike and his team are beyond helpful, even for the features that don't exist by default you could just request them and they will add them (speaking based on personal experience).However, since this is just a single unit he is better off just installing Anydesk on a local PC, accessing the PC from the outside using is smartphone or laptop, and then logging in to the miner webpage and adjusting it, for monitoring purposes however, he is going to need a dedicated software for that like Awesomeminer.And as for the cooling, one thing I can tell you is that if you use the stock fans you won't reduce much noise + heat will still be an issue, you need to use an inline fan with a higher cfm than the stock, then buy or print fan shroud to connect the inline fan to the miner, a good inline fan will do double the cfm for half the noise, better cooling, and a lot less noise without using any sort of boxes.",

      "body": "Thank you for your information; it has been incredibly helpful in managing my AvalonMiner. I found a command to shut down the miner, which can be quite useful: {\"command\":\"ascset\", \"parameter\":\"0,hashpower,0\"}. You can find more details about this command in https://github.com/Canaan-Creative/avalon10-docs/blob/master/Universal%20API/Avalon%20A10%20API%20manual-EN.md#28--shut-down-hash-powerAs for monitoring the miner from outside my home, I'll certainly explore your recommended method. Connecting my PC or even via a Raspberry Pi sounds like a promising solution, and I believe it will provide the remote access I need. I'm currently working on optimizing the cooling system for the miner box to reduce the temperature by an additional 3 or 4 degrees to ensure it stays below 35°C. Your advice has been instrumental in this process, and I truly appreciate your input.",

I don't think it would work to reduce the temp but I think if you can put an exhaust fan on the end of the duct hose it would help to exhaust hot air out compared to adding a fan on the box but you can try and let see if it would help to reduce the miner temp.",
