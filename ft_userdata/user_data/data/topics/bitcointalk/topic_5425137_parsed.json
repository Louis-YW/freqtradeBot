Not sure if it will work. I guess there's only one way to find out.",

The phone has to run 24/7 connected to power and processing transactions constantly. That means heat and also the battery life could be a concern too.",

I had a bad experience in the past when I tried downloading large files in a similar manner [it kept getting corrupted, so I had to redo it in another way] + I have a feeling it might drain the battery faster than it could be recharged [in \"some\" of the older phones]!",
