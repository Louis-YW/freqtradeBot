But then again, maybe there is manipulation or what as the price surges as high as $27,250++ if I'm not mistaken.But now, it seems that there are short selling as the price is now at $26,200. So we might say that the impact is not that significant. Although this news is big if I'm not mistaken, but maybe effects are going to be short term only.",

      "body": "SEC and their problem: the news was not shocking to me anyway; it was already expected a long time ago since they were already throwing stones gradually at Binance months ago after the FTX incident. The only shocking thing was the unexpected drastic price drop, which removed almost $1600 from the market within 24 hours. I believe a lot of traders assets will definitely be liquidated, especially those of future traders. But as we can see, the market is already auto-correcting; let's watch and see what it will look like in the coming days, if the Court will approve the SEC request to freeze Binance's U.S. holdings assets.Quote from: franky1 on June 07, 2023, 03:36:39 PMSEC now going after coinbase tooWho knows who they have next on their to-do list? Let all big exchanges under the US soil prepare their table for they might receive an unwanted guest very soon.",

There will be a temporary decline in prices but will recover the next few days. Better to get used to these \"attacks\" on exchanges and crypto in general. The US government is looking for avenues to destabilize the market and cause FUD which will lead to a drop in the price of Bitcoin and others. But such a move is not yielding the targeted outcome. The price was affected slightly yesterday but today the rebound was massive. There were different predictions that the price will go below $20k but all didn't come to pass. I am suspecting that the crypto space was already expecting this attack because the SEC has been attacking Binance for some time now. It could also be that the Bitcoin sector is becoming resistant to some external attacks. The rush to secure a court order to freeze the assets of Binance is showing that the US government is seeking diverse means to seize some of its assets. But I am sure that CZ and Binance are already prepared for this attack and might have moved most of their assets. I just hope that none of thier customers would loose their funds.",

Because Bitcoin was existing before all those exchange platforms came to an existence so bitcoin has nothing to do with them.

When I initially read this news I thought that the SEC was going after Binance with this asset freeze.  That would have been big news.  If they're going after Binance.us, that basically means nothing.  Nobody uses Binance.us and I can't imagine they have enough funds being held to matter.  It does display a little bit that the SEC has limits of what it is capable of doing.  I'm sure their main target was Binance, but had to settle for some tiny company that licenses their name instead.  Honestly, Binance.us imploding completely would hardly be news.  It does show the SEC is continuing to ramp up their attacks against crypto though, which I guess is concerning.",

Im not sure if its verified info as it just a screenshot though, but I think CZ's hat is strong and will likely fight back on the matter.

Any bans from the SEC will not affect the global market. Yes, we will have a price storm for some time, but I do not think that this will last very long. Also, I don’t think that traders will have problems with those assets that get delisted; there are plenty of other exchanges that work without verification, so globally, I think we won’t even borrow any major changes.",
