  "content": "it seems that another small exchange is going out of business. They were not a particularly important player in the market, although I personally had no special complications with them, I saw a lot of accusations against them.unfortunately, there is no official announcement, nor is it possible to get any information on the website. they just keep doing business in their shady way.somewhere I saw that even earlier they banned all users from Europe and the USA, Australia. I am not sure if can anyone access them. I tried but I can't access their website, even if I use a VPN with Asian IP. On his Twitter and Telegram channels, they publish a list of coins that will be delisted from the platform.according to the volume displayed on CMC, there is only $240,373.32 or 11 BTC per 24h, while BTC/USDT is only $281.13https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/crex24/I suggest that anyone who might have some funds there, try to get them out of there or forget them forever.",

Another theory could be like they have addresses that are not known publicly, so it's hard to find the actual volume from blockchain.Either way, I always have doubt that the exchanges really have the volume that they show on their system. For obvious reason they always show higher numbers in the charts.",
