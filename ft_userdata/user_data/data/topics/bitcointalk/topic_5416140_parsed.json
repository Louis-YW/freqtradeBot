The value has multiplied thousands of times over, in the course of it's history, so, some would naturally expect it to increase further and as such hold on to it.Quote from: burugcrypto on October 06, 2022, 07:50:34 AMSo How will willing are you to spend crypto for your purchases? A drop in the price would not factor in much with a $1 purchase of a cup of coffee, or less than $50 for a hardware wallet. I can still comfortably do this from time to time, along with other small, daily purchases involving Bitcoin (that's what I hold).

Beauty of Bitcoin is that everyone can use it as he pleases, there are no rules or rights/wrongs, even though I do think that all bitcoiners should pay with bitcoin when they can. It doesn't have to be a big amount or even often, but if every now and then you have a chance to pay something directly with bitcoin that costs like $10-$20, why not?I personally spend crypto on the regular basis, no matter the price and I stopped looking back at how much my bitcoin would worth if I didn't spend. With that being said, I do spend more when bitcoin is worth more (for example I sold some bitcoin when price was $50k+ and fully renovated my apartment) and at the moment I am only spending bitcoin when its convenient and for nothing major like that.",

This will always be depends on what tokens you are telling about since there are shit tokens doesn't really worth it to be bought even if the market is so down since there are some of them will die naturally on bear market season as there dev decide to abandon their project and already want to secure their pockets. If we are talking about top alts and other tokens maybe yes but I will be more careful since will try to seek some good position to enter to avoid wasting money.",

So How will willing are you to spend crypto for your purchases? I am very much willing to use cryptocurrency whether it's bitcoin or other tokens as a payment method through any transaction however it will still depend on how convenient paying cryptocurrency will be. In regard to the crypto price fluctuation, just as what most of us will do is seldomly use cryptocurrency as the payment method and try to stick with fiat especially when the price is too low. But there are still some exemptions such as for emergency purposes or urgent need.

In this case, it depends on how one will consider bitcoin whether it's for investment, currency, security, anonymity, and other purposes of bitcoin. But to the general public, most of us consider it as both for investment and currency purposes and have a goal to earn thru bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. Most of us intend to accumulate more cryptocurrency as much as possible to maximize our potential profit however we also use it and sell it to fiat to buy our needs and wants.",

It is true; you'd only lose in an investment once you chose liquidation of your asset or by spending what you are holding 'coz that would simply mean you sold your asset for a low value. But as we all know, we have different circumstances; there are times we would be forced to prioritize other things such as if you are needing emergency money and such, there would be a tendency for you to let go of your losses or idea of gaining profit from enduring down market. Point here is, no action is wrong as long as you won't regret it afterwards and as long as you have a valid reason you yourself won't question about. That's your money in the first place and only you have the rights to make that 'move'. If you have other resources and you are that determined to your investments, ofcourse it would be better to avoid using your assets especially at this situation we are currently experiencing.",
