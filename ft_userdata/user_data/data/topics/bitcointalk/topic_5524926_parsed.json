Satoshi did not want any control and he did not reveal his identity because of this. Government are not controlling bitcoin but controlling exchanges and other centralized platforms. Even bitcoin transaction till today is not controlled in a way that it is censored.Quote from: Mrbluntzy on January 01, 2025, 02:15:02 PMNow that financial institutions and government are becoming interested in Bitcoin, which we all know how this is going to look like on the future.

Among what are truly decentralized, bitcoin is still part of them. Bitcoin is still peer-to-peer payment system. Bitcoin still eliminate central control. Satoshi did not design those exchanges and other central controls. It designed nodes, wallets and everything needed for bitcoin not to have central control. You can still make use of bitcoin like that. Let us wait and see what will happen in the future but bitcoin is not for the government to control.",

Bitcoin works using a consensus.. The government and other bigger institutions buying Bitcoin shouldn't be anything to fear of mate, thy cannot control Bitcoin because of its decentralized nature.

They would want to take control. If Satoshi is still alive, how would he feel and what if he wakes up one day decides to do what I don't want to imagine about? Interesting question, but the truth is, there is nothing we can do about it. The government are very smart. After their long frown towards it, they've decided to embrace it because such technology looks promising and doesn't seem like the regular type. Fine, some of us are scared that the whole government involvement and reserve thing doesn't look genuine as it is, but I don't think the government will be able to take control of the technology itself.Though, having that purchasing power to buy a massive amount for reserve purposes looks threatening in terms of price manipulation, but I also feel that the government won't want to spend alot in something they can't control. There are so many points that can be raise from this if we to start analyzing. At the end of the day, Satoshi knows he has played his part for the community, by introducing the technology and making it decentralization. It's now the duty of the community members to play their own part because the government will surely need key figures to get things done.",

This is a huge achievement for any person, so, I think that this way, he will be proud but it's a different subject if he likes the idea of governments using them. I think that he doesn't like because his purpose was to create a P2P payment method that would solve the issues that were in e-commerce business, he didn't create bitcoin for storing wealth for governments. Also, he had decentralization in his mind when he was creating Bitcoin but it's clear that governments are enemies of decentralization.",

Even now, nothing has been done outside the scheme as, even with fiat currency, you donât get to spend it all but, reserve some for future purposes.

As much as government involvement can raise the credibility of Bitcoin, it risks bringing back that central control Bitcoin which hardly the case since those governments still only own Bitcoin not controlling it.
