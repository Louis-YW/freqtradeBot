It's an example and it shows that the chance does exist.Indeed, for 15-20 reds in a row you have to be very unlucky, but it's basic math, the longer you play the bigger the chance even the events with small odds can happen.When I play dice I do something somewhat similar with your logic, but with a very big difference: if I get to a 4-5 losing streak already I stop and go back to the initial amount. And you know why? Because it's not worth to wager 1000s of dollars to basically try to recover 20$ (give or take).",

I'm also assuming \"original\" martingale where you double on losing and reset on winning (your martingale approach will make you lose more money faster during a losing streak, so it'll be even worse)The odds of rolling 1 time and losing: 1/2, you just lost $20The odds of rolling 2 times and losing: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, you just lost $20 + $40 = $60The odds of rolling 3 times and losing: 1/8, you just lost $60 + $80 = $140The odds of rolling 4 times and losing: 1/16, you just lost $140 + $160 = $3005 => 1/32, you just lost $300 + $320 = $6206 => 1/64, you just lost $620 + $640 = $12607 => 1/128, you just lost $1260 + $1280 = $25408 => 1/256, you just lost $2540 + $2560 = $51009 => 1/512, you just lost $5100 + $5120 = $1022010 => 1/1024, you just lost $10220 + $10240 = $2046011 => 1/2048, you just lost $20460 + $20480= $40940And you're done... your $50k bankroll can no longer suffice for continuing...if you try to win $20 (cause that's all you'll win) for 2048 times, on average you'll lose $40k of your $50k bankroll...",

Can you back that up by providing relevant data? Each new roll has no connection to the previous ones and you always have an equal chance to roll red or green. If you start with a $20 initial bet, and double your bet on every loss, you'll burn through your $50,000 balance with just 10 reds in a row. Even if you start with a $1 initial bet, you'll burn through $50k with just 14 reds in a row. And, if you've gambled long enough, you'd know that a bad streak of 14 reds in a row is quite possible.",

Even more loses in a row is very likely. You will finally lose. Be sure of that. Assume that you have 50,000 dollars. You want to double it and the house edge is only 1%.If you play at 2x multiplier, you have 49.5% chance to double your balance and 50.5% chance to lose your balance.Now assume that I try to double my 50,000 dollar using martingale strategy. I set the base amount to only 5 cents. If I lose the bet, I will double the bet amount and if I win the bet, I return the bet amount to 5 cents.Let's do some calculations and see if my chance increases.I can continue until I lose 20 bets in a row. As with every win I win only 0.05 cents, to double my initial balance, I must win 1 million bets.The chance to lose 20 bets in a row is 0.505^20. That's only 0.000117%. Till now every thing is OK.To double my balance, I have to win 1 million times.The chance of not losing 20 times in a row until you win 1 million bets is (1-0.00000117)^1,000,000. That's 31%.Therefore, the chance to increase your balance with martingale strategy is 31% while the chance to that with a single bet was 49.5%.This is how martingale strategy decreases the chance of success.",

You are using an abnormal martingale strategy which very risky considering how huge the money you are betting including the bet increase. Maybe it work on your case that losing streak is not over 7 but that doesn’t mean it’s the limit since everyone that playing will win most of the time if your theory was true and also it’s statistically impossible to be honest.This is a dangerous suggestion and might risk newbie to lose huge funds in case they read your thread and follow it.

A lot of us have already tried it and it doesn't always work as expected. Also, I suggest that you lower your initial bet which is less than 20$ and try at a smaller value such as 1$ or less. This way you can maximize your winning rate and avoid losing most or all of your bankroll instantly. One of the key factors for this strategy is your bankroll as you will need a lot of it in case you'll encounter a losing streak that is more than 7 times which usually happens.",

Even with 49.5% odds there is a huge possibility that you can sink into a lose streak that is more than 7 times. Longest I've had is 15 and if I followed your method, I'd be out in the game in just a few seconds. Also, changing bet size is IMO not a sound strategy that can help you increase your win probability. It's all luck in dice at the end of the day.
