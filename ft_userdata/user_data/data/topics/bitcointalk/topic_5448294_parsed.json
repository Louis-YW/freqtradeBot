Putting up a service like this of assisting people that wants to have business information being placed on Seychelles should include those platforms and accounts. It's not about doubting OP or what not but it's about the typical things of someone likes him to have which is a basic thing. It will also help him and the potential businessman to save both of their times. Businessman can just read details on those accounts in social media or read the FAQ on his website for those usual questions that will be asked and then if it's unclear and there's no detail yet about it and they want to start negotiating, they'll contact you.",
