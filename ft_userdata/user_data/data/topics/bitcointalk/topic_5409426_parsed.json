  "content": "I saw this breaking news on social media and it appears that much of the people there want to create the fud and make it appear that all of Hotbit's senior team members have been involved in criminal financial activity. I thought it was real, however, this announcement from their website has announced that it was only a former employee and Hotbit is cooperating with the authorities to solve the problem.Announcement on the Suspension of Hotbit Website Service on August 10th, 2022Dear Respected Hotbit Users, Because a former Hotbit management employee who left Hotbit in April this year was involved in a project last year that law enforcement authorities now think is suspected of violating criminal laws. So, a number of Hotbit senior managers have been subpoenaed by law enforcement since the end of July and are assisting in the investigation. Furthermore, law enforcement has frozen some funds of Hotbit, which has prevented Hotbit from running normally. Therefore, Hotbit has to suspend trading, deposit, withdrawal and funding functions. All user’s assets and data on Hotbit are secure and correct. Please wait for our further announcement about the specific recovery time of our service. Hotbit hereby declares: Hotbit and the rest employees of Hotbit's management are not involved in the project and have no knowledge of the illegal information involved in the project. And we are still actively cooperating with the law enforcement authorities in their investigations. All user’s assets are safe. For more details, please visit https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8074249353495 Source https://www.hotbit.io/maintenance",

Also some people like leaving coins on exchanges, which is not right at all, if it is not your key, it is not your coin, exchanges do not give your any private key, they have it all and have control over your money. The government freeze some funds of the exchange (as we heard about it), but it could even be all the funds that has been frozen, leaving Hotbit customers in panic. People that will mostly leave their coins on exchanges are traders, definitely they will all be significantly affected by this.",

What I don’t understand was why does the Hotbit need to halt withdrawal while only partial funds is needed to be freeze and customers balance is surely not part of it? I think they are using the customers balance as hostage and use as collateral damage once the investigation will be in favor with the law enforcement. This is sucks! This can happened on any exchange even Binance. Not your keys not your coin indeed.",

Not your keys not your coin indeed.Probably they are using their customers money to make a profit or they liquidated the long-calls because they dont have the money to pay them. If this criminal activity is really real why didnt a news agency aired this already, it should have been covered because there is law enforcement involved there should be 1 or 2 bored reporters would snoop around the area.",

Additionally, legal investigation could take really long time which sucks for both Hotbit and Hotbit customer.Agreed, however, Hotbit can make a request to open the exchange for withdrawals. I reckon this is what the authorities should allow the exchange to do after knowing which funds and how much should be frozen. In any case, this is a warning sign for everyone and also to stop using this exchange. The skeptical me thinks there is something more behind their blog post.",

(I am one of them). a similar thing happens with them approximately every 2-3 months, \"maintenance due to potential hack\". We are not particularly surprised by the current situation, I believe that the majority of users did not hold any serious amount of money on this exchange.occasionally I have some altcoins that are easiest for me to sell on Hotbit. Deposit altcoin, sell it, withdraw whatever. that's all.to be honest, so far not a single Hotbit hack has sampled the theft of money.",

I think hotbit is trying to cover up their mistake. because if this error gets leaked then they are afraid of losing all their users and they are afraid of ending up in the legal table.there must be a reason behind the freezing of some assets by the legal authorities. This reason explains that there is involvement in it. because if it's a former employee who just made a mistake then I don't think there is any reason to freeze some hotbit assets by the legal authorities. whether this is drama or whatever. But I hope the problem will be resolved soon. because I also have assets in hotbit that I need to withdraw.",

You are there just for trading the pumps? How about the fees? The Defi exchanges based on what I heard that the ETH gas fee is still pretty high and actually I tried to swap on some tokens before but I can't seem to find any coins support on Defi exchanges. I usually mine shitcoins before hoping that I can make more profit than mining BTC but I sold that shitcoin due to financial problems and only the Hotbit exchange support that coin that is why I end up using the Hotbit exchange. I don't usually trade on any Defi most of my trades are in Big exchanges Binance and Coinex I have experienced using other exchanges but due to restrictions and limitations, I can't able to use them.",
