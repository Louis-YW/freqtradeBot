After that, you have to log in to the Metamask wallet.",

I frequently get stuck when switching to a network that needs a transaction. At such times, I usually delete them and reinstall them rather than waiting for them to switch networks. I think reinstalling is the best solution for errors like this.",

Re-install solve everything for my case, like balance error and other think.True, I agree with this.The most important thing is that you hold the private key of your wallet. After you have reinstalled your Metamask and still have the same problem, make sure you have a good internet network.If it still doesn't work, there may be a problem with your device. You can download the Metamask application on your smartphone and import your wallet.",

      "body": "Thanks for all that replied. Restating browser, clearing cache, reinstalling meta mask all didn’t help. Only thing that worked was basically when the “Approve transaction” appeared on Metamask it was dim because of the Connecting to Ethereum Mainnet showing up in front of it,  but if you hit tab a few times it lets you select Approve and it worked. No idea why it does this. In the past I never had any issues.I found MM very buggy. In my Polygon section, the MATIC is displayed as ETH instead of MATIC. And it uses ETH price. So if you got 10 MATIC it will say 10 ETH and you will think you are rich having $18000 in your account but it’s obviously a visual bug.Hopefully they fix all these issues.",
