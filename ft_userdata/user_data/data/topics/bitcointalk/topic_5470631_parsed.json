  "content": "Since 2017, we've been dedicated to evaluating Crypto VIP Premium Groups. In this realm, you'll come across both credible Trader Channels and groups that offer valuable market insights and technical analysis. However, there's also a disheartening number of fraudulent VIP groups that charge fees and engage in scams.Our purpose is to uncover and reveal these deceitful channels. The challenge lies in not being able to discern their authenticity until you've experienced them firsthand. This is where we come in. We take on the financial commitment, add these channels upon member request, and investigate their legitimacy on your behalf. The aim is to eliminate the bad trading actors and issue warnings, preserving only those you can trust to be a valuable resource. This trust is built on their ability to interpret charts, provide trade signals, and explain technical and fundamental analysis.Typically, the monthly fee for these groups averages around $200. Since 2017, we've actively participated in Crypto Premium Groups, and our commitment extends to exposing the VIP groups engaged in scams that offer signals with huge accuracy, lending subscribers to lose, as in reality its not close to what they show in public. On the flip side, we also identify groups that are genuinely worth following and learning from. These reputable sources are housed within our Discord and Telegram channels, allowing you to select the one that aligns best with your preferences and trading style. If their trading methods resonate with you, you can support them by joining directly, negating the need for you to search each month for a beneficial trading resource.Our comprehensive effort has led to the compilation of over 50 paid crypto groups in one convenient location, simplifying your research process. Our goal is to offer access to the most exclusive paid channels in the cryptocurrency space, ensuring you receive valuable and precise insights for your trading endeavors.CryptoCartel.co",

If it is free, share some of this information here and leave the user to join your group. However, if it is paid, there is no difference between your service and the rest of the groups, and in view of the negative trust in your account, it is better to provide some data for free.In general, crypto signals should be a hobby or something free unless the user wants to pay you as a donation or for additional data.Edit: after reading @poker player feedback it is better to say away from any paid service from this user",

Because the sites are genuine and they will never ask for anything about anyone's personal information. So I think it is better to stay away from them. Crypto signals are often seen as false signals because if not traded at the right time, losses are bound to occur. So I think it is better to stay away from all these signals.",

All this are just to receive payment from those who are lazy and believe the signal can be useful to them. I don’t trust any of this signal channels no matter the kind of review that any one give about them.",

So there will also be a lot of considerations from forum members who may have experience with one of your VIP list signals.As you said, this is to avoid fraud, so let the forum also judge whether the list is good or the list is bad.However, VIP signals are nothing better than our own analysis and efforts in analyzing and making a profit.I wouldn't even believe in VIP or Non VIP signals.",

The best that can happen is not to make a profit when you make a loss, but inevitably They will not share the loss with you.",

But you guys are sharing it and let's be honest that you're all for the payment of your potential victims.The goal is to get as much money as possible. We have often heard and known about it. Joining the group requires a subscription fee. And everyone will decide to join or not to join.But we should learn about trading analysis so we don't depend on them. And if market conditions are uncertain and we are still expecting trading signals from the group, that doesn't guarantee you can still make a profit.But if you can analyze the market, you can still find coins that can provide profits. So you don't depend on anyone in trading. And you can still trade in all market conditions.",

I'll wait until tomorrow before taking anything fresh. I'm happy with my current positions. There's not much to update there. All in good spots.

This happens literally all the time.We have exposure to other ALTs already, this is mainly just to round up the overall exposure. A little bit of the BTC/ETH, blue chips, and top100s, and the smaller exposure to round out being spot shitcoins and MC.From Birb Nest:Absolutely, here's a condensed version of the Bitcoin & market update, emphasizing that all signals are currently bullish:DAILY REPORTBITCOIN & MARKET UPDATEBitcoin has a history of surging post-halving—peaks showing 9000%, 3000%, and 700% growth. Now, all indicators are increasingly bullish as traders anticipate the 4th halving.Daily timeframe indicates a confirmed breakout above the 200-day SMA and BPRO Baseline, targeting $39k. Traders should be cautious near the psychological $40k level.The breakout confirmation is approved:▸ Volume (spike) ▸ Breadth (coins > SMA200) ▸ Volatility (ATR > SMA50) ▸ Price % traveled (12%) ▸ Price action (new 52-week high) ▸ Time (2 days > resistance) ▸ Momentum (RSI >80) ▸ S/R level ($32k broken)  The 12H chart presents a bullish outlook with a key CTF Stop at $32,775. If held daily, expect more bullish action to persist.On the 4H chart, Momentum Bands slope aggressively upward, signaling strong bullish momentum. Wide support area @ 31-32kBullish trend sentiment is prevalent across all timeframes except for hourly consolidation - neutral rating. October’s bullish seasonality supports current price action. November gets 2-3 times stronger, historically.Mark your calendars for November 15-21 -> Free Trading Congress V.If you find this helpful, please leave an emoji under this report.
