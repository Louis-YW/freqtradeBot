What I'm asking it does user here normally make 25 post per week without any subscription on signature campaign? If being natural is what the campaign manager wants. Removing the post quota is the answer. Can you keep posting above 25 post per week without signature campaign to give joy in the forum?",

This is really a subjective matter and you can't generalize all the campaign manager need to agree with your opinion. Burst post matter is an example, there are different definition for them:1. Creating many posts in a short time, this make some users need to wait for a hour to post from his previous post. 2. Creating 10+ posts in a day, only post for 2 days to hit the 25 week posts requirements. 3. Creating post in one thread only, he keep replying with the same user over and over, to avoid multiple posting/post in a row.

You might decide to use your time on something else that might bring financial benefit. A signature campaign should not be seen as a full-time job but having a post quota gives participants the responsibility of performing the task they are been paid for. If you allow participants to post naturally some might just do a few posts and relax which affects the main focus of the promotional campaign. Every firm that runs a campaign program wants their products to be promoted around the forum so having a bunch of unserious posters will negate their objectives.It is also important to state that joining a campaign is not by force and different campaigns have their requirements so you should choose the one that suits you. Most campaign managers don't just pay attention to post quota but post quality. Some quality posters/members will never be removed from a campaign because they didn't complete their post quota.In summary, post quotas are important because the campaign manager and the firm have plans and targets. Post quality is more important than just completing post quota. And if you are not comfortable with the rules of a campaign, don't join.",

If you made 4 posts for example last week, the campaign would pay for your 4 posts... It is a bit frustrating to be having to make posts while you are on vacation you know.

This is an issue that was raised in the signature campaign thread of Flush. Although the manager tried to clarify the issue but I purposely stopped replying because that is a signature thread of Flush while I wear Mixero to post there.It is surprising that some persons are misunderstanding the OP while he was straight forward. What the OP meant is that, if a campaign manager requires that you make 25 posts per week, he shouldn't at the same time be expecting you to make 5 or more posts above 25 posts. If the minimum posts is reached with quality, both parties should be satisfied. Then, my stake is that if the minimum requirement is reached with quality, there shouldn't be any problems. I will personally prefer a campaign which doesn't have minimum requirement or one whose minimum requirement is 10 like Best Change to another which will deny you payment if eventually 1 out of the 24 posts that will complete your post is eventually deleted by a mod or moved to off topic.",

If the minimum posts is reached with quality, both parties should be satisfied. Since I'm mentioned here, I think I should add what I meant in my campaign thread post.If someone is posting 20 times (eligible) a week, they will get paid. Did someone not pay them? I can't remember if I have seen such an issue. However, since they post the exact number as required, they are following the rules. They are providing nothing extra to the campaign. In return, I will be strict with them as per the rules set in the campaign thread. If they even post 19, I'm very much unlikely to pay them[1]. On the other hand, for those who post more than the required number of posts, I will apply flexible rules to them. Lucius missed 10 posts on the gambling section one week, I didn't even write any comments. In fact, I told him not to worry about posts in the gambling section. I don't have a problem if he posts less in the gambling section.I thought I mentioned them clearly in the thread but seems you didn't get my point. Thank you for the mention.1. When people only follow the campaign rules, they don't deserve any mercy in my opinion. When they post 19/week, they don't deserve payment but I paid half pay for them.Quote from: Xiestar on May 06, 2023, 07:52:26 AMWhat I'm asking it does user here normally make 25 post per week without any subscription on signature campaign? There are people who post almost 100 per week regardless of they are in a campaign or not.Quote from: Rikafip on May 06, 2023, 12:42:24 PMThis is best noticeable in gambling signature campaigns so managers are then forced to set up a requirement to write certain amount of posts in gambling board.

If they want a higher post quota participants, They should increase the minimum post requirements or make the campaign rate per post without any consequences for posting low but quality post. I'm confused on the minimum post requirements rules. I saw many users being remove on the campaign by posting within the quota. First, I noticed that their is more of competition among memebers participating in campaigns and signature campaign managers always select the memeber who they think is best, normally some memeber go above the required post count and seems the managers prefer them more to those that only do less the required post or those that only do just the required post. Normally for me, I think that doing only the required post means that the person is only posting for the SATs, but that aside (I might be wrong about that), some of those that even do just the required post, may end up having some of their post rejected due to low quality and I think that's why some managers remove memeber from campaign, apart from that, managers specifically use to specify \"a read before joining\" which sometimes says \"campaign manager have the right to remove you without any explanation.\"  So it might not also really be that the reason managers remove members is because of the lower required post count.Also, for some campaigns, there used to be an extra bonus that required much posting to win, but that's not really any reason why campaign managers remove members. Sometimes, reason is best known to them.If I gues correctly, some reasons why some members get removed from campaigns are due to competition; some members are doing lots of posts normally without putting on any signatures, so probably the manager removes such people that do less post and employees those that usually do more posts. Perhaps all they also want in the best exposure for project they manage their campaigns.",
