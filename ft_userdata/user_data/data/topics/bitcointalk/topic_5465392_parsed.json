      "body": "Inflation is one of the economic terms that is often misunderstood. In a good economic system, controlled inflation is necessary to create value on the commodity and to force consumers to spend instead of displacing. As an example of the importance of inflation (in its simple sense, which means an increase in product prices), we can ask why prices do not increase in Japan[1] and how It was bad for the economy[2].In general, inflation of 2% is good for most economies, and sometimes as long as the government can control inflation, the wheel of the economy will turn.The problem comes from excessive and explosive inflation, where the government is unable to control inflation, prices increase daily, and the currency rate decreases, and this is what many believe is the concept of inflation.Excessive inflation has internal causes related to state policies, external causes, and causes related to the structure of the economy. It is a symptom of a disease, and without identifying the cause of hyperinflation, the solutions will fail.I think that talking about such a subject requires more, but this story in brief.[1] https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14462174[2] https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/08/12/japans-low-inflation-conundrum/",

Correct me if I take it wrong. Well, the point is in the hope to making the value of one country's currency equal to another things, many factors plays important role, like monetary policy, interest rates, etc. etc.So after huge discussion things came back to the fact that higher demand of goods means more inflation, lower supply of money in the circulation means lesser inflation as there will be less money to buy things. PS: Well, if the ratio between consumption and production will be managed then inflation can be controlled.",

No company would operate like that. A company would food eventually if they followed this business model. The goal is to make a profit, so if they're not making a profit then there's no point in the business.Or, they're making a profit but not much. For example, they make just $2 out of a $20 product. Isn't that a good thing that a company can't exploit people and make excessive profits off of them? Could it also be that the people in Japan buy more less quality products? If the cost of producing the product is $20 and the company knows that people will not buy at that price, they'll find ways to reduce the cost of production to about $10 to $15 and then sell for about $22. This would help the company make more profit but they would sell less quality products, to their Japanese market at least.Another question, Does it mean that the forces of demand and supply don't play a role in the determination of prices in Japan? From the article, I can conclude that it is the people who determine the price, so no matter how the market is, the buyers still determine the price. Finally, Does this also affect imported products from foreign companies or do the citizens only do this to local products? Because there is no way foreign companies would export their products and services to Japan if the people would just buy them at a price they want even if the company is not making the kind of profit they desire.",

I agree that government policies have an impact on the value of our fiat currencies, however inflation is one of the primary causes of fiat currency depreciation around the world. When fiat loses value, the country's economy suffers as a result of higher prices for products and services, and people who save fiat will no longer value what they saved.I no longer trust keeping fiat cash because my country's currency consistently loses value to the dollar, and the little money you have on hand can no longer satisfy your wants as a result of the high cost of things.

An example is the case of Zimbabwe in 2006 where a loaf of bread cost about Z$550,000 which was just 1 dollar. But devaluation can also be an economic strategy to promote local consumption of goods and exports. Locally produced goods will be cheaper which means people will prefer it to expensive imported goods. Currency devaluation will make the country's goods cheaper in the international market which will attract more trade partnerships. But there are also dangers of devaluation especially if the country relies on other countries for importation of raw materials. This will make raw materials more expensive and locally produced goods may no longer be cheaper. Devaluation is a good economic policy that has worked for countries like China but it can cause harm to other countries, especially to countries that depend on others for raw materials and human resources.",

Your nickname sounds Spanish, I suggest you to go to the local Spanish forum to debate there as well. To try to clarify what you are saying and to do my bit, we have two parts, inflation and economic growth, which are linked. And within inflation we have inflation that is only caused by monetary policies, or inflation that is not caused by monetary policies, generally by economic growth, but also by other factors, such as the increase in energy prices. So, when inflation is caused by monetary causes, because central banks issue a lot of money this causes currency devaluation, and in that sense the title of your thread is correct. However, when inflation is not strictly monetary it does not cause devaluation. Therefore, what you say is only partially correct.",

The uncontrolled inflation that the government creates through the printing of money is only beneficial in the short term especially during a recession. In the long-term people can't keep with the rising price especially if those on fixed incomes. Let me summarise by saying that in the short-term inflation helps because there will be more money in circulation and people would have more to spend but then when it is left uncontrolled, the money becomes useless no matter how much you have and demand will no longer increase but remain either stagnant or decrease.",

Apart from fall in supply which could lead to scarcity and the rise of the price of goods or services which is what is called inflation, you also have to know that the government can deliberately cause a level of inflation maybe moderately to control the amount of money in circulation. To this effect if government want to have the policy to circulate money, they could reduce the rate of interest on loan and that can cause money to be in the reach of many and that means more money chasing fewer goods.
