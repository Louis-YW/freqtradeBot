When it has first got an outage, I guess everyone just thought that it's fairly okay and not that much to be worried of.But with the most recent things that has happened. It has started to give doubt to those that are bag holders of it. And if they're firm holding this coin, that won't matter to them and will still believe on it.I guess what makes them stick on it because of what it has built just like the few portions of success that ETH has got like in the NFT market.",

This blockchain is the most garbage blockchain after UST. this is the big question that has not yet answered. It seems like that people didn't really care about reliability of blockchain but pure speculating the token that issued by the blockchain. It's probably because SOL was born out of the bull market that's why it has great start from the beginning. People never look (and you can call them dumb) regarding their blockchain, and they just invest on them, see the price goes up, tremendous growth. And now we've seen what their blockchain is in the bear market and realized that it was pure garbage and now we heard that they have been hacked and compromised.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/03/hackers-attack-solana-crypto-stealing-millions.html",

So far i only heard negative stuff about Solana because of all the hacks that have occurred. There even was another one very recently like yesterday or so where again millions of dollars where stolen from users. I was always wondering that the price of Solana was not really reacting when such news about hacks were appearing and always remained relatively stable.I have never really heard accusations that the team behind the project is shady or that the project itself is centralized or that they have even lied about important stuff. I alwys wanted to buy a handful of SOL once or if the price will drop below 30$, but reading your post i have to do a little more research i guess.",

It's not right. his investment and his decision. If you are closely following a project, you will know their weaknesses and failures. So lucky for you if you got the chance to know the SOL platform.It may save your funds from losing it. Maybe, some are still believing on their capability because they haven't studied the network yet.But in every investment, we really need to follow and keep up with the progress of the project. Or else, we will not see our losses coming our way. SOL for me is better than most project. Maybe, that's the reason why people are interested with it.",

That was making thousands of people are not able to move their assets to the new wallet with new seedphrase. This is also the reason why this blockchain was so garbage. I saw bunch of complaints in the telegram group about people can't access their wallet nor explorer to check if everything is fine or not.",
