That's really good advice. Experience is often more valuable than spending a lot of time reading books to learn something. I'm not saying that learning is bad, but ultimately experience is what truly matters because it helps you achieve your goals. Long story short, simply gaining knowledge won't make you a skilled trader. I would suggest learning the basics and then immersing yourself in actual trading by starting with a demo account. You will definitely make mistakes along the way but you'll learn from them much faster and improve significantly over time.",

It's a very vast field and the advanced traders know that how much they have lost to master crypto-trading and the market volatility. That's why I always recommend the traders to learn the market and master the volatility before doing trading with real money.QuoteNever borrow money to start crypto trading, because it's very wrong to be trading under pressure.I also suggest that a trader should avoid borrowing the money that has interest on it because such money can be stuck if your trade goes wrong. Well, I believe that trading itself involves some kind of pressure and even if a trader hasn't borrowed money from someone else he/she still have to face some pressure during the process of trading.QuoteNever give your coin to someone to trade for you, there is a high probability of you getting scammed.I don't think that anyone is newbie enough to give their coins to someone else for trading purpose. The other party could lose the coins during losses. There are even some scammers who promise innocent users to multiply their money in a month or 2 months, and a smart person will always avoid those kind of offers.QuoteIt is inevitable to hit losses at some point in the crypto market, it's just normal and it happens in any other kind of business.What makes you a profitable trader is the ability to make more profit than losses.Well, a trader has to face losses every once in a while and no one is perfect enough to profit all the time. It's always recommended to have control over your emotions during the loss because if you don't you will lose even more. A profitable trader on the other hand is someone who has built a better trading strategy and have a proper plan during the process of trading. Such traders are mostly profitable with their trades.QuoteThe more money you put into crypto trading the more money you get and also there is a high risk losses without proper risk management in place.You should also say that the more money you put into crypto trading the more money you are going to lose if you aren't a good trader, and if you haven't built a good trading strategy. A good trader always prefers to follow a strategy and has control over his/her emotions during trading. A novice trader will rush trade with the more money and the result will be pure loss.",

They struggle but in the end, they fall. At the same time, most of people fall early who are more impatient and try to become over-smart with the market.

This allows you to gain experience and learn from your mistakes without risking significant financial loss, and the last one is to implement stop-loss orders.

But when trading we should make sure that our profits is more than our lose. If your lose is more than your profits, then something is wrong and you have to check your trading pattern and look for a way to discover what's wrong with your pattern, and why you are really losing.",
