Like I did purchased ProtonVPN service with BTC for example. I'm interested in total revenue one may get using Bitcoin as a legal tender or money per se.We've been pushing so hard to make Bitcoin a legal tender but on the other hand, I've heard this second thought about the sending fee or better said the transaction fee associated with Bitcoin isn't a small one and it will be great to have Bitcoin as a legal tender especially for people who want to maintain anonymity in almost everything dey do but I guess the transaction fee is a major setback.I have no issue with selling my coin to fiat when making purchase because I believe that there isn't much need for me using Bitcoin as a means of payment especially with the high fee associated with it.",

But still though, it's sound money and legal tender to me so I will go with that route.So maybe there are individuals who wanted a P2P, or exchanges their Bitcoin to fiat to make it money.It might take years though before we can see the full potential of BTC as legal tender.",

Others who have little knowledge of crypto do not accept this as payment because the fee is very high. But if they only know that there is something called the Lightning network for Bitcoin that makes the transaction easier and the fee cheaper, they will surely accept it.",

Like I did purchased ProtonVPN service with BTC for example. I'm interested in total revenue one may get using Bitcoin as a legal tender or money per se.When you're spending Bitcoin, I don't see how it's about revenues. I've probably paid for some sort of subscription with Bitcoin in the past. I also frequently use it as a form of money in two areas: gambling with Bitcoin and donating with Bitcoin. The former is very common but also sometimes overlooked as a way of spending Bitcoin directly, and I do see it as an exchange of money for a service. The latter can either be a straightforward donation to a cause, or it can be a case where you donate BTC and get a service or even a thing out of it as well. In my case, I got a hoodie for a Bitcoin donation a while ago, and also a mental health webinar for a donation recently.",

Most of my transactions are usually cash which I think is still the best-case scenario avoiding any problems in the long run. As for now, I still don't see a large amount of transactions or options to pay Bitcoin in local stores. I guess this forum has the only highest number of transactions when it comes to buying goods in exchange for Bitcoin. But, I am not losing hope. Maybe someday I will see a physical store who would offer such service and it will grow. Online? Yes, it's possible but I want a case where I am holding the goods and paying up directly afterwards.",

Since bitcoins can reach $20k-$60k in recent years, I want to accumulate more bitcoins because I want to make a lot of profit selling bitcoins and not using bitcoins as a means of payment. I think like that because maybe it's not time for me to use bitcoin as a means of payment and bitcoin still serves as a long-term investment tool.",
