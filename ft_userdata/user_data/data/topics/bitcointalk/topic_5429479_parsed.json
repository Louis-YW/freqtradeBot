      "body": "There are quote a lot of variables to ponder, amongst which lie your country’s legislation both for the person/company that places the ATMs, as for the people to use them, limits, KYC yes/partial/no, types of coins to deal with, who provides the ATM, at what initial cost, what are the monthly costs, what software will it run, what hardware does it need, can you use a cloud version, security of the ATM and of the data itself, applicable fees, expected customer flow and derived income, placement, placement rent, repairs, etc.I just juggled the above out of the top of my mind, but they’re certainly questions to ask oneself and include them in a business plan.One interesting thorough read, at least from a conceptual point of view, is the documentation from one of the ATM providers that I’ve skimmed through in the past (due to a hack they suffered though):https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/overviewIt gives you an idea of the features an ATM has, how they are parametrized, who does what, and so forth, though it obviously is only part of a potential prospective plan to understand some of the inner things to consider. CoinATMRadar has a few articles you can take a look at, and even a profit calculator, though the info is likely rather outdated (yet some of the principals to consider will still carry).",

      "body": "First of all my advice is to make a research about the numbers of crypto users in your location: If you set ,,fear'' fees and make a campaign(partnership with crypto exchanges) about cryptos I think it will work, but as I said you have to choose right location(shopping centre, etc.). What about legal issues, As I collect the information, its necessary to obtain licenses and permits,there may be specific requirements for your area.what about technical issues, You can easily find Bitcoin ATM's manufacturers,there are several reputable manufacturers, such as BitAccess(Canada), Coinsource(USA), Genesis Coin and etc.. You have to do your own research because I have no experience about this topic, I just collected this information for OP.",

Crypto adoption is not brought about by making it more accessible to the people (except there's a lack of such accessibility), there has to be an understanding of what it is and then an interest in the product. You can check this interest by surveying the number of users of bitcoin within the state, with what information is publicly available. With this data, you can check where more interest lies and then go a step further by finding out what drawbacks users experience.I, for example, is a Bitcoin enthusiast, but would not use a Bitcoin ATM to buy or sell, and there are others like that. Understanding what the people need would enable you better serve them.",

      "body": "I think Installing a Bitcoin ATM can be a great way to provide an easy and convenient way for customers to buy and sell Bitcoin in your area. But the first thing to consider when installing a Bitcoin ATM is regulation. You should check with your local authorities to see if there are any specific regulations or licenses required for operating a Bitcoin ATM in your area. Another important thing you should think about is security. You will have to implement security measures to protect the machine and the funds it handles. This may include installing cameras, using secure hardware... It is also a good idea to do some research on the various companies that manufacture and operate Bitcoin ATMs, as well as the types of machines that are available. This will help you make an informed decision about which machine is the best fit for your business. Anyway, good luck!",

      "body": "I know nothing about Bitcoin ATM installation. But the impression is that it must require a lot of study, feasibility study and consultations and whatnot, legal processes as well. While there are resources found online like the ones abundantly provided by CoinATMRadar, there are definitely a lot of factors that are unique to your own place. For example, how aware is your locality about Bitcoin? And you can't even take its high level of awareness as a guarantee that your venture would turn out well. If there's high awareness, it could even mean they are aware that most Bitcoin ATM machines charge exorbitant fees, ask for KYC, that there are a lot of better options online, and so on. Also, how about the legality of it all? I guess you will have to get a lawyer for it. But since your brother seems to be a little influential in your locality, I guess he could pull some strings to expedite everything a bit. If it's the first Bitcoin ATM in your place, it might indeed get a good deal of attention and curiosity. It might drive some adoption. It might also help if you organize some kind of an information drive. Surely, a lot of beginners need some guidance before trying your machine.",

I am starting this journey after Christmas. Any information and ideas are welcome I think the main focus first is to convince leaders in your area to agree on the project deployment is easy once they support your project, if your mother wins they are the obstacle that you are going to face, you have to make them believe that it will be for good, the people will follow the leaders in your area, in some country you have to face the congress for such project same as yours presenting on them first is the priority, partnering for banks who use bitcoin ATM is easy, since they will profit.",

This is a good idea and i will like you to consider somethings in common and out into consideration, knowing that this is political orchestrated decision to bring and install bitcoin ATM i hope it's not what's going to only last for the political ambition period you guys are in office if won the election and if you also did not make it to the last phase of winning does that mean the project as well is dead also, because if you consider the conditions attached to installing a bitcoin ATM you wouldn't have thought about it for a short period interval project jus, will it be sustained with or without election won?",

And then from that seller, most likely they can help you with the installation (either they go with you or teach you how to install it - which can be verbal or through a manual). On the other hand, if they didn't give you that, then it's good that you're here.For the cheaper cryptocurrency,  it'll be better if you go with a decentralized one. However, I am not aware of any decentralized cryptocurrency other than BTC.",

Any information and ideas are welcome does your country not strictly prohibit bitcoin? because that is the most important thing before you start a bitcoin ATM business.  besides that making a perfect btc ATM machine won't be easy, i saw in the news there is a broken ATM machine that keeps issuing money accidentally, have you guys thought about developing it? and what stage is your plan?",

For example, it may be difficult to find suppliers or partners who are willing to work with you, and you may have difficulty finding customers or users for your ATM. Overall, it is important to carefully consider the legal and practical risks of investing in a Bitcoin ATM business, particularly if your country has an unfavorable or uncertain regulatory environment for Bitcoin.",
