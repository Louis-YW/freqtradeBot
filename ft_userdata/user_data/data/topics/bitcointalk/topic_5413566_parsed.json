  "content": "Go to Google and type \"the merge\", currently about 14hr 38 mins to go...Lets share our memories of when we first started to mine ETH.I started in Feb 2016 because my Antminer ASICs were getting boring. I had tons of GPUs sitting and collecting dust from the Litecoin/Dogecoin 2014 days. Figured this Ethereum might take off and decided to switch over my mining. Turned off my Bitcoin ASICs and went back to full GPU mining again.Back in 2016, there was no Claymore miner. You had to use the crappy ethminer which came with the ETH client software, and it sucked. I remember every time there was a new DAG, all my rigs froze. Every single time. I had to set alarms to manually restart the mining every 5 days when the DAG change happened.There was also no remote monitoring back then. The only type of monitoring that was possible was with the pool. Some pools sent you an email and alerted you when a rig went down. However 50% of the time I never got any emails.Then there was the DAO hack. I had tons of ETH I was holding and then when the hack happened I ended up selling at a crappy price because there was bad publicity how the coin is going to die. I think I sold at the lowest price ever at the time. Oh well...Whats your memorable ETH mining moment....",
