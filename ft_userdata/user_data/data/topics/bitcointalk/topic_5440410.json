I recently got rank up so thought I'd share some joy with the forum members, so I'd like to give away some btc treats as a giveaway. And since I have never given a giveaway, I would like to know from you which methods would be the easiest for me to use?Waiting for your replies To add to the above mentioned tools/ideas, you can also consider two ideas that, while may not be as easy as using the tools and aren't new to experienced users of the forum, also end up working to select winners to a specific prize:Make a themed event where you'll give the award (let's say, for example, BTC) to a user whose submissions is the best one (according to some criteria). This has happened in the past - for example with theymos art competition[1] or even pumpkin carving contest[2]. You can see that you can get outstanding submissions that wouldn't happen if such event hadn't occurred.Make the users guess which block will be mined on X day (at Y hour) : 1miau has done that recently (with support from GazetaBitcoin) and it's always nice to see how people make the math and you'll also make users learn how the blockchain works in order to make accurate guesses!I reckon that these suggestions are a bit more \"hard\" to pull off (when compared to the handsome tool made by bitmover) but they are, nonetheless, great ways to generate activity from within the forum users.[1]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5193860.0[2]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416347.0[3]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5121375.msg61519925#msg61519925",

But I still don't know the main reason for what you actually give the giveaway.  But for whatever reason, I pray that your purpose may be fulfilled. and the method you chose to select the winner is appreciated",
