  "content": "Found an interesting article today coming from Spain, it says that someone contracted a debt with another private party, it was a simple two-guy debt setting without a legal agreement other than Whatsapp messages. \"I need X amount of money, I will pay you back\". The creditor accepted and so sent 0.58 BTC to this guy which eventually refused to pay back. What's interesting is that for the first time ever the judge said the debt plus interest must be paid back in Bitcoin, not the fiat currency (EUR in Spain). Due counterparty risk, he will have to pay more since by the time the agreement happened the price of Bitcoin was cheaper, specifically, 14.000€ at current rate, 5.900€ back then. It's one of those things, you may take advantage of the fluctuating price or you may have to pay more. At the end of the day this is positive for BTC since it is being considered as a viable way to settle debts between private parties by authorities, which always translates into better regulation and in general being looked like less of a dodgy guy when you liquidate it into a bank deposit.Source: https://es.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/juzgado-en-espana-ordena-devolucion-de-prestamo-en-bitcoin-no-en-euros-2401286",

Although it cannot be use as legal tender which is the Euro or use as an international transaction currency. But the individual payment if agreed between two people is not frowned upon. So base on the law it was logical to have the debtor pay back in bitcoin. The sweetness in this is a bitcoin stays the same and doesn’t devalue like the fiat currency. And the use of it for loan repayment can solve many problems associated with fiat",

It will be challenging for certain regions to accept bitcoin as legal tender, but I am certain some will. The issue was that the debtor wants to pay part of the debt in fiat money but the creditor refused because he wants his money in Bitcoin. This judgment was triggered by the fact that bitcoin is recognized as a currency in  Spain. And the judge in his wisdom ruled that the debt should be paid with the agreed currency. I wonder what will happen if such a disagreement happens in Mainland China. Both parties will just keep silent or settle the matter between themselves and the creditor would have been cheated. This is because exposing such a case might lead to confiscation of the funds or even imprisonment. The court acted wisely and such news can lead to bitcoin awareness because people will appreciate the fact that bitcoin is also backed by the law.",

Here we have an unorthodox contract formed on the shifting sands of a Whatsapp conversation, predicated on the exchange of 0.58 BTC, a sum not inconsequential in today's market. Indeed, the central thrust of this tale pivots on the court's verdict, mandating the repayment in Bitcoin, a precedent-setting move in the otherwise Euros-tied legal landscape of Spain. This development suggests a shift in perception of BTC from an obscure asset into a legitimate currency. However, let us not rush into celebrating this as a victory for the crypto community. The ruling merely applies the principle of restitution to its logical conclusion, as per the original agreement. It's less of a step towards broader regulation, as some might infer, and more of a rather specific legal interpretation. I would urge you to take this news with a pinch of salt.",
