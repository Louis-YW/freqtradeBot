  "content": "Hi,A few days ago, I did a Forward swap to the Lightning channel. About 28 hours later a “Swap refund” showed up for the whole amount (minus fees, it seems). I didn't understand why, but I left it at that. Today, I did a new Forward swap, for a lesser amount. This time it took only three hours before a Swap refund was once again initiated (by who? the “Boltz backend”?). That was two hours ago. At time of writing this “refund” isn't even confirmed on the Blockchain yet.I'm in a bit of a fix - no funds left in the Lightning channel. What is going on? What should I do to have this not happen?",

(also complain to the wallet provider about those funds not coming back to you if you can't pick what node to connect to and it doesn't just select a random one for you). Thank you very much, and sorry for the delay — I wasn't expecting such a quick reply.I have been using BTC with Electrum for many years, after moving all funds off the exchanges, but in a rather low-key manner (mostly shopping needs). Lightning is very new for me, so please bear with me, I'm not at all familiar with some of its workings.Following the indications of an instructor who seemed experienced and reliable, I modified Electrum's config file in order to connect to one node only (instead of various nodes selected at random). He recommended a couple of them. I opted for 'blockstream.info:700'. That same instructor recommended opening the channel with ACINQ. So far it had been going OK — another channel opened with Electrum trampoline got closed on me without my understanding the reason.Do I understand correctly that you would suggest I reinstate the use of multiple nodes? As far as the wallet itself is concerned, I only use Electrum and I wouldn't know what else to use. Also, Electrum only gives me three options when opening a channel (incidentally, 'hodlister.co' was also recommended by the instructor, but only as a single node, not to open a LN channel with).I'm not sure how I should complain to Electrum (the wallet provider) — anyway, the fees lost were really minimal, single-digit euro cents.Last, is the 'Boltz backend', which Electrum designates as \"powering submarine swaps\" in any way related to all this?Anyway, whether it's Boltz, ACINQ or blockstream.info that's responsible for this, what could be the reason for it or they doing it?Quote from: nc50lc on October 20, 2022, 06:49:57 AMQuote from: Josson on October 19, 2022, 02:39:44 PM-snip-Just make sure that your channel has enough inbound liquidity to accept the swapped amount.You can check it in \"can receive n BTC\" value in the 'Channels' tab.If it's not the inbound capacity, there must be a reason why Boltz can't send your \"swapped\" lightning fundslike poor channel connectivity, etc.Quote from: Josson on October 19, 2022, 02:39:44 PMThat was two hours ago.

Or maybe I didn't explain things properly. As evidenced by this screenshot:the two Forward swaps had gone through perfectly well, and it's only some time later that someone, somehow, in the name of what? was able to initiate the Swap refunds. The second \"refund\", initiated shortly before I wrote this post, only went through in the night. Note that the part that's greyed/dimmed is a new Forward swap I did after writing the post — I kept an eye on it, and as soon as it was through (very quickly) I did the Lightning transactions before that same someone somehow came and did a new \"refund\".[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

I hadn't realised that the amount showing in the description meant anything in particular. Looking back in time I find that out of good number of Forward swaps there's only one without the amount, about a month ago. But as far as I can see it didn't cause any hassles. I should also think that during the 28 hours that lapsed between tx6 and tx7 I would have had plenty of time to use the funds as I did in tx2 and tx3.Concerning connection issues, I can't see that it should have been the case at my end (unless... shutting down the computer? - I had understood that this could be a problem if I had my own node, which is not the case). If it's at Boltz's end that the problem lies, the fact is that Electrum doesn't give us another option.If Boltz fails, as you wrote, to send amounts that are not very substantial, could it be a question of fees? On-chain, in 99 out of 100 transactions, I put the lowest fee, for the simple reason that I'm never in a hurry, but that's maybe not the right thing to do in LN?P.S. I hope this reply gets accepted - my previous reply got me a warning from a moderator which I wasn't able to understand for lack of familiarit with the terminology.Quote from: Abdussamad on October 20, 2022, 01:39:56 PMConnecting to just one server reduces your security somewhat.

It was the LN instructor I mentioned that suggested to use only one node and recommended a couple of them in particular. His point was that that some nodes in the crowd might be a bit dodgy, and that using one node only is slightly better in terms of anonimity.

A bit inconvenient, as I may have to reboot or switch servers occasionally, and the fact that I like to shut down when I go to bed. But I'll certainly pay attention to this aspect.Also, I now understand that there's something called swaps services, or instant exchange services, that have a life of their own.Quote from: nc50lc on October 21, 2022, 04:10:21 AMFor the mod's note, they just combined your two-in-a-row posts.It seemed normal to reply back separately to two different posters, but yes, that's what they did.

They are run by random volunteers and cannot be trusted. Getting data from multiple servers and cross checking it is better than relying on any one server. The exception to this rule is if you are running your own server in which case you have a copy of the blockchain locally and don't need to trust anyone else.",
