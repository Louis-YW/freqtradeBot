A cold wallet is one which is permanently offline, not one which occasionally connects to the internet.What you want to do is to install Bitcoin Core on a permanently airgapped device which will never be connected to the internet. You can then use this to generate a new wallet and private keys without needing to sync the blockchain. You then export the addresses from this wallet and import the addresses only (and not the private keys) in to a new wallet on an online and fully synced version of Bitcoin Core. The online synced wallet creates an unsigned transaction, you move the unsigned transaction to your airgapped wallet to be signed, and then move it back to your online wallet to be broadcast.",

Bitcoin Core gives this warning when you first run it:QuoteThis initial synchronisation is very demanding, and may expose hardware problems with your computer that had previously gone unnoticed.I'd say start testing your hardware. Your CPU's TDP is 84W. It may be overheating, or your power supply might be unstable. Or your memory or SSD might be bad. I'd start with the CPU temperature though.",

Because i dont really belive in ledger or trezor.The plan was fallowing to store my coins:1.Bitcoin holding - Download bitcore  from bitcoin.org - download whole blockchain make 3 keys backups(on 3 diffrent pendrives) and sync it once every 2 months.2.Cardano Holding - Download DAEDALUS WALLET from cardano.org and rest like ^3.BNB and BUSD - Holding it on Binance (Its centralised chain soo anyway it dosent really change anything)4.Ethereum - create wallet on my ether wallet and make 3 backups on pendrives.(I wanted to download mist wallet but it dosent seems to working anymore)(every wallet be offline all the time Only windows + wallet will be installed on the SSD each Wallet has separate PC).Is there anything that i can improove in my Holding steps? The ammount of time im planning to hold until i sell is 2-3 years.(Im just spending small ammounts from 2 months 400USD weekly on crypto)",

But form the few info you provide I don't know.Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 01:33:56 PM1.Bitcoin holding - Download bitcore  from bitcoin.org - download whole blockchain make 3 keys backups(on 3 diffrent pendrives) and sync it once every 2 months.Getting your wallet online even for a second is unsafe. And I have a feeling you want to store big money if you want to use different computers for each. So .. don't.(Plus, since the cold storage never goes online, not even for windows updates, you can easily keep all wallets on that one. I repeat, sync is not needed for cold storage).If you want only safety and you don't care too much about privacy, I will recommend Electrum because it's easier to handle and better documented.One Electrum will stay forever offline. That one contains the seed. Offline.Another Electrum, on another computer, will go online. That's a watch only wallet. They will work together. The watch only wallet will handle the online stuff (see funds/inputs, create transactions, broadcast transactions) and since it's online it's OK. The offline cold storage will only sign transactions (you transfer from the watch wallet and back when signed, to broadcast). The watch only wallet is created from master public key, not for seed. Some more details are here: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlSimilar logic can be done with Bitcoin core, but I don't have experience with that. However, there too, the cold storage stays offline. Always.Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 01:33:56 PM2.Sorry, I don't know (nor care much) about these.",

At least if privacy is your concern, storing them on an exchange will eventually require an ID verification for withdrawal etc since they can easily change their policy.",

Using -reindex?If you still haven't, follow the log's suggestion to start Bitcoin-qt with -reindex-chainstate command line option (instructions).But AFAIK, having a corrupted chainstate wont cause the GUI to crash without errors.But the log doesn't tell much about the issue, are there any non-default settings? (should already be available if the full log is provided)",
