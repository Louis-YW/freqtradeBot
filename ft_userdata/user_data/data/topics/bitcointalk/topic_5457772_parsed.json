  "content": "Let's begin by knowing what a black tax is..WHAT IS BLACK TAX? Wikipedia explained BLACK TAX to mean, giving to parents, siblings, and other family members, often out of obligation, or a deeply ingrained sense of family responsibility.Now, for us to better understand this, many of us feel it's our responsibility to take care of our parents, sibling(mostly the younger ones), and other family members like our aged uncles and aunties, maybe even nephews and cousins, most especially those without parents anymore, and to achieve this, we sometimes inconvenience ourselves, put our own plans on hold, to make sure their own needs are taken care of first.So, born from my own personal experience, or should I rather say what I am currently going through, I will like to ask this honorable forum members, How are you dealing with Black Tax after making money from crypto?Personally for me, it's been hell really, on a monthly basis, I make good amount of money from my several crypto activities, like trading, staking, investments, my participation on forum ad signature campaigns and all that, but at the end of the day, its as if I am not even trying due to personal and family expenses( family expenses mostly since it does not even allow me take care of most of my personal expenses), with the total amount of money I make every month from all my crypto activities, I should be a millionaire (in my country's currency please) by now Economically, but I discover I am still like the average person I was years back before I entered crypto(a slight difference though).I really wanna be better, I wanna learn how to deal with the issue of black tax, I wanna learn from your own experiences, stories, contributions or perhaps, your suggestions, so please feel free to contribute to this discussion.",

      "body": "To be honest and sincere, family is one of the major reason that drives me to want to make money. I get happily when they are happy, well, safe and around. They are the best part of my life. Even after I build my own family(not yet married), I would still get to take good care of them. These responsibilities is a choice, but making the wrong choice could jeopardize ones future. No matter how stressful it might be, taking good care of them and abandoning our own personal goals could be just one right thing to do. Before I got into the crypto space I was able to provide for them the litte I could even when my business wasn't moving as expected. I just believed that all would be better one day and I would have enough to care for them. So as long as they are well, you just have to over look how much you spend on a daily basis because the more you think about it, the more negative taught keeps running on your mind. And remember no matter how much you have you cannot buy a good family",

How can I advice someone to stop making money? How is he going to Carter for his family. Sorry you misunderstood my words I should have explained better",

Do you have some sort of authority in the house since you're basically the breadwinner from what you've describe? If none yet then try to be assertive. Small things like telling your younger siblings to save on electricity and water could go a long way. Teaching them about budgeting will also help them learn about responsibility at a younger age.",

Term of this procedure put me in confusion that why it is called as black while i found nothing wrong in paying it, instead the tax we pay to government will be called as Black Tax  . I have watched some movies in which when a kid turn 18, their parent ask them to live on their own and the kid does not have to look after his parents financially. If i am not wrong about this culture.Speaking freely, i am also living the same old life even back i was not earning and now i earn money but the issue is my love and care for my parents that they give me so much love and fulfilled all of my needs and wishes and that love did not allow me to ignore there needs and wishes. So, according to my status i try my best to pay Black Tax. I also live with my parents and i am not that old and in our country there is no concept of moving out leaving parents behind too.How can we deal with it, simple earn more and try to save money for yourself and fulfill your own needs too as they also love you and they must be worry about you too. I think we should not take it as tax because that's not what i am atleast paying.",

If possible you can empower some of the people who depend on you, so they can start making money of their own and in the long run it'll relieve you of the financial stress.

I know he'll never spend his savings because of the way he lives, and even if he tried he's got enough to live a good life for another 10+ years without having to lift a finger. I never had to support my family financially, it was rather the other way round. Nowadays I don't get anything from them, but they also don't need me, apart from the occasional help with bills and papers, which is typical for old folks. If you're earning good money, try to give your family the rod instead of the fish. Give them a business idea, maybe help them find jobs, or buy them a place they can turn into a small store, or a food stand. A child should never be the main provider for the family. You can help them from time to time, but you should not be their slave.Come up with an amount of money you can give them each month, and make sure this is less than 50% of what you make.",

Maybe a part of your crypto income could secure education for a sibling, seed a family venture, or upskill a relative.This way, you're teaching them to fish rather than just handing them fish.

Its true that if ever i havent been able to do such thing then i might be millionaire as of this moment but since you have spend it out or actively been converting those crypto earnings then those opportunity or chance is gone.Im really that getting stressed into this situation and this is why im trying to put up some boundaries via spending less and if i would say that i dont already have funds then thats it.Im not going past beyond those limits which i do set where it is mostly that i do take a huge chunk or % of earning to savings and wont be tending on touching it no matter what.",

      "body": "The question is both simple and complex Let's start with taxes in general. Taxes have to be paid! Whether we like it or not, a normal state does not print money, it collects TAXES. And these are our parents' pensions, medicine, and the social obligations of the state. More precisely - the ability to fulfill them and the level of their quality.And here we come to the so-called \"black taxes\". It is because the state either does not receive enough taxes, or underpays them, or does not use them effectively - we, those who can earn, and those who have a responsibility to their close relatives, are forced to pay them.But there are nuances here, too. Some people \"score\" on their parents and younger siblings, for example, and some people live only for themselves. I, for example, support my parents, my wife's mother, and my niece. No, it doesn't mean that I am their breadwinner and they are my dependents, no - they don't have a meager income, but I have the ability and desire to help them and raise their standard of living a bit.Cryptocurrency, for the last 7-8 years gave me a very good income, and now brings profit - from investing activities, from trading, and other things, which gives additional almost \"passive income\".So my answer - I have a positive attitude to paying taxes, both white and \"black\", and not only from income from cryptocurrency",

Just like on what others been saying above that you should put up limits on the money that you would gonna spend on 1 month and the rest would be saved up for long term holds. This is hard because you have been get used to on helping your family in terms of finances which you cant really ignore some situations which you would might end up on supporting them once again. If you do wishon having a progress at least then start on having that discipline towards your spending and put up limits. Black tax is something that it isnt that a responsibility but this is a normal urge for you to give money because of that sense of giving back into your family.",

However, you must set a plan for your self as time waits for nobody especially if you are advancing in age and wanting to carter for everyone is something that would possibly drag you back just as I have said with our proverbs. You must have some multiple stream of income for you to be able to foot the bills of everyone or possibly starting distribution of money, as man I know they needs to be taken care of but you can't dispute the facts that it's a must do duty or responsibility, yes let say it's but you need to stand firmly before trying to lift a heavy load and if you don't stand firmly same people, same family members are still the ones to make gest of you. I was actually facing same issues less until I met an uncle who is also wealthy and I asked how were you able to managed all these things at your time, and yet you were able to stand firmly without being poor. What he said to me is that \"set a plan for yourself to stand first before thinking how to take a proper care of others\" I was like are you being serious sir? He said yes by son!That they were eating, living and walking even when you weren't of age and despite being of age they are still alive and they won't die being that their health condition is safe, go hustle and get yourself established after which you may come back and clean them up.That was he's own part of experience and to what he explained to me, You know as someone who is wealthy and well respected in our community I did not even bother to do anything else than to put all he said in practice and I believe some results are already manifesting.",
