Gensler considers all cryptocurrencies to be securities and are operating illegally if they are not registered with SEC. Except for BTC. Quotehttps://www.wsj.com/articles/ethers-new-staking-model-could-draw-sec-attention-11663266224Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said Thursday that cryptocurrencies and intermediaries that allow holders to “stake” their coins might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security. Known as the Howey test, it examines whether investors expect to earn a return from the work of third parties. “From the coin’s perspective…that’s another indicia that under the Howey test, the investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others,” Mr. Gensler told reporters after a congressional hearing. He said he wasn’t referring to any specific cryptocurrency. Howey test is a test you wanna fail if you don't wanna be regulated by SEC.",

Honestly the SEC can move the goalposts anytime they want to make it work for them.  Will they classify PoS coins as securities, no clue.  I have read too much into the reasons that would make them classify them as such but if they did eth pricing could see a massive hit in the short term.",

If they assert that ETH is a security, it would be contrary to the old claims, this would contradict their statement. But if they declare ETH is not a security then this will be a good reason for XRP, they will protest against the SEC.

Thank you very much. This is what SEC have been trying to do for so long and with this consensus change into PoS it will become more reasons for SEC to finally impose ETH into security. However, SEC will still need sometimes to finally make the decision, the problem if SEC does not classify ETH as security then it will deny it's own decision that said XRP is a security, and it will not be good image for them.",

For decentralized staking you could argue that users are being compensated for providing security to the network and this does not meet the criteria of being a security.That's certainly true, mate. But there's nothing stopping ETC from reaching the top if developers become interested in it. There's been a lot of criticism surrounding ETH's new consensus algorithm (especially that it sacrifices decentralization in favor of cost-efficiency), so it's likely PoW chains (with the exception of ETHW) will gain massive traction soon. Regarding securities laws, I think centralized exchanges and staking services would be the ones required to comply. Stakers (validators) earning rewards in a decentralized manner would be exempt from this. If the government does otherwise (enforcing securities laws on decentralized protocols/networks), then crypto advocates would challenge its actions within a court of law.Just because the US government succeeded taking down Tornado.Cash (even though smart contracts are alive), doesn't mean that it will be successful at enforcing securities laws within decentralized cryptocurrencies. We're going to have to see whenever ETH will succeed or ultimately fail in the long run. Who knows what the US government's next move will be? Just my thoughts",

But that still won't exclude it from being classified as a security by the SEC. Everything will depend how much power is given to the validators on the network. If the ones controlling most of the tokens on the Blockchain are exchanges and centralized service providers, then you can bet the SEC will be on such entities' tails to enforce securities laws. That won't apply to private individuals, though.We're going to have to see how regulations will be applied to the rapidly-evolving crypto/Blockchain space. If somehow ETH becomes compromised, then we would have no choice but to switch to \"Plan B\" by using a PoW fork like Ethereum Classic (technically, it's the original version of the ETH blockchain). No one knows what will happen in the future, so we can only hope for the best. Just my thoughts",
