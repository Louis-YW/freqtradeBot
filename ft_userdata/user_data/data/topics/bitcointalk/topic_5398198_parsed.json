      "body": "I read your entire post yesterday and tried to give it a good night sleep and re-read them again today in hope for a new perspective. And the impression I get still the same as last night:Where exactly on your narrative is the scam attempt happen? I haven't read or do any DD on 5Dimes, just a glance at their website, and although the website looks... worrying, based on your narrative --unless you can provide further info and evidence on whichnpoimt amd what form does the scam happen-- the impression I get from both time is that this is a simple case of Karen. And no, not only when you pull the card to[ask for manager, it's from the exact point where you demanded something so technical about 30% discount.Forgive me if I'm wrong, I have no idea about gambling terms at all, but wasn't what you insisting are explained here already?The way I see it, you're being banned for wasting their time with 2 hours of chat, spamming their helpdesk by asking on multiple chat topic, and ultimately asking something rather personal and completely not related to the topic in discussion.",

      "body": "A support staff banning your from the casino's chat is not a scam. Your feelings and opinions that Max might be an Indian who is a scammer waiting for you to deposit money so he can confiscate them is also not a scam. The only thing that happened here is that you got banned from accessing the chat by someone who has the power to do so. Maybe he didn't have to do it, but you also didn't have to go off-topic and talk about Luna or Terra. 5Dimes did not scam you, case closed.",
