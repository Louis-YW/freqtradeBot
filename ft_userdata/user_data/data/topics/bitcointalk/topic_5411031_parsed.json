So they remain one step ahead of the game as we all know that IRS offers bounty to software developers to break Monero.",

Though Bitcoin isn't a privacy coins, but you can take advantages to use Bitcoin mixer and decentralized exchanges, also own non custodial wallet that run full node. If you really take care about your privacy, Bitcoin could become 100% anonymous.",

Because so far there are no other privacy coins in the market that were good as the Monero. Anyway, in the case of investment consideration, I think it needs more study because currently, some governments are very hostile against privacy coins, particularly in Monero.",

There will be more regulations on privacy coins as well as more fud against those coins. If you are investor, you don't need it.If governments launch more regulations, enforce exchanges to delete privacy coins, exchanges will have to do it. Price will react very bad with delisting news.",

Monero is top of the mind since it has been battle-tested that even IRS has a bounty on those who are able to trace/crack Monero transactions, it gives proof that Monero has solid underlying privacy technologies. With that in mind, there are few alternatives, but still, it also has other different advantages and disadvantages, we can name the coins like Grin, Zcash, and LTC.",

We have Zcash and Dash as well, but XMR is our best privacy coin. Privacy coins are mostly old coins so they are usually used for certain purposes rather than an investment as their hype is mostly gone or not too big to make a profit.Nowadays privacy coins are the target of government so it is very risky when you invest in them.

Might be more risky if you will choose other coins which is not that being considered by many. Who knows though if there is/are.Is that just what are you trying to find out?
