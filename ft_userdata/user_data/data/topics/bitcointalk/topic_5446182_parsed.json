  "content": "Today I was heading to a studio where am doing music production, I saw a young child crying home from school, I couldn't help it because you can feels his emotions, and I was like what happens to you, he said he's an orphan staying with her aunt who he normally sells for her but it will take her a decade to pay his school fees after school have sent home with flogging on several occasions, that most at times he sleep outside the house or kitchen if he fails to sell the whole pure water or eventually made any losses.So I held him in his hands and say come and show me your Aunty's house! He scream nooo, my aunt will kill me if I do.¬† I really understand him, then I took him to his school and see the proprietor of the school who later explains how the child has been owing and the aunt will be less concern no matter how you flog the child.I told him never to flog the child again, that will pay for the child school fees and uniforms till his primary six or basic six. I don't have much but I grow up as an orphan and I know what it is to live with wicked persons. Let's treat human beings as though they're humans, if you can help someone else child stop using them for selfishness. Be good to others because God has been so good to you.",

      "body": "This story made me sad to read. I think you are a good person to help this orphan and to pay for his school fees. I wonder what the orphan sells for his aunty maybe he is not doing his job well so she is mad with him.He is so scared of his aunty I want to know why he says she will kill him. Maybe he has done something bad to her he is not saying to you. But yes I agree like you say it is always good to help someone. All human beings have feelings.",

      "body": "In this case, it's really commendable that you took the time to stop and talk to him and offer him help. It's so important to be compassionate and empathetic towards others, especially those who may be going through a tough time. Heartwarming to hear that you were able to help him out by paying for his school fees and uniforms. I mean, it's not something that everyone would do, but it's really inspiring to hear that you were able to step up and make a difference in this child's life.I can understand why the child was hesitant to show you where he lived, especially if he was afraid of his aunt's reaction. But it's really great that you were able to connect with the school proprietor and get more information about his situation.¬† I hope that the child will be able to thrive and succeed in school now that he doesn't have to worry about being flogged or not having the resources to pay for his education.",

      "body": "it is generally considered to be a good thing to help someone. Helping others can bring a sense of fulfillment and purpose to our lives, as well as benefit the people we help. Whether it's a small gesture like holding the door open for someone or a larger act of generosity like volunteering at a charity or donating to a cause, helping others can have a positive impact on both the giver and the receiver.Research has shown that helping others can also lead to improved mental health and well-being. Acts of kindness and generosity have been linked to increased happiness, reduced stress levels, and improved self-esteem. Additionally, helping others can strengthen our relationships and connections with others, which can also have a positive impact on our overall well-being.Of course, it's important to balance helping others with taking care of our own needs and boundaries. It's not always possible or appropriate to help everyone, and it's important to set healthy boundaries and prioritize our own well-being as well. But in general, helping others is a positive and worthwhile thing to do.",

There was this thread on twitter sometime ago where author literally asked people to repeated state that their siblings kids are also their kids. I think it goes beyond just ones' immediate family. We should learn and cultivate love as an attitude, only then can we actually live.Our humanity should come first!",
