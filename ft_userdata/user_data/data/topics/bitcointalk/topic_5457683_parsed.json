  "content": "I tried to deposit euros to Kraken via SEPA. Their new bank coordinates now identify a bank account in the United Kingdom, and the money transfer is considered \"extra-SEPA\". I remember that years ago Kraken accepted deposits into a bank in Germany, and the SEPA transfers were free. Now with their bank in the UK, my bank (ING) charges 30€ plus a 1.5% fee for currency conversion from EUR to GBP.Is there a cheaper way to deposit?",

      "body": "The problem with the UK bank is that ING would send the euro payment via SWIFT instead of SEPA, and that's expensive. I discovered that to deposit on Kraken it's possible to select a different beneficiary bank in Liechtenstein and the whole process remains in euro and goes over SEPA, for free.",

This British bank that Kraken uses to receive deposits does not accept SEPA payments, so ING would use SWIFT instead.1.5% for conversion from EUR (my balance) to GBP (recipient bank's balance). The British bank has its account denominated in GBP, so currency conversion is done automatically upon depositing EUR.The easy solution that I couldn't find earlier is to select a different beneficiary bank, in Liechtenstein, to send the EUR deposit to.",
