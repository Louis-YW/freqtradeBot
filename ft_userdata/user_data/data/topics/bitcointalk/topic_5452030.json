I think it will take ages for this transaction to get confirmed because fees go crazy sometimes.Just did a CPFP, so hopefully, that would do the job without Royse777 bumping the fee: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/3a5978099ea12d161f7f3b9901010c9ee4959d142ce0842ff8a8b36048661117I'll update this post when it gets a confirmation...Update:It's now confirmed :)Please read the following link to add to your insight regarding the differences between the three fee estimation algorithm options:https://bitcoinelectrum.com/how-to-manually-set-transaction-fees/",

The mempool is around 184 sat/vbyte now. The transaction will only get stuck and remain unconfirmed for long time, or will be dropped out of mempool.If you are using mobile Electrum, you can use static option to set the fee to 200 sat/vbyte. If you use desktop Electrum, you can just edit the fee as nc50lc commented about it already. If fee customization is the problem (I mean on Android Electrum) after checking https://mempool.space, Bluewallet support fee customization. But only BIP39 seed phrase support RBF and CPFP on Bluewallet.",

The mempool is around 184 sat/vbyte now. The transaction will only get stuck and remain unconfirmed for long time, or will be dropped out of mempool.The transaction won't even broadcast at such a fee. The current minimum fee to be accepting in to the mempool for nodes running default settings (the vast majority) is around 31 sats/vbyte. If you try to broadcast a transaction at 1 sat/vbyte, most nodes won't accept it.",

You may try lower fees but no one knows if mempool gets stuck again or not, it depends on you, you may risk and tomorrow you'll get your transaction confirmed with 30 sat/byte because slowly fees are going down as it seems throughout the day but there is a chance that people will spam blockchain and fees will skyrocket again. Decide yourself, keep in mind that bitcoin price changes by some % throughout the day, keep that in mind.@joker_josueCongrats, my first image officially uploaded on your website",

Eta and Mempool use different algorithms for fee estimation. It doesn't matter which option you choose, it won't affect the speed at which your transaction will get confirmed. What matters is the fee rate you set.You can also use mempool.space to have a rough estimation on what fee rate you need to set for your transaction to have a fast/medium/low priority.",
