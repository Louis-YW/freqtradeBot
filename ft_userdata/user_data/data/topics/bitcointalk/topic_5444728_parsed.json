I still have some issues with controlling the maximum temperature in the room. To handle that, I have to take a separate power connection other than solar power. When it comes to your question, my answer is sustainable approaches(Hydro Power, Wind Power) are already there.",

      "body": "In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in interest in Sustainable Crypto Mining (also known as Green Mining). Many mining farms around the globe are exploring green options to reduce their carbon footprint and promote cleaner, more sustainable cryptocurrencies. If you're interested in learning more about green mining and discovering examples of countries that have already adopted this practice, we encourage you to check out the following article: https://zionodes.com/blog/green-mining-a-global-overview.",
