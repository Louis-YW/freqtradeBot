But it is still new and no evidence that you have good reputation yet. But let us see how it goes. How about the login and sign up links on the website? You are regarding it as no KYC instant exchange, then why sign up and login?",

You the ones who need potential visitors to the site, and people also needs to build trust on you. So yes it would be better if you maintain pure transparency among everyone. Moreover along with other members, I too don’t get about the “sign up and login” button. You mentioned in the OP, regarding no registration thing. So why someone should register?

But my advice to anyone using this platform should be very careful with the rate of exchange they always present here because they always knows how to get users attention since people don't want to reveal their kyc details they believe it could be easier to attract and lure you into using their platform. I would prefer an exchange with kyc that are reputable to trade instead of failing prey for new platform.",

They can also later force anyone to provide KYC. Quote from: Little Mouse on November 06, 2022, 04:49:51 PMIs this question really relevant?

Thanks for pointing to that. I have just noticed they are called instant exchange, but no much privacy as some even give the option to sign in with social media like Facebook. I remember when I was using instant exchange on Coinomi when I still do not know much about crypto, no login but just a third party. Just a confusion because I ihave not accessed any instant exchange website for use before and it was long ago k used instant exchange last.@cryptochanger.toI will edit my post and be a bit soft, I hope you will be a good instant exchange.",
