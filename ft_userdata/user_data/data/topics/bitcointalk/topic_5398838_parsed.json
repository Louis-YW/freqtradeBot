  "content": "I figured that a continuously updated table (relative to the current difficulty) would list all of the current-generation ASICs - the ones that are still mostly used that is - and USB miners, and make a table of electricity prices denominated in (US) cents/kwh, with a third column reading the average profit of that miner if it were to run continuously with the current difficulty and electricity prices.Has anyone ever made such a website before?Note: I am not talking about mining profitability calculators.",
