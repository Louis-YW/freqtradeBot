Some exchanges like Binance are naturally shady and the problems they face are more real than others since they may not even have enough bitcoins to pay everyone which could be the reason why they stopped letting people withdraw bitcoin but they still allow withdrawal of shitcoins on alternative chains (like BTC on Binance chain which is not really BTC).Other exchanges like Coinbase are facing smaller problems since their shadiness is far less than the first group but the problems they face is mainly because these days a large number of people are buying bitcoin and transferring it to their cold storages taking advantage of the current discount.",

I was surprised that some people want to move their coins from Binance to another exchange to sell, which means they think Binance is a wallet, I just do not know the reason behind that.

They have producy of earn savings which your btc can be stake/unstake flexibly with 5% apy, (just checked now) before its only 1% or 2%.But obviously this isnt an on chain btc since we all knew that btc doesnt have staking but only a program initiated by binance for their users.",
