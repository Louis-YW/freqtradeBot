Some also say that Paxful was the main reason behind this shut down. People saw more features in Paxful and hence moved there completely.

Although I think it's indeed the reason as far as Localcryptos are concerned, it probably wasn't as to the case of LocalBitcoins. LocalBitcoins complied with regulatory demands. Therefore, they didn't have to shutdown because of regulatory challenges. It was probably more of dwindling activity or volume brought by the crypto winter and their mandatory KYC. Localcryptos remained principled until the end; they had to shutdown. As to Paxful, although they also mentioned it, the shutdown wasn't really about stricter regulations. It was more of internal disagreement on ownership and control. It reopened later with another CEO.",

They are actually better alternatives in terms of privacy because they don't ask for KYC yet. The only disadvantage is low liquidity, but if you really care about not handing over your KYC documents to many online platforms, they are the services to use for now.Some have already been mentioned by other members, but let me list morehttps://localcoinswap.com/https://hodlhodl.com/https://peachbitcoin.com/https://bisq.network/",

I knew Localbitcoins but never transacted there simply because it's an old way of exchange, they've had their good moments when cryptocurrency was not as exposed as this and working in the old way is primarily the reason I believe they stopped operation, they couldn't meet up with the competition. This is the second time in less than a year and I believe they are going for good this time.Come to think of it, they are doing KYC, this is despite that their transcription fees are so high. I don't think it would be a smart idea for anyone to deal with them when they can easily deal with regular exchanges like Binance with low fees.In other words, cheapness and ease of doing business within exchanges might be the main cause of this, people are taking their businesses elsewhere.",

And what does that have to do with being centralized or not?It is not about what i think, an exchange that makes kyc mandatory cannot be called a decentralized or p2p exchange, if you have to submit information about yourself and still deposit funds into a wallet that only the exchange controls in order to trade, then that's surely not a p2p trade, you can call it what you want, and maybe peer to exchange, and then exchange to the trading peer on the other side is suitable. Buddy, It has a lot with being centralized, because that is simply what kyc exchanges are called, and as with everything centralized, there is a single point ot failure, it could be a honeypot service and data could be fed to the LE at anytime.Quote from: khaled0111 on November 17, 2023, 10:59:49 PMLbc was still a p2p exchange even after enforcing kyc and, BTW, I don't believe this is the reason, or the drop of their trading volume, is the reason why they had to shut down their services. Binance have the strictest kyc requirements but they still have a p2p exchange platform. Binance have always been a centralized exchange, most of their customers have always been people who didn't mind submitting their data to centralized services, how do you compare it to LocalBitcoins that was a p2p exchange that didn't require kyc, and then decided to make it mandatory along the line, what do you think would happen to trading volume in Bisq or AgoraDesk if they make KYC compulsory tomorrow? Majority of their customers would look for another p2p alternative. And FWIW, p2p on Binance isn't true p2p.",

It doesn't mean peer to middle man to peer. If there is a middle man called Binance with which you have to register an account, complete KYC, deposit your coins or fiat, and who can spy on everything you do, block or reverse trades, close your account, confiscate your coins, etc., then that isn't peer to peer in the slightest. It is completely centralized in all but name.There are plenty of exchanges out there which call themselves peer to peer or call themselves decentralized when they are no such thing. This has been the case for years:Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on September 14, 2020, 09:26:47 AMThere is a problem with a lot of exchanges using the word \"decentralized\" as a marketing tool and gimmick, when in reality they are not decentralized at all. Sites like LocalBitcoins and IDEX which claim to be decentralized, and yet users have to deposit coins to their custodial wallets and complete KYC. Complete nonsense.How could a truly peer to peer exchange even collect KYC? For an exchange to collect KYC then there must be a centralized third party to do that collection in the first place, at which point you are no longer trading peer to peer but trading with permission of this centralized third party. There are very few truly peer to peer exchanges out there, and even fewer truly decentralized ones. Bisq remains the best option for both criteria.",
