I don't see the point in pointing out on this forum for the 1000th time that bitcoin uses less electricity than everything from watching porn to running clothes dryers - everyone who has spent more than 2 minutes looking in to knows that bitcoin is a tiny fraction of a single percent of global electricity use. And I also don't see the point in pointing out yet again that bitcoin mining uses more renewable energy than any other sector on the planet, because again, this is common knowledge to anyone who cares to look in to it.But these such articles are not targeted towards individuals who will bother to look in to it themselves. These such articles are targeted at people who believe everything they read online without a second thought. The government need something to direct people's anger at when they inevitably miss all the renewable energy and lower emissions targets they have set, and they also obviously have a vested interest in bitcoin not being successful. So someone in the press department put two and two together and realized that they could use both these issues to their advantage. And so we see articles like this, getting the average moron angry about bitcoin and giving the government a future excuse for their own failings.",

Look at China for example. They banned bitcoin mining last year, there was a very short lived dip in the hashrate, and then a quick recovery and growth from the starting point. The miners simply moved to other countries (including here in the US), or ignored the ban. Today, China still accounts for ~20% of the global hashrate, so the ban hasn't exactly been effective. And it made literally zero difference to China's electricity consumption.The exact same thing will happen in the case of a US ban. Temporary dip in hashrate followed by a return to the previous steady growth, with absolutely no difference in nationwide electricity consumption.",

Quote from: Lucius on September 14, 2022, 04:15:06 PMbut I would like one of those geniuses to explain to me how in this particular case Bitcoin with its (currently) 250 TWh per year threatens US climate efforts? I think it has been proven many times that more than 50% of the energy for Bitcoin mining comes from renewable sources and that from that point of view it is crazy to talk about Bitcoin as any problem when it comes to the climate.Mining bitcoin requires stable electricity. Even if \"renewable\" energy is used, \"traditional\" electric sources will need to be on hand to serve as a backup when the \"renewable\" energy sources go offline (for example when it gets dark, or when the wind stops blowing). Further, electricity is fungible, so electricity consumed via solar panels means that this electricity cannot be consumed by others. Bitcoin mining does use less electricity than many other things, including many that provide less utility.

This is really posturing by the administration to make it look like they are trying to address \"climate change\"",

There is a thread about a similar article that discusses how Fidelity investments is being pressured to try to pressure the bitcoin devs to switch to PoS. I noted that many investment management companies often push their own political and social agenda while threatening to vote a particular way with shares that belong to their customers. Noted in your blog post is that there are a small number of exchanges that stake coin on behalf of their customers. If a change to PoS is done, it would be best to not do so for reasons related to \"climate change\".",
