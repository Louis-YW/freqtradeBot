  "content": "This idea just came into my mind this morning to add some coins to my BTC to see if my profits can multiple higher when their price increase higher in the future because, I have been holding only BTC over a year but the price is still moving slowly which I don't think it will rise to my satisfaction before the end of this year. CYBER and TOMO is in my mind to invest in this period because, the price of CYBER has reduced to $4 and TOMO has reduced to $1 too, which I believe it will rise higher before the end of this year to allow short term holders to earn money. I don't want to touch my BTC in my wallet until the price reach $100k, which I believe it will surely come to pass before the end of 2025 which is my target before I can sell my BTC. Do you think, if I add those two coins I just mentioned to my wallet, will it bring a good results in the future? Because I don't want to depend  on BTC only in this bear season so that what happened to me last year will not happen again. This idea of adding some coins to my wallet, is it a good idea or I should still invest more money on BTC? Your opinion is welcome.",

This is the first time I have ever heard of this two coins. Why did you think their prices will increase before the end of this year? I will advice you to be careful with altcoins before they will teach you a lesson..Quote from: Zanab247 on August 29, 2023, 06:14:41 PMDo you think, if I add those two coins I just mentioned to my wallet, will it bring a good results in the future? Altcoins are gambling, gamble with them with the amount of money that you can lose and never think about.Quote from: Zanab247 on August 29, 2023, 06:14:41 PMBecause I don't want to depend  on BTC only in this bear season so that what happened to me last year will not happen again. Altcoins are more volatile than bitcoin. If you invested in altcoins, you would have lost money than this. It is unrealized and bitcoin price will reach all-time-high. Some altcoins will not get to all-time-high. Bitcoin is better.Quote from: Zanab247 on August 29, 2023, 06:14:41 PMThis idea of adding some coins to my wallet, is it a good idea or I should still invest more money on BTC?Invest in bitcoin.But if you like, you can gamble with altcoins with very little amount of money that you can lose and never think about.",

Make the fall percentage of a coin no dey among one of the reasons why you consider a coin to be better choice to use do investment matter because those percentage fall no dey always tell the full story. Why the coin fall like that, you need know the full story or you think say na every coin wey fall na him go rise again. Some dun fall forever be dat and one big mistakes wey you go go make na to go invest inside project wey people dun abandon as na you dem go use do cashout liquidity. I never hear about this your project dem so I no go fit tell you if na good choice you wan do so or not and even though I tell you na you still get final say because when it comes to altcoins investing, nobody go fit tell you which project go make you profit or not so do your own research.Quote I don't want to touch my BTC in my wallet until the price reach $100k, which I believe it will surely come to pass before the end of 2025 which is my target before I can sell my BTC.

Your opinion is welcome.If you get bitcoin holding wey you get target for, it make sense to get other small small investment dem wey you fit sell when bull market come make you use hold body while you still dey wait for your bitcoin main target to reach and you fit do am with extra Bitcoin or other altcoins them but try make dem be those ones wey get name small make you no go fall to scammers them. E get some coins wey be say we know say dem go blow with Bitcoin when the time comes so if you dey look for cashout investments, you fit use them and you no go plan to hold them for long but just to take profits and waka dey go your own way.",

      "body": "Quote from: Charles-TimBut if you like, you can gamble with altcoins with very little amount of money that you can lose and never think about.Based on your explanation, i don't think I will try those altcoins I mentioned so that I will not loose the little money I saved for my salary than to wait for the price of BTC to reduce like the way it reduced early last to help people like us to use the little capital we saved to invested in Bitcoin that is giving us hope that we will earn big money when the genuine bull start. The reason why I thought about all those altcoins in the market is because I saw their price very low for someone to use small money to get big money from the investment, but with your idea maybe I will still wait for some months to see if the altcoins will maintain that green light before I will take the risk with money I will afford to lose.Quote from: Sim_card I go advice you to DYOR before you choose to invest make you  no go use your head carry am o.I will try my best to carry out some research about all those altcoins because the thing just came into my mind some few days ago that made me though about the Tomo and CYBER coin,  that someone can make a good profits from them when someone apply short term hold on then. With the advice I got from Charles-Tim, cryptopreneurBrainboss and you too, I think I will not go ahead with that my idea so that I will not regret for such move in the future than to try other coins like ADA and XRP.",

      "body": "The two coins wey you mentioned, na my first time I d hear them so but base on their price history wey I don see for coinmarketcap about the two coins(Cyber and Tomo) em be like sae the two coin d well for price currently and there's every possibility dem go do well in the bull run. The both coins have a total supply of 100 million. The ATH of Cyber na $18, while that Tomo na $3.92(2years ago)As of now wey I don check the price of Cyber for coinmarketcap, it has skyrocketed from the $4 wey em d before to $8. If to sae you still d hodl am em d give you x2 of profits. As for Tomo na $1.13 now. You still d on profits sha.As the crypto market d so, you can invest as many coin you feel like but make sure sae you DYOR before investing, and you d invest on them with the money you can afford to lose.Take note* have more of your investment in Bitcoin than altcoins",

Do you think, if I add those two coins I just mentioned to my wallet, will it bring a good results in the future? I just made a little research about the two coins you just suggested (i.e CYBER & TOMO), and I most confuse these coins are too volatile for my liking, which is to say that you are likely to make profit or make lose if you invest in them. But since I'm not a financial adviser, I can only advise you to invest only an amount you can always afford to lose in these coin, while you constantly strive to top up your Bitcoin portfolio so as to accumulate more before your expected time frame which you intend to withdraw it.However, from the image given below, you can see that TOMO has been able to go 23% profit in the last 7days, and 10% lose in the last 1month. Likewise CYBER that has gone 123% profit in the past 7days and also 344% profit in the last 1month (i.e a potential idea coin to give a try with). But, invest at your own risk.",
