  "content": "Hello,I'm aware the forum is probably awash with these type of posts, so i sincerley apologise for another. i've spent a few weeks trying to possibly recover bitcoin wallet from mining in 2009 but hit a dead end, so i've come to ask for advice.So to explain, I mined bitcoin propbably early 2009 for roughly 2 months, before thinking it was not really worth leaving the pc on and called it a day. This was on an old pentium 4 pc desktop, nothing great. I left the country oct 09 and left my PC with my friend and said he could use it until i returned. Upon returning 2011, he had wiped windows xp and put on win7 OS. I got the pc back, but it packed in and i never used it again. I never had any interest in cryptocurrency until last year, and recently saw a thread on reddit explaining that even with a formatted drive, that it's possible to recover deleted bitcoin wallet.So i got the old hdd out and bought a sata 3 caddy. Then as i read was advisable , i cloned the HDD booting my windows laptop into a Linux ubuntu usb boot key.I used ddrescue and saved the cloned drive image to an external.I have searched for wallet.dat and don't see anything from a standard search or browsing to app data. I think i need to recover the deleted xp formatted part. If this is not possible and it's simply gone and it's toast, then fine, i just move on.I managed to figure out how to run testdisk and found lot's of deleted stuff but so much came back i had no idea what to do with it all next.Then i tried to follow the instructions from this thread to use keyhunter.py https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2857580.0 .....but this is where i am stuck, i do not know Linux, nor am i good technically with computer code like this...So i couldn't get it to work.I mounted the cloned hdd image, but no idea how to use keyhunter.py it said to make it executable - no idea.Then i went back to windows 10, cloned the hdd once again using EaseUS software ( windows wouldnt open the Linux created image file), mounted it which created it as Local drive (Z) Then i ran R-studio and followed this guide https://www.disktuna.com/recover-lost-or-deleted-bitcoin-wallet-dat-using-r-studio/The script wallet.ini filled raw data files as suggested to use in that guide came back with various wallet folders with a total of 39 dat files - probably nothing looking at it, none were marked wallet.dat. I still haven't recovered any potential formatted data though.Edit **the search using wallet.ini that came back with 39 files - i used a program called DMDE.So is this just toast and chasing btc ghosts or is there something else i could do ?Cheers",

What is WSL , is it like a dual boot thing ? No i have not restored any folder structures, i ran Testdisk, r-studio - which came back with deleted sections but i didn't recover them as was unsure what to bother with. Also ran DMDE using the search for wallet.ini, but as you say likely program file.Not tried pywallet.....I installed python 2.7 on my c drive . How do i run it , just command line ? and say if the mounted disk is Local disk (z) how do i get it to target that cloned image ?Cheers",

      "body": "I am inexperienced on recovering your wallet, however, some basics:1. WSL is a tool you install on Windows 10, tool which allows you run a Linux (you have to install from Microsoft Store) like you'd run any other Windows application (or console application).2. I may be wrong, but cloning has a pretty good chance to completely miss the clusters marked as deleted or, even more, from a previous partitioning or formatting. Keep this in mind.3. I think that best would be to get a HDD or SSD (different from the disk you have the valuable data on, but I guess that you already know you should not write absolutely anything onto the valuable disk) you install Linux onto it and run everything under pure Linux (no WSL) and then work on reading all the clusters of the other disk (I don't know with which tool) and scan them for useful data. The valuable HDD will probably stay either as USB disk, either as a secondary HDD.",

Yes i was wondering which cloning software  will pick up all deleted data and not worry about missing sections. As i say, some software has picked up deleted data, it's just messy to look at so i'm not too sure. If i figure out pywallet and it comes back with nothing then maybe best put it to bed and accept it's gone.",

Once you've got a disk image, your files are safe and can be recovered later on anyway if you get motivation to come back to it/get bored.  I don't know how useful this is but you might want to look at installing software like autopsy which should be able to sort things in a time wise format (from a disk image) - presumably your wallet.dat file could then be found by looking at things of a similar timeframe (but I'm not sure on how the filesystem in XP worked).Also I don't think bitcoin core had encryption back in 2009 so you could attempt to search to your disk for strings of data the wallet file would have saved (but I've not seen an example of one from that long ago so I'm not sure how they would have been).",

Some say it should be (hex value):Code:fd1701308201130201010420or shorter version, for example:Code:201010420Then the next bytes should be your private key.About making copy: did you consider using linux tool 'dd' to make disk image? It seems it would copy all.If you may read in the same language as Molière (or just want to use google translate), take a look there:https://www.radjaidjah.org/index.php?post/2014/09/07/Sauver-ses-bitcoins-de-la-corruption",

I will also go back to Linux and try as suggested - making a clone using DD and try to work it that way. It is all beyond me this stuff, bit too technical but willing to try and at least put any doubts to rest by exhausting every avenue of search. All i know is at the time i was running SETI (search for extra terrestrial intelligence) - crunching data & i ran bitcoin to mine in the background alternatively, it was in 2009 as i left the country later that year. If it's gone it's gone, game over. Appreciate all the replies    Cheers",

It is difficult to detect.You are right too. I will write what to do.Step 1 : You need detect fat system for sector scannig. Fat12/16/32 bla bla. If ntfs its hard  because it has an authorization system. Found !!!  the file does not mean accessing it.Step 2 : How long it was used after format. Fat system is changed ? Which sectors were rebuilt ? or Which sectors were owerwrite ?Step 3 : Is there a partition ? if yes you remember partition location for your data ? If your data on second or third partition your chances are higher.Step 4 : After the determinations are made, the appropriate tool or software should be found and the audit should be started. You dont know python or c++ i recomended \"Deep Scan\" tools from Easeus Software for you. Dont forget you need sector based scan. Not partition or not another.if you want help write here please",
