Luckily this happened to me before on another site and I decided to record the games. I proceeded than to contact support but I received no support, so I went to live support on Rollbit and told them about the situation.Here are pictures of the games where I was taken money but haven't dealt cards.https://i.imgur.com/FaycfEm.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/UmxGV6j.jpgAnd here is their response: They said I lost the rounds as I busted, but how could that happen when I was not dealt cards ?Also the hands they are showing are completely different.https://i.imgur.com/U8SwId8.pngI was patient with them but seems like they are not trying to help me get my money back so I'm opening this thread to let you know about my experience in their site.I will update here if they decide to give me back my money or keep scamming me.",

You can move it here. From what I could see and from your explanations, It could possibly be a glitch and I would suggest as others have done to asking you to give the casino time to carry out their investigation if possibly they as are on it, they would respond to you appropriately. I will implore you to exercise patience with them and do well to send them a reminder and if they Fail to respond then possibly a reputable member here could come into play to assist you. It would be nice you chat up their representative here as well to enquire from him or her about your complaints. I believe this could give you a little push to you gaining their attention.",

First, I have no idea why would Rollbit show you another bet, instead, I think that was the actual bet of the glitch but it was made complicated when there is none of that bet in your history.  It is actually strange to think that it doesn't appear in your bet history...Quote from: holydarkness on September 01, 2023, 11:28:51 AMI'll reach Razer about this, see if he can take this matter into his hand and take another look at your case.

This was minutes before my follow up here, so please be sure to check that out.We first checked with the provider on the 31st of August, to which they replied there was nothing wrong with the reported bets.In the days that followed the ticket remained active, so we double checked with the provider and they confirmed once again that nothing unexpected happened.Further, during this time we performed internal checks on our own records and can confirm that no Blackjack rounds finished unattributed. If a game finishes without us receiving an outcome, the round would be unattributed.Thanks,Razer",

That's why rollbit is so ridiculous, just like in any other scam accusation thread.So the chat support says hand 1 was lost because the played busted (without cards) and shows the hand history clearly showing 2 cards with 10 value combining for 20 points for the dealer.Problem is, none of the 2 screenshots provided by the OP had the dealer having 20 points with 2 cards.So there is the first error already.Why are they even talking about wrong hands?Razor, any explanation for that?",
