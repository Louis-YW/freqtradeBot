It is easiest to find influencers for cryptocurrencies while the blockchain remains in the shadows. However, this does not mean that such technology does not deserve your attention.What is blockchain and its main advantages?Blockchain is a decentralized database. Initially, this was developed for cryptocurrencies, but today it is clear that this technology can be actively used in other industries. It is because this database captures various data and stores and encrypts it.All blockchains can be divided into public and private. In the first case, everyone can see the information from the database, and in the second case, a limited number of people have access to the data.Among the main advantages of blockchain are:Increased security;Inability to correct saved data;Ability to use cryptocurrencies;Can be used in absolutely all industries;Smart contracts and more.Today, this is used in many projects to increase transparency, improve customer confidence, and speed up transactions, especially international ones.Top 5 InfluencersToday there are quite a lot of companies and IT specialists who work with blockchain.

Here he announces innovations from Blockchain.com and shares his thoughts on the development of the blockchain industry.Who can be considered an expert in this industry?As we can see, most of the famous crypto experts are the founders of large platforms that are very successful worldwide. It is mainly because these people are pretty successful, recognizable, and know their business well.However, there are quite a few other experts on Twitter â€“ people who have been working with blockchain technologies for several years or even teach in this industry. They often do not have such a vast audience (on average, they have no more than 5 thousand subscribers); however, this does not mean they do not deserve attention. So, the founders of large corporations mainly talk about their business but do not cover the crypto world as a whole, while other experts, on the contrary, try to give the most helpful and valuable information to attract more user attention.Can a person who has only recently started his/her social network be considered an expert? Practice shows that this practice does not matter much. The main thing is the knowledge of blockchain technology and the desire to share helpful information. And who do you think, whose posts do you follow, and why?",
