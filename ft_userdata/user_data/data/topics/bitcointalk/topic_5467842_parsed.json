  "content": "Dear followers,We want to update you on the latest developments regarding ASKMEAI. It's been a busy week as we've been in discussions with several pre-sale platforms , although we haven't finalized our choice yet. Our plan for next week is also crowded.We will announce our launch plan after next week.The most significant news pertains to the accessibility of the ASKMEAI application. ASKMEAI application will be exclusively available to ASKME token holders.You know this information.We are pleased to announce that the ASKMEAI application is now operational. We conducted beta tests with 5-10 volunteer users, and their feedback has been invaluable in refining the application. Additionally, we have developed a mobile version for your convenience.In response to user feedback, we've made improvements by adding a link and project name to the query section. This change addresses the challenge posed by platform links that contain information about other pre-sales, which can confuse our artificial intelligence.We are also excited to share that the maximum query time has been reduced to just 1 minute on average.The big news is that we will soon be making an announcement on Twitter, where we will provide access passwords for everyone to test the application. We are committed to continuous improvement, and your feedback is vital. With version 1.4, we will incorporate feedback and log records generated by a larger user base.Version 1.3 focused solely on pre-sale queries. However, in response to user demands, we have expanded our capabilities to include queries for pre-sales, fair launches, and private sales.Starting with version 1.4, access to the project will be limited to ASKME token holders exclusively.All information regarding this update will be documented in the whitepaper under the 'Updates' section.Thank you for your continued support and stay tuned for further announcements.Warm regards,[AskmeAI Team]\"#NFA #ASKMEAI #AI #BSCGems #BSCGemsAlert #SAFU #KYC #audit #ScamAlert #BSC #BNB #BNBChain #ETH #newlisting #crypto #artificialintelligence",
