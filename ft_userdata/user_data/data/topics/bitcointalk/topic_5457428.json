Then after couple of hours my reward was reduced to 25$ and also added red mark. I asked what did I do? because I posted every work correctly and also I submitted screenshots of coinmarketcap, coingecko task also. Then manager replied also that I was done and eligible for reward. Once I asked what happened and send the proofs of all my work and screenshot submitted he stopped replying me and banned me from his bounty group. In project telegram also we can't tell anything he take admin and delete all our messages. I usually don't follow this kind of thing and complain but since more than 50+ people were cheated and also I have same situation with his previous bounty Oscarswap and evo. He always changed wallet and ineligible people without no reason after the bounty end. Since people silenced he take advantages always by misleading and wasting people time. It's time to raise the voice and make right action for what he doing continuously. I'm requesting please take necessary action for this bounty manager. I don't need reward but I would like if someone can take action against this cheater.",

It is better for them not to participate if the campaign manager is not a trusted member or there is a guarantee for the campaign.This is not the first incident and it will not be the last. Bounty hunters do not tire themselves with research and participate in any campaign, so they always fall into the trap.",
