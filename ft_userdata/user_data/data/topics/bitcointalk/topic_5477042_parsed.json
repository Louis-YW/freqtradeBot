Bitcoin is not a platform but a digital currency that was created to be an alternative payment method to fiat, it uses p2p payment system, that is it doesn't need an third party to carry out transactions for you. You should understand that those your co-workers don't understand what bitcoin is and you failed to explain about the risk of holding bitcoin. You are misleading them by not telling the fact and whatever happens to their bitcoin, you will be held responsible. I don't also think that you told them about the best wallet for them to use as noncustodial wallets. Bitcoin price is pumping now because we are close to the halving and the hope that SEC will approve bitcoin ETF by January. After the bull run bitcoin will dip. It is only when you invest in a long term investment that you have lowered the risk in bitcoin investment.Don't leave your bitcoin in an exchange. Not your keys not your coins.",

But from what read in your story or explanation of Bitcoin is wrong so I advise you to go and correct that mistake in the thread and also tell the person again that you did a mistake while explaining the meaning of Bitcoin. The way you spend your fiat currency is the same way Bitcoin is also spend but it is in internet because there is no hardcopy of Bitcoin but all softcopy which can be transmit from one person to another. I know that it is a mistake and you can correct it. Most of us have made it so it is not a big deal to correct. And from the naira sign you used, I believed that you are a Nigerian.",

You are not being specific. The Bitcoin investment requirement is that you will buy from an exchange and hold in your cold storage till any time you are ready to sell off and take your profit, while trading Bitcoin is if you are going to be trading either on leverage or buying low and selling high for a short-term profit.Coupled with your fiber-self-employed business, whose profit you are to use for your bill payment, you will definitely be able to hold the Bitcoin payment you will be receiving from your salary. It's not a bad decision, but something seems strange. You mean, every one of the workers there agreed to accept the Bitcoin payment because you proposed it? If that's true, then it might be easier for the company to employ your idea. But I doubt that all the employees will agree. The reason is that everyone has different budgets and not all of them have businesses like you do, so it will be difficult for them to be able to hold their salary paid in Bitcoin. They will definitely also undergo the stress of converting to fiat.",

The aim for this thread and the reason of my opinion it to take part in the Bitcoin industry so hopefully, I don't stand to be an expert but a beginner. There was also no much of time given that I could go in details about the little knowledges I ahve acquired about Bitcoin that is why I didn't hit about it he potential flexibilities of losts in the Bitcoin. Moreover, the organization is yet to put it in considerations and if approved, they would set upon a seminar that is to educate everyone more better about Bitcoin. That really sounds like an advancious advantages to be gained while working with this company.I look forth to bring more members to participate in this forum soonest. All I know is good luck to me and to my colleagues.",

      "body": "One alternative to investing directly in Bitcoin is to invest in a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds hold a variety of assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. ETFs can be a good option for investors who want exposure to the cryptocurrency market without having to buy and store the actual coins. Another alternative is to invest in companies that are involved in the cryptocurrency industry, such as those that provide mining services or blockchain technology. Or you could invest in related assets such as stocks, real estate, or commodities. These assets can also be affected by market cycles, but they may not be as closely tied to the price of Bitcoin.....There are several reasons why these alternatives may be attractive for investors. First, ETFs can offer diversification, which means that your investment is not as dependent on the performance of a single asset. They can also be more liquid, meaning that you can sell your shares more easily if you need to. Second, by investing in companies involved in the cryptocurrency industry, you are not directly investing in a volatile asset like Bitcoin, but you are still able to benefit from the growth of the industry. And third, other assets like stocks, real estate, and commodities can provide a more stable investment opportunity and potentially lower risk than investing directly in Bitcoin....",

The idea of been paid in Bitcoin isn't in most cases open to some companies as they feel the need to leave out their finances from the digital cryptic framework.They still believe the space is yet to be properly regulated but I think they are old fashioned. You may have taken the scales off their eyes in just one meeting. Everyone needs to be a part of the global adoption at all levels even though you had targeted it as an alternative source to invest in Bitcoin",
