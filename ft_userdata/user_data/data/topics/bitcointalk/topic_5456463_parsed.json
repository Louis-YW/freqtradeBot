But getting married first and then being established is also not a problem. Provided that there must be a projection of what it will look like in the future, what plans to do with your partner in the future.",

Can you get married with an unstable source of income or you will wait till when you are very financially stable. Please share your personal answers.Before you decide to get married you should have a stable means of income that will be enough to cater for you and your spouse. There should be enough funds to pay bills like house rent, food, clothing, healthcare, and others. If you want to start having children, you also need to increase your income because your expenses will also increase. Marrying without a stable means of income will lead to hardship, frustration, and even divorce. I have also seen some men that have decided that they must be wealthy before they get married because they do not want their families to suffer. Some of them have waited for many years to get enough money to no avail. I tell people that the most important blessing a man can get from marriage is marrying a good woman and vice versa. If you are married to a spouse that understands, even in the face of financial hardship he/she will always stand by you. You don't need to have all the money before you get married but there should be a constant income that will sustain the needs of the family.",

Please share your personal answers.That's what I've thought of before but how long I'll wait until I get stable because we've got different priorities. I don't want to be that old before I become stable and get married. So, what's important is that you're prepared mentally, financially and spiritually when you're about to tie the knot.",

Many of my classmates are not married because they are scared of failing in their future homes. They think that getting married might lead to giving birth to children that can not be provided for. But I have also seen many people around me getting married believing that the future will be better. I tell people that the future is unpredictable which means your plans and projections might fail. Some people got married when they are millionaires but a few years after the marriage they become bankrupt and can't provide for the family anymore. But some got married financially weak but grew to become rich and financially stable. Finance is one of the main factors to consider in marriage but it is not the only factor. When two people who are compatible and in love meet, money is not mainly considered but joy and peace of staying together. There is always hope and joy where there is love. If you meet someone you truly love my brother Hispo you will get married in a few months.",

Please share your personal answers.I got married in 2018 and let me say I had not that stable finances but I was lucky to have a home passed down to me as a gift and that kind of gift gives you enough space to start a family even without much financial stability.I got a credit for about 15.000 EUR to furnish my home and I still have now about 2-3 years almost to finish it,so I am lucky to have been doing it.In normal conditions you marry when you find the person that has the same objectives as you and you buy a home with mortgage and work together to finish it,meanwhile creating family and being a better citizen which gives the contribute to the world,i.e you bring up 1 or 2 babies in the world.As a single person there is no exact moment to marry,you marry when you find as I said your life partner,that person when you don't need much time but you soon realize that he/she is the one and marry,everything else come together after it as I explained above.",

Please share your personal answers.What do you mean by financially stable,  do you mean when one has a stable source of income or has attained some financial independence! I guess both play a minimal as in what makes a successful marriage since we have to put some other things in check it is obvious that many successful and wealthy people also have a crisis in their marriage and at some point end up in divorce,  and we have some couple who may not be a financially ok bit yet have a peaceful marriage,  so it all depends on the individuals involved and what their commitment is to the union. Financial status does not have anything to do with marriage but also it very important to always be able to take care of all our bills so it is important to have money in marriage if not,  the lack of money can also make the marriage.",

If it's a good example, they would want to follow it, but if it's a bad one, they would want to make a change, like never making the same mistake that their parents made. So, I think I would fall into the class of those who would want to follow in their parents footsteps and In regards to that, my dad did not marry his wife at the time when he had stable finances; his financial life then was still a bit shaky when he got married, and he told me that was not really very easy for him then, which became worse when babies started coming, but it was just one day that his efforts and pursuit for a good job favored him and he got employed. So, for that reason, I really don't see any reason why someone should settle for marriage when they don't yet have a sustainable source of income. OP, In my opinion, the right time to do so is when you at least have the finances to always provide for the needs of you, your wife, and your kids.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

However, in my opinion and plan, I can't wait until I reach a certain stage in life to get married and find a spouse because no one can predict how their own lives will turn out; all I can say is that I can't get married without a means of earning money. If you said you would wait until you are very financially stable, however, I think that would be a bad idea.As a result, as soon as I have a means to adequately cater for my family's requirements without going through any difficulty, I will marry because people are dying.",

Please share your personal answers.I think the best time for one to get married is when one is financially stable to provide the necessary things for family because money has a vital role it plays in the family. Finance is one of the first chateria if a man is ready for marriage.  Apart from the financial aspect there other things to consider if one is ready for marriage. Sometimes money is not only the thing that  makes marriage to work, their are lot of billionaire that their marriage didn't work out due to some misunderstanding between them and their partner.  Marriage is patience, tolerance and respect.  If  one lacks all this  characters I think it will be difficult for marriage to last long , the marriage will be full of regret and bad time. So one has  to be ready in character wise to sustain the marriage to last.",

Can you get married with an unstable source of income or you will wait till when you are very financially stable. Please share your personal answers. I'm a single person but based on my parents experience and that of my elder siblings, well I'll say it's not necessarily a must that one's got to have a very stable income before going into marriage, yes money is one of the vital things required in marriage but then many couples won't even want to go into marriage if so, financial stability is something that would occur in as much you're working hard to meet end needs even the rich billionaires like Dangote, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates are still hustling to get more money despite being financially blessed, they're not relaxed and most of them end up divorcing their spouse regardless of the wealth they've acquired. However for the single people before venturing into a relationship or marriage, you need to have a handwork or job, that would atleast generate some income that would sustain you and your spouse before you grow bigger in wealth, might not be very massive, even though it's little for a start, just do something and not relax when you don't have any sources of income, relationship mustn't be built on love only, you'll still need to satisfy ends need as the head of your family. Also for those that are already married, you ought to a have source of income as well, whether you're a woman too, even though you don't have a job while in marriage seek help financially from your spouse, so as to create a business that would yield more income and also be beneficial to both parties, cause your husband might be down on the long run and you'll in return assist him, that's why it's good to establish your partner if you're more financially balanced because togetherness in marriage yields greater result.",

Fear of the unknown is what makes the youth not to have trust in God and believe in themselves by thinking positively on getting married without a job that pays high. The Bible says he that finds a wife,finds a good thing because both of you becomes one in spirit and become more powerful in overcoming some unforseen challenges to make progress. If you get married to a good woman,you will be successful in whatever you lay your hands on and when you give birth,your kids also have their own fortunes which will make your more successful. There is a stage in a man's life that he will see that he has stability in his financial life,then he will know that he can take care of one more person and himself. At that stage you should be able to understand that you need a wife. I have seen so many of my friends that weren't rich but has a stable income that isn't big but took the bold step and got married,before I knew it they increased their hustle and step up their game because they know that they have responsibilities to take care of. When you are married,you will no longer think like a boy because your family depends on your reasons to move forward.",
