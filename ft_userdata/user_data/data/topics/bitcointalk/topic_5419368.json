      "body": "How long is long? Multi year investments are generally a good idea based on the past (everyone who's held for more than 4 years so far has made a profit afaik).If you plan to invest for only a year or less, you'll probably be disappointed and might just be back at these price levels this time next year. If you plan to hold for 2 years, there's a much better chance you'll have made a return on your investment.With that being said, there might be fewer security concerns related to shorter term trading (protocol related issues cryptos - especially new ones - might undergo). You're shielded a lot from these with bitcoin but it's always a bad idea to sell flash crashes if something does come up as the markets here often overreact.",

      "body": "Hello! Welcome! Have you already made yourself familiar with Bitcoin's overall price history? Have you been observing its daily, weekly, and monthly price changes? If yes to both, I suppose you've already noticed how Bitcoin's price has risen from less than a cent to almost $70,000. But that was almost a year ago. 6 months ago, the price was already at $40,000. Today, the price is only around $20,000. However, the projection in 2-3 years from now is that it will reach at least $100,000. With this, I'd say it is better to focus on the long-term. Its volatility and extreme price fluctuations are happening in the short-term. Although you can earn from those, it is risky and hard to predict and probably stressful, too. The long-term option is the safer choice.",

For example other altcoins like ethereum went up against bitcoin (to 0.15) then got dumped and never went back up again.Additionally try to think of bitcoin as a currency not an investment. As a currency you can use it for payment and both send and receive money. Even earn money using bitcoin. That way you maximize the benefits you are getting from bitcoin.",

But even those who bought at $18k could sell after 3-4years but most importantly sell when they know they have profited. It's easy to trade in short-term when there is a bull run which a newbie can try buying back every dip. If you invest for long term but you keep watching the market, you might have to do it short term too. Be a day trader. Watching prices is addictive.",

      "body": "Short term investment makes sense when the market is bullish - it's likely to crash, possibly below your entry price, so it's better to take a profit while you can, instead of having an unrealized loss. But when the market is bearish, like it is right now, it's better to plan for a long term investment, you should buy and wait, without worrying about the price, for the next bull market. Short term trading in bear market is more risky, because the market often goes sideways, there's a lot of bull and bear traps.",

Bitcoin tends to make a bull run every after 4 years and then will enter the bear market. It happened in 2017-2018 where Bitcoin rallied as high as ~$20,000, but the year after was the year of hell where Bitcoin went from its ATH down to near the ~$3,000 price. Same with what's happening right now. Bitcoin rallied last November of 2021 to as high as ~$69,000 and now it's currently moving sideways at around the ~$18,000 - ~$25,000 price range. In general, long-term investing is better and it's less stressful to many including me so I'd suggest you go long term but you're a newbie like you said so maybe it would be better to at least watch some videos and equip yourself with information so that you'll be ready if the worst thing comes. Maybe I'll consider taking profit every bull run and re-invest it when the bear market starts.",

Try to study what trading is and the pros and cons of doing it before deciding whether to convert to short-term or not (or you can honestly do both). We're down pretty big right now so it's pretty perfect for an entry toward investments in the long term as well. I don't think there's a \"better\" option between the two tbh, it's just a matter of what you prefer and what you can and can't do. I gave up on trading since it wasn't really for me so I just went about to doing DCA.",

OP, what happened to your previously purchased bitcoins? Why don't many of the newbies realize that their post history is visible to the community? And the illogicality of the posts makes you understand why another empty topic is being created.OP, do you really not understand the answer to your question, or is it not you who have been repeating for three months about the value of investing in bitcoin?",

Just imagine you bought bitcoin last 2010, went short-term, sold it all in 2011, and gained profit, right? But what if you go long-term and sell it at today's price? Then, sure, the results are far better than short term. But you are still depending on you if what you prefer most since it's your choice.

      "body": "All forms of investment are good for the long term, including cryptocurrencies, especially in bitcoin because of its proven track record of generating significant returns over the long term.and my advice is to do DCA because the idea behind DCA is to buy consistently regardless of whether the market is going up or down due to fluctuations andDCA will help you disciplined to buy more bitcoins when the price is down and less when the price is going up. And this will make it easier for you to make investment decisions and avoid emotional decisions.Buying within your means with money you can afford to lose and doing it consistently is the most appropriate strategy for novice investors, the longer you invest, the greater the amount of money you will save with more optimal returns.and you don't need to rush to get rich, because investing does take time to show results even up to 10 years.and the investment decisions you make today will have a big impact if done regularly and consistently over the long term.",
