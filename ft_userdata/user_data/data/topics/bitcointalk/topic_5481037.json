  "content": "So... I was going through the CPUMiner code (... YES, I know CPU mining is dead, I'm just using this code as an educational way to learn how BTC blocks and transactions are assembled) and was wondering about these two lines:   work->data[20] = 0x80000000;   work->data[31] = 0x00000280;in the block header setup. Any idea why these values are important to set? From reading the BTC specs, I thought the header padding from +20 onwards was all supposed to be 0's..?So confused newbie to the bowels of BTC... any help appreciated, thanks.",
