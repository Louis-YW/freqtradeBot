  "content": "Before to all i want to remember to everybody that TESTNET coins are worthless and never supposed to have any real value.Quoting: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/TestnetQuoteTestnet coins are separate and distinct from actual bitcoins, and are never supposed to have any value. The only value that they provide are experience for developers, testers and other people that want to undertand and practice how bitcoin works without spend real bitcoins.I am doing recently some test on testnet to test features like CPFP, RBF and FullRBF, testing scripts and a long etc...But something change in the difficult of testnet in the last hours, somebody is mining like 5 blocks per second, so if someone wants to learn how to mining they can try Testnet on this momment.Quoting againt the bitcoin.it pageQuoteMinimum difficulty of 1.0 on testnet is equal to difficulty of 0.5 on mainnet. This means that the mainnet-equivalent of any testnet difficulty is half the testnet difficulty. In addition, if no block has been found in 20 minutes, the difficulty automatically resets back to the minimum for a single block, after which it returns to its previous value.According to it, the difficulty is reset to the minimum for a single block and then ir should return to the minimum. But in this ocassion that doesn't happend, i guess that the difficulty just drop to the minimun.See it on real time on https://mempool.space/testnetThe block mined by a single addres are from 2477663 to 2481082 up to this time, not much just like 4 thousand blocks.Anyway this is just a little interesting for me because mining is a new topic for me.Regards",

In your screenshot it stopped \"2 minutes ago\", currently it stopped 5 minutes ago. But there are now 3356 more blocks than when you posted this (less than an hour ago).If it's someone with very high hash rate, this doesn't mean anyone can try mining testnet now. I tried earlier this year, and even when the difficulty drops to the minimum CPU mining is futile.",

I imagine that by selecting moments when the difficulty is at a minimum, you can accumulate the rewards quickly and therefore the energy cost of a testnet coin remains relatively low, doesn't it?",

The issue here is that the block with difficulty 1 is the last block in a difficulty epoch (2,477,664/2016 = 1,229 exactly, remembering of course we start at block 0 and not at block 1).The next difficulty epoch should adjust the difficulty based on the old difficulty of 147386757.8674816, but instead it mistakenly adjusts the difficulty based on the difficulty of the last block, which is 1. So the difficulty for the new epoch is set at 1.Every block since then has been mined in seconds, and the difficulty is slowly adjusting back upwards to a normal value.",

      "body": "The Block Storms of Bitcoin testnet. Jameson Lopp wrote about that, x4 difficulty and why 1 difficulty is regularly occurs for testnet blocks.QuoteDue to the unpredictability of hashing power and block times there’s a special rule that allows a block to be mined against the minimum difficulty of 1 (and thus practically instantly on a GPU or ASIC) if there hasn’t been a block for 20 minutes. This rule gets invoked fairly regularly on testnet. In fact, I wrote this script to determine just how often. It turns out that nearly 200,000 blocks (nearly 12% of all blocks) on testnet have been mined at a difficulty of 1 after the 20 minute window has passed since the previous block.QuoteUnanticipated InteractionsJust like the normal bitcoin network, testnet also recalculates the mining difficulty every 2016 blocks. However, the logic for calculating the new difficulty was written with the assumption that previous blocks were all validated against the same difficulty target calculation and thus it's safe to continue this series of difficulty calculations. This is similar implicit logic to how Bitcoin's 21 million BTC limit is assured - a node never actually sums up all of the UTXO values but rather assumes that every previous block has been validated not to create more than the allowed subsidy, thus the sum must implicitly be below the total limit.Thus, on testnet when the block before the retarget (block #2015, #4031, etc) is a difficulty 1 block due to the special minimum difficulty rule, the retarget logic for the next block will run based upon the assumption that the difficulty for the entire previous 2015 blocks has been 1! And because a retarget is bounded to never increase the \"current difficulty\" by more than 4X, the new difficulty will be recalculated to be either 1, 2, 3, or 4.QuoteWe can see that while during a normal day around 144 blocks are minted, if a difficulty reset to the minimum difficulty occurs, it results in over 10,000 blocks being mined! That's a block every 8 seconds!https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/pow.cpp#L32Quote from: achow101 on August 13, 2017, 06:29:36 PMThe difficulty will reset to 1 if the time since the last block is more than 20 minutes. There is no stipulation that after a difficulty reset block that the next block must be the normal difficulty; if the next block is more than 20 minutes after the current block, then it can also have a difficulty of 1.For blocks that are found within 20 minutes of each other, the block's difficulty will be the same as the difficulty of the last block in the difficulty interval whose difficulty was not 1 OR the difficulty of the first block in the difficulty interval. This behavior is defined here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/pow.cpp#L32.The way that the difficulty retarget works is that, at the beginning of the new difficulty interval, the difficulty of the first block in that interval takes the difficulty of the last block in that interval and multiplies that by the time it took to mine the 2016 blocks and then divides it by the target time. The result is then clamped to be at least 1. Since this is based upon the difficulty of the last block in the previous interval, if that block is difficulty 1, then the next interval will also have a difficulty of one.So what we are seeing here is that the last block in the interval is found 20 minutes after the block before it so it has a difficulty of one. Because the next block adjust the difficulty and it only looks at the block before it (which is difficulty 1), the difficulty of the next interval is 1. So the next 2016 blocks are mined at difficulty 1, and the difficulty then slowly adjusts up again.",

But did not know that people have started to use the testnet token to trade with ETH and with effectiveness. I mean, that's some next-level scam they were doing. I hope people know that they are buying the test tokens. This indicates that knowledge is necessary in the era of crypto if you don't get educated then someone will scam you by selling you nothing. I mean you are buying nothing. This feels insane",

Here is the data from 2020 till today.You've missed a lot of occurrences of this from your table.The difficulty of the new epoch will not necessarily be 1. Rather, the difficulty adjustment for the new epoch will be made from a baseline of 1. So, if the difficulty adjustment was supposed to be -10%, the difficulty would be 0.9, but since 1 is the minimum it will be 1. However, if the difficulty adjustment was supposed to be +10%, then the new difficulty will be 1.1.You can see this most recently happening just a couple of months ago at epoch 1,212. Epoch 1,211 took 12 days, 2 hours, and 42 minutes. This is 290.7 hours, which would be 1744.2 blocks. 2015/1744.2 = 1.156. And so if you look at the difficulty for epoch 1,212, it is 1 * 1.156 = 1.156.Since the most the difficulty can change by in one retarget is a factor of 4, then any epoch with a sudden drop in difficulty to between 1 and 4 will be a result of this phenomenon.",
