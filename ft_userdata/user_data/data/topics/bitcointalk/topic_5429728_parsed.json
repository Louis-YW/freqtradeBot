Countries can only try that people don't buy bitcoin but how will they know who is buying in decentralised exchange? They can only regulate centralised exchange and ask for KYC on customers and they monitor the exchange and the customer through that but I don't think total regulation like the forex is going to work.",

Such incidents like FTX are only making the process faster. It is putting more pressure on regulatory bodies to bring in a framework so that any such future events can be avoided. I understand a lot of people don't like regulations but if exchanges are centralized and established as a legal entity, they are expected to follow certain regulations. So a more structured regulation will make the centralized businesses more transparent for its users.",

And the winners are mostly large corporations. Now, I don't know about you, but I don't like volatility. However, I neither believe more regulation will calm things down with no tradeoffs, though.",

In general when a successful industry is born, as cryptocurrencies would be in this case, the absence of regulations helps the business flourish. Not paying taxes, either because it is not foreseen in the legislation or because it is easy to escape them and the industry players do not pay them, also help the initial growth, as much more can be reinvested in the business.But as the industries mature, some regulations become necessary so that it doesn't look like the Wild West and fraudsters run wild. I would like regulations in which people who play an important role within the bitcoin ecosystem would be involved, which is not going to happen, as they will be made by politicians seeking to preserve their status quo, even though they may seek industry input to save face.",

I think it actually can have a very positive impact, because investors are looking for guarantees and safety when investing their money. If they see cases like FTX and Celsius without the industry addressing the issues and preventing it from happening again futurely, of course they will stay away from crypto market. But if they see regulations are coming to prevent new scams from happening, I believe it's very likely they will start investing again.
