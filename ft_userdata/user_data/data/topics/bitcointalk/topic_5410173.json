With a little interest on your part, you wouldn't be asking this question today. Bitcoin was created as a digital currency, an electronic payment system designed to operate from person to person, without the intervention of a central bank or other centralised entities.It's not exactly person-to-person, though, because in between are the miners, but the system is decentralised. However, nowadays many people use it with centralised intermediaries, although at the base it works in a decentralised manner.Anyway, put some interest in it and read the White Paper or some of Andreas Antonopoulos' videos, for example.",

Even adamantium looks like a little girl when compared with bitcoin. Bitcoin is hard like men. Hard and sound. They say gold is hard money too but That’s not my experience with gold. Gold is nothing like bitcoin. You can scratch or bend gold easily. Gold is not hard money. Gold is a wimp.",

It is a currency, a mode of transaction that is different from how traditionally money have been known to transact. Blockchain is the technology on which bitcoin works in simple words.Comparing this to altcoins that can run apps on blockchain is a wrong way to think. Just like the fact that older science texts are nowadays proven wrong by newer development does not mean any of it is inferior.Again whether such apps are useful at all or have only been a marketing gimmick needs more critical thinking. Bitcoin on its own is a coin enough to the economy. It does not need such developements.",

I give a little explanation about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency system used is peer to peer or P2P.This bitcoin ownership will be stored on a personal computer with a swiftlet or swallow file provided by a third party without the need for identity. Bitcoin aliases can be owned with an anonymous identity.There is a public transaction record that forms a dependent network of bitcoins called a block-chain or blockchain. Confirmed bitcoin transactions will be stored on the block-chain.",

Bitcoin nodes are created transparently, so they can be easily learned by anyone to develop. Many wallets are being developed today without having to work with Bitcoin developers.

It also cares for the interests of a few wealthy foundation members and not the whole community.  I am not entirely sure if we can call ethereum 100% centralized, it is really not. Because, the logic was to get everyone to agree again, so it is democratic. By the same logic, we could actually have more than 21 million bitcoins, did you know that? How? Well, someone could create a side chain to bitcoin where there are 210 million bitcoins total instead of 21 million, and if 90%+ people start to use that, it will become the de facto new bitcoin blockchain.So, it is \"possible\", decentralized doesn't mean untouched, if it was then we wouldn't have segwit, it means that it is decentralized meaning there are no central figure that decides all by themselves, all changes are asked to us, before being done.",

Ethereum has the Ethereum Foundation which is a major player when it comes to changes on the network. They make arbitrary changes that serve their interests first and foremost. If they lose money, they can just roll back the chain so the problematic transaction never happened. That's something they have already done. To become a validator in their upcoming 2.0 Ethereum version, you need to stake 32 ETH. That will make the network even more centralized around only those who have the required stake or can afford to buy it. Nodes needs to be spread out as much as possible, not concentrated around a few wealthy individuals.",

It completely depends upon a user and how he/she gonna use it.In order to understand Bitcoins more clearly, you can compare it to gold in digital form.As Bitcoins are limited in supply, so if you buy and store it in a earlier phase, then definitely after some years when you sell it, you will get huge profit like the gold.In other words Bitcoin gave us the opportunity to use our money independently in a decentralised manner.",

The word “cryptocurrency” refers to a group of digital assets where transactions are secured and verified using cryptography – a scientific practice of encoding and decoding data. Those transactions are often stored on computers distributed all over the world via a distributed ledger technology called blockchain.Bitcoin can be divided into smaller units known as “satoshis” (up to 8 decimal places) and used for payments, but it’s also considered a store of value like gold. This is because the price of a single bitcoin has increased considerably since its inception – from less than a cent to tens of thousands of dollars. When discussed as a market asset, bitcoin is represented by the ticker symbol BTC.The term “decentralized” is used often when discussing cryptocurrency, and simply means something that is widely distributed and has no single, centralized location or controlling authority. In the case of bitcoin, and indeed many other cryptocurrencies, the technology and infrastructure that govern the creation, supply, and security of it do not rely on centralized entities, like banks and governments, to manage it.",
