As I said every time - no one needs a power limit - there is no benefit in setting the PL, only trouble. All you need is fixed clocks and fixed voltage - nothing more - no DPM, no PL !!!!!!Your 6700xt use very much power - normal is under 80w in hiveos = 120w in real. You have 123w in hiveos, so you have around 160w in real from the wall.",
