Bitcoin is already a really scarce, deflationary asset by design. Lost coins make it even more valuable.Only 21,000,000 to ever be mined & as you said, over 3,000,000 already lost. You could say lost coins are a donation to the financial benefit of everybody else.",

      "body": "This is generally why bitcoi.is considered deflationary. It generally means that the supply reduces when coins like these go missing so it would push the value of bitcoin higher..I think the 3 million figure is a large overestimate though, 1 million were satoshi's coins, 1 million could be lost and the rest are probably recoverable. You don't know something is permenantly lost though either, you can only know something isn't when people decide to spend it so sticking with the 20-21 million bitcoin for how many are circulating is all we can do for now.(some estimates of lost coins also put it as high as 12 million+ in the past too which I also think is unlikely but we'll ultimately probably never know who's actually right unless a lot of coins move - and then the price will probably crash).",

On a product, a specific number launched as limited version will have the same specs but some signature change makes it different from the regular ones. With time these products have high demand. This is how the market of bitcoin is predicted to function. Those coins that are being lost were considered as the holdings kept securely for its uniqueness, which means the available ones get high demand leading to rise in the price.",

Today's coin management solutions are far better than an early days, and people are less careless with their coins, and coins are now less concentrated - in the early days people owned thousands of coins, now people own single coins or a fraction of a coin.",

So it really has an impact on the price, they seem like a long-time holder of Bitcoin but unrecoverable.So it's impossible Bitcoin price to become zero value even though there are many people who dumped it.",

Well of course it does have an impact to bitcoin's price. The fact that there are only 21,000,000 bitcoins in existence with an immutable supply, add to the fact that these estimated 3,000,000 bitcoins lost forever that could never be recovered adds scarcity and in result a higher demand for these things. So whenever people like the ones you mentioned announces that they have lost their bitcoins, A part of me is a little bit happy because that means fewer coins in circulation which makes the price for one increase even more. Still, my heart goes for all these people who deserve to still be able to access their wallets. Someday, someday.",

It's really unfortunate for those who lost access to their holdings, I feel sorry for them and wouldn't like to see anyone on the same situation, but I can't deny it impacts bitcoin price positively as more adopters start investing. It works like an extra boost for bitcoin price during bullish seasons and even during the bearish ones, as it also helps keeping bitcoin at support level price ranges.",

Some altcoin developers could create some altcoin, which is more scarce than Bitcoin(let's say 1M coins hard cap). Will this altcoin reach a higher price than Bitcoin Core? I don't think so, because the people trust in the Bitcoin Core blockchain and Bitcoin Core has earned their trust across the years. People's trust determines the demand for BTC, which determines the Bitcoin price.A scarce resource with zero demand is as worthless as a bunch of rocks.",

Now, having said that, I think the effect is so much on the Bitcoin holder that lost the key or in other ways. Of course, we know some famous stories along this line and personally they are really so sad...to see fortunes gone to waste. I am sure this can never happen to me since I do not have any big amount of assets stored in Bitcoin. This is one of some risks in dealing with cryptocurrency and that is why there is really that need to always educate and remind people to be extra-careful with their keys and in doing the very transactions...we need to triple check everything!",

I mean there are already a fixed amount of Bitcoins present in the market, from that also many are lost, so this made Bitcoins less in number to be mined or to be occupied. But the demand of the coin remains same and hence due to less in supply and more in demand the price will definitely grow up. Sad to hear that many people lost their Bitcoins and at that time they didn’t value it so much. But now the scenarios are really different.",

No matter how many bitcoins you think are lost, there is always a lot of altcoins that have a lower supply than the remaining bitcoins. Yet those altcoins are always worth a lot less than bitcoin because of a simple reason: lack of demand.

Here are some people that lost there bitcoin fortune. Recently? Well, that's a story that's been known for at least 5 years, when a company applied the methodology of expressing lost BTC in such a way that they said that everything that hasn't moved in 4 or 5 years is lost, and that's more than a stupid way to conclude something.Quote from: Twentyonepaylots on October 31, 2022, 09:32:24 PMStefan Thomas is a software developer held an estimated $220 million in a lost Bitcoin wallet he simply forgot the password in his IronKey account, and James Howells, lost his Bitcoin fortune of approximately 8 000 bitcoin when he accidentally threw away an old laptop. When such a thing happens to an ordinary person, I am not too surprised, but someone who is supposed to be a software developer should not ignore the importance of a backup. It's shameful and humiliating, and I would keep such a thing a secret so as not to damage my reputation - but he wasn't even that intelligent.As for Howells, it is about 7500 BTC (allegedly), the private keys of which were on a hard drive that was thrown away by his partner and not by him personally.Quote from: Twentyonepaylots on October 31, 2022, 09:32:24 PMIf someone lose their bitcoins (whether it is small or big amount), does it have a significant impact to the bitcoin economy?It has a positive effect, because those coins that remain will be worth even more in the future - Satoshi himself had such an opinion. Although some think that 21 million is insufficient max supply, I do not agree with that considering that even today there is enough BTC for anyone who wants to buy it - millions are on the market every day.",
