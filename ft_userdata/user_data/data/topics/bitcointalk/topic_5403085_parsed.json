Although there are many disappointments, it is my own making for myself. I think I missed the opportunity to sell them for a better profit, but anyway, I am very grateful for what BTC as well as the crypto market brought to me.And now that the support levels are gradually being broken, I think it is also necessary to rebuild the strategy to buy them back and hold them for the next 2-3 years.",

I think we are already in th bear market since summer of last year and maybe the bottom/ end of bear market is near ?Bitcoin didn't disappoint me at all despite the current price drop, because I perceive bitcoin not just as a speculative instrument, but as an instrument of freedom and independence from the traditional banking system. In this regard, from the moment of its appearance and existence to the present day, from the moment I learned about bitcoin, I had no reason to doubt the capabilities of bitcoin and be disappointed. Any price is a temporary phenomenon and you should not dwell on it. Look at the cost counter less often and you will have less worries.The bear market has been going on since the end of last year, winter, and not from the end of summer, as you said. I will assume that the bear market is only in the initial stages and will last for a relatively long time, therefore, be patient.",

It has now been effectively broken. I wasn't really expecting the price to go down this low, but I'm not disappointed. I guess I'm a little sad, though.

Bitcoin is major reason behind the countless number of crash in the Crypto markets. Bitcoin is currently at $20k and some Investors are losing money while others are gaining massive Profits. Crypto as they say, it's not for the weak, investors need to build patience and be able to face their lose. Although is not easy to see your portfolio which was $5k few weeks ago, all you hoping to see like 3x of your capital. You suddenly see $1k or even less. So the best thing is to hold Bitcoin at its ATL price and sell at it's ATH price.",

      "body": "Disappointed? Not in my vocabulary .I mean, why you will be disappointed with Bitcoin? Is it because it went down from as high as $69,000 to now around $19,000 in just a matter of months? Is it because you bought at it's peak, or is it because you are at a loss now? What disappoints me more is the people who are saying negative things about Bitcoin just because they are at a loss right now. I'm more disappointed with the people who are saying \"Bitcoin is over\" or \"Bitcoin is dead\" etc. To those pessimists out there, just continue to tell negative things to Bitcoin, since you can only say whenever Bitcoin is at its lowest. History repeats itself and after the dark days, a bright light will come and all the people (including me) who are constantly accumulating Bitcoin when it is down are the ones who will gain the most profit .",

However it is going to shake out a lot of people who claimed to be wanting to hold it forever, when in actual fact they just hoped it would double or triple from their buy in point so they could sell it off and profit. Bitcoin never disappointed me, because it was always just a mechanism of payment and it was a bad idea to keep actual currency stored within it. A lot of people who could have been millionaires, but retained trust as it keeps on dropping, are going to have big regrets later on - but they were kinda driven by greed when they should have cashed out long ago.",
