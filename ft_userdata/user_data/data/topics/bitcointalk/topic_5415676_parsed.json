That's what I found online.2) is it safe to buy it on Amazon store if I want? 3) Look the picture I get from safepal.com website below It says that it keeps coins safe 100% offline < that's where I'm lost, to store coins on the wallet could work just like paper wallet, accepted, but what about if I want to send the coin out to an exchange for example? Will it still work offline?",

Will it still work offline? I haven't ever used safepal and I don't have any idea about that. I just know that it's close source. But generally speaking, making a transaction offline means that the transaction is signed offline without your private key being connected to the internet. It doesn't mean the transaction can be broadcast offline. Take note that you don't need to be online for signing a transaction. You need internet connection for broadcasting it.",

Too bad mehn 🤦🏼‍♂️ I don't know it's closed source but which one is close to the look of safepal with shape? Ledger Nano X is the most rated of them all but I guess it's also closed source since it's not on your list, this sucks, what about Ellipal Titan? It looks more like a phone it will be easier to access but I don't know if it's closed source.",

It looks more like a phone it will be easier to access but I don't know if it's closed source.Ledger Nano is not completely close source, only the hardware secure element which is used for seed phrase generation and storage is close source. Ledger Live is completely open source, but Ledger Nano can also still be used with open source wallet like Electrum. But the reason I hate Ledger Nano is because they do not value their customer's privacy.If I should recommend open source hardware wallet to go for, they are expensive, but not too expensive. They are Trezor, BitBox02 and Keystone, they are completely open source.But if using Trezor, know that if it is stolen, a physical attack on it can lead to the exposure of the seed phrase by the attacker. That is why it is good to use passphrase with it, so that different keys and addresses are generated which the attacker can not know and not able to spend from the wallet. But know that if passphrase is lost, just like seed phrase, you will not be able to access your wallet. Or better keep your wallet safe against physical attack.BitBox02 is good, it has secure element which is not included in Trezor, but it supports Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP) which may not affect people that are not from Switzerland, but the reason I do not recommend the wallet, because it is supporting what is against the real purpose of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which is freedom and privacy.",

Any hardware wallet is best purchased on official store or in their local reseller store.You can get scammed and hacked even buying locally, and I would never trust that some Chinese garage will keep my personal information safe.Quote from: KiaKia on October 02, 2022, 10:50:17 AMIt says that it keeps coins safe 100% offline < that's where I'm lost, to store coins on the wallet could work just like paper wallet, accepted, but what about if I want to send the coin out to an exchange for example? Will it still work offline? You can't exactly use paper wallet to send, receive transaction and change addresses.Offline means that device it is not connected with internet or any other device, except for power or charging.You don't need to buy this cheap Chinese crap, you can buy some decent open source wallet, or just use offline laptop with fresh Linux OS and Electrum wallet.Additonal information, Kraken Security Labs Finds Flaws in Safepal S1 Hardware Wallet in 2021:https://blog.kraken.com/post/7874/kraken-security-labs-finds-flaws-in-safepal-s1-hardware-wallet/",

There must have been some reason for this choice, right? But since OP decided so, then this is his choice and responsibility. Regarding buying from the Amazon store, I think it's better to buy directly from the manufacturer, bypassing intermediaries in order to avoid fraud by sellers in order to get the owner's books.",

Will it still work offline? I do have SafePal wallet and it’s good. However, I don’t really use it from time to time. But I just bought it because it’s one of the most affordable cryptocurrency hardware wallets as of today. Plus, they have some airdrop promos for those who actually have the hardware wallet rather than just the mobile app and those who are holding SFP tokens. I would prefer buying from their official website rather than in a 3rd party ecommerce store like Amazon. But when it comes to storing Bitcoin, I rather use the Ledger Nano S.",
