  "content": "We had a topic in the Archival section. We had designs of our upcoming signature campaign with some changes that I made from the original, signature campaign topic draft on the archival topic. But I just noticed half an hour ago that the entire topic has gone. I really don't understand the reason.In the section I see users are testing their topics/codes/anything. I was not aware that moderators moderate it.Unfortunately, I do not see any useful backup copy in https://ninjastic.space/topic/5411309, https://loyce.club/archive/topics/541/5411309.html and even save drafts. Doing everything from the beginning is too much work too but it seems I have to do it again.But it needs to be clear why the topic was moved to trashcan or deleted since it's now confusing the use of Archival section.Cheers,",

Up to 100 drafts are kept. Drafts are deleted after 7 days.But in this case, is it possible for the mod to undo those deleted posts even though they are now in the trash?If that's possible, then the OP just needs to wait for the moderator's response.",

Anyway luckily received some older versions from someone else in the team which was sent via email. I can work it out.But still it worth to know the archival section moderation policy because as of now, I am confused to see it was deleted or moved to trashcan",

Just copy the entire code and save it in a Word document or txt file. That way you can always come back to it in case something happens with the actual thread.In situations like what you just described, I am sure one could contact theymos or the super mods, explain why you need to have the thread back, and get it restored.",

You post a topic, a few posts, look at how they look and then consider the topic as gone / no longer important. One shouldn't rely on the Archival board (whose main purpose is to archive / retire regular topics) as storage (short term or long term) as test topics may be deleted at any point in time.I'd strongly recommend using the PM preview feature for continuous / iterative previewing of BBCode.

If there's no replies I normally remove them. If they have replies I tend to move them to archival or keep them where they are on a case by case basis. Some of the examples you've given have replies, so I suspect other moderators have a similar line of thought.",

As for what I delete from the Archival board, well, it depends on a number of factors - are there any substantial replies (as opposed to something as \"move this Â test to archival\", \"please delete\", \"lol\", etc) from other users, is the post merited, is it self-moderated (dunno if I seen any in Archival though so not sure if they keep their self-mod status when moved there), etc. Essentially, I tend to delete threads that seem to be testing BBcode / thread designs or contain absolutely no information whatsoever (no content in the OP, no content in the replies and the topic itself doesn't provide any info in it of itself).While I did say that I \"tend to clean the Archival section once in a while\", it's usually more of a casual sweep up - look through several pages and delete the more or less obvious test threads, making it easier for anyone who makes new test threads to find theirs as well as for other users to dig through retired threads. The \"once in a while\" isn't particularly frequent either - from once a year or so to maybe once every few months. It just so hapenned that Casino Critique's thread was posted semi-briefly before I started my occasional sweep.As for reporting these threads, I wouldn't bother unless it's something that shouldn't belong on the forum in the first place. Maybe if it's a clearly abandoned test thread or a deleted thread that is truly and utterly devoid of any info or data (old, no content, no merit, no self-mod, no other user replies).",

I imagine you're a outlier in that though, and I can't see many other users fulfilling their drafts. 100 previews a day is a bit high, but I dare to say many members use about that much daily. Depending on the length of a reply I make, I could preview it about 3-4 times, before finally posting. That's about 5 slots already. If I notice any errors later, I would edit and most likely preview again. Someone who makes 10-20 posts a day, could easily run through the entire drafts and clear out those from previous days.",
