  "content": "Since version 24.0 of Bitcoin Core I suspect, you can use Electrum and 2 phones with Muun wallet on each. Follow instructions below:Make sure mempool.space website have transactions greater than 3 sats/vB for candidate blocks.From Electrum, send max sats at 2 sats/vB on Electrum to a disposable Muun wallet from native segwit (from Electrum) to taproot address (on Muun) via Bitcoin network (bc1q... to bc1p...). Call this Muun Wallet AAs soon as Muun Wallet A receives fund, send funds to another Muun wallet (let us name it Muun Wallet B) via taproot again (bc1p.. to bc1p...) at 1 sat/vB.As soon as Muun Wallet B receives fund, send to new Electrum address via native segwit address (bc1q....) according to optimal fee on mempool space website.Open Electrum on PC and cancel original transaction (double spend) at 3 sats/vB or recommended fee.Wait for confirmation of transaction from Muun to Electrum transaction.Delete data (clear data of app) on Muun Wallet A app on Android phone. Muun wallet B can be kept (the one signed in). For iPhone, delete wallet, close app. (Muun Wallet A on Android; Muun Wallet B on iPhone)Repeat step 1.More info at: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/020980.htmlMuun trusts you with zero-conf transactions with small amounts, but with larger amounts they’ll make you wait for a confirmation.Why not just wait for confirmations, even with small amounts?Also, why do they subsidize your on-chain fees? Is it a feasible business plan? What's their 0 conf bitcoin amount limit?Devices:              [PC]              [ANDROID]              [IPHONE]APP INSTALLED:    [ELECTRUM]    [MUUN]                  [MUUN]",
