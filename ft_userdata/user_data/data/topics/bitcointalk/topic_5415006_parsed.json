While I'm obviously still long term bullish, we had a lot of delusional moonboys (as we always do) near the peak of the bull market. We need to wipe out all those crappy crypto YouTubers and influencers first as well.",

The market don't give you what you want to be served immediately. The market is at this time like an example of a bad waiter trying to clean up all the mess on the table before taking your order. So what do you have to do at such time especially if you like the delicacy from the restaurant? To wait for the time the waiter comes to take your order. Now there are many traders and hodlers waiting to get in but the market not giving in just yet because of some clean up and correction.",

Dumping is not a silent trend, it's a big message to us that we should start accumulating, a great indication of a good market.

Regardless if the world economy will be good or bad, it is going to be better soon as what the cycles have been. Yes, this is simply a trend that the market has to go through. Although many people say that due to war, economic crisis leads to market crash, that is true but not entirely true. Many people have started to believe that this year we will enter a bear market after we hit ATH last November, which means this was predicted before war or inflation started. OP should review the history of the market and the cycles the market has gone through in the past, you will understand where we are and when this silence will end. A falling market is not necessarily a bad sign if you really understand how it works.",

And now, the bitcoin price has started to increase by returning to the $20k price and hopefully, the price can continue to increase and reach new ATH again. But we have to be patient because it can't all be back in a short time and there must be stages that should pass. This is a good time to buy bitcoin because the price is still below the bottom and we can also try to profit from trading.",

No matter what news or events affect it, the result will always be the same - the trend will change and no one will care why bitcoin has been falling for such a long time. Then, when most people buy bitcoin at a high price, the market will deflate and the bearish season will start again, just like now. Patient people make a lot of money on such fluctuations.",

They are now passing their leisure time on the other side. But they will come again, they don't even need to do much research. They have a specific goal and never go beyond that. I have seen some big investors start traveling to different countries for entertainment when the bear market started.
