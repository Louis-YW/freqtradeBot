I want my meat cooked well-done.The US meat supply may soon be widely contaminated with mRNA proteins from biotech “vaccines”https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-01-16-us-meat-supply-infected-with-mrna-proteins.htmlThere’s soon going to be another reason to either choose vegetarian food options or get your meat from local, trusted sources: mRNA vaccines are about to be heavily implemented across the meat industry, with cattle, chickens, pigs, goats and other livestock targeted for regular mRNA injections.As we’ve seen with human beings, mRNA injections can:    Circulate throughout the entire body and end up in blood and organs.    Cause the body to produce toxic proteins which can cause toxic effects.    Clog arteries and end up killing or harming people from strokes or heart attacks.    Alter chromosomes and cause permanent genetic changes to the organism.Hypodermic needles, it turns out, aren’t the only way these mRNA instructions can be introduced into the human body. They can also be swallowed, or they can enter through skin contact. Merely handling raw meat contaminated with mRNA products is likely the equivalent to being exposed to “shedding” from vaccine recipients. And even though stomach acid likely destroys mRNA sequences, there is absorption that takes place in the mouth, under the tongue, which is why many medications and supplements — including CBD oils and zinc — are often best absorbed under the tongue rather than being swallowed.Thus, merely introducing mRNA-vaccinated animal meat products into your mouth, if not fully cooked, may expose you to a kind of “food shedding” of mRNA products that can be absorbed into your blood and circulated throughout your body. This can include proteins which are alien to the human body.Pfizer, Bayer and other pharma giants have already announced mRNA vaccines for meat animalsAs Dr. Robert Malone revealed in a recent substack article, Big Pharma giants began announcing mRNA vaccines for animals as early as 2016.
