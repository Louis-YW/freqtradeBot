But Bitcoin in an aspect of the payment system has made it possible for holders to make payments seamlessly without undergoing any form of government policy on transaction limits or restrictions to who one can send payments. Bitcoin has impacted in so many ways that make human life easier than I can even imagine.",

Even now the un-banked sector around the world contributes a big number. Those people at some point turning towards cryptocurrency will be a big success.Bitcoin having multiple usage is another key factor for which users can prefer it over other form of investment/traditional usage. It can be used as investment, currency, store of value, transaction medium. Above all, it doesn't require a series of procedure same as we do with banks.",

A shame that a person with the seniority on this forum that you have is talking about converting bitcoin to fiat to pay instead of paying directly with it. And then that in the second sentence you somehow identify bitcoin and cryptocurrencies when they are essentially different is already the last straw. Bitcoin is having more and more impact on society, just like cryptocurrencies but the latter are just another part of the system while the former at least was devised as an alternative to it. Another thing is that in daily use many people acquire or transfer them through centralized entities.",

It depends on the country you live in, if bitcoin in your country is illegal then using bitcoin will be caught and fined. In this case, there is nothing wrong if you convert bitcoins to fiat to use. When you buy a cup of coffee for only $0.50, you can't use bitcoin to pay, it takes quite a long time to confirm the transaction and I think the transaction fee will be higher than paying for the coffee. Bitcoin is not only a means of payment, it can be a currency, property, safe haven… depending on how each person uses it. We are bitcoin investors but don't always use it for payment, use it according to the circumstances. IMO.",

The use of virtual currencies thus offers a more secure way to transact with foreign entities or local merchants without having to worry about fraud or theft. This has offered consumers a new alternative to their usual way of making purchases, allowing them to have more control over their spending.Future generations will definitely be smarter and will ask themselves, how is it possible to send money for free?Yes, we are all heading into a new era in remittances.

Now the fear is because of uncontrolled authority over the use of bitcoin which could put down various government operations. Such as how they will get the taxation and how they will run the nation (if they really do!). I don’t think there is anything else that’s interfering with their decisions of accepting it. The fear of loosing tax monetary system is alone biggest barrier for them. However, DUBAI managed to survive with less or zero tax but again that’s rich country with kings who understand humanity.
