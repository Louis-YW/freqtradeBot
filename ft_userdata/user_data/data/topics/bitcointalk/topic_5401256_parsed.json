He is also trying to carve out an extra bit of his legacy, since Russia has stood still in the 20+ years of his rule and been gutted by the corruption his system of government breeds. Besides oil and gas, which are simply extracting resources from the earth, there is very little productive coming from that country unfortunately - it is full of people who have the potential of any other country, but they are handicapped by the criminality that runs from the very top of government. Oil and gas can keep it sustained in the short term, but since those energy resources have been weaponized and used to threaten Europe, it is seen as an unreliable source which needs cutting off - this will take time but that revenue source will drop as other countries step in to buy it at much lower prices. Only recently have western companies decided to pull out entirely, most had suspended operations and still paid staff, that is starting to end and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of jobs are going to evaporate.",

Russia has lost it's best military personnel in this war and it is facing an unusual economic challenge due to sanctions. Russia also thought that invading Russia would scare other nations from joining NATO. But they got it all wrong.This invasion has proved to the world that peace is priceless and terror is senseless.

Do they have a backup plan or is this economic suicide?? https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61656289At first I'm a little off topic, but about part of your post. I'll just inform you - a country that carries the idea of ​​naZism, rashiZm and total terror - cannot fight against nationalism in another country, especially against invented nationalism.Regarding the impact on the economy. I will not one-sidedly assess the situation, it is not beautiful. This conflict has actually created economic problems for a very large number of countries. The EU, for example, got a problem that was talked about for a long time, but the policy of flirting with a pathetic parody of the Fuhrer led to it. The problem is the very significant dependence of the economies of some large countries in the EU on gas and oil from a terrorist state. The EU had and still has the opportunity (now it will be much more expensive, but you have to pay for all idiotic actions) to diversify gas and oil supplies in such a way that the loss of one of the participants in the supply does not lead to significant problems. But corruption in the EU (although objectively - this process began long before the creation of the EU), pragmatism and reason won.Regarding other problems that the world has received as a result of the terrorist war unleashed by Russia in Ukraine, and the confrontation of the whole world against a terrorist country. The supply of grain to the world market - a problem is also brewing here. It is connected with the fact that most likely Russia will limit the sale of grain to the EU. At the same time, Russia does not give Ukraine, by blocking civilian ports, seizing territories, and stealing grain stocks from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. I think this market will be divided very quickly by Canada, the US and Australia, while maintaining some market dissatisfaction.Also, some restructuring of the market will occur in the field of inert gases. Russia supplied about 30% of neon, which is in demand due to its active use in the production of microelectronics. But these volumes can be replenished after some time by China and Ukraine. After the start of the terrorist attack, the production of neon was suspended in Ukraine, but the production itself is operational. Rising prices caused by the ban on the export of inert gases from Russia have increased gas prices, which will positively affect the income of Ukrainian companies.Another area of ​​potential problems is fertilizers. Sanctions were imposed against Belarus and Russia, for the supply of their potash fertilizers. In volumes, this is 20% of the world market, from Belarus. Russia also stopped shipments of ammonium nitrate.Perhaps he missed something, but did not find other products that are significant for the world market. Just do not forget that Russia's share in the world economy is less than 2%.What problems does Russia have?First you need to understand the structure of Russia's export/import.Exports are mostly represented by natural resources, and first of all, these are oil, gas, and derivatives. It is also precious metals, wood and some others. Resources predominate in the structure of exports.Imports are mostly technologies, high-tech equipment, machine tools, devices, computers, semiconductor devices, chemicals, medicines, and medical equipment, technological and industrial equipment (including for the extraction and processing of oil and gas). Given that even according to official statements, imports to Russia fell after it unleashed a terrorist war against Ukraine by almost 90%! Considering the above directions of imports, sanctions of the 6th package and the expected subsequent ones, in 3 months Russia lost what, for example, the USSR was deprived of for 10 years, which ultimately led to its bankruptcy and collapse. Considering that in 2022, Russia officially banned the open publication of some economic and financial indicators, it is difficult to give specific figures. But the sanctions hit critical imports and left Russia without technology. For a country, essentially a third world resource-based economy, this means the collapse of industry, or the decline of the economy by the middle of the 20th century. The only thing that still keeps the country afloat a little is the export of resources, but this is also rapidly declining. It is absolutely clear that sanctions are not a blow to the head with a sledgehammer - they do not give an instant result  But this is a process that systematically destroys the country's economy. Well, and most importantly, at the current stage, it is impossible to lift the sanctions and return everything to the pre-sanction period. Many countries that imported raw materials and some goods from Russia have already changed suppliers, and returning back is extremely difficult, and even if such a decision is made, it will be very long in time.",

      "body": "Billions of dollars in revenue sounds like much, but if it's a few billion over a year, it's not significant enough. Initially, the panic and sanctions did lead to ruble explosion, but very strict monetary policies, forcing to basically abandon foreign currencies and limiting any foreign currency withdrawals, along with linking ruble to gold, did the thing to stabilize the ruble. However, that doesn't mean that all is good in Russia and the economy wasn't hit. I watch videos of a Russian youtuber occasionally where he walks in the supermarket, talking about the prices and comparing them to how they used to be, as well as showing big malls and how they used to be. From that, it seems that the food prices grew generally 1.5-2x, which if you ask me is huge. Also, a significant number of people lost jobs, and salaries didn't grow. So Russians can now afford less than they used to, and tons of clothing brands and food chains are no longer operating in Russia. So there's impact, but Russians are also quite used to shitty lives and adjusting to increasingly worsening conditions, and thus that's not enough to cause meaningful change in terms of the war. But some effects are indeed long-term and may become more pronounced later.",

On the other hand, Europe is suffering from immense inflation and excessive gas prices, burdening both whole nations who are forced to implement measures to tackle the excessive costs of living.",

On the other hand, Europe is suffering from immense inflation and excessive gas prices, burdening both whole nations who are forced to implement measures to tackle the excessive costs of living.Exactly. Out of the 8 million barrels of crude and refined products that Russia export every day, now China and India together account for more than 3 million. And this figure may increase further. The Indian government is in talks with Russian counterparts for further discounts to the imports and Chinese government has announced that they are looking forward to fill their strategic oil reserves with Russian crude. On top of that, a large number of Asian nations (Sri Lanka, Pakistan.etc) have expressed interest in Russian crude.",

As a result of the war, news outlets where one can read, watch or listen to news no longer have independence to be aired as they have been either blocked or shutdown. Hundreds of companies have pulled out of Russia in protest as a result of the invasion in Ukraine.Russia meanwhile believe that this attack is not a war; rather a necessary operation designed to fight Nazis, Ultra nationalists and bring about peace and liberation ( what a funny way to go about it, if you ask me). Although the Russian economy has not collapsed under the onslaught of sanctions, but the world's largest country is now unable to import many of the goods it once did including high-tech semi conductors. The EU's oil embargo alone is expected to cost Moscow billions of dollars in lost export revenue. Do they have a backup plan or is this economic suicide?? https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61656289In my opinion, there is no back-up plan ....  At one time, former Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev suggested that Russia is too important for other countries to remain isolated forever.  He suggested that the initially imposed economic sanctions would eventually be lifted or relaxed.  However, this is an overly optimistic statement .... The oil and gas embargo, in my opinion, has disastrous consequences for the Russian economy.  Also catastrophic is the ban on the import of Western technology.  However, all these effects have a long-term effect. This effect will not appear immediately, but will have disastrous consequences.Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Russia selling oil to Asia count as a backup plan? I read an article claiming that Russia had over $20b in revenue from selling crude oil, which is a 50% increase just for 2022. On the other hand, Europe is suffering from immense inflation and excessive gas prices, burdening both whole nations who are forced to implement measures to tackle the excessive costs of living.Asia (India and China) does not really need Russian oil (and natural gas) ... They will buy it if the prices are attractive for buying, but in fact they do not really need Russian oil.  This is due to the availability of alternative sources of energy resources and the structure of the economies of these countries, as well as to a warmer climate.  The main consumers of Russian gas and oil are European countries.  Therefore, the conflict with European countries is a very stupid and insane action.  Currently, Russia receives a lot of money from the sale of oil and gas (due to rising world energy prices).  However, in such a business, the main thing is to maximize the supply of goods.  The most important thing here is the struggle for the volume of the market.  This is what affects Russia's income in the long run.",
