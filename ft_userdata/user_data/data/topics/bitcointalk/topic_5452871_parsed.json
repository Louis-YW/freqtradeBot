The balance you’re asking for is an utopic world and that’s pretty much.. impossible to achieve.For the current state of the world and technology, Bitcoin’s really the best version ever of a currency. It’s constantly improving and it’s much better than the version Satoshi launched decade ago. Yet, there’s no way you can do everything your way. Doing everything your way means leaving behind everything Bitcoin stands for.By blocking bankers from buying a lot of Bitcoin you’re also going to need to block individuals from doing so. Bankers can make as many addresses as they want, how will you control this? There’s a discussion going on right now in the Bitcoin Discussion board exactly about this: the number of Bitcoin addresses holding 1 Bitcoin has gone up but there’s no real information about how many people actually hold them. Bitcoin can’t be perfect. Even if you controlled bankers and restricted their Bitcoin ownership, they’ll find another way to impose their power.You also complain about the “premine”… well, how do you create a currency that is never premined to newborns? Again, issues that aren’t actual issues.. I mean in some way I get you, but as of now there’s no solution for this except censorship, which leads to so many other issues that are then solved by decentralization.. and there goes the dog spinning around its tail.",

Nobody is forced to invest in it. Personally I just think you don't understand the subject in depth to be able to write that here, I totally disagree with you.What do you have to offer better OP?mk4 is a thousand times right, what you describe sounds very much like an infinite inflation protocol. There's nothing to stop you from holding USD if that's your will.Quotebtw stop deleting my post u fucking cock suckers what are you elon musk u can't have free speech on this shit or what.You should maybe relax a little bit, and maybe educate yourself a bit more on the subject, instead of posting nonsense and being in a persecution syndrome.",

Fiat can't buy it all because the ones who are holding their Bitcoin won't sell for such low rates. The true Bitcoin enthusiasts know the real value of the crypto-currency and they won't sell it for such low rates that are below $1 million to $10 million per Bitcoin and until then the government and banks can't own all the bitcoins with their fiat.QuoteYou know miners will kill each other for the coins in the future and it already happens today.That statement is totally incorrect. If the miners can kill each others for the coins in future then investors can also kill each other for the assets they are holding. That point is totally useless my friend and is not even considered in anyone's eyes as a legit point so kindly, stop promoting such type of hatred material.QuoteYou know the energy consumption impact on earth even Hal knew it.Bitcoin is mostly mined with renewable energy sources and that won't impact the earth. The renewable energy sources are in abundance and utilizing those for such beneficial work is a great deed done by miners. It's totally unfair to say such things, that's most probably another way that people like you use to degrade the value of Bitcoin.QuoteWhen you make a bitcoin that has fair distribution?.. so we can get on with earth and ditch fiat and bitcoin crypto currency beta test.When Bitcoin was created everyone had fair distribution to mine as many Bitcoin as they could. Even with slow systems people could mine enough bitcoins. In the early days of Bitcoin the miners could mine many blocks of Bitcoin per day even with simple Pentium grade computers. Here is the post of Theymos that you must visit to see that how well was its distribution. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php? topic=43.msg371#msg371It's distribution was fair and those who adopt it earlier made enough Bitcoin because of their own intelligence and early adopting of a great innovation.
