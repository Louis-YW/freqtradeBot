Well, here we go:Bitcoin: A Homie-to-Homie Digital Cash Vibeby Satoshi THE GOAT Nakamotosatoshin@gmx.comSource: www.BitcoinForGenZ.orgAbstract. Yo fam, ever wish you could send cash to your crew without any bankdrama or middleman vibes? Digital signatures are sick, but if you’re still needing atrusted third party to stop double-spending, that’s just sus. We’ve got a GOATsolution for this mess using a homie-to-homie network. Here’s the tea: wetimestamp transactions by hashing them into an endless chain of proof-of-work,creating a record that’s locked down tight. You gotta redo all the proof-of-work tomess with it. The longest chain isn’t just the ultimate proof of what went down; it’salso proof that it came from the most CPU power flex. As long as the majority ofCPU power is with the legit squad and not some shady crew trying to wreck things,they’ll keep the chain lit and outpace the attackers. The network is mad chill withminimal structure, messages get broadcasted on a “best effort” basis, and nodes candip in and out whenever they want. They just vibe with the longest proof-of-workchain to stay on track.",
