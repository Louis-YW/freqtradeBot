Although I'm sure the flow of money going to major trusted certificate authorities would disagree with me. Looks like the SSL certificate expired, so we'll need to get it renewed.. but your communication to the site is as encrypted as it would have been yesterday. The browser notification is just alerting you to the date being expired, so the browser no longer officially trusts the certificate, and is warning you.I can tell you it's the same certificate that was on the site yesterday, it's just expired now. Regardless, as @Charles-Tim pointed out, I don't believe there would be anything of value to gain from compromising BPIP's SSL certificate.",
