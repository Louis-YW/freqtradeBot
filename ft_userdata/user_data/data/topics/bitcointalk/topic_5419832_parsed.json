  "content": "Hello,I would like to report a website that is scamming it's users by providing a broken system, the website link is : https://www.bitsler.com/There are many many problems example, the admin doesn't respect people, the way he talks like he owns you, for example if you say something he doesn't like he will block you right away or tell you to go and watch netflix and leave bitslerBUT the main fault is in their \"Self-Exclude\" feature, when you click it it will block your account but it doesn't block your IP nor your information, meaning even if you \"self-exclude\" an account you can create another account right away, and you can create tens if not hundreds of Accounts from the same IP address on this website. they don't care about the \"self-exclude\" which is a big problem because am one of the players that has an addiction and i did self-excluded my account and i created another account after 2 days and played and lost my money (2500$) ! I talked to them about it and they are refusing the ban my IP address because they know that i will come back later and deposit more and lost to them, and this happens with every other player on their scammy site!, then after i started telling the support that i will write about this on bitcointalk he said they will look into it and they will block it in the future and i have been in  contact with them for the past 3 hours and my IP is not blocked yet nor more account! Now imagine if you have a gambling addiction and you are trying to stop but suddenly you had the urge to do it again, you open the site and simply create 10 more accounts no matter how many times you close the other accountsAnd before bitsler fans jump in, i have tried stake, primedice, etc.. all of these sites block the account right away if you have another account related to that IP addressPlease take action and warn others about this scammy faulty system.*PS : i have the chat transcript so if it's necessary then let me know and i will upload it right away.*In the chat i started saying a lot of bad words to them because they were using my addiction against me, they were refusing to block my account and they were refusing to block my IP address !**This is the email from their support i just recieved after i told them to block my IP otherwise i will report this on bitcointalk : \"Gabriel from Bitsler <gabriel@bitsler.intercom-mail.com>\"\"Feel free to post on btctalk we already have a nice collection of kids like you who feel important only because they use caps and insults. I hope you feel better now that you have found someone to blame for your own issues.\" Thank you.",

Also, you have other options to exclude yourself from online casinos. There must be some programs which disable to access from your computer to specific domains, you might try to download one of those programs, set a random and long password and then proceed to destroy the password or delete it, this way you would get locked out those casinos from your computer.",

Gambling addiction will never push you to make things right, instead it will make you worst, and I think this is not all about the casino but definitely its your own fault. If you are always breaking the rules in a casino, expect that you will always face a problem too when it comes to your finances. I suggest stop gambling when you think you are always in trouble, seek professional help first so you will know you are hitting beyond your limits.",

There are many other gambling firms that will treat you the way you desire.  Instead of blaming them for your loss or problems just move to another firm. But the truth is that you have not stated any cogent reason why Bitsler is a huge scam because your complains are just personal problems and not the fault of the company. There are only few gambling company that would help you solve problem of gambling addiction because they benefit massive from your problem. Like you have already been advised, seek for help in order to deal with gambling addiction. It is also important to read and understand the terms and conditions of every firm before dealing with them.",

But your question is that you were cheated by Bitsler and you blame Bitsler entirely for it. My question is you can't blame Bitsler for this. Because you want to leave their site of your own accord. And you might have used some wrong with them that caused you to be kicked out. You can solve your failure. Besides, if Bitsler had turned out to be a scam project, there would have been more complaints from more people.",

      "body": "If I understand correctly your statements against bitsler this gambling platform scammed you of 2500$? is that right? And also agree with your story, in other crypto gambling such as Primedice and others, when you create more than one account, they immediately block it and unlike Bitsler, this is not done, is that right? and now because you can't release your 2500$ balance assets from Bitsler, this is the basis for you to be cheated by them.Okay, based on my assessment based on your statement, it doesn't seem right to immediately say that Bitsler is to blame for why you lost 2500$, you said that you have a gambling addiction. This means that you decide how much money you will enter into their casino platform. It also appears that you are the one who admits that you created multiple accounts on their platform using only one IP address, but here it seems like you didn't use or apply your common sense first. You may know most of the time and most crypto gambling prohibit dummy accounts.So in my conclusion bitsler is right and has a reason why they were able to block your account. I hope the next time you play crypto gambling, don't pass on the gambling platform if you have any assets in their casino, because you won't have any problems with a casino if you don't decide to gamble and play there.",
