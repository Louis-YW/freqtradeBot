You might have an hidden malware in your system that you aren't aware of and that could be something troublesome. If you really want your device to be 100% air gapped then surely you'll need to format the drives and install a new operating system into it because sometimes networking components aren't disabled from bios settings and the hardware is also present in that system and due to a wrong step it can still connect to internet. I would suggest you to install a Linux based operating system instead of Windows OS because Linux is much secure and completely open-source. You should also learn about networking hardware of your system and if it's detachable then you should completely remove it from your system. You should never ever use any wifi internet dongle on that device.Quote from: Mia Chloe on September 18, 2023, 10:42:08 AMAnd will it be possible for an hacker to install those drivers remotely?The hackers won't be able to install the drivers remotely if they aren't close to your device but if the device has Bluetooth connectivity and the hacker is in close distance from your device then in theory that person may be able to connect to your device and install those drivers remotely. However, you really don't have to be worried about that thing if your pc doesn't have any Bluetooth connectivity built into it.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on September 18, 2023, 01:38:10 PMQuote from: Mia Chloe on September 18, 2023, 11:44:50 AMAlright I will uninstall the windows software and re install it now.Even better - install a good Linux distro which will be more secure and more private than any Windows system (as well as being open source). You might also find that lots of modern wallet software won't run properly on old versions of Windows.That's what I was going to say. Another good thing about Linux distros is that they are light weight and can be installed on any system even with low ram. I personally used Lubuntu on my low end desktop and it was pretty good in performance. The Linux is much safer than Windows OS especially from that decade old Windows OS's. The best thing about Linux distros is that they have support for each wallet and whatever is open-source can be compiled for it and it will work flawlessly.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on September 18, 2023, 01:38:10 PMQuote from: AbuBhakar on September 18, 2023, 11:54:54 AMThis count as air gapped device but why not just invest on a hardwaware that is 100% air gapped like Keystone and Elipal instead of relying on an old PC that has the tendency of being not functional in future?Why would an old PC not be functional? I have computers which are 20+ years old and still run just fine, whereas you can find reports of hardware wallets having their screens die after just a few years.I'm not a fan of hardware wallets because they aren't necessary for the ones who are technically good. I agree with you the old PC's won't have any issue as long as they are running a Linux distro and they really aren't that bad for wallets but yes the user must have to be careful about the hard drives as they are mechanical in nature and can stop working anytime. An old pc with SATA SSD would work like a charm as an air gapped device, and the users don't really need to update that pc whatsoever.",

I never made an air-gapped device in my life but in my recent time here I have heard a lot about it and just to clear things up for you I'm not an expert but sharing the slightest knowledge I have. You should not connect your device to the internet and will not even connect any external device with your PC (peripheral device). That's what most people advise. The point is, why did you want to make your old computer air-gapped, I mean if you think you can make it air-gapped and can use it for wallet purposes and think that for making transactions you can connect it to the Internet for a short time and it will still be count as air-gapped. But no it will not count as air gapped. I know your question is not this but I'm adding useful knowledge for you so you can get familiar with the possibilities and mistakes that people make.

However it's better than openening it up to the world yourself. If somehow it gets hacked after a thorough airgapping you could narrow things down to the manufacturer and software makers. But I doubt they would go that route if they know you are knowledgeable in stuff like that as it would  expose what their device and software are capable of doing secretly after thoroughly airgapping it.",

Will this still count as an air-gapped device or do I still have to remove the hardware networking components from the PC board?

According to the definition of an air gap device, it should not be connected to the outer world, directly or indirectly. So, you have to make that PC air-gapped but if you were using the same PC while connecting it to the internet then I prefer you to uninstall this window or maybe buy a new HDD or SDD but that's not compulsory. After that, install a new operating system. Try not to install Windows OS as it is vulnerable to scams and hacks. And I don't think the deletion of network drivers is necessary but that is a good practice to do, just in case. I am also not a technical dude who works at geekforgeeks but after learning from some tutorials you will be able to make an airgap device at home easily. But according to my knowledge, the hard part is to keep that air gap device disconnected from the outside world.",

A properly airgapped computer shouldn't have the hardware components to connect to the internet. So, even if you wanted to store your seed in the cloud using that machine, you wouldn't be able to. If, on the other hand, you import that seed to a hot wallet, it stops being an airgapped cold storage.Removing connectivity hardware is also a protection against yourself. If you have had your software wallet on your airgapped device for a few years and you feel it's time for an update, you might get lazy and say it doesn't hurt to connect my computer to the internet just once to update it directly on my machine. You can do that if you have the needed hardware.

It's not that common nowadays to find a PC that hasn't been regularly connected to the internet. Reinstalling the OS is therefore recommended regardless of how you used it in the past. The fact that you aren't going to connect a non-reformatted PC to the internet in the future isn't enough. You could have been infected with a clipboard malware, for example. It will be able to replace your copied address even without internet connection. So, don't do it.",
