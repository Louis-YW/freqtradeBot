These games currently have over 15 prizes including all top #10 crypto assets and some partnership BSC token prizes. Using prize credits on our dashboard you can track your progression towards your prizes. Hold more GEMS and gain more plays of our games each time. Sessions reset every 8 hours. https://games.gemcave.org/NFTsAll our NFTs are minted using GEMS tokens. The GEMS used to mint are BURNED forever. This is a huge deflationary aspect to GEMS as we aim to distribute our NFT technology across the globe. https://avatar.gemcave.org/GemCave NFT TechnologyThe technology behind gemcave token’s NFTs is perhaps the biggest product of all. Using on-chain compression algorithms and encoded data, Gemcave Token manages to store 100% of NFT Meta Data on-chain. Meaning $0 in server fees as all data is stored on chain. It also means the NFTs are 100% secure, no chance of the servers going offline, no chance of the NFT ever being modified and altered in any way. 100% secure, 100% safe and most importantly, 100% YOURS!Listing SiteThe GemCave listing site is the oldest product GemCave Token has, predating the GemCave Token Contract itself! This is where communities apply for listing and vote for their projects! The top projects are rounded up each month and given varying rewards for their activity on the site. This provides our holders with excellent inside tips for new up and coming projects to invest in as well as bringing more eyes to Gemcave Token. https://listing.gemcave.org/SWAPGemcave Token’s SWAP platform is live in alpha with 0% fees on buys/sells. https://swap.gemcave.org/#/swapThis is the current list of products we offer at GemCave Token, note that NONE of these products require payment from our holders — ALL are free to use daily.ALL GemCave services are available for purchase for other crypto projects, for enquiries, Email: admin@gemcave.org",
