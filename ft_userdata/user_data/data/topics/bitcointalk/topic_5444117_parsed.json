Blockchain and.... Very interesting question. It's actually important but not necessary. I actually prefer a certificate-less employee who can do his/her job really well.... compared to someone who knows little to nothing but is certified on a mere Certificate that he/she knows or can do the job very well. Very disgusting thing to experience. Certificate just makes things easy for the truely qualified in a dumb world. But if you are smart enough you easily can qualify for right job without it.",
