They will obviously say it is safe to update, but the main concern is not really about whether Ledger wants to hack their customer's wallets or not, but the possibility of other attacks/abuse that can happen due to their latest update afaik. Personally, the trust is lost and I'd move on to other wallets as of now until they make everything open source so others can verify their words instead of trusting what they said (which have been proven to be a lie, including the \"your seed never leave the wallet\"). CMMIW.By the way, no need to make a new thread about this since the previous one is still active[1] imo.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452900.",

If there is a backdoor, it's already a problem, what if Ledger instead adds this feature to all of its hardware wallet products.Within the sea of comments in the Reddit post shared by NotATether, both the co-founders (/u/murzika[1] and /u/btchip[2]) say that the reason this feature won't reach Nano S is due to memory limits:Quote from: /u/murzikaI don't have the details, but I think it's related to the SE chip not enough memory to store the new firmware (this will require a confirmation as I'm not sure).Quote from: /u/btchipThe firmware is the OS, so you need to be using one (same thing on your computer). We just won't port the Recover functionality to the SE because there isn't enough space to put it there.All their marketing during these 8 years was aimed at passing the idea that it would be impossible to remove the SRP from the SE but recently they've started to push the narrative \"oh no, in these past 8 years you had to trust Ledger to not implement such mechanisms\". Talk about misguiding their audience.[1]https://safereddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13layt7/comment/jkp9xq2/[2]https://safereddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13layt7/my_personal_view_on_the_pr_disaster_from_a_ledger/jkpttz0/It is odd that ledger company decided to dump all their old faithful customers in a crazy attempt to attract new customers...",

If you are suspicious of the security of your coins in the Ledger wallet, buy an alternative HW or create an airgapped wallet using Electrum.Back to the story, Ledger is required to speed up the open source firmware and you need to keep in mind that all new firmwares have access to the private keys, whether with your consent or not, and therefore they may some backdoors in old firmwares because we do not know what is happening in the background Although no crypto loss has been reported yet.Quote“If the wallet wants to implement a backdoor, there are many ways to do it, in the random number generation, in the cryptographic library, in the hardware itself. It’s even possible to create signatures so that the private key can be retrieved only by monitoring the blockchain.”I do not know why he made such a statement, but it is not assumed that this is a statement to reassure customers, but indeed if a person has physical access to that wallet, he may be able to access to your coins.",

May be those people who don't have much idea of crypto but as soon as they will learn their private key is not safe with them and they implemented such BS subscriptions idea, the clients will start to leave.

Of course, they will leave eventually, new and completely new customers do not fully understand what is going on with Ledger. once they realize and know that the Hardware Wallet private keys they bought can be extracted then they will stop at that point. Those who stayed just didn't understand what the danger would be.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on June 16, 2023, 12:11:58 PMYes they will find some one-time customers but not a customer base that will keep buying the product. A business can only survive in the long run when they have a loyal customer group who keeps buying their product. In the next a year or two ledger will be out of business.In fact, old customers are an important foundation for the company to survive. If the old customers are gone then there is no longer that foundation. They even get free marketing from old customers. and now the old customers are disappointed and replaced by new customers who still lack knowledge, this is like building a company from scratch but still with defects and will go bankrupt in the end.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on June 16, 2023, 12:11:58 PMI don't think you and me will ever care to have a Ledger wallet even if it's given free.If it is given for free, then I will choose to sell it again and buy another Hardware wallet that is more secure without the latest feature (private key extraction).Quote from: Pmalek on June 30, 2023, 04:15:39 PMOnly partially.
