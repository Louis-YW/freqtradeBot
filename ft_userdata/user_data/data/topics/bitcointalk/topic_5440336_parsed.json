      "body": "I agree with you, and I don't like it either. I remember seeing one brand of metal seed plates with a company logo and a website address like save . bitcoin . com or something similar. That's just ridiculous. A thief might not know what he is holding in his hands if he comes across a piece of steel with some weird words stamped on it. If you discover you have been robbed, you could move your coins by the time they figure it out. But you are definitely making it easier for them by engraving the words \"save\" and \"bitcoin\" on the thing.",

See this photo- YamaneSome are good / some are bad: https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/But the point remains, the one I use looks like nothing more then a metal bracket holding something together. Which technically you can do with these by putting the logo-ed side towards the thing you are bolting it to. But if you are not hiding it, just putting it someplace 'safe' them having a logo is just not a good idea.-Dave",

I just bought one for a friend and saw the logo and was thinking WTF???I think that all the businesses are proudly putting their logo on their products, no matter how (in)appropriate it is  I've said it on Willi's thread too. These look to me more like collectibles. More like nice things to show off.If one wants to hide their stuff on steel, I think that the best idea I've seen on this forum was the use of washers.",

I just bought one for a friend and saw the logo and was thinking WTF???What did you expect to receive?You are not going to receive blank plate when you are purchasing accessories from brand hardware wallet, but I think you can easily use sand paper for that or permanent market.However, it's much better to purchase regular stainless steel washers, add your own seed words and pay ten times less money.I am not advertising anything, but OneKey is offering interesting and unique aircraft-grade titanium alloy based solution, that only have only minimal logo that looks like 01. https://onekey.so/products/onekey-keytag",

The last ones I have been using are similar to the onekey link you posted except they had drill holes in it so can make it look like a bracket. Picked them up a DefCon a few years ago. I ordered this one for a friend to go with the hardware wallet I made him get and it was more like the ones I posted pictures of. I know they are not as good as the punched titanium ones but since it's the 3rd backup it's good enough. But as I said I really did not expect the logo on it. Don't know why since it's clearly in the picture. As others have said it's common. <shrug> It's now bolted somewhere in his house logo side in so it just looks like a cheap repair. (which it might be too but that's not the point here....)-Dave",

If you are interested, you can give you links to some of these services.- Yamane",
