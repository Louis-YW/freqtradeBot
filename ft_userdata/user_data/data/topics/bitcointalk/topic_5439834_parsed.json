  "content": "After roughly 1 month without hearing from Betcoin on mail, I feel the need to reach out here in hopes for some clarification either from them, or others. I have seen multiple posts and allegations on this forum against them already, and I sincerely wish I had seen them before creating an account there. I deposited approximately 5000USD to my account around NYE, and bet strictly NBA for around a week. After a high odds winner one night i got limited down to only a few bucks per play and decided to withdraw the entire balance of ~15000USD. All of a sudden I was unable to login to my account, and was told by livechat that my account was under review, and that I had to reach out to them by e-mail. Below follows the entire convo, with nothing left out:https://gyazo.com/63abb2b5e76da83af5e201c97bd01509https://gyazo.com/3c0437e15b90d751e0146a8a84841b32After Betcoins initial accusation of \"syndicate play\", they didn't ever respond to me, and it's now been a month since that. One of the accounts they linked to my name is my IRL friend, who recommended me the site after getting his withdrawal paid out quickly without any hazzle. The other account I have no idea who is, I only know 1 guy that has used this site and that is my IRL friend.The only reason I seek to these sites is due to new betting regulations in Norway, which forces Norwegians who like to bet to use cryptobookies. Banks do not accept betting-related transactions anymore, hence why I had to move away from regular EU-bookies which I previously used. I have never ever experienced anything like this before, therefore a little lost regarding what my options are. Any help at all is much appreciated.",

The only link we have is that we are friends, and I am guessing they connected us through checking our SoMe accs. I don't know if funds are confiscated, since I can't access my account. Not able to login, just getting an error message. Thanks btw, will for sure check that out.",

His account was his account and my account was my account. Neither created multiple accounts. We never logged in with same device or placed the same bets. It was plain and regular betting only, two friends that used the same bookie.Yes I am going to do that, I also run a semi-large twitter account that I will upload this to, and have been in touch with even bigger SoMe accounts regarding this. Mapping out now a way to make it as public as possible in hopes to get it solved.",

This is how reputable casinos should address complaints it should be fast and quick to resolve issues and do not let things hanging for several weeks, there are active casinos here that wait for DT to tag them or a flag created for them before they address issues, if the casino is fair, they will address it as soon as possible even if the result of the investigation is not favoring their casino, or they hold on to their decision against the complainant as long as the complainant really violated their terms or found guilty of abuse and cheating.Its time for OP to lock this thread and change the title to solved.",

If a customer's serious problem email goes to the spam folder, the customer will not get a solution from the company unless it creates extra pressure on the company. I think you got your problem resolved quickly because you posted on this forum and they also found out that your mail went to spam folder.But you still haven't cleared the amount of funds they have allowed you to withdraw.",

The conclusion was that they found a significant risk that I would create accounts on other identities, hence locked my account so they could speak to me and warn me. Issue appeared of course when there was no dialogue at all due to my emails arriving to their spamfolder. But was quickly solved last night when we spoke with each other on DM here. We didn't necessarily agree with each other, as I had no intention making more accounts. But apart from that, I'm just happy I got my funds out.",
