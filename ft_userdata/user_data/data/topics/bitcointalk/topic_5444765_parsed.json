I have always trusted this technique to save me tons in transaction fees since time immemorial, and I trust that people do this all the time too. These two have proven to be very effective in keeping me from paying too much for gas fees/transaction fees. I also just go for the slowest transaction processes since most of them tend to go through at my preferred time anyway and most of my transactions in the bitcoin network do not require immediate transfer, and even when they do I can always just ask for the person I'd send the btc to be patient, which surprisingly works every time.",

Adjust the fee based on your preferences for transaction processing time. Generally, higher sat/byte fees will result in faster transaction processing times, but at a higher cost. If your wallet has the Replace-By-Fee (RBF) feature, you can use it to cancel or increase the fee of a transaction that was initially sent with low fee.",

Do you use a fixed amount for transactions?I basically hate sending out coins especially when it has to do with charges and that's why I barely sell out coins but rather do more of receiving.Transaction charges are truly something else when the crypto space is involved as most times my heart skips when I have to send Bitcoin but thanks to lightening network which helps send Bitcoin bit with more lesser fee.There is this technique I just learnt of recent which is that I first covert my crypto to BUSD because it doesn't require any charges and I relatively think is just the best and fastest way for me.I hope you figure the best way for you too.",

I use electrum, and I always use the minimum that they have at the time of my transaction and so far it’s doing well. Never had any delayed transactions and usually get my confirms in the next block or two.In Electrum wallet, you have three options: Mempool, Static, ETA. I guess you use ETA option that usually over pay transaction fee with higher fee rate than what you can use to get fast enough waiting time for first confirmation.Static is used for fixed fee rate that you don't want to change like with 1 sat/vbyte or 2 sat/vbyte but with this, you must check mempool before making transactions. If mempool is heavy and you broadcast your transaction with too low fee rate, your transaction will be stucked in mempool or will be dropped off mempool after about 14 days.Mempool is for flexible fee rate and it helps you to avoid over paid with ETA. It's the best option in my opinion.QuoteIf I overpay on fees, I usually just let it be because it’s only a few cents at best anyways, so I do not feel the need to be bitchy about the fees especially when everything is already pre-calculated for me that still gets my transactions through the network.If you make a transaction with value like $100, $1000 a few cents for transaction fee is small with you but if someone make a $10 or $20 transaction, transaction fee is important for them.",

Bitcoin fee isn't called as gas fee, gas fee is known in Ethereum not Bitcoin. Some sites do give a bad estimation or measurement of the current Bitcoin fee, the best is mempool.space where you can easily set the appropriate of sat/byte.It's not effective to wait until the fee is low and then you will make a transaction, because it will wasting your time. The better option is just use wallet which have Replace By Fee feature e.g. Electrum, so if you make a transaction with cheap fee and it doesn't confirmed after next few hours or days, you can bump the fee whenever you want.",

But, Since you asked what others use to check the current transaction fees, I wouldn't mind sharing mine. I have used Atomic Wallet for a long time, and most of the time, I used suggested transaction fees, and sometimes I used lower fees. But, If I feel like Atomic is suggesting high fees, I check on Blockchains. Suppose you visit https://blockchair.com/bitcoin; you will see the recommended transaction fees on their website (see the image below). If you want your transaction to get faster, you can increase it slightly. When I write this post, the recommended transaction fee is two satoshis per byte. You can increase three satoshis if you want.",

Then you don't need to worry about knowing what the fee rates are, what to set the fee based on mempool state to get high priority, etc.Otherwise it all comes down to manually analyzing the mempool and speculating the fee rate from the time you create your transaction until the next block is found. For example during an ongoing spam attack or a transaction surge you should consider the slope apart from the current state and possibly pay a slightly higher fee if you want to ensure your tx is confirmed.But as I said for most users using a decent wallet should be more than enough.",

While you have enough time, why to pay more?Yes, that is true, but as explain by @dkbit98, if you want to get your transaction confirmed then pay higher fees. However, there are times as well that the mempool transaction fees changes, as it is dynamically base on the number of incoming transactions.Like what I did a couple of hours ago, the median is around 2-3 sats/vB, but suddenly it became a low priority.So I'm like waiting for 9 hours already, but hasn't got any confirmation yet. But I'm not in a hurry though, so it's ok. Maybe later it will clear out.",

I usually always add a few sat above the fixed amount of the medium rate or close to the fast rate.For example, if the transaction is using the mobile version of the wallet as shown in the picture, then I will add 19 or 20 sat to the fixed amount (14 sat).Image: Bluewallet Android version",
