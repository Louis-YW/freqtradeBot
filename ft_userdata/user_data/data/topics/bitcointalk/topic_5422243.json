It's been a while since you are not updated on crypto but it won't take you a long read and research to understand what's currently happening right now. Take a time to read any news about crypto.The bear market is part of the crypto-market happenings since the beginning of crypto. Not all the time that the situation will be favorable to us.Try to relax a bit and just be calm as there's no other choice but to be patient.",

Once the bear season arrives, there will always be a reason for the price of bitcoin to drop, and things won't change from the previous bear season. But you have come back at the right time, this is the time for you to buy back bitcoin at low price and wait for another bull run to take profits.",

This is 2022, in bitcoin history, using every 4 years after halving, the price do drop 2 years after halving. The last halving occured in 2020 and this is 2022 which is 2 years after. The drop was as a result of bear market which is normal, it has nothing to do with the war. 2023 would be bullish and bearish, followed by 2024 halving and another massive bullish trend would come.",

But this time, we didn't expect the decline to be very drastic and almost touched the lowest point in 2020 and has already passed the lowest price in 2021. This gives us the experience that bitcoin is still moving very wildly and can be at any price point so we have to be careful if we want to invest in bitcoin.The cause may be war, global problems, or government interference in the market. But since the beginning of this year, a lot of news and events have decreased the bitcoin price.

There are many reasons today why prices are falling and these have probably been discussed at any time in the space.But you are lucky, you have sold all your bitcoin in 2021, that should have made you very profitable.
