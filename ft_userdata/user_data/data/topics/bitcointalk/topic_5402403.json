You shouldn't pay that to me. You should pay that to miners. If you want a fast confirmation, you can make a new transaction and spend the fund received from binance with that high fee. Note that you can do so, only if you have full control over the fund. If the fund in on an exchange or any other custodial service, the only thing you can do is wait.",
