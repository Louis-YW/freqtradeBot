But that is not the case, we should wait till the bitcoin halving, because that will be the catalyst to end the bear market.",

Most of people should already learn from their past mistake, so that's why I say I don't believe it will down as $10K.",

It's very common to see price increases(sometimes even 2x's) in bear markets.Yeah, too soon to say it is over. The current situation suggests that the most catastrophic predictions will not come true. The ones that talked about the price going down to $15k, and even to $10k.In addition, there is a general improvement in the markets, which affects the price of Bitcoin. If it continues like this, I think the worst of this cycle will be over, but I do not expect great joy until the next cycle.",

As to analyze the market trend and price, we are still not hitting yet the 50% market recovery, that was still a little bit far which means that we are still below and consider it a bear market. I wasn't longing for this nor did I think about it but I was happy because I can still buy potential coins at a cheaper price.",

      "body": "No I don't think the bear market is over, even I think the bottom is probably in. It'll likely take another year for the bear market to be over, same as in 2019/2020 where there was around a year of consolidation (up, down then sideways). Given that the best times to buy are at the lows of the bear market, even if the most riskiest time to do so, then sure now could very well be a good price even though the bear market is far from over.Quote from: OgNasty on August 16, 2022, 01:54:45 PMI have long been saying that the mtgox coins being released will cause a drop in price, however with the recent Blackrock news that may not be the case.  Personally though, until those coins are absorbed by the market I don't think I'm ready to be done looking for lower prices.I also somewhat agree with OG that the idea of MtGox coins being distributed to creditors will have the market on edge until this passes, even though the likes of Fortress have been scooping them up for over a year already even when price was at $60K. Regardless of the fact they almost certainly won't be sold on spot market due to number of institutions willing to buy them, it doesn't mean whales won't manipulate the price in the meantime in order to get cheaper deals OTC. One this is for sure that selling your MtGox coins back in March 2021 to Fortress when price was at $60K for 20% discount would have been a much better deal than now.",

      "body": "The answer is obvious: Yes.The bear market ended 2 months ago when the drop ended and price slowly started going back up again. If you look at the charts from 2022-6-18 until today there is a slow but clearly visible uptrend (so far with a 43% rise).Those who are voting no are probably confusing the possibility of \"bear market starting again\" with \"bear market still going on\". If we are talking about that possibility, meaning this trend reverses and a NEW bear market starts, I'd say the chances are very low.",

Investment.2. Trade.In those two methods, of course people do both, be it for Bitcoin or any other type of crypto, the bottom line: for those who need a bear market to continue to the point where they believe, for example: Bitcoin to $10k, that's for those who invest, others don't believe the bear market is over or it's time to buy, they have their own analysis they believe in.For those who trade, of course they don't care about the bear market and the fortress market, they need market movement at all times, where to buy and where to sell.Conclusion: if you really want to do something in the crypto world, do it with your own heart, belief and mind, to make more profit, one can only say, not that it should happen.",

Some would argue that the bear market is over when the price starts spiking upwards within a short space of time, indicating that the bulls have taken over: and that market upticks does not indicate a change in the general sentiment.How many markets would you say exists? Is it just bear and bull or there's something in-between? Cause if it's just bear/bull, and the bear market is over, then we would be in a bull market at the moment.",

It's their problem that they haven't bought bitcoin when it has reached $17k and if it's bound to get into a new ATH, they'll not miss it.Because they're in between buying or waiting for some more. We're not yet out of the bear market and the bottom ain't that far from the current price that we've got.The confidence isn't yet there that bear's totally out, still, it's around the corner and anytime the price could go below $20k again.",

It means bitcoin doesn't have strength to push above yet, so I don't think the bearish market is over. Correction is so strong right now that bitcoin has already retreated to the same level it was before the last pump which happened days ago. Unfortunatelly there aren't evidences of solid gains for bitcoin when looking the recent fluctuations. Once progressive increasements in price start happening we might glimpse a chance of overcoming this bear market.",

In my opinion I don't think that it's the right time to ape in hard on altcoins, until bitcoin attain $30k - $35k,before I might reconsider the fact that we are not in bear market. The fact is that no one can predict the bottom, one of the best thing to do is to DCA your trading, don't go hard in buying any coin, there still speculation that bitcoin might hit $10k this year, remember that Mt Gox bitcoin had not been released.. So its better to buy in bit maybe every week or two weeks instead of buying all at once",

Your poll is missing \"I don't know/I am not sure\"It seems to me that too little time has passed since the beginning of the bearish trend, which means that it is still very early for this to end. According to the established tradition, this period lasts about several years, and less than a year has passed since the end of the bullrun. So, I believe that it is still too early to expect new high performance in the market and I would not like the world economic problems to affect the usual bitcoin cycles.
