  "content": "Few days ago I posted a topic about fake OpenAI crypto project that is using the ChatGPT and OpenAI hype to promote their scam..the link is here.. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5433880.msg61573994#msg61573994The journey doesn't end there for these criminals, right now new applications of ChatGPT are showing up on Google Play Store, beware people, there is no official ChatGPT app on Google Playstore, yet. Here is a the list of few fake ChatGPT apps on Playstore right now 1. GPT AI Chat and this one has the same logo as OpenAI  2. CHAT GPT 3: CHAT AI 3. Open CHAT: AI Chat BOT      The list is very big in number, the last time I make a count it's over 40 fake ChatGPT apps on play store, the problem is those apps can have some evil plan for the downloaders, this is a huge traffic since AI is popular right now, people will definitely want to download and use.In my country people's fund are going missing in their bank accounts, millions and thousands are gone and there is no single explanation for the reason yet but I believe that downloading unofficial apps an clicking on random links are not safe either, hackers work will be easier this way. Be wise. As good as HYPE is in crypto space it's also very dangerous and useful for criminals.",

Be wise. Downloading a fake app alone is unlikely to result in loss of millions from bank accounts. You would likely have to take some other sort of action which would expose your funds.- Jay -",

I personally have never even tried that AI because I really have no interest in it, but I understand that it is currently a hot topic for all those who think that they will be able to write posts on the forum that way and that no one will notice.",

But, to make things easier for users, the review page is there to tackle disputes like this. If a person reads through all the reviews written about an app (though some are lies) they'll find the truth about the app, whether it's real or fake. However many people don't care about reading reviews; such people get disappointed after downloading the file or app. In a situation like this, users are advised to stick with the official website of chatgpt if they want to utilize their AI. Hence, some developers are also building apps with the GPT api, like the \"ORIGINALITY\", I think they are the sites listed on app store. Note: not all of them would be harmful to users. Everyone need to be careful with taking decisions. Moreover, openAI would be launching a premium version of chatgpt soon, maybe it'll reduce the spam. The site is lagging even at the moment.",
