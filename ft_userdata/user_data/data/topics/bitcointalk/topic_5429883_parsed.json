Obviously it is the catalyst for the next bull run.But it is still very far, there could be black swan events that can push the market in the current bearish trend. Our lowest low is $15,500 so possible that it could be the bottom for this bear cycle or we might see another crash to $10,000-$13,000.And with that, we will need a lot of patience as its around 14-16 months till the next block halving.",

      "body": "Countdown is not the right word to use for the Bitcoin halving that is still over a year to come. It's a custom and expectation that Bitcoin enthusiasts envisage would make BTC climb, however, it would come and go, but one should be careful with their decisions at that time, that's my take on this rather than being a blind expectant. The halving is a Bitcoin tradition, yet, the market reality and speculation at that time is equally important. So, let's be careful and proactive with our analysis along this tradition so that we don't make mistakes. And if halving would cause a strong bullish run, I only see BTC hitting the ATH again, nothing more. While in the unforeseen event where a breach of the ATH happens, it might make it further reach $100k+ without hesitation.As for the 2023 behaviour, I don't see anything different from what happened in 2022, nonetheless, BTC might hit $30-35k in the year.",

In 2011, 2015 and 2019 there were positive returns, or rather, in fact, the only years with negative returns were 2014, 2018 and 2022. Let's hope that at least until 2026 we won't have a loss year again.",

      "body": "when it comes to expectations, I think my expectations will be the same as most of everyone's expectations. That is the price of bitcoin can return to ATH or beyond it. But that's hope for the future. the hope for now is that I still want to keep accumulating. and I'm in the middle of my target number. I still expect the price to stay in the current area and it's okay if it goes back down a bit. However, when talking about 2023, I think there will be a fairly positive movement. My thoughts are always the opposite of what is being discussed by global elites which is widely broadcast in the news. where many of them say that we must be prepared for what will happen in 2023 (negative). be it a recession or hyper inflation and the like. that scared people. but I think when bad news is spread then that's when the elites are shopping. or the whales are accumulating bitcoins. it is indeed effective to make the price down. so they happily buy from every drop. So I followed suit by buying when people were scared and selling. and my hope is that i can hit the target before the bitcoin halving starts.",

For example, the website you mentioned predicts the halving to be 500 days later while buybitcoinworldwide and coinmarketcap predicts it be 480 days and 522 days later, respectively.",

There are currently 767,898 blocks are mined total and also only 72002 block are left to mined. And also according to this there are only 526 days left until next halving and rewards will be halved that are currently in position.

There was some time in the past which Bitcoin halving doesn’t give any impact on the price since the market is experiencing too much FUD from different negative news from China. There’s a chance that it might happened again if the time when halving occurred is same when the recession or inflation hitting the global economy hard. Bitcoin halving will surely give a positive impact but the level of its effect is still depends on the atmosphere of the market during that time.",

Well, there are possibilities given that the event could hype the investors to engage with Bitcoin more than their usual amount of investment. Reason? Simply what happened from previous halving. Does it guarantee the same thing? Not really but the idea itself is enough to create the demand. We won't be certain than halving itself or its benefits would be the main key to recovery. But it is more likely the assumptions and how investors of this industry relates the past to future and present, which could be the 'role player' for the market recovery. But whether it would or wouldn't, it is still a long way before the next halving so let us hope there will be more positive things to happen in this industry as we are on the way.",
