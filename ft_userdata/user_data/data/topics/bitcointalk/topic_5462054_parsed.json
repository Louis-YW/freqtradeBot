To be honest the forum is large and you really can‚Äôt blame them for not putting them through thoroughly. Even up to this day there are some things that still exist in Theo forum that some legendary members don‚Äôt know of, because there are a lot of resources and no man is an island of knowledge. The best they can do is to give you the rules of the forum, give you some resources to learn about bitcoin because that‚Äôs what the forum is about, as soon as you take your learning seriously and start to contribute to discussions your account growth is sure to come. But if you‚Äôre of the opinion that those introducing you to the forum to sit you down and start to tutor you on how to make your every posts then you‚Äôre in the wrong because you‚Äôre expected to share your own opinions on different topics so you depending on them purely defeats the purpose of you learning.",

No one has the time to teach you the appropriate way to behave since we're all adults, you should already be aware of how to act when you join a group. Instead, you should spend some time learning about and observing how things are done before you start interacting.¬†It doesn't really matter whether the information you offered was read or not; what matters is that you shared knowledge. Since nothing put on this forum goes unnoticed, I assume that someone must have clicked on the link you shared. There are sticky threads here that were created to assist new members, but people tend to skip them without realising that they are the cornerstone of every new member's success in the forum. There is a thread labelled \"read before posting\" that contains answers to the questions new users have regarding the forum.",

Do not think that here someone is obliged to teach someone or be responsible for someone. I'm surprised by this. Speaking separately, I don't care how beginners navigate here. From my experience, there is a feature called the \"poke method.\"Read, try, and ask. Nothing complicated.Forget about being led by the hand. Don't expect too much; just be genuinely yourself, and don't forget that you are on the internet. And in it, people are very different, with a different understanding of the word \"should.\"",

We all had a beginning similar to many newbies and so I think we should just avoid it.They do post in hurry sometimes without bothering to search for existing threads and that annoys many people but as they spend more time they learn the ways things are in this forum.It's just about time and how mature one is to seek the knowledge they desire. The wise newbies do search for threads before posting and their posts do sound like genuine queries.But not all can have the same approach and so just leave them for they are because as time goes they will know how it has to be in here.",

I have seen many members here who just bash other just because they don't have to write lengthy or useful post because to write that they need useful information which many lacks. SO they just start roasting you.And one more thing, If you think that the roasting will be stopped once you become one of the rank members than it's wrong, because i am senior now but still have to bear some words against my mistakes and i have to admit them because mistake is a mistake and i am also in the learning phase so i can not argue someone, trying to emphasizing things for me.",

My only suggestion is learning is a difficult task and teaching too, many members might be using the roasting tactics to teach you things out but ok i get it you don't like that way.But let me tell you, even if some of the members have bashed you but most of the member must have dealt your with love they must have given you the answers you are looking for. We are here to help and if one abuses you, then you have the right to report them to moderators even the other part is legendary. Moderators of this platform are so active.

If you break any of the rules or you post rubbish, you will be held responsible and not the person that invited you. It is good to give the people you invite basic rules about the forum, but it is up to the person to learn more individually. Some persons were not invited by anybody to this forum, which means nobody gave them any formal or informal orientation. The rules are everywhere for you to read and you don't expect anybody to spoon-feed you. That is why before you post make sure that you are sure of the information. Most of those were created to advise and educate newbies. I don't see it as bashing or insulting. It seems you are taking it personally. They were only told to learn more before they start giving out lectures. How will someone want to teach you how to write quality posts while his post is low standard? Or how will a newbie want to teach how to get merits, while he has little or no merits? You can not teach what you know nothing about. And I see those posts not as insults but as a piece of very good advice to newbies.",
