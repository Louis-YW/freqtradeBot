Why are you interested in investing in bitcoin?You can benefit from bitcoin a lot, first of all, it can be an opportunity for you to earn money if you are unemployed right now, how do you do that? Of course, you need to know and learn how to have bitcoin and how to do trading in this industry.    In addition, this bitcoin can also be saving for your future, the beauty of this is that the value you sell for bitcoin can be 10x or 100x depending on what happens, then you can also apply it to a business if you already have a business, and you can send 24/7 even anywhere in the world via money transfer.",

So, I want to learn more about bitcoin from you guys. I want to ask you guys. Why are you interested in investing in bitcoin?I'm not qualified to answer your question because until now i have never bought Bitcoin. I just want to share my perspective on Bitcoin, and why we should invest there (not talking about the technology). First of all, Bitcoin has a max supply of 21M coins. This number will never increase, which means there will be a limit to inflation in Bitcoin. In contrast to gold which does not have a maximum supply. From this point of view, we can judge that Bitcoin has more store of value than gold which people say is the best store of value.Even though i haven't been able to buy Bitcoin, at least i can get it for free through the faucets that i currently use, such as Bestchange, Freebitco.in and Yannik.biz. Hopefully i can get my first Bitcoin in the near future.",

The initial interest in bitcoin was for the potential for profit. If talk about me. Later, with a little more in-depth study and the beginning of awareness of the possibilities of this technology, interest turned towards financial independence and digital freedom. It still seems unimaginable to me. You can be anywhere in the world and not depend on any banks and governments. OP. If you want to learn more about bitcoin - just start reading info on this forum and your efforts will be rewarded.",

Consequently I'm more interested in using bitcoin and earning it as you would any other currency.The reason for that is the uniqueness of bitcoin as a currency. And of course the increased purchase power, which you could call \"profit\" is the cherry on top.",

Why are you interested in investing in bitcoin?I become interested on Bitcoin when I’m newbie because of online casino and faucets. Online casino that rime is new to me since physical casino is not accessible in my location that time. I learned that I can earn Bitcoin by just solving captcha on faucet so that I can play on gambling. I later on become interested on blockchain and privacy as time passes by which makes me invest more rather than just waste it on gambling. I saw the future on blockchain which banks can’t do. I realized that banks make our life harder in terms of managing our finances and sending it to someone. Blockchain is the future money is what I’m thinking when I become a believer of Bitcoin.",

Why are you interested in investing in bitcoin?It's because of having a limited supply. The supply limit that it has is 21 million but as of now, its current supply in the economy is around or nearly 19.3M BTC.And the remaining other supply will have a long time before it reaches the max cap.Aside from that, the experience that I've got by investing in bitcoin has already proved me that having its features has the potential to move its value.I'll be having the payment for things that I want to buy with the use of bitcoin but only for selected shops and has an investment at the same time.",

There is a good chance that we could come up with a more free way to use fiat as well one day, and in many sci-fi future movies we have so many different currencies, why do you think when people make movies or write books about the future and get rid of the fiat we use today? Or even in the past, when you write a fantasy novel, why do we talk about silvers and golds? That is mainly because people all realize that the current system is open to corruption and bad management, hence why we need to find something else. I believe that I found that better thing with bitcoin, and even if it doesn't become a legal tender, it could be at least a blueprint for something much better.",

Before 2009, whatever you could think of, literally everything, if demand was risen, so would its supply. Food, stocks, gold, houses, everything; if people wanted more of that thing, it'd magically increase in supply.
