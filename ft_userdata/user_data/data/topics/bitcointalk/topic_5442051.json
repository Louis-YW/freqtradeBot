  "content": "Sitting here at home watching my alma matter Southern Illinois University (Salukis) face off against Missouri State in “Arch Madness” which is the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament. The winner of this game automatically gets a trip to the NCAA Tournament, and my Saukis haven’t gone in quite a few years so this game is stressful (pulled off the victory 54-51)Gearing up for the NCAA tournament and doing lots of gambling! I’m considering putting a pool together, so if anyone’s interested in participating, please let me know. If you’re unfamiliar with how that works, you simply pick the winner of each game all the way through to the championship game. There’s plenty of platforms that make doing this really easy, like Yahoo. Buy-in would be something small like .001BTCThis thread is also just to discuss the tournament that starts soon! ( Tuesday, March 14th )",

They had a lead of 12 points with 12min to play and led the whole game, then didn't score the final 5min. That's when they lost the lead and the game.Virginia falling to Furman was also a little surprising but not as big of an upset as Furman was only a 6 point underdog. Though, I didn't expect that to happen. Furman had a good season though.The ending was surely crazy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAAsaXX3GYo16 games down today and 2 upsets, the rest were mostly favourite wins and some wins of small handicap underdogs.Let's see what day 2 will have in store for us.",

Gonzaga down 13 at halftime, then comeback and led by 9 with 80 seconds to go. 12 seconds to go UCLA hits a 3 to get a miracle 76:75 lead just to get stung in the heart by a 3 from Gonzaga.This ending was really something else, that's why we love college basketball!",

But of course this just makes it more exciting!Gonzaga vs Uconn will be the most even game in the elite 8 with both teams having good chances to advance. In the other games I am hoping for some more upsets, wouldn't it be fun to see San Diego State or Miami FL in the Final four?Of course the biggest surprise would be if somehow Florida Atlantic could advance, there is still a decent chance of beating Kansas state for yet another big win, everything is possible.",

Again a testament to how well rounded this tournament really was.My teams certainly didn’t fare well this year, and my brackets crashed way early. Sooo, that wasn’t so fun.Looks like Yahoo won the pool challenge, congrats.",
