But its kinda hard to find dev that would be trusted enough not to fall in greed if this project succeeded. Most wanted to create their own project so likely your idea could be somehow implemented just join the team and pitch them what is on your mind.",

Like a member above already pointed out, it is very hard to find a trusted dev that will support the project through thick and thin, most usually get greedy from the first pump. If your idea of creating a new stablecoin are that great i hope you can find equally great dev that will support your idea 100%.Or you can find an incubator firm that will incubate your project and provide the right tools to support the growth.",

With the disaster of UST & $LUNA, people are worried and now more put trust into a stable coin like this. Because, In case this happen in their crypto pair then should be no problem to change the stable-coin into a real money fiat. Unless, the company is lie for the backup (not 100% backup with real money).",

Second, how it is a game changer? I mean it's just supposed to be pegged to USD.Maybe you can visit this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=12.0. Maybe someone will pick it up, but jus be careful and filter all applicants as they might be scammers though.",

The link is on their twitter page. Semilla means seed in spanish and the the discord is for incubating new projects and forming project teams.",
