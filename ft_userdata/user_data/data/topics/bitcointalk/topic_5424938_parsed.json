Because so far , I don't remember any controversy VAR decision in this World Cup and even the referees are doing a great job by keeping the games clean. Maybe next phase , we will bring more controversy to VAR but with next phases , we will have only top referees as well so I prefer to have a clean tournament when VAR is used only when is necessary.",

      "body": "So far, the VAR has been doing credibly well and are very fearful with their judgment due to some advanced technology being used by VAR officials which has made it very easy to make decisions as quickly as possible, and moreover, the referees have been officiating the matches well in this group stage, which I hope they will continue to do because it is a world tournament and FIFA are very strict with their rules.",

Because so far , I don't remember any controversy VAR decision in this World Cup and even the referees are doing a great job by keeping the games clean. Lets see some facts in the current World Cup that can be considered as debatable or controversy: 1. The ruled out goal by Ecuador in the opening match against Qatar. 2. Penalty given to Portugal against Ghana3. Penalty given to Argentina against Poland4. Ruled out goal by France (Griezman) against Tunisia. I think there are still some controversy/debatable decision due to VAR. In my honest opinion as what I've said few times about VAR, it kills the art of soccer game. Just simple example, a goal is ruled out because of offside for 1inch. I do even think that offside rules in soccer need to be revised.",

      "body": "So far in the matches played in the Qatar 2022 world cup matches. Following the drama on the pitch in the previous games, what can you understand as the weaknesses and strengths of VAR in the games played before? I would rate it very good considering yesterday in the Argentina game we wouldn't have had a penalty for them without VAR, a lot of people might disagree with the penalty but it was definitely a penalty for me because the Polish keeper clearly hit Messi. . . face and for me it is a violation. I think on many other occasions VAR has given awards that otherwise would not have been given in full until now I love VAR and before the World Cup started,",

But don't you think it's rather bias to rate it's performance by the very way you do cause it could also go against you in a way that isn't favourable , so would you still rate it fine and like the decision ?",

The penalty given to Argentina yesterday will have not been given to them if not for VAR.VAR is doing so much on football it helps the referee and FIFA officials to ease their pressure in decision making. It makes football free from match robbery,I will rate VAR very good",

      "body": "They certainly didn't do their job flawlessly. If the VAR intervenes, I think they should also make a decision on the spot what the referee should do. Now the referee is called aside and the referee has to make the decision himself. Wouldn't you make it much more logical if the VAR would also make the decision right away? Now the entire responsibility of the choice is placed on the umpire's shoes. But good decisions have also been made in themselves. Argentina's penalty yesterday was not a penalty, so that was strange. We are and will always be people who make mistakes.",

      "body": "VAR has been an integral part of football for the last five years. and, in fact we have discussed VAR in many threads. however, there is nothing wrong if we discuss VAR at this world cup in Qatar. and if I refer to the effectiveness of VAR in this world cup, it is clear that with VAR the world cup is much better and cleaner than the dramas that often occur on the football field. scandals such as match fixing and the like, can be wiped out with VAR technology.So far, VAR has made it easier for referees to make decisions when in doubt. and VAR, has worked as it should.at the world cup in Qatar, VAR received more attention from football fans. there was an incident that made some fans emotional because several goals were disallowed by the referee, but there were also those who benefited from VAR, including in our betting on this world cup. sometimes VAR is an advantage for us, for example in Tunisia and France matches. but there were also things that made us unprofitable, because several goals were annulled, such as the Argentina vs Saudi Arabia match.  but either way, the controversy will always remain.",
