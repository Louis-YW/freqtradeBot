      "body": "Thank you for sharing this information with us.QuoteThe new project will first develop two mining sites with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts (MW) of mining power, according to a press release. The sites will be powered by excess energy in Abu Dhabi, increasing the base load and sustainability of that Middle Eastern capital's power grid, the statement continued. The necessary mining equipment and infrastructure for each site has already been ordered and construction is currently underway.It's always interesting to see places using their excess electricity to power BTC mining.Especially given the current context, US laws and the rising price of kw/h in many places, we need more mining-friendly places to emerge. I imagine that if things get too complicated in the US, the hashrate will mostly redirect to Russia or Kazakhstan. I'm curious to see what other places I don't imagine now will host this hashrate.In the case of Abu Dhabi, I think I see that they have already ordered their ASICs, so it's not about hosting potential US ASICs. So I'm now waiting to see what real hashrate is going to come out of this infrastructure and to see what is the future there for the Bitcoin miners.",
