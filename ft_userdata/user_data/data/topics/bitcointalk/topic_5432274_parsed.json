I hope all my friends can explain to me,,?Firstly, welcome to the forum.Secondly, bitcoin itself is a form of crypto (since it uses encryption to verify transactions), there is nothing to differentiate here.Thirdly, I assume you were about to ask difference between bitcoin and altcoins, anything other than bitcoin is an alt (even usdt).",

I hope all my friends can explain to me,,?Crypto is the umbrella term for digital / micropayment currencies like Bitcoin and other altcoins, much like Fiat is the general term for all local currencies (Dollar, Naira, Cedis, etc.). And keep in mind that the cryptocurrency world is very risky, from storage to spending to investment; you should know what you are getting into before buying.Do not fall for quick money investments; there is no shortcut in the world of cryptocurrencies; you get what you pay for. Don't invest if something seems too good to be true.Edit:Quote from: Coin_trader on December 29, 2022, 01:28:26 PMSimply Bitcoin is a type of crypto currency.

Also you can read up the pinned message of the forum or even create different more thread in this section to ask about your other question thay bothers you since there are reputable member will share their knowledge about some things they know about crypto.",

Of course, throughout this time we had some upgrades that should have made Bitcoin more functional considering the fact that its user base has increased over the years from a few tens of people to several million.Everything else that appeared after tried to compete with Bitcoin in some way, whether it was about max coin supply, block size or forcing POS as some kind of \"better\" POW alternative. It's no secret that every altcoin that is based on POS, has x100 more max supply and it is premined can not be in the same category as Bitcoin.In other words, the only man who didn't ask for anything for himself and didn't get rich from his invention is Satoshi - everyone else did it for profit.",

And I’m confident that with these explanations, your question is answered. I just want to quickly point out that among all the numerous coins that is grouped as cryptocurrencies, bitcoin reigns supreme and should be what you should be focused on now. All other alternate coins are as risky as they come and is better left alone. While learning more about bitcoin, I think it’s noteworthy to stress the point that exchanges are never safe to keep and store your bitcoins.",

In fact it wouldn't exist for quite some time until people started creating modified copies of Bitcoin. That's when the need for a more general term arouse.Originally \"cryptocurrency\" was defined as a currency that exists on a decentralized network of computers. But there are many cryptocurrencies that are not decentralized, and yet no one is bothered by this fact, despite their centralization defeating the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. This is because most people in crypto community only come here for high risk high reward trading and not actually to use cryptocurrency.Crypto ecosystem is so toxic and useless that we might as well abandon it and say that Bitcoin is what Satoshi described it - a peer to peer digital currency.",

Many Bitcoin supporters don't want Bitcoin to be lumped together with the rest of what are called cryptocurrencies primarily because they aren't the kind of coins that Bitcoin is.
