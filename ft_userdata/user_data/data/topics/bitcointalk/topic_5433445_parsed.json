Unfortunately, scammers use various techniques to try to position themselves at the top of the search, and it's not just through ads anymore - because all these phishing sites have nothing to do with that and we see them as normal search results.I advise everyone to save a legitimate website in their favorites, and also to be aware that mix only works with an onion address, so all sites that offer you mix through clearnet addresses are 100% fake.

I did not find the real chip mixer site on the first few search results sites by google. That is indeed strange.Secondly what i notice that usually scams clone sites appear in the ads search, but this time it is showing scam chip mixer not as an ad, but as a real site. How is that possible? Does it mean that the scam site has done a better SEO to be on the top?",

Something has definitely changed in the way Google handles everything that is reported, and it has to do something with mixers. I think I already wrote it somewhere, but it seems that they don't want to protect people from such things and that in this way they want to create as much pressure as possible on the mixers in terms of their elimination.",
