  "content": "Tim Draper predicts bitcoin will reach $250,000 next year despite FTX collapse: ‘The dam is about to break’ source:[/font]https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/05/tim-draper-predicts-bitcoin-will-reach-250000-despite-ftx-collapse.htmli] KEY POINTS [/i]1> Draper previously predicted that bitcoin would top $250,000 by the end of 2022.2> He told CNBC that $250,000 “is still my number” despite the digital coin’s more than 60% drop this year.3>The venture capitalist is extending his prediction by six months.There has been series of speculations from different angles throughout this year about the price of bitcoin rising. As we were approaching the year 2022 many persons speculated february as the period from when the boom rise in price will take place, others claimed middle of the year while some speculated it to take place around the end of the year but from all indications bitcoin price at different intervals defeated these speculations with a different outcome.And now here, we have a veteran capitalist Tim Draper who strongly believe bitcoin will hit $250,000 by the middle of 2023 despite how wounded the industry has been for many persons recently with it falling price. What really caught my attention about Draper prediction is that he ones made such kind of prediction in 2014 about bitcoin rising to $10,000 in the next three years of which bitcoin took flight to about $20,000 in 2017, and now same man has come up with another prediction just like in 2014. But contrary to Draper's prediction, another renowned investor in the industry, Mark Mobius in an interview with CNBC  he claimed bitcoin could crash to $10,000 next year. And this was same man that well speculated the drop of bitcoin to $20,000 this year, of which we saw how bitcoin price did turned out.After going through the article I got perplexed at a point on which side of the divide to pair my thought with, could it be that this is just another mind game these men are pulling  for the approaching year. Cause for me I think both predictions could affect and drive confusion into the minds of other average traders/investors based on the underlying fact that this two men have made predictions in the past about bitcoin price and the results of their prediction's we're in line as given.",

I don't really bug my mind when I read these men try to predict the price of bitcoin or forecast on it because they always want to favour themselves. What do you think will happen if investors believe in the price he predicted according to him? Investors will rush in and the price will start to appreciate and what and what they have will also start increasing, then we will forcefully leave the bear to bull to emergency ATH. These are all strategies to hit the market into green is normal for the whales.",

He is just trying very hard to be in the news. Bitcoin can not get to that now and even in the next 5 years. I know most people will not like me saying this but that is the truth. Like palle11 said I do not think or bother myself with such news because they do not work out.",

I strongly believe this are only two things which occurs with the market and is very technical for you to air out about the falling or the rising and if the market probably went the way you predicted doesn't mean you are an expert or professional, and other may air out as well predict if the market went against their predictions doesn't mean they knew it all. So if you would invest i will advise you to stay away from crypto news because they more deceitful. Just have it in mind as something natural and constant with crypto market.",

Winners might make predictions but they won't bet. They wait for real things on market and will follow their original plans if predictions are correct. Else they will switch to plan B. In both Plan A and Plan B, they always have plan to stay outside or exit the market.If market is in bottom, there are people who believe it is bottom and buy in. There are opposite people who will reject to join.Same for market at top area, there are people who take profit but others will wait for higher highs who will likely sell or be liquidated along market to bottom.",

The early predictors who were lucky to get price to get close to there predictions feel they are experts already. One thing is crypto currency is volatile and kind of a bet like football matches even sure odds lose some games.But new investors are always looking for who to give them go ahead to invest. This has lead to to many investors investing in ICO of shit coins. The only true prediction is investing with a mindset of losing your money or rather invest when it feels low to you",

You are thinking too much about this, they are not playing mind games with you or trying to manipulate investors, you could show a current chart of the daily movements of bitcoin to 100 different traders and each one of them will use 100 different methods to predict what it will happen next, in fact if we actually did the experiment I would be surprised if there were two people which gave you the exact same prediction, so it is natural that people have different views about what is coming for the market during the next years.",
