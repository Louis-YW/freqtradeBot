Well, in fact, taking into account the growth of the hashrate of the bitcoin network, which has already reached 314.6 EH/s, your Asic has 1/2860000 of the total hashrate of the bitcoin network, therefore your miner has a chance the miner has a 0.000035% chance of finding a block that he will statistically catch one block out of every 2860000 blocks or 19,861 days, which is 54.4 years, this is without taking into account your luck, of course.",

With luck, it will bring a good bonus.If you don’t want trouble from the electricity supplier (who will sooner or later discover a 3000W leak), then why not connect your mining power to a common pool. This will bring even a smaller, but guaranteed income and without unnecessary problems.If you are ready to try-your-luck journey, then what are you waiting for? Just do it.",

If you have a business and the given amount is good, it is of course good and in your favor, dude.

Unless you are an electrical Engr. what is said may be true but if not. I don't know.

And if they notice a continuous 3000W going to your place, they may not like it.If you walk into a coffee shop and they don't charge you for the cup of coffee you drink then it's free as far as you are concerned, just because someone else pays for it doesn't change the fact, the same thing is true if you are forced by the law to walk into that coffee shop and pay 1$ per entry whether or not you drink the coffee or not.In many places around the world,  essentials like electricity are subsidized by the government, yes the government is using your money to subsidize the electricity, but you can't ask them to give you that money in cash or give you apples instead.Even in some \"modernized\" countries where power is not subsidized, some people pay for fixed contracts, say the minimum is 1000kWh and your house uses only half of that, you can't just buy 500kWh, so you are forced to get 1000kWh, the otherwise wasted 500kWh falls safely under the term \"free\".OP, no hashrate is ever enough for solo mining, just like no amount of money is enough to buy you enough lottery tickets to guarantee a win ( unless you buy all the tickets which don't make you win anything anyway).With 110Th and assuming both price and difficulty will not change, you can easily earn $250 a month mining to a PPS/PPLNS pool, in 10-12 months you will ROI the mining gear and enjoy a stable almost guaranteed income of $250, makes a lot more sense than solo mining, if you insist on trying your luck, go ahead, you might as well just hit a block, but you need to be aware of the fact that it's extremely unlikely for that to happen, you need to be freaking lucky to hit a block with that hashrate.",

When the halving will happen only one thing is for sure, the reward will drop from 6.25 to 3.125.Nobody knows what the difficulty will be and how it will react, but normally you would expect the difficulty to actually drop since there is less reward in mining, the revue drops also by half so some miners won't be that happy to mine anymore if instead of 10$ revenue with 6$ costs, you have 5$ revenue with $6 costs. It will depend a lot on what the prices are at that time and if even halving the profit margins would be enough to keep miners running.But! for sure it won't mean the difficulty will double overnight!As for the other free electricity issue, I knew I saw OP on another topic, so this is the \"free\" electricity some of you were curious aboutQuote from: Outhue on January 14, 2023, 06:58:59 AM@Charles-Tim 50% of my electricity fee per day is free because I have solar panels installed, mining from 9am to 6pm is 100 percent guaranteed, the rest will be on grid power.
