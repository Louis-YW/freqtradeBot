  "content": "Argentine journalist Santiago Montag has come to Bangladesh for the first time. Montag has come to this country to watch the frenzy of Bangladesh over the football final. Montag, a geography student, however, already knew about Bangladesh. Even though he has come so far to watch his country play, he doesn't feel like he is outside of Argentina. He said that he was surprised to see Argentine football fans from all over the country.This freelance journalist came to Bangladesh from India. Montag said, \"Hopefully, they will prove that Argentina is the best football team in the world.\" And in this special moment, as an Argentine, I will take a different experience from Bangladesh. Montag said that he liked eating hilsa fish of Bangladesh.Montag will watch the game tonight in Dhaka University area. He hopes the experience there will be different. Montag was too young to win the World Cup under Maradona. He could not enjoy the frenzy of the title much. So after winning the World Cup in Messi's hands, he wants to repay that madness.",
