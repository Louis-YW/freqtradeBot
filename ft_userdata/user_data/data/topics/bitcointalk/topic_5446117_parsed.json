But the problem for me is that anytime I think about paying with BTC I feel somehow uncomfortable. I always remember the guy who spent 30+ bitcoins on pizza and now these bitcoins are worth a fortune. Like I don't want to be this guy and pay with an asset that WILL go up in price. It feels like you paying more for the product from a future perspective. What are your thoughts about this? Personally, I usually try to buy with stablecoins if I have some, it just feels more natural for me. I don't want to touch my BTC while the market is still bad.",

I think you're refer to Laszlo Hanyecz where he spend 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizza and he was not disappointed for doing it, so why you should care with it?It's your choice if you want to pay with BTC or not, but I believe there's a time where you will convert your Bitcoin to cash because you will need that money in the future, you can't just hold it and not enjoy what you've accumulated so long.",

You feel uncomfortable right?I also look back at the context of the story you mentioned and we can't make a fair comparison here at the moment. Convenience in use takes precedence, we can hear btc is accepted for payment for some business, and that's great for the practical demonstration of how convenient BTC is. But as more and more people see it as a big asset, it's really inconvenient to trade small and up. So there is no need to force yourself into those frameworks, just do whatever we think there is no barrier here, and for me instead of paying btc directly, replacing it with other crypto also helps push into BTC development.",

First of all, the person you mentioned is Laszlo, he didn't spend 30+ for a pizza, but 10,000 for 2 pizzas. And the second is, you create a topic, you ask and you've answered it in the same place. If you don't want to pay for something with Bitcoin (BTC) because you don't want to be unlucky like Laszlo who doesn't realize the real value of Bitcoin, well, like you said, use stablecoins. So why else ask about it?",

Bitcoin has moved away from its original concept of Internet money and has become an investment vehicle. It is wiser to spend cash or stablecoins (than btc), which are not profitable to store due to their depreciation.You are talking about your case, but there are people who store bitcoin for a long time and they have already received their profit, which means they are already winning, and why shouldn't they pay for purchases using btc? Don't wait for them to infinity rise in price of this asset. I believe that there may be enough such people and they can afford to pay bitcoin without worrying about future price increases.",

Spending it at that time will never be an issue, you can as well replenish back your coin when it's becoming bullish again.",

Why not just use fiat instead if you prefer stablecoins for payment?Regarding your question, I felt like you at the beginning when I just started paying stuff with bitcoin as I always had it in back of my head that I might overpay something when bitcoin goes up but after some time I simply start thinking it that way and spending bitcoin when I need to. I will try to avoid big purchases though when bitcoin is down a lot (for example few months ago when it was ~16k) and will use bitcoin for cheaper stuff like VPN or IPTV monthly sub and wait for better times (like now) to start spending.",

To be able to pay something, you must not use all money to invest in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.I know you can love Bitcoin or cryptocurrency but you must have good management for your finance. If you don't have any stable coin or fiat currency, but all of your fund is in Bitcoin, cryptocurrency you will have to sell them when you need money for payment. You can sell them to stable coin or fiat currency and because you don't have any choice, you might have to sell at lost price.With all de-pegs, bank runs, bankruptcy related to some stable coins, it is safer to store part of your fund in fiat currency, not in stable coin.",

You feel as if you are wasting something you would have invested. That's the feeling of a true investor mate. If you have other means of paying for your goods, why paying with Bitcoin? Â The best decision is to have two wallets. One should be used for hodling your coins while you can use the other for paying for your purchases. But sometimes there is this sense of pride when you pay with bitcoin, the feeling of freedom and independence from bank and government controls.
