The whole point of the current block size limit is to allow people to have the full blockchain on their computers without making a significant investment into storage. If there's a low barrier for running a full node, then the network will have a huge number of nodes, which is good for decentralization and security. There's no point in predicting blockchain size many years away from now, because it will depend on the state of storage technology. If there will be some sort of revolution in this field and average people would own drives with hundreds of terrabytes, you can expect the devs to raise the block size limit to slightly improve network capacity.",

You can just use a pruned wallet.Far as I know, a pruned node is helpful if you really want to make disk space economy but does not help you much if you want to run your own Block Explorer or gather all sorts of information from the Bitcoin Blockchain.  While both are still verified and safe, a Full Node is like the complete version of the Blockchain.  You have it all right on your computer and you can make use of it if necessary.I do not remember honestly but I think you can not use a pruned node to import a new wallet and sync it up.  I think you will need to go through the entire Blockchain again for that.Moreover.  You are going to help the Bitcoin network by running a Full Node.  You will gather block information, but you will also provide others yours.  This is how the Decentralized Peer to Peer thingy works.-Regards,PrivacyG",

In fact, a pruned node can update an old wallet, as long as the data goes back to the last time the wallet was connected.

Here's another fact: my full node uploads 28 times more than it downloads. When I ran a pruned node that was allowed to upload, it still uploaded more than it downloaded. Many people run Bitcoin Core without uploading, and after their initial sync, those people can get all the blocks they need from a pruned node.Quotedo you think a bittorrent system of mvie files would sustain and work well if majority of users only keep the credits final 5 minutes.Bittorrent doesn't need updates every few minutes, this comparison makes no sense. But if there's a TV-series with 200 episodes, you'll find there are more seeders for the last episode than for the first episode. And that's fine, because there are also more downloaders for the last episode. So maybe your comparison makes sense after all, just not in the way you intended.Quoteif you are not decentralising the blockchain by archiving the blockchain your not supporting the networkI'm supporting the network just fine:Code:{  \"totalbytesrecv\": 90994820791,  \"totalbytessent\": 2597366605245,  \"timemillis\": 1669451854985,  \"uploadtarget\": {    \"timeframe\": 86400,    \"target\": 524288000000,    \"target_reached\": false,    \"serve_historical_blocks\": true,    \"bytes_left_in_cycle\": 515675185681,    \"time_left_in_cycle\": 24522  }}By now I've uploaded much more than I've ever downloaded.Quoteif majority of the network is pruned. there is only a minority of the network seeding the blockchain. meaning more centralised, less distributedEach pruned node still verifies all the blocks, and from the network's perspective, a full node that isn't uploading still contributes less than a pruned node that uploads the latest blocks.Quoteimagine the bandwidth demand increase by new users who can only get initial block download from low minority.I have never experienced any bandwidth shortage. When I'm downloading, it downloads as fast as my system can handle. And when I'm uploading, only 0.028 of the allocated 0.5 TB per day gets used.Quotethat low minority then has bandwidth bottlenecks which means everyone leaching from them get slower IBD time. meaning more delays and cries that \"it takes too long\"Most cries come from their own hardware limitations.Quoteif all you care about is relaying latest tx or latest height blocks.. you are not looking to be a full node. you can be hapy with a light nodeOr you can be happy with a pruned node.
