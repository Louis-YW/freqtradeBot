You need capital to have more room to stay in the game cause trades will not always go in your favour no matter how skilled you are.Gambling is a huge part of investing and growing wealth.",

In essence, we have to live frugally and set aside money. The best way is to increase our monthly income so that we don't need to be too frugal because income is greater than expenses. However, in practice it is not easy, but it can be done. Youth needs to be utilized because the energy and mind are still strong enough to think about many things",

When you've been earning a lot of money and you invest it in many things but you're no good in management, you'll be torn apart and that's for real and no joke. While I do agree with what you've said, there are those people that can't retain what they're able to acquire and that's giving them the toughest lesson of their lives.Because many that were able to accumulate wealth that came from nothing into something, don't know what to do and how to maintain it. Thus, they spend it in luxurious things that aren't income generating because the justification is that they deserve it. It's no problem and someone truly deserve it after hard work but don't put all that you have got in it.",

If I was living in the 1960s I would have done all of these things but nowadays you have to take into account that the liberal system puts you in debt to get rich. Debt is not something to be afraid of and when used correctly it can make you rich. We are living in a time of increasing inflation in the world and saving money may not be wise.If you want to invest in this situation, the most sensible thing to do is to invest with debt or credit. However, you need to be careful when doing so. If you don't make the right moves, the debt or loan you take can also drag you into the depths of misery.",

You sound like a business coach or a motivational speaker with a misplaced priority.What tone of wealth will anyone build using $50 as start-up capital in this harsh economic dispensation and the crazy side of it is that you're talking about a real estate business for such meager amount that can't pay one worker salary in real estate management companies. You just don't compare real estate investment to gambling, no  you don't do that. They are two different world apart, gambling is never an investment source and still not, so cut the crap and come back when you have something perfect for us to examine not this collateral junk.",

And for someone wanting to be wealthy, money management starts from the little you earn or have first before money management for when you start earning bigger amounts. Money management involves how to manage what you have so you can have enough for investing, because it is from having proper investments that wealth comes. So I support the statement you have made that if you cannot build wealth with small money, you will not do it with big money.",

Most of the wealthy people you see today are the ones that inherited their wealth from their parents. This generation has the ability to make money, but the ability to multiply that money is where the problem lies. In order to have a generational wealth there should be able to have a consistent kind of investment over the years. This will no doubt open the door of generational wealth. When it is time for investment, invest only in things that you will not likely lose your money. Money is hard to earn but easy to lose. Avoid any kind of investment that will make you to lose money and and curtail your expenses. This is the way to building wealth.",

Starting with $50 is not the same as starting with $5K and let me remind you that chances of withdrawing any profits you made from $50 will take months but with $50 it's going to be in seconds and the next big thing is withdrawal fees on exchanges so more money you withdraw the fee will become negligible and with your 50 dollars it is going to eat your capital in two withdrawal alone.Building wealth or winning the lottery but it all ends up with the money on our hands so if you succeed with doing it even once then why not another time?",
