The mining pool is open to everyone as well as to external miners, and an API link has been implemented to connect to the 3DPass network directly.The mining pool has a restriction of 10% per mining pool of the overall network. In other words, if someone exceeds 10%, anything above 10% will go to the treasury. This approach ensures that the 3DPass network remains decentralized and secure, while also incentivizing many miners to contribute to the community. The founder of the project Paul has shared some bad experiences with his previous project with no restrictions/penalties implemented. Some big name mining companies joining and no-one was able to mine a block for years.Here are some of the benefits of joining the new mining pool:Easy setup and configuration as detailed on www.3DPass.org and discordAccess to a supportive community of 3DPass minersThis is currently in the testnet phase so you're very earlyThe project provides actual real life use cases, check the ANN thread for more detailsÂ  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382009.0And much more!To get started, simply follow these steps:Visit https://3dpass.org/ and go to the test section under the Mainnet header and follow the instructions to set up a node. For setting up the miner go on discord on the testnet section.If you have a reasonable confidence through the registrar you can set up your own mining pool!Start mining!",
