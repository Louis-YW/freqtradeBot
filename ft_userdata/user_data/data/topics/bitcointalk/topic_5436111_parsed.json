If it was from your end, and you had done the homework (analysis) on your own, then I would ask you to explain your method and after that, compare it to mine in order to get the best result and get a prediction on how it should be. YouTube is a free platform and people are sharing their own thoughts. So never expect it to go smooth all the time. DYOR and make sure that you can depend on it. If you can, avoid these free services at all cost. Newbies fall for these kinds of traps and make trades based on this. And for that reason, they make losses while those spreading these news making profits, doing the opposite. And you can confirm that by listening to what the YouTubers are saying. They will always give you one prediction and then say that it might go the other way. So they can keep their hands clean and manipulate you. Honestly saying, try to avoid this. Sharpen your skills, try to do it on your own.",

Whatever it is, I‚Äôm pretty sure most of the trader here also know where the market is heading. If BTC goes down to level of $19k again and breaks it, most probably we will see the real bottom of this bear market and the worst analysis is that the price of BTC will fall into $10k level again, which many believes that it will happen if the worst support goes break.",

Haha, I dont think OP is that much of a high level person to run a p&d channel. He is just a small fish like the rest of us. And few famous youtubers (like mmcrypto and carlthemoon) should be already arrested if that was the case. But I like your style of thinking, make no video about price analysis for bitcoin since all of them flip flop everyday, nonsense üòÅ",

The video is 8:33 long and has about 1.2k views. Just imagine how much revenue the account owner will get. We are not uncomfortable with trying to calculate the revenue figures that will be obtained, but what if there are parties who dispute or there are parties who dare to challenge the truth of the content discussed in the video.",

This Scenario is the best possible outcome for Bitcoin price. Myself have a more rooted fear from a macro perspective... Many people don't like red market analysis which is understandable as many are Hodlers, But as speculation goes it is wise to see what the Bulls has got going for them and at the same time understand the Bear's case. There is a death cross on the weekly about to complete which forms the decisive resistance at 24500 to 25000 region. The pull back will come but the question will be how severe, a higher low will have us chasing higher targets of btc price, but a lower low (if the rejection was severe) will mean 10k or below.This link shows a picture of what I'm trying to point out https://twitter.com/Maxtwo10/status/1617915731865370625?t=B2lCeoclmaVGBO-XbUxqiQ&s=19 . also note how the weekly candles is getting smaller as it exhausts into the resistance. All that being said I prefer we bounce to the upside.It seems the dump has commenced already, many traders I think will be trapped on the buy side as they wait for a bounce that may never come. The DXY dollar index is currently sitting on a support after a significant drop, very likely dollar will strengthen from hence.",

Spot on, this is exactly what the so-called expert traders on YouTube and Twitter do. In fact, I no longer waste my time watching their videos. Most of the time they are emphasizing viewers to subscribe and like their videos or even sign up through their referral links of different exchanges.The whole point is to just grow the viewership of the channel so that they can earn from it rather than the trading which they claim to be knowing",
