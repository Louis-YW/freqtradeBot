  "content": "I tried to send bitcoin through coinbase.com and they would not allow the transfer to an online news agency bitcoin address.About a week or so later I got an Email and Coinbase made me fill out a form about why I was trying to send bitcoin to this address. It was for $5 dollars worth.I later learned that this news agency was sanctioned by USA and it was under Russian disinformation website. I had no idea as I thought it was just a news website that offered an alternative perspective than what the USA media is telling us about the war. I mean who would have thought the USA government would sanction news right? Coinbase made me fill out a bunch of questions about why I was sending $5 bitcoin here, even though it never got sent. They asked the reasons and how I was affiliated with this organization. They said it was their due diligence or something, even though the bitcoin never got sent on coinbase.comKind of pissed they made me fill this out and I had no choice because they threatened to ban my account.I did actually send bitcoin to this Russian organization with my mobile coinbase wallet as they did not block me sending bitcoin to this bitcoin address with the mobile wallet. My question is, does coinbase know and keep track of who I am sending bitcoin to with the mobile coinbase wallet? Should I consider another wallet?Thanks",

Electrum is currently considered the best open source software wallet today, in addition to the desktop version, there is also an android version that you can replace your coinbase wallet. My only regret is that the electrum wallet still doesn't have an IOS version.",

Exchanges are worst than banks sometimes. I think Coinbase will red list you now and maybe sending informations about you to CIA or another american intelligence agency. If I were you, I would send my BTC from Coinbase to a blender before putting them in a truly non custodial and independent wallet to avoid being blockchain tracked by an agency.",

The reason for this is that when you withdraw from the platform, the money comes from their hot wallet, which means that the source of the money is Coinbase and therefore they will not risk causing problems with United State.So if you want the freedom to send, use any well reviewed open source wallet and run a full node.",

The solution is, to not use them!You are right that using a hardware wallet is a great solution, especially if having a huge amount of bitcoin or other coins, hardware wallet is what to go for. But OP indicated both coinbase.com and the Coinbase noncustodial wallet, indicating the cons of Coinbase.com why asking if Coinbase noncustodial wallet can be a good alternative. We all know how both are not recommendable because one is a custodial wallet just like you meant while the other makes its users to lack privacy.Quote from: Darker45 on August 19, 2022, 02:11:00 AMYour mobile Coinbase wallet is noncustodial, which means Coinbase cannot block your transaction.

A self-custody wallet doesn't ask for any KYC information. But this does not mean the Coinbase noncustodial wallet is recommendable, in fact, it is not. It gives full control but no privacy and also encouraging people to make use of online cloud for seed phrase storage, it is not an open source wallet.Quote from: hugeblack on August 19, 2022, 07:29:02 AMSo if you want the freedom to send, use any well reviewed open source wallet and run a full node.Yes, especially for privacy reasons, it is best to use a full node wallet.

People have been already advised not to use these centralised exchange and wallet service as they have control over your funds and will make you feel like culprit who is sending money in an illegal way so don't use it and instead opt for other good non custodial wallets like Electrum and transfer fund easily.Coinbase has the anti-privacy reputation in the market like restricting users from making transfer, asking for all these documents and freezing some accounts with no proper information so what else do you expect from them? In the SEC filings they stated in case of any insolvency the user funds will be treated as product investment to pay off the debts so it's their money indirectly which you have deposited over with them.Take it out as soon you can to be on safe side otherwise your funds will be gone and your data leak issue still remains at high risk.",

Trustwallet is fine in my opinion base on the time I am using it and also my experience using it plus it is also a noncustodial wallet but one thing that many people doesn't like because Trustwallet is a close source that will make the one who use Trustwallet think who might have the private key or mnemonic phrase of the wallet. It's already more than a year since I am using Trustwallet but the way I use it is to receive and send right away instead of receiving and storing btc. So far, I didn't notice anything that someone have access to the wallet or a transaction happen without my knowledge.",
