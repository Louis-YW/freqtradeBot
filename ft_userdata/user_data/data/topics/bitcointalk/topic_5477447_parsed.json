  "content": "Hello everyone,I am new to this forum and I think it is very important that we have this topic on this section. Lot of betting sintes like BC.game, Rollbit.com, Betfury.com, Coins.game, and bunch of others use same sportsbook provider - Betby. I don't know if you noticed this earlier in the Scam Accusations section, but there are too many accusations against casinos for voided winning sports bets after the match is over and the outcome is known. In the last month or two I have read dozens of such accusations. In the end, the casinos washed away the blame from themselves, and replied that the bet was canceled by the sportsbook provider. The reason? The reason is the wrong odds. Which is absolutely false, and absolutely very easy to check that this was not the reason in almost any case.Unfortunately, I am opening this topic after the same situation happened to me today on the Coins.game website. Below is a screenshot of a voided bet after the match was over and the outcome was known.ScreenshotScreenshot2It's a bit unbelievable to me and I refuse that someone is doing this in 2023, literally giving themselves the right to cancel every winning bet, which of course they wouldn't do if the bet was losing. After this, I don't see the point of betting on sites with this provider, I don't see how you can make any profit if they have the right to cancel every winning bet.My strategy in sports betting is to find value bets, which was the case with that bet today that was voided after the match ended and my team won 1-0. I placed it at odds of 1.83, the odds before the kick-off were 1.40. An obvious value that the aforementioned provider obviously didn't like. Or do you have a better explanation?I'm interested in your opinion on all this? It is quite easy to find other cases in Scam Accusations where people have had their bets voided after the outcome of the match was known and with much higher stakes, I remember one user had an NFL bet.Once again, in my opinion this is really creepy stuff, completely unacceptable when it comes to sports betting and casinos in general. After what happened to me today, I am sure that I will not open an account with this bookie who use this provider anywhere else. Please, don't get me wrong, by opening this topic, my goal is not to get a bad reputation for anyone, but only to exchange opinions and experiences.",

I didn't mind actually since I was betting more than a dozen matches with small amounts and then betting on the game as they are live. The odds constantly changed that sometimes I kept pushing the button just to go through and then later they voided my bet. It could have been a win but can't complain. I'm not aware what their terms with the sportsbook providers but despite them owning the casino, they are not in control of it especially when it comes to the odds that changes every second.",

As a sportsbook provider, you have your own risks. Just like any other job. As I said above in the previous post, you will always have some players who will take your money. In the case of sports betting, these are value-bet players, for example. Some are successful, some less successful. You have different ways to fight them, one of those ways is not to accept his bet. Simple. No one is forcing you to accept his bet.But if you accepted a bet, it carries its own risks for you. The bet can be a winner, right? But to equate fraudulent betting with value betting is ridiculous to say the least. Then the best thing for you is to write a rule and allow only losing bets on your platform. If he wins by any chance? Cancel it. That way, you have absolutely no risk as a sportsbook provider. All customers just lose. Funny, isn't it?Of course, something like this is unimaginable at regular, land-based betting shops. You can't label someone as a fraud just because he placed a value bet. It's just fascinating to me how they, Betby, don't see a problem with that.If you don't want to your customers place bets on certain competitions, say low-market competitions. Then why do you offer it? Why don't you just leave the Premier League, NBA, Bundesliga, NFL, Ligue 1 and all those big-market competitions. You are the safest there, no one will placed value bets there. And in case someone wins a large amount there, you can always cancel his bet, just say that the odds were wrong, even though it is obvious and easy to check that they were not.The most fascinating thing to me is that there are users on this forum who know a little about sports betting and see nothing wrong with this. I guess the whole point of sports betting is that someone can win some money. If he spotted a value bet in any competition, placed a bet before some important news from that team, he is guilty?

      "body": "@LEVSKI7 Of course, it all depends on what the regulation is. In fact, I don't find it so controversial to cancel a bet where there is an obvious error in the odds. Of course, it should be clear what the error is in the odds. It is not a error if you offer 1.83 and other places offer 5-10% less/more. We are talking about obvious mistakes, where they odds are reversed in relation to the teams and the like.For example, in Italy, sports-betting regulation is at a fairly high level, and the rule is that all bets placed must be paid. There have been cases where bettors placed good amounts for obvious mistakes, for example odds were mistakenly switched in live. Instead of 1.20 on home they offered that on away win, and people played 5.00 on home win. There were situations when people placed bets in a match where a goal had already been scored, but the scout did not made an input of goal at the match or there was some technical error. So, we are talking about situations where people placed on the wrong odds 20.00-30.00. And all bets stand. Rules are rules.But these guys from Betby void a good majority of winning bets, and it's not about the odds being wrong. It's just because you won. That's the problem, they will cancel whatever they want. So, they have their own interpretation of what value-bets and the like are, and accordingly they have given themselves the right to cancel everything that suits them - even though the match is already over and the result is known. So, there is no point in posting Scam Accusations against the casino anymore, when it is mostly about a canceled bet by Betby. And quite a large number of casinos use their feed. I really have no words to describe this crime these people are doing, I doubt that the bookies in Runda, Zimambwe and Burundi are doing something like that, with all due respect.",

If you win, you have to wait days for them to settle your winning bets. Just awful and I already made complaint to MGA which license they have",

      "body": "Completely agree with the OP's statement and reason behind opening this thread.I myself have had ATLEAST 5-6k USD of winnings CONFISCATED and scammed out of my balance because of this supposed \"wrong odds\" policy that BetBy keeps abusing.It doesn't matter what you bet , they can void WHATEVER betslip they feel like it , WHENEVER they feel like it simply as their terms state \"if the sportsbook deems the odds wrong , then the betslips are refunded\" ,and they don't even have to bother explaining or proving what this \"odd wrongs\" even means.If bet365 has the same odds as BetBy at the time of you placing your bet , then the odds are \"correct\"?Of course not , no matter if bet365 and rest bookies have 2.00 odd for your over 2.5 when you placed the bet on BetBY at 1.95 , they can and will void the betslip if they want to ,no questions asked.Of course they wait for the betslip to be won and then they VOID ,and in my experience with this provider (over 500-600 bets I have never ever had a lost betslip voided due to the same reason.)Personally I gave up on this scam provider and I am simply waiting for some other provider to replace them at some point after all these scam reports and issues with this oddsprovider.Sadly they seem to dominate the crypto sportsbetting era at the moment for whatever reason I am not aware of.The gamblers that are using them to bet Liverpool win on 1.60 odds in Premier League are just too many I guess ,but sooner or later some lawsuit will come to their license regulator about this \"voided betslips due to wrong odds according to OUR SPORTSBOOK PROVIDER\" and certainly things will change.We just have to wait it out and then dance on this provider's grave.Thank you to the OP for pointing out the continuous scam methods of this provider used by the \"well-known\" casinos here like FJ ,Rollbit ,betpanda and many others.",
