  "content": "BitMagge, a very ordinary new crypto marketplace, with ordinary features.I hereby announce, I am launching a crypto exchange website under the name BitMagge, I know what you're thinking, and it's unavoidable... it's based on trust. I really want to run a crypto market, for now this is all I can give.. in the future there will be some feature customization but I can't give an exact date when this will be completed, BitMagge has confirmed that it is stable to use.BitMagge will focus on supporting the launch of new blockchain projects by providing a temporary marketplace for the project until the time when the new blockchain project has a better market. For new blockchain developers who have just launched a project, please contact me at the following email: listing@bitmagge.com It's free, we accept donations.Any exchange on BitMagge will incur a 0.0% fee for maker & taker on each trades. For withdrawal fees, please read this page for more details: https://info.bitmagge.com/coin-infoYou have every right to ridicule my actions, but I will continue my desire to run a crypto trading website with passion, I hope you can provide input rather than ridicule.Because I understand the form of running this business will require a very large capital, I present a Token from BitMagge called BitMagge Token (BTMT), This token can be purchased via: https://www.bitmagge.com/trading/btmttrxFull Name : BitMagge TokenTicker : BTMTDecimal : 8Chain : TronMax Supply : 1.000.000 BTMT (100%)Your BitMagge Token (BTMT) reflects how much you own the BitMagge project.Assume that 1 BTMT is 1 BitMagge Share. Every individual who owns BTMT is entitled to share the profits from Trading Fees which are accumulated every month based on the number of shares owned.35% of BitMagge's earnings will be kept as a financial reserve to improve services, and 65% will be distributed to shareholders.My vision as the owner of BitMagge is to provide a crypto exchange where we don't just look at big projects, but help small projects grow so that we can all achieve our goals.Website : https://www.bitmagge.comTrading Fees : http://info.bitmagge.com/trading-feeCoin Information & Fees : http://info.bitmagge.com/coin-infoApi Documentation : https://docs.bitmagge.comFree Tron (TRX) : https://claim.bitmagge.comTwitter : https://twitter.com/BitMaggeTelegram : https://t.me/bitmagge (Channel) & https://t.me/bitmaggeglobal (Group)Discord : https://discord.gg/HzJHhx2F8xTHANK FOR THE GREAT WORKPEATIO - OPENWARE",

Crypto exchange can't be run as a hobby.I'm not even sure what advice would be best. should you get an honest one, which you probably won't like, or should we praise you and give you support? in the end, you will be wasting your time and your energy. So, good luck with this, you'll need it.",

      "body": "It's a positive thing that the withdrawal fees are low. When I say low, I mean compared to other centralized exchanges. 0.0001 BTC is better then what many other platforms are offering. But if you want to get your business up and running, you have to be willing to offer something better and cheaper than the big players. But one question: why does your info page say that BitMagge is a decentralized exchange?QuoteBitMagge is a decentralized website-based cryptocurrency trading platform covering Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Tron and USDT trading. https://info.bitmagge.com/One more thing. Your OP mentions 0.2% as maker & taker fees. However, according to the trading fee section, there is no mention of this. The source shows that the lowest level is MEMBER and all the fees are displayed as 0%.Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 23, 2022, 07:45:39 PMActually you may have a chance since there are plenty of shitcoins desperate to get listed somewhere.. anywhere. True, but people will mostly look to dump their bags on someone. With no liquidity, I don't see it as a viable business model.",
