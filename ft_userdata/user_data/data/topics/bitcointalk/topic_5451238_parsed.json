I honestly don't know about the future but it will most likely pump again some day as the history of the charts show (if there's still development and community). But as i don't have a clue what could trigger that pump i don't either have a clue when that would be. Could be years from now so i won't risk a penny for it. Micro marketcap is tempting though.",

Still thinking bout getting more of a bag.does anyone hold xdn?I also have XDN which I bought in 2018 then on Bittrex and I still have it stored there because it is no longer worth I have no intention of withdrawing it. Luckily I only spent $50 at that time, the current price is far from what I bought it for. The Twitter activity of XDN does not provide any important information, only a shill to buy XDN. From this we will see that XDN is nearing its end, volume that just leaves below USD 1000 indicates no interest anymore. The XDN thread on this forum doesn't have any updates, so maybe we should forget about it.",
