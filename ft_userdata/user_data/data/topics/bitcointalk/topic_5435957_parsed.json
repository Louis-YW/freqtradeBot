But people on generaö seem to be hoping that these kind of nft collections would just die out eventually. But of course they don't. These are stupid and that's why they get the spotlight and money. And as nft investors have a black belt in stupid. It's a win-win combo.And at least these seem to have some work behind them and they are not just Midjourney images. (I am currently learning to love NFTs and shitcoins. Because If i can't beat them i must join them.)",

He is promoting it on his official Twitter and OpenSea page also has a blue seal indicating it's a verified seller. But indeed, every caution is needed in a sea of scammers this crypto ocean is.https://twitter.com/HasbullaHive/status/1615521571942064132Quote from: justdimin on January 21, 2023, 09:56:22 AMHe only look like a kid but he is 20 yrs old now and with that age I think he already heard and knows something about crypto but it's also possible that he is only being hired as a promoter and people behind him only uses his fame to market the NFTs easily.

If not then just ignore them.I don't know if his physical condition also affects his mental development, if not he has full conditions of learning and understanding about NFTs and crypto in general. Anyway, there is someone behind him managing these things, he is just the celebrity, the poster boy who will have to advertise the product and meet big investors, as it's part of the benefits' program. So, it's really for fans who want to meet Hasbulla for real and hang out with him.",

They have similar fan-bases, and I believe he is even more popular than Hasbulla in Turkey, since he is native from your country, and he also has a history of participating advertisements' campaigns, video clips plus million of views on Youtube.",
