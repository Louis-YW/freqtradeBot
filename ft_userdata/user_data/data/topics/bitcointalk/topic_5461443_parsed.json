  "content": "So I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for the past 8 months. He is so nice, educated and also handsome with a kind heart. But from a couple of weeks ago onwards he is so annoying me with my spending. We both have good jobs and also passive incomes from our family business. He makes 20x than me cuz he comes from the richest family background. But I'm not, unfortunately. But that's not the problem with our relationship. Whenever I purchase something or spend money on an investment or business he always asks why I spend so much, why you buy that, Why I invest it there blah blah, and why I can't save money like these nonsence always. The thing is I spend the money that I earn by myself. It has nothing to do with him. Throughout the whole relationship, I never ask him for expensive things because he comes rich background. I'm very ashamed of that kind of thing, my friends always tell me why don't ask him anything if we have that kind of bf we will live a more comfortable life. Honestly, I can't think of that. Because I think as a boy/girl we don't need to depend on someone's money right? I don't know about other girls but I think if you have your income you should take care of your needs. I work hard, study hard, and passed a lot of problems in my life to become who I'm today. So I have a right to wear good clothes, have good mobile, good meals with my own money. On my last birthday, he gave me an expensive gold watch. It's so nice but I'm not a person who likes to wear that kind of fancy thing, that is also a problem with him. So right now I felt like this relationship won't work in the long run. I mean I can't imagine what will happen to me if I marry him. So what do you guys think about this kind of situation? Should I move on or be more patient?",
