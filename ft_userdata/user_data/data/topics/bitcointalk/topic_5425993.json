I see some negative reviews because your customers are complaining about freezing funds with KYC requests[1]. And your one reason for responding to a complaint, I find ridiculous (an attempt to get free money  ).QuoteAs noted on the e-mail sent, Instacoins actually did attempt to refund the monies sent, however the charges incurred would be larger than your wire transfer, making it impossible for us to refundIn a case like this, is there no consideration of returning in some other way than the customer gets nothing?1. https://www.trustpilot.com/review/instacoins.com?stars=1",
