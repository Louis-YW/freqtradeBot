Also NGC makes a number of slabs giving you more potential for having different \"off-sized\" coins graded.I've told this story here before several times but Tread93 ( I think that's his user name off the top of my head) spoke with the head of NGC once and asked why they wouldn't grade crypto coins.  He stated \"we don't grade fake coins\".  Tread responded with..\"but you grade the McDonalds Big Mac coins\".  NGC owners responded by saying \"yeah, but those are really nice coins\".  lol",

Although I do enjoy a membership at PCGS as well.Some great points here.  No, PCGS would indeed NOT call you to discuss that. I’m trying to help Kialara find a grader to slab his coins and got an assist from a very prominent collector here who introduced me to his PCGS guy who helps him. Said he’d look in to it for me months ago. Replied w a follow up of “any news” nothing. Emailed PCGS directly over a month ago, probably 2, no word back. Shocked to see NGC grading after they said our coins are fake coins lol, so that’s why they don’t (didn’t) grade them. So you’re right FattCatt, unless you’re a whale ..customer service seems to be shit, unlike ICG. ICG though is not well known or on the level of the fore mentioned two “big guys”, so that does in theory have less value than a PCGS/NGC slab (despite the fact that MJ is technically verifying PCGS crypto coins through ICG, which offers a TON of value). But only we here understand that value for the most part. Also, the big two have all sorts of slab shapes and sizes. That’s a big deal, obviously. I do wonder if NGC graded Otohs collection because well he’s Otoh. Same with Heritage Auctions, which is an even bigger deal. Just wonder if it’s a one off for Otoh or just the start. 250 Cas coin auction upcoming (don’t think this has been posted yet but I dunno, less active here these days). All NGC graded I do believe. https://coins.ha.com/c/search-results.zx?No=0&N=3184+792+4294934363",

They can accomodate coins of ALL shapes and sizes, so if you want to know the truth most Numimatists choose NGC over all other graders at least IMO. Not to say that all grading companies aren't good, I have just seen a large preference towards NGC over time.",
