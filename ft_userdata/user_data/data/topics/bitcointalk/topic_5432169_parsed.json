It seems like it would be really interesting.",

There are some pretty big names on it with Celsius, BlockFi, Anchor and many others and of course there is also FTX and Alameda which is responsible for many of those other projects to go bankrupt too. That those projects received a funding of 3.6 Billion $ is just crazy because in the end that is a huge amount of money that is basically lost forever probably. For everyone that makes a big profit in crypto there is someone that is making a loss obviously.I also like that on that list there are no stupid meme-coins listed because obviously most of them are dead again withing a few days anyway. If those list would have included meme-coins, then it would have at least 10000 entries i would guess.",

Sometimes we don't know how exactly we can invest in the next successful project because of this kind of scenario and also experience and knowledge sometimes contradict our perspective. Due to the fact that the crypto market is still really high when it comes to its volatility, that's why the thing you need to remember and you should never forget is, to invest only what you can afford to lose. after what happened to FTX, the crypto market will not be the same anymore until it recovers from this bearish trend.",

If you are a quality project, bull market, or bear market, you are safe.Another reason may also be that the project only wants to make a profit from investors' funds through the hype trend in the market so that when they fail, they will not think long about building it but instead leave and leave the project alone.So obviously it's not a reason because of a bear market, rather the altcoin project doesn't have a mature idea in running it just wants to enjoy the trend of hype and manipulation for the development of the project but in the end he failed too.",

To think that people lose money everyday in all of these projects, but nonetheless the next new project still allures investors, i guess it is what it is, and nothing is going to change next year or even in the future; for people who do no know what they are doing/how to handle altcoin risky investments, they better basically just invest in Bitcoin that is sustainable for the long run, and that wouldn't go extinct like most altcoins do.",

The kind of project that was not built to outright scam people. Compared to the yearly reports from the firm that I also barely knew, I think the scanner indeed won't give a perfect 100% accuracy, especially if there is a new polished method within the scam smart contract code. Nevertheless, it may also potentially give a pretty good number for a scam project that was created this year, noting people may reuse the same scam scheme again and again.",
