  "content": "With price dropping today from $30K to around $29K, are you worried there will be a deeper correction, or return to bear market, or is this just the short-term correction before re-testing $30K? Many speculators anticipated rejection from $30K level, as this was previously support for 18 months in from 2021 to mid 2022 and could become strong resistance. Although so far (as of writing) we have only seen a -5% correction to $29K. Ultimately I think it's too early to tell if price will correct further to $25K, $23K or break the recent higher low of $20K. But nonetheless people have started to get concerned, hence this thread.Some positives to consider:Price remains above all Daily moving averages (20,50,200) while above $29K, so far from bearish longer-termPrice remains in a bull flag / upwards trend since mid March with short-term support level around $28.6KPrice previously broke through $25K strong resistance that could well turn into new supportThe current sell-off isn't supported by strong volume, similar to the move to $30K initiallyThese are just a few factors that come to mind. While short-term (1hr/4hr) price can be seen as bearish, it remains bullish on the Daily time-frame and still reversing the bearish trend on Weekly/Monthly time-frames. Personally I think $28K level is likely to act as strong support, due to the 3 weeks of consolidation/accumulation that occurred recently. Otherwise below this level I think a re-test of the 200 WMA around $26K, as well as $25K becomes increasingly likely. The 200 Day MA however continues to rise from $20K, now above $21K, with major consolidation/accumulation zone currently priced at around $23K.",

The 1 Day and 4 Hour TF looks bearish, but we are still in an uptrend if we look at it from the 1 Month TF. So I personally wouldn't worry about this correction, it's just going to be very close to recovering and getting back to testing $30k.Strong support now expected at $29k, but if this correction is followed by panic traders then I don't think $29k will be able to withstand the selling pressure. I hope there is no deeper correction, this should be resolved in the short term.",

      "body": "Don't look for specific price in USD but see how big the change was. How much did we really lose from yesterday? 3%? That's nothing when we compare it to a normal price action of bitcoin. Bitcoin is known for experiencing daily price action of +/- 5% and this usually happens at least twice a month, which if you look at the charts is exactly what's been going on for years. In March we had a correction from 28,7k to 26,6k, this time it's 30,3 to 29k (so far)so this is a much smaller drop than 3 weeks ago. If you weren't worried then, why make threads about it now?",

How does the 1 Day chart look bearish to you? I only see a bearish candle from today, nothing else. As I referenced in the OP, price is above all it's short to long-term MAs, the RSI on the border of neutral/bullish (far from bearish), CMF is still bullish, the only exception would be the MACD that is crossing bearish today, mainly due to the minimal move to the upside above $29K, hence MAs are catching up.As someone else pointed out in the thread, price is down -3% today, or -5% from it's yearly high, which overall is a pretty standard price fluctuation for an asset like Bitcoin.",

Cuz there have been plenty of drops so far this year.I just saw an article in a major publication today claiming that Bitcoin's rally has stalled...all I could think is wtf?!Bitcoin literally just hit $30k a week ago. OP why would you possibly be worrying?Bitcoin has already \"stalled/corrected\" at $21k, $23k, $24k, $26k, and $28k so far this year. Hell from late Feb to mid march it dropped from $25k to $19k over like 3 weeks. I don't know why going from $30k to $29k is worrying some people so much, as though this is anything but completely normal.This is literally just normal price action. If you get worried over this you must have only just joined Bitcoin this month. And be prepared to get worried every few weeks lol",

This is essential for it to have that retest that we're all anticipating because that's how it act before it gets to another support level. Long term people have nothing to worry about. This has been seen by the books already and experiencing the market even without going through technical analysis will tell that this is a common move for bitcoin as we know what will come by next year. These roller coaster rides are fairly normal and bitcoin has to go through several process of going down before it becomes stable again with the support that we might see soon. Each level that it goes up provides another support and these retests surely are part of it. By then, traders should still be careful, the active or daily traders because in these short terms the moves are unknown and unpredictable just as the usual.",

If we breach the resistance like in this case of $30k, it's hard to sustain it's run. Just like when we broke $25k and $28k. Specially that $28k, that's one of the hardest barrier because we have like attempted 5x to go over it and sustained. And even if we go past $28k, it went sideways for the next 10 days. So this might be the case as well to $30k, going to trade sideways for the longest time before we can make another break out run to maybe $32k. And then it will just repeat itself again.",

It is pretty normal to see a retracement as long as it will not go deeper below -20% or more. A lot of people asking if the price of bitcoin is healthy even though it is currently going down, for me it is a yes because like what I said, retracement is important and it is necessary if we want to see bitcoin at around $32,000 + or even more.Do not worry guys because the major support has been established around $29,000. The possibility of the bitcoin to breakdown in that area is very low so we can expect a bounce in the following days because the price of it is considered as cheap especially for the swing traders.",

The latest upgrade has unlocked billions of dollars in staked coins and it appears some of them are being deposited to exchanges.Crypto exchanges received a net inflow of 179,500 ether (ETH), worth some $375 million in the four days after Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade went live, according to crypto data firm CryptoQuant.CryptoQuant data shows that traders deposited 1,101,079 ETH to exchanges between April 13 and April 16, while only removing 921,579 tokens.

One thing that seems to be missed by everyone is sideways action.I think it's clear that everyone is fearful of sharp crashes or dips of 10%+ as we saw in the last bull run. The difference between last bull run and this (in my opinion, temporary) bull run is that Bitcoin was artificially reduced in value pretty much throughout all of 2022. Now, it's sideways and upwards until this trend is over. I wouldn't expect huge crashes, just small corrections like the one we just saw...and to go with it, lots of steady and sideways action.

They, along with CoinTelegram and other mainstream crypto news platforms are for the most part, garbage.  I think it should also be known that during the last bull run, on-chain data was just becoming a wider known form of data for predicting the price. Whales and market manipulators who seek to the control the price paid almost no mind to this data and it was an accurate way of seeing where the market was headed. This time things are very different. You should expect on-chain data to be just as manipulated as the charts you TA on. Take it all with a grain of salt.",

It shows price is able to to sustain higher levels and bears are unable to move prices lower. So in that regard, not being worried about a short-term correction and being bullish is inclusive of sideways price action (rather than just continued upside). Based on the consolidation around $28K, I also agree it's quite likely around $30K in order to remain bullish.",
