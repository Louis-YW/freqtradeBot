That put pressure on inventories, which was further exacerbated in August when a hospital circulated a letter suggesting patients get a prescription for the drugs to ensure they would have access.Herrington said that ended up being interpreted as a warning that prescriptions would be required for the products, creating demand that was “three or four times above normal,” further emptying shelves and creating more pressure at a time when supply chains were still not recovered from the pandemic and there were rising rates of illness globally.But he said all along, the drug makers and government have been working on ways to ease the crunch.He cited Monday’s announcement that foreign supplies of children’s acetaminophen for retail outlets and community pharmacies are on the way, on top of the approval recently to import children’s and infant ibuprofen and acetaminophen for hospitals.“We believe these efforts will result in a market improvement in access to these medicines in the coming days and weeks,” he told the committee.“With that said, we still have no clear line of sight to the day when the number of these viral cases begins to normalize and demand for these products returns to something resembling normal.”Garon also raised the question of whether delays in bringing supplies from abroad was linked to bilingual labelling requirements, as has been suggested.That was discounted by Hugues Mousseau, the director general of the Quebec association of drug distributors, who called it a “false debate.” He said there are easy solutions that Quebec companies are familiar with.The drugs now being imported to Canada come from the U.S. and Australia, with the government making sure they’re being flown over to avoid further delays, officials said Tuesday.But when asked Tuesday how many doses are coming and where they are going, Health Canada said it couldn’t provide the answer.“We work quite closely with market authorization holders, and I’m sure you can appreciate when we have confidential business information in our possession, then we need to treat it as such,” said Linsey Hollett, the director general of health product compliance for Health Canada.“So quantities have been established, but because of confidential business information, I’m not able to share them.”NDP Don Davies was incredulous at her answer, noting that when the government was buying COVID-19 vaccines, it had no issue releasing the numbers.“When the government wants to release numbers to try to make itself look good, when it’s procuring lots of COVID vaccines, then commercial sensitivities doesn’t seem to be a problem in terms of releasing numbers of doses,” he said.“But now, when there’s a shortage all of a sudden the government is claiming commercial sensitivity, they’re not releasing numbers …”Hollett said the government hopes to have that information available online in due course.“The need for that information, and the importance of that information has been recognized,” she said.https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2022/11/15/health-canada-says-more-childrens-pain-medication-is-on-the-way-but-not-how-much.html....Pharmaceutical drug shortages in canada.There doesn't appear to be clear or concise information available for what is causing it, or when circumstances might improve. It has declined into a blame game where consumers are blaming the government for drug shortages. And the government is blaming consumers for shortages claiming they overbought the market and are hoarding supplies.There is a chance these shortages could become the new normal standard. Which could be frightening to consider for those who require medical supplies to live. Supply chain disruptions are being felt worldwide and no one appears to have a definitive answer to them. What can consumers do to alleviate and address these issues.",

      "body": "if the drugs have been used less over a period of 2 years then the way stores order from the suppliers changes.the suppliers have less since less was ordered.  and so on.  demand spike and system is overloaded thus creating a shortage.   welcome to the downside of \"just in time\" style of inventory management .now my opinion on this can be wrong.   but it seems to be that the people least effective at solving the problem are the ones the media is paying attention to =>",
