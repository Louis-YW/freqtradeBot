I feel like the market situation is far from the \"bloodbath\", in fact, I'm surprised that the recent SEC's actions didn't cause a much greater price drop, but I guess exaggerated headlines generate more clicks.‘Bloodbath’—Sudden $1 Trillion Crypto Crash Sparks Fresh Coinbase Warning And Tanks The Price Of Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Polygon And Solanahttps://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/10/bloodbath-sudden-1-trillion-crypto-crash-sparks-fresh-coinbase-warning-and-tanks-the-price-of-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana/QuoteBitcoin, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies have suffered a sudden crash after a week that saw some of the biggest crypto companies rocked by shock regulatory action—with further bombshells on the way.The bitcoin price has dropped to around $25,000, down 5% to its lowest level since March and mirrored by declines seen by the ethereum price. However, other top ten cryptocurrencies—BNB, XRP, cardano, matic, dogecoin and solana—have all suffered far larger declines, losing between 10% and 25% in mere hours.Crypto's latest crash—plunging the crypto market to around $1 trillion and described as an \"absolute bloodbath\" by one trader on Twitter—comes as one of the top global credit rating agencies, Moody's, dropped its outlook on embattled bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase from stable to negative.(...)",

We have to remember that most people that are invested in Crypto are here for the speculation and profits and they want that to happen in a secure manner. (Most of them still believe in centralized entities like Banks and the Stock Exchange)We face some very big obstacles, with the SEC attacking one of the largest exchanges, but we have faced many of these challenges before and we will simply ride it out again.",

The Sec's actions against Binance were purely to cause panic in the market but I'm not sure that why they needed to create panic in first place when even Binance wasn't doing any damage to US users? I think they did that to stop US based investors to put more money into Bitcoin because of the fear that when more dollars are invested into Bitcoin the economy might face more inflation due to that.Sec and Binance have already come up to a negotiation deal and they will soon sort out the problems. In future Binance US will be highly regulated and the US government might get a way to access every trader's history in order to protect the users from any type of financial damages. Or they might want that to impose taxes on the crypto traders to fix the inflation in their community, and we will know that only when the time comes.I'm not against decentralized exchanges but in their current state they won't be able to compete with centralized exchanges like Binance and some others. They truly are best for the ones who prefer privacy over ease of use, but unfortunately most users don't care about privacy. The only thing they care about is the ease of use and the features an exchange offers. In that scenario I don't think that there's any other exchange providing such good features as Binance, and such exchange will always be helpful for the growth of the crypto-community.",

In a scenario where crypto trading is delegalised, I can't imagine it replacing fiat, even if the use of fiat is massively restricted. Especially if fiat is still good enough to use for the purchase of government-approved goods.",

The difference between fiats and Bitcoin is that you have to use the former to pay taxes, bills, or make large purchases (i.e. house). If Bitcoin is declared illegal by entire developed world, it will be practically unusable. Sure you could participate in an alternative economy, risk penalties to make some small purchases, but you won't be able to use it for any significant transactions.Even the the use of the Euro in the form of cash gets crippled constantly with more and more restrictions i.e. on the maximum cash transactions and limited cash withdrawals options.",
