  "content": "U.K. inflation hit 9.1% year-on-year in May as soaring food and energy prices continue to deepen the country’s cost-of-living crisis. The 9.1% rise in the consumer price index, released Wednesday, was in line with expectations from economists in a Reuters poll and slightly higher than the 9% increase recorded in April.https://www.cmcmarkets.com/sv-se/nyheter-och-analys/uk-cpi-set-to-increase-again-in-mayConsumer prices rose by 0.7% month-on-month in May, slightly above expectations for a 0.6% rise but well short of the 2.5% monthly increase in April, indicating that inflation is slowing somewhat. The largest upward contributions to the inflation rate came from housing and household services, primarily electricity, gas and other fuels, along with transport (mostly motor fuel and second-hand cars).The Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) came in at 7.9% in the 12 months to May, up from 7.8% in April. “Rising prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages, compared with falls a year ago, resulted in the largest upward contribution to the change in both the CPIH and CPI 12-month inflation rates between April and May 2022 (0.17 percentage points for CPIH),” the ONS said in its report.https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2022/06/22/uk-inflation-hits-40-year-record-highest-in-g7The Bank of England last week implemented a fifth consecutive hike to interest rates, though stopped short of the aggressive hikes seen in the U.S. and Switzerland, as it looks to tame inflation without compounding the current economic slowdown.More than four in five people in the U.K. are worried about rising living costs and their ability to afford basics necessities like food and energy over the coming months, according to a new survey.",

With them still dealing with the strain the COVID-19 pandemic put on them, and the demand for consumer goods are high as against the supply, the government will have to look for means to curb this to avoid the inflation rate climbing to a shocking 10%.",

If you continue to adhere to this position, then everything will only get worse. Of course, now these 2 GBP don’t play any role, but in a year it will already turn into 10 GBP, and maybe more.",

You build a farm out of the cities, someplace where nobody lives, and then you need to use tractors which uses gas to collect those, then you put them on trucks and send them to cities, which causes the food prices go be high.However, as long as there are no cheap oil, gas whatever prices anywhere then we are going to keep living this high priced world and it will not stop. Right now, the whole world is aware of the situation, and they can't really do anything right now, hence we just need to accept the fact that the world will be like this until all thing settled.",

Over the past 2+ years, the whole world has been experiencing several powerful crises - first Covid, then the first wave left hard scars on the economies of countries ... Small and small businesses - for the most part and everywhere did not survive the restrictive measures. Which led to unemployment, and the burden on social budgets, already overloaded with pandemics. Then a new wave of Covid. And in 2022, there will also be a new round of terrorist aggression against Ukraine, which launched a chain reaction of sanctions and consequences (unfortunately, sanctions often have a backlash). The result of the conflict was also the disruption of the hydrocarbon market. With gas, decisions are still being delayed, and with oil, an embargo and all side processes, as a result, an increase in logistics costs, which greatly affects everything that surrounds us ... The next couple of years will be very difficult ... Covid will still seem \"easy problem\"",

Loan payments are depreciating at a faster rate, faster than loaners earn from interest. The market greatly favors those taking out a loan in contrast to those offering loans.",

How I hope the government can look into this matter and help us. Maybe they are doing something but they are just defeated by increasing demand and low supply coming to their country. Minimum salary earners are really choke up by the inflation rate rise because the purchasing powers of their salary gotten every 15 days or monthly decrease and this totally hurt so much to majority that's why since this issues shown already maybe they should finds ways in future that there's no food crisis will happen to their country and maybe they should boost their agricultural sector to increase the food supply in their country.",

This time everything has happened altogether, the pandemic, the economic crisis, and the food crisis. In some aspect this destruction is initiated by pandemic and further has caused economic decline and food shortage.",

Europe really need to gear up itself for tough times ahead.Brexit is not responsible for this inflation. High energy prices is one of the major reasons behind this. Price of the commodities is heavily dependent on the fuel price. With the ongoing Russia Ukraine war, the fuel is being sold at a premium. OPEC countries are not increasing the supply while their is demand, adding up to the supply stress leading to consumer inflation. Also when the economy is rising, when people are making a lot of money, it usually leads to overspending which artificially increases the demand. So if supply remains same, it leads to a price surge. Central bank increases the interest rate to suck out money from the economy so that people don't overspend. 9.1% is really huge for a low interest European country to be honest.",
