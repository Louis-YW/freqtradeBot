      "body": "There is a question as to whether morality can exist in a world where moral behavior is lawfully required or incentively rewarded.Let's say that a person goes 1 full year without breaking any traffic laws. They are incentively rewarded by paying 5% lower income taxes and a lump sum bonus of exclusive deflationary CBDC which they can HODL under the expectation of it accumulating value over their lifetime. (This CBDC in theory, could only be earned and accumulated through good behavior, on a public ledger which would routinely be independently scrutinized, it could also only be sold exclusively back to the state at a higher price than when it was received, at which time the coins would be destroyed. The state would hold $1 trillion in coin reserves, which could routinely be sold off at regular intervals to fund coin buy backs. Not 100% certain on the format, but in essence it would be a deflationary and scarce commodity which appreciated in value over time) Would following traffic laws still be a moral act? Or could they become motivated by greed and material gain, which could transform the act of following traffic laws into an immoral act?What would happen if this precedent were applied to areas outside of traffic laws. Its an old concept but still might be interesting to consider.....Here are a few other decent resources on the topic.Quote6 Design Principles for a Successful Central Bank Digital Currencyhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/6-design-principles-for-a-successful-central-bank-digital-currencyQuoteThe Problem with Mainstream Banks and a New Alternative | Fluidhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSlF-GkDsg",

In other words as long as we are mixing the cryptocurrency with the existing financial structure there can't be any fairness in it.

      "body": "A fair mechanism would be hardwork-based rewards. But it should be designed in such a way that once a problem is properly solved by anyone he/she is guaranteed reward. It's more like Bitcoin or gold Mining, with rewards hidden in puzzles that are automatically released once solved.This would make the Bitcoin or Gold found in this manner a hard money/reward. And Hard Rather Than Easy Money is better for an economy as it takes hardwork to solve problems and create enough values. Hardwork = using enough time & energy to solve problems and create sufficient value. I think whatever payment is made to a child should be inherited, so we don't run into the problem of children getting paid money printed out of nothing that probably will be use for only consumption without producing enough, thus increasing the prices of goods & services and creating inflation. Money should be hard to create just like it's hard to create bitcoin. It should be reward for job well done, or for working & solving problems without creating more problems. This is suppose to be so because we all have roles to serve. And money should be given to those who are serving their roles well otherwise we would have the issue of people getting paid without serving their roles, and problems will pile up with no one or very few solving them due to lack of insensitive. Some say let's just create the machines to solve the problems better/faster than humans & for humans, and we won't have the issues you described. Well, humans and the world aren't designed that way. That will be the end of the world. Look at what the over reliance on machines and computers have done to people so far. They are getting fat, finding it hard to solve simple problems, etc. It's seems the parts of the human bodies created for the roles machines/computers are taking over from are weakening, dying off or shutting down. Hardwork is satisfying if the role is yours, the problem getting solved by you and you are getting rewarded",

Otherwise this coin would be simply worthless.You are proposing a model about child birth, but what about immigration? If new immigrants enter the country, will they receive such minted coins, in case of unemployment, education, illness, retirement, etc.? If yes, won't this model create high inflation?I usually don't trust theoretical models, in which the money (both fiat and crypto) are created out of thin air. This seems like a recipe for hyperinflation and financial disaster. There's a thing called labor theory of value. The value of every product/service is determined by the amount of labor, which was invested into the creation of the product or completion of the service.You can't create something out of nothing and give it actual value.Anyway, to answer your request about a theoretical economical model.My proposal is to give every person (above the legal age) a certain amount of coins(maybe 1000) and let's see what happens. The total supply of coins in circulation will be fixed and there will be no additional coins.",

First case is a free insurance, second is... some sort of stimulus for learning.For the first case, I've seen in my country giving free money to those hit by flash floods; I've never find it fair, they've pretty much bought some votes with tax payers' money, instead of fixing the problem (deforestation). I don't really agree with your ideas either and I don't think they'll be implemented easy or at all:* CBDCs are money and in the global acceptation money usually is something one gets as payment for something, no matter it's another good or some service/work done for the payer* there are few countries wealthy enough to just give money to its citizen, that's an exception; in all the rest of the cases somebody (the taxpayer) has worked for that money* so free insurance is an unfair equalitarian thing, for which probably some tax payers will pay more and some less, and still receiving the same \"service\"* education... when I'll see politicians indeed and for real support education, then this may worth a second thought...  Now, \"no premine\" would somehow mean wealth created out of thin air and then distributed, and we both know that if everybody receive gold for free, gold will no longer stay valuable.So, since it's a central bank coin, i.e. a digital representation of same ol' fiat, there will be the same type of \"premine\" all fiat has (just this time it will be a replacement of a few tons of printed paper) and the fair mechanism would remain the salaries.Sorry that I didn't really follow a very clear line of thought, but I hope you've got my points. Bitcoin has this success because it's a representation of hard work (of the ASICs), free airdrops cannot compete with that.",

But ... Everyone spoils the nuances ...One of them is the need for the state budget to neutralize all sorts of negative processes that lead to the \"printing\" of money. A net balance in the form - money supply = gross product or other indicator, unfortunately is not possible. More precisely, if it is possible, then only in ideal conditions of the economy, order. This is not about the economy of the state and order in the country, this is about the world economy, world peace, and the absence of international problems, such as wars, sanctions, economic terror, etc.In a word - the idea is cool, but at the level of utopia",

Taking your locked system but combining it with the idea that £6k/$8k is enough to invest as a child to retire off (similar to how state pension works in the UK). I think a system like that could be achieved for a CBDC and might make companies think twice about making too many foreign investments if they can profit themselves by negotiating for the initial company to franchise or decentralise itself.A CBDC that matches the wealth of an economy would also bring a surprise to how valuable certain countries were or how they are perceived.Obviously a deflationary amount of coins could then also be minted every year to give people an incentive to keep working and not rely on the money they already have in the CBDC if they use it more like a financial cushion.",

CBDCs in most forms are flawed and governments are trying to impose them on us and take away cash because otherwise nobody would agree to this. They will proceed in taking away our financial freedom by pushing these broken financial instruments that have only one thing about them that seems to work and it's control.Based on your first idea, you'd want people to get a cheat sheet knowing that if they ever get unemployed they'll get free money, or if they finish school they'll get free money. You'd get people who'd sign up to a number of courses knowing it's all going to be paid for by the government. As long as they keep learning they're going to keep getting paid. Then, after getting all the possible education for free and having some money saved up, they'd move to another country where such knowledge is expensive, to compete on the job market and get the best position and the best pay.
