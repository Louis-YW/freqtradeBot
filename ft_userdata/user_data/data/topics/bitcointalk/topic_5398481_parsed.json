The Luna devs itself should freeze there blockchain during the initial stage of the attack so that the price will not dumpmto it’s current state. The attacker are freely dumping there UST while its peg to Luna. Meaning Luna tokens smart contract do unli print during the sell off on UST. All the blame should be point out to the incompetent Terra devs. There emergency plan make things works since it inflated the supply into trillion.",

I hope your psyche is still fine.People should be aware of what's happening in their portfolio if these Luna holders are fully aware they will cancel their order or do not buy the dip hoping for a resurgence because it is listed on Binance, never trust where it is listed but on issues confronting coins that you're holding, you don't do action them blame others for the action you take.When buying you should be on your own and for your reference check this tweet from Binancehttps://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1525060775391510529Quote5. I am very disappointed with how this UST/LUNA incident was handled (or not handled) by the Terra team. We requested their team to restore the network, burn the extra minted LUNA, and recover the UST peg. So far, we have not gotten any positive response, or much response at allQuote6. (This is in sharp contrast to Axie Infinity, where the team took accountability, had a plan, and were communicating with us proactively. And we helped.)",

I don’t believe that the crash happened was because it is a scam act, but more like a consequence of how the people acted when it is seen to be going down, that’s why it has hit rock bottom now. The exchanges are not accountable for something that is caused due to the movement of the market like this one.",

Luna is not listed on Binance alone, it has many other listings and traders should be able to do with their Luna what they want with it instead of the tokens remaining in Binance.",

While Binance is an exchange that has a large list of coins, not just LUNA, it's highly unlikely that Binance will focus on LUNA alone. Not only Binance, I think other exchanges are like this too. Besides that, the price crash and the problems that occurred in LUNA/terra also coincided with the fall in the price of BTC and altcoins where many fell by more than 50 percent.It should be the investors themselves who must understand and be aware before investing, or if they have invested, at least they know and update the news about LUNA, so that if something bad happens, the investor is able to take precautions regarding their investment.",
