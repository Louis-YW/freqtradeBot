A high transaction fee should not be a hindrance to your decision concerning whether to invest in Bitcoin or not.",

(Layman Terms Please).I guess you're concerned that people will still use this network if they need to pay ridiculous fees to make transactions. I'd say no since the network is definitely the most secure compared to other networks. Even if what you're afraid of comes true, people who value security and those who hold lots of BTC will keep making transactions as usual. Sure, those who want to transact in lower values might not find BTC attractive, but the market is not limited to them. In fact, this is not the first time this happened to the network. The fact that the number of transactions keeps increasing should tell you that the demand has increased instead of decreased. I doubt those who spam the network to mint tokens also want high fees either. Either they'll move on or they'll just build something to reduce the fee to print their speculative assets.",

I will simplify it for you by saying just because of BRC-20 protocol and its ordinals thing has caused the congestion of the network with its useless token Pepe and that created much burden on the blockchain and is the cause of huge fees and delays in transactions.QuoteHow can I find out the status / when I will receive it??!? I was told that the \"slowdown\" is due toLike other reputed members of the forum suggested you can use a good block explorer to get an estimation about the time when you will receive the payment. The estimation might not be exact but still you will get some info that might be helpful to reduce your stress. You should use Blockchair to get the estimated time of your transaction as that one is the most recommended one because of its features.Quotehigher transfer fees. Will these fees ever lower, and are BTC worth the investment still??!? (Layman Terms Please).In layman terms yes the fees will be lower and the BTC is still worth the investment. The hype created by the ordinals won'tÂ  be staying for a long time. And, it is expected that within few weeks the transaction speeds will be faster and the fees will be reduced just the way they were before the introduction of that useless token.",
