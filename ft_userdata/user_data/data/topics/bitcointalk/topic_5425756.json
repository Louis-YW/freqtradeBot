Using some random website is not a good idea unfortunately. I doubt you’ll ever see those funds again but I hope you learned a valuable lesson. Don’t trust, verify. There are more people out there trying to steal from you than there are trying to help you. Sad but true.",

Can you share the address with us?",

The possibility of recovering it depends on knowing the scammer, and it can be known either by tracking the blockchain (the hardest option) or by knowing the scammer (either about the person who sent you the link or searching for the identity of the owner)",
