  "content": "Hi. I have discovered that electric transformer can convert AC to DC and DC back to AC.Looking for investors who are interested in experimenting with this unusual technique.It's not all, off course. I took universal motor, connected my way and it showed half of running current, at some point amper meter showed 0 amps produced by running motor. And more stuff.Also I feel like I can build powerfull PMDC generator, that can compete with 3 phase generators. PMDC generators are easier to build. Might not be particularly cheaper.But need to build custom cores, that don't look like any transformers today. And this cost money which I don't have. Need to buy material that is not cheap. Rent a place and get some not expensive equipment. I will place video cameras in the shop and setup life chat, so the investors would see what I'm doing.",

I have discovered that electric transformer can convert AC to DC and DC back to AC.That is not something new, I use a transformer to charge my car battery and plugin it to the AC current in my house...So what you can do by transforming the energy from AC to DC? i think the only application is to charge batteries but maybe I'm missing some important applications for it. And one last question, can you use this technology for mining, or what's the relation between your project and cryptos?",

      "body": "Why not just buy a motor/generator to do this? They may be as efficient as it gets and if they're not it'll be easier and more efficient to improve individual parts than it would to build your own from scratch.As said above, you also need a reason this can be used and what you're aiming to make. You've not said how big the motor or generator your expect to make is? Could it be used to charge a phone battery? An electric car? A house?",

Yes, a house, rail gun, ionic engine perhaps anything require huge amount of powers. Can't buy it, need to make custom motors. They are different from those on the market, but not the same.",
