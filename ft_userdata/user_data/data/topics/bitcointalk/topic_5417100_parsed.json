In a way thats my view on things currently with the new graphic card coming out most probably mining performance will increase as well. So its really up to you how to take it.",

The is the Bitcoin section of the Forum and BTC cannot be mined using graphics cards as bitcoin difficulty is literally trillions of times higher than what even the most advance GPU's can handle. Mining Bitcoin requires using ASIC-based miners.That said, please ask in the altcoin areas of the Forum where you can find the answers you are looking for. Many if not most altcoins can be mined using GPU's.Requesting the mods to move this to the altcoin area.",

Currently the hash rate, the amount of computing power working on mining bitcoin is: 260.27 EH/s \"Exa hashes per second\", let's say you have a high end graphics card (Nvidia 3090) with 120MH/s \"Mega hashes per second\" and let's assume you're mining in a pool so you're sharing profit instead of waiting x amount of years to mine a block, which includes pool fees. You're looking at, at most, 50 cents USD per day, or 30 cents if mining Ethereum. I couldn't find a good BTC calculator so I hope someone else knows one. That's not counting your electricity bill which you have to estimate based on your local electricity cost and power draw from your PC.If you're profitable, yes you might make a profit in a couple years but I would recommend just playing some games and watching your gains from HODLing. There are many factors that need to be accounted for and I'm only a student so I'll leave this up to the veterans. Just my 2 cents. Also, hello BTC community!",

This mining discussion is solely for Bitcoin and not for altcoins. You should move this on the altcoin board using the move command on the bottom of your thread once you click edit. And also GPU mining is already not profitable since ETH is the most efficient token to mine using GPU while they are now change to PoS. Your will just gamble to mine unknown tokens or old tokens that don’t have any hype which is not profitable in long run for your mining rig.",

There is not a set point on how do u flip it. I also flip but I use mostly 3rd party web to flip. Since nowadays crypto is applicable in so many different websites, there are a lot of ways but keep in mind is your own risk   I've been thinking about flipping as well might look into in a little more. In your context about 3rd party website what do u mean by that.",

I use to mine 0xMonero and Raven but since mining for 0xMonero stopped and the supply was capped at under 2 million tokens, I moved on to staking. Don't get me wrong, I still hold 0xMR and RVN and I think both of them are great projects but when you compare staking to mining only, staking on platforms like MAXX finance and Spookyswap are much more profitable than mining these days.",

And yes it still worth it.. Btw i said these because it seems you want to mine on your gaming device. Lol",

If you have this opportunity (which is nearly impossible in current crisis ridden global economy) you can profit through mining. But I see it as more like gambling at this point.

Can anybody give me an advice on it. Your insight is very much appreciated.  You have to understand the cost of mining and not just look at the market situation, some miners already moved to other places where they can get a cheaper energy and maximize their mining. If you have a good mining rig and the cost of energy in your area is not that expensive then I can day mining is still worth it. Cheaper coins to mine means you can get more and when the bull market hits, that could be a huge profit for you, patience is also the key in mining for you to succeed.",

You'll get mostly negative from the profits that you'll make in mining because the electricity consumption is where it's mostly going. If you have a free electricity and it's coming from a renewable source or you've got solar panels then it's still profitable to you. But, if you have no free electricity and you have to pay for it then you better just look for something else where you can earn from your hobby of gaming, like offering yourself to play with some people who are looking for a duo or lonely folks that don't have friends.",

It was great that you woke up from the reality that playing video games alone won't get you anywhere but it can only be a waste of time.If you are a not a kid anymore then you should focus on grinding the real way like what you are planning now, looking for a source of income. Mining can be one of it only if you have cheap sources of energy but if you only entered a little earlier then mining is easily doable even using a graphics card but right now, I think you will need a real mining hardware to be able to mine a btc.",

It's no longer a PoW consensus algorithm as it's switched to PoS already for which, the more you hold, the more you contribute to its network and as well as profitability.Quote from: Pejoh Asu on October 18, 2022, 07:13:05 AMthere are many new coins that are worthy and more profitable, I have tried mining some new and profit coins, but after the market drops since the beginning of the year I stopped And now trying to find a decent coins in mining.Good luck finding that, before it was Ethereum which is the most profitable of them all. I just don't know these days if there will be a coin that will be par at its profitability when it's still mineable.",
