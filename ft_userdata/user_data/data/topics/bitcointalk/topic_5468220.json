  "content": "EXCITING OPPORTUNITY:Join My Art Journey to London Domain Conference 2024The entire community is aware that I attended this year's London domain conference with a private art display. And I intend to return the next year. With all the artwork, getting there is not a simple procedure for me. Of course, I must also make preparations for 2024, which is not simple. I do believe I could find some sponsors, but I'm not sure if other artists like me do things like this. I'm putting it to you since I've known you for a very long time. There will be space for designs, logos, and other things when I design clothing. I'll also create artwork, but it all depends on sponsorship and donations.I want to go this time bigger and not by myself; I've always fought alone, so why not try to go this time with someone else and gain some support? I've been developing my art for years, and perhaps I can support certain communities with these pieces of work and my contacts._________________________________________________Bitcoin: 35bH7mMffgLXVJx6gukF1BUK7kXgTCkn4gBitcoin Lightning: nastyrisk78@walletofsatoshi.com_________________________________________________Feel Free to visit Mx12Art Bitcoin Art Threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5362071.0",

      "body": "I still have some 1 of 1 artworks available, although they aren't that large in size. However, a new one is on the way and will be unveiled at the next private exhibition in London on August 19-21. This particular artwork holds a certain power, and I can't wait to share it with you.As a fun twist, we have an International Chess Master as a guest at the summit(https://www.domainsummit.com/e/2138615980) The person who wins against this master will receive the original artwork. If nobody beats him, the artwork will be gifted to the master, and, of course, I'll make also an open edition for those who try to beat him. I don't want anyone to leave empty handed. It takes a lot of effort, but these kinds of art exhibitions should be fun, right?I haven't received any sponsorships or exciting collaboration ideas, but that won't deter me from making this exhibition great and fun. I don't care if it involves pain or whatever, I'll make it happen. I'm staying in this mood till the end, echoing the words of a friend of mine :DDD 'I'm the best ever. I'm the most brutal and vicious, and the most ruthless champion there's ever been. No one can stop me.'",

I will get a ticket for you. Write me a DM and I will help organize it. The place and the people there are going to be awesome!I can't wait to be there. As of now, I haven't found any sponsors, which means I'll be financing this myself. It's not always easy to get to events like these, but someone has to create that atmosphere. If not me, then who?",

Getting to the event, staying there, and shipping my art will cost around $1800. That's why I started a funding thread for my mobile art gallery. This expense could go towards that.But I am not stopping! My art is now being displayed in many public places. I am waiting for images from a real Bitcoin restaurant in Germany. The restaurant is called \"Stack's,\" and everything there is about Bitcoin. They even have an old-school phone you can use to buy Bitcoin Lightning. It's just awesome!I will share more updates with you. Everything I do goes back into the community. We are here to build better times, and every helping hand will support my vision.Thank you for taking the time to read this!",
