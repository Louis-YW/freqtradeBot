There are many other understandings of investment that are found in various books and articles.Investment is like a trend that is most in demand by various groups of human resource groups of various age groups.In the past, long before technological sophistication like today, gold was the type of investment that was most in demand by various groups of human resources of various age groups and gold investment is still ongoing today.A compelling reason to invest in gold is to maintain a hedge against fiat currencies that can change in value at any time and become a strong midset.They continue to save and will not sell (hold) as long as there is no urgent need.Gold is a natural resource that is processed by humans in various stages.In the all-digital era, people still have the confidence to buy physical gold even though there are already many gold investment sites digitally.The birth of Bitcoin, which is known as crypto in the digital era, can be used as a new type of investment in an effort to protect the value of fiat currency which can change or even be worthless.In conclusion, the level of people's trust in fiat from ancient times to very low. People are willing to work hard to earn fiat currency and convert into this type of investment.Those who understand Bitcoin, including its volatility and choose to invest in Bitcoin, are very easy to panic about the price, even though Bitcoin has been proven to be a future investment choice.

There are many other understandings of investment that are found in various books and articles.Investment is like a trend that is most in demand by various groups of human resource groups of various age groups.That's true we invest basically to earn more returns from our investments, and it's also our main aim to recover our investment first and then allow the investment for sometime so that we can gain some good profits form it. I agree that there are many good books that can be helpful in learning the concepts of trading. Investment is a way to earn good returns but only practiced by few people who know the art very well.QuoteGold is a natural resource that is processed by humans in various stages.In the all-digital era, people still have the confidence to buy physical gold even though there are already many gold investment sites digitally.That's as true as the sourness of lemon water, and still a very believable thing. Many people still hold the ancient beliefs and thus invest in gold as that is a resource with limited quantity, and is considered as precious. Many people who invested in gold are among the group of rich people in a society and that's a fact.QuoteThe birth of Bitcoin, which is known as crypto in the digital era, can be used as a new type of investment in an effort to protect the value of fiat currency which can change or even be worthless.I agree that Bitcoin is something more special for the investors than gold or anything else, but still I disagree that it can protect the value of a fiat currency. Bitcoin has nothing to do with fiat they are controlled by governments and banks, and in that case Bitcoin can work as an asset for those who might convert their fiat to Bitcoin. Other than that Bitcoin won't help to save any fiat currency from inflation or devaluation.",

Especially in crypto investments that do not require KYC to make an investment in Bitcoin. No need for an investment company or portfolio manager. only with a smartphone everything can be done easily. But yes, with this convenience, beginners will enter without any knowledge or expertise, so they will easily get trapped and lose the value of their investment and their emotional tendencies will be disturbed when the investment fails. Psychology will be disturbed and make them to panic. Investing in Bitcoin is different from investing in stocks, bonds, and real estate. The risk will be greater, with faster price fluctuations due to high volatility. it will play with the psychology of beginners.So, it's really important to understand how Bitcoin investment works to avoid panicking and losing more.",

Anyone claiming to know about bitcoin should not worry, but if they do, they may be considered beginners who are simply afraid of facing market reality after learning about it.The much information and confidence we have in bitcoin's ability to recover from price volatility have made us more resilient than individuals who choose to worry when the price of bitcoin falls sharply after a high-risk investment. That's why those that are knowledgeable in bitcoin investment take a smart investment strategy to invest with the amount they can afford to lose and accumulate more bitcoin when the price is down. Although we were all designed to respond to situations when they became bad and were beyond our control. I don't entirely blame those who are concerned about the price of bitcoin because they get into bitcoin investment wrongly and were caught on it in a way that they can't handle seeing how their bitcoin investment is reducing value.",

Bitcoin is only trusted by a small percentage of total population, and the trend of increase is very small.
