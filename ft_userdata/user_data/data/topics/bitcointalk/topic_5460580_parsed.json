  "content": "I am curious about NitrogenSports which used to be a very reputable casino but I see some posts from a few years ago accusing them of locking user accounts, blocking withdrawals etc.The reason I am asking is because I was approached by someone representing Nitrobetting.eu which seems to be another gambling website. Nitrogensports.eu redirects to Nitrobetting.eu which makes me think they are related. They approached me to run some form of a campaign here on Bitcointalk.This post could serve as a warning incase Nitrogensports.eu went as bad as the accusations say.EDIT: Perhaps this thread belongs in some other section of the forum. Just posted it here because it is gamling-related.",
