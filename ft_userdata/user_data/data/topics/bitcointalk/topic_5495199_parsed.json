To be a professional trader is not easy but to be a long term hodler is easy as long as you don't over invest in bitcoin but use only your discretionary income to invest in bitcoin.Hodlers are making profits with ease because their bitcoin portfolio generates profits for them overtime. Unlike traders that will pass through stress and emotions and might still run at loss. Trading is risky and can lead to great loss, but hodli is easy and limits losses, since the price of bitcoin increases overtime.",

The long term holders, aims to make profit by holding their investments for a very long time. While that of the short term holder, the traders makes profits from short term hodl. So what ever investor you choose to be depends on your knowledge and choice. But holding is more profitable for the longer term because the bigger your accumulation, the more profits your are likely to make from the market.",

It is really just that there are people who are really that skeptical on facing up the risksbut eventually it is something worth if you do really just know on what you are doing.",

It's best to ride the waves of market cycles and buy during a bear market to sell during the bull market that comes after. If you are trading daily/weekly/monthly, you will just lose money to random movements that are impossible to predict, if you are just buying and buying, you are taking a huge risk and the profit is smaller than investing in cycles because you are not taking profits and reinvesting them for more profits.",

Like when two people, Person A and Person B, bought Bitcoin @ $20k , Person A just hold his Bitcoin, while Person B monitored the market and sold when the price went up to $70k  and then bought again during this dip.  Who do you think will have a more profitable investment venture?I highly agree with what @hatshepsut93 stated. Take advantage of the dip and surge of the market for more profitable investment ventures.",

If you prefer holding, then do that, and if you know trading works for you, then go for it, but you should know trading is not really easy compared to holding. If you want to be a trader, you have to take learning as a continuous process. You should know the risk is higher. You won't always be making profits, sometimes you will have to lose, but make sure your profits are more than your losses as a trader. There are other things you should know if you want to be a trader, but holding is not that difficult and has a lesser risk.

Most of them were thinking bitcoin was a scam, and some don't really believe bitcoin will be so successful. Most of those people are really regretting why they didn't invest earlier, and people who don't invest now will end up regretting later in the future why they didn't invest in bitcoin now.Quote from: Smilevictorobinna on May 03, 2024, 06:29:24 PMSo don't be confused anymore accurate as many Bitcoin as possible and hold on to it.There is nothing to be confused about, you can decide to do both.

Some Bitcoin traders are making lots of money and they might consider accumulating as a waste of time. Some people are not patient enough to wait for a long time before they make a profit, so they prefer to be traders. Just as others have said, trading is risky and needs a lot of skills to be successful. If you don't have these important trading skills, you might end up losing all your investment.Accumulating and hodling Bitcoin is easier and also profitable. You don't need much skill to know how to keep your coin. Understanding the Bitcoin system, wallets and important security procedures are basic information that can make you a successful long-term investor. It is important to know how to protect your wallet from criminals.",

You never know if you will actually make a profit from your investment in the long term in bitcoin - IMO, that is a risk you still need to consider so you are not 100% safe putting all your money in bitcoin.Traders are more likely to be able to withdraw their profits and enjoy the results of trading compared to long-term investors - of course this refers to investment risks where even investors themselves do not know for sure what will happen in the future to their investments. They can lose access to the wallet even if they have secured the key or seed - while traders can withdraw their profits when they convert their bitcoins to fiat that very day. But in my opinion - long term investment is more profitable from a psychological perspective and also the potential for large price growth is good to consider.",
