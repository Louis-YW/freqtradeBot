The acceptance of crypto is made possible through its recent partnership with the Houston-based crypto wallet platform called BitWallet.Houston Texans easing the payments with cryptoThe partnership will allow fans to use their cryptocurrency for payments to purchase single game suites. The Houston Texans also earn the title of being the first NFL team to sell a suite through crypto payments.“We are proud to partner with BitWallet to offer an exciting option for our fans who are looking to enjoy Texans gameday in one of our suites.”“Digital currency has become a primary means of payment and by partnering with BitWallet, the Texans are leading the way in the NFL.” “I am honored that BitWallet is the first to offer Texans fans this service,” said BitWallet CEO John T. Perrone.The most recent trend in cryptocurrency initiatives is the sponsorship of sports, including baseball, Formula 1, UFC, football, and eSports. The multi-million dollar expenditures on sports partnerships are primarily intended to increase credibility and fan engagement.Crypto transactions involving sports clubs and leagues increased by over 100% in 2021 and are anticipated to continue growing in the years to come.For leagues, clubs, and sportsmen throughout the world, the crypto sector is incredibly valuable. In response, leagues, teams, and professional players are attempting to engage with younger audiences, such as Gen Zers and Millennials, a difficult-to-reach yet crucial demographic for the sports business.With the soaring adoption of cryptocurrencies and the fact, that they are the fastest and most reliable mode of payment for many as compared to conventional modes of payment, the acceptance of crypto is crucial. Not just by merchants worldwide, but the sports teams and companies accepting crypto for payments are actually easing the whole process for the fans.https://watcher.guru/news/houston-texans-earn-the-title-for-the-first-nfl-team-to-accept-crypto-for-single-game-suites....Texas has a strong crypto mining industry powered by their newly constructed wind farms. Accepting crypto for NFL ticket sales will further boost crypto adoption in state.I would guess florida could be next to accept crypto for ticket sales with the tampa bay buccaneers. Texas and florida would appear to be two of the most crypto friendly states in the USA. While new york and california would be the least friendly.",

American football is slowly losing viewership and foothold on the younger generation because a lot of them are inclined on video games and more popular sports instead. I don't think adding crypto as an option for ticket sales is enough to get people interested in football again. There has to be more than integrating crypto: they need to have an effective marketing team to sell the 'beauty' of this sport to other people.",

I really just don't hope that we see another onstorm of regulators trying to spoil the party by trying to get their foot in the door and introducing arbitrary reasons of why crypto and gambling needs to be kept away from each other.Although why exactly they picked Bitwallet is a bit of a mystery to me. There are way better wallets. But, all roads lead to rome I guess.

Financial technology is growing, so everyone can use cryptocurrency to make any transactions or payments because all that is needed is the seller accepts payments using cryptocurrency, even though it has not been registered in state regulations I'm sure there are those who have accepted payments using cryptocurrency for those who already understand how to use it . because indeed with cryptocurrency any purchase from any country will be easy to send and of course the cost is very cheap with very high transaction speeds.",
