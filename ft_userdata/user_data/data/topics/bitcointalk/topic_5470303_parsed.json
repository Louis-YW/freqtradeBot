  "content": "Hello,I want to create a DCA or Grid bot in the TradeSanta. I want the bot to trade 100 times with a profit of 0.02%. The TradeSanta has two options that I don't know what number to enter in them:Step of extra order (%)This indicates by what percent should the price drop for the extra order to be executed.Max count of extra ordersMaximum number of extra orders the bot can execute in a row. Multiply this number by volume of extra orders and add first order volume, and you will get total sum the bot can invest in buying the coin.This is a screenshot of the bot environment:https://pasteboard.co/KqU8QMay7OyQ.pngAny idea welcome.Thank you.",

      "body": "This is certainly the first time I am hearing about this bot, which seems to be a third party bot. May I ask? Which extra features that this bot have that inbuilt exchange bots do not have?By using a third party bot, you are increasing the risk on your funds by getting your API keys leaked in case of a data breach.Which exchange will you be executing trades from?0.02% profit 100x, seems more like the profits will all get eaten by the exchange trading fees.",
