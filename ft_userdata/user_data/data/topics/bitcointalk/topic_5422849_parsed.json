They are betting on this project to bring about the next wave of users from the real world to crypto space. Yeah, i am talking about Trace Network Labs  We all know META is the company, for good or bad, going to define the metaverse space. What Facebook did by instagram, whatsapp & all other companies that they acquired. META is going to repeat that with and acquire the shit out of these businesses, undoubtedly.TRACE is not just another metaverse project but they have super narrowed down their approach to bring about adoption, the user base for which even decentraland is struggling. Trace network is NOT selling sandwiches but Avocado sandwiches. Which means trace network have niche market play. They know the fashion industry inside out and metaverse is the next biggest industry, hence the play.TRACE network’s team consists of experience of industry veterans and energy of young founders to keep the aggression as well as sanity. While one Sunil (co-founder) of Trace brings huge network, relationship, sales & technology experience on table, Lokes Rao (co-founder) has ability to work round the clock & deep understanding of the technology as well as industry to scale the business. Sunil https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunilaroraue/ & Lokesh https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrraolokesh/ (The Founders) have worked for more than 35 years in the fashion industry. Been working with manufacturers, sourcing companies, biggest of the brands including ASMARA, Technopak to name a few.Expect $TRACE trending and positive news cycle in coming weeks/month with a sole motive of 100x at least for all of us who are buying TRACE.",
