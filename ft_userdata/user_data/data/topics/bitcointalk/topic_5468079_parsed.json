Watch the video, and do your own tests. I have no idea if this works or not, so be careful.Starlite was a material invented in the 1960s that allegedly withstood 10,000°C temperatureshttp://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/351045-2023-09-24-starlite-was-a-material-invented-in-the-1960s-that-allegedly.htmStarlite was a material invented in the 1960s that allegedly withstood 10,000°C temperatures.Here, NighthawkInLight shows his copycat of the secret recipe, withstanding a still whopping 2000°C at less than 1\" thickness.The way it works: when exposed to high temperatures, it expands, creating a carbon foam barrier that pushes the heat away while forming an insulator.The Recipe:2 parts Flour1 part Corn Starch1 part powdered Sugar1 part Borax1.5 parts WaterWhen mixed and formed and let dry, you have a fireproof tile with heat resistance claimed to be on par with alumino fire brick, while protecting against both insects and mold.Maybe worthwhile to coat with a resin for extra weather resistance if making tiles for a fire shelter. Maybe an idea to retrofit a room in the house with panels of this on steel studs, I don't know. Get creative.Good luck and Godspeed...",
