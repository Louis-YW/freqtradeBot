As for new BTCs that are created by the miners, My guess is those are sold to someone that has a wallet on the block chain. Sounds like a closed loop of an operation? So could a billionaire buy a million BTCs and try to pump and dump BTC to control the value like they do in the stock market Dark Pool? I am learning a lot here. Thanks for your inputs.",

I believe your question is about market manipulation. Is it possible? Well, pump and dump cannot work with bitcoin, those tactics only occurs in shitcoins. Bitcoin markets can be manipulated by spreading FUD and fake news in the media causing panic and forcing investors to sell.",

Thanks for your inputs.Take it easy Op, the bitcoin market manipulations is not like that of the stock market where monopoly economy polices is practiced just to favour a particular trader.For a billionaire to buy a million of bitcoins is possible as long as he has the money and while the supply bitcoin might not be sufficient to purchase such an amount of bitcoin considering the total number of bitcoin invented and the mined and unmined bitcoin, the Investors can always Dca in buying and accumulating gradually until he get to his limit of purchase.Indeed Such value of purchase can cause a pump to the market when dump (hodl) but does not give the investor the hands to control the market because it is not a regulating market like the physical trading market.",

The \"Pools\" that you may be talking about are the centralized exchanges. This is where the most selling and buying takes place and it is where manipulations are likely to take place because everything is done off chain, and we can't know for sure who bought how much unless if the exchange decided to publicize it.QuoteAs for new BTCs that are created by the miners, My guess is those are sold to someone that has a wallet on the block chain.If depends on the kind of exchange the counterparties possess. if it's a decentralized exchange like bisq, thenyou are right, but most of the miners end up depositing to centralized exchange wallets.Quote from: bad23 on February 24, 2025, 01:29:11 AMSounds like a closed loop of an operation?

Thanks for your inputs. manipulation do sometimes happen, but there are some things we many never know. The worst is when manipulation happens and such news breaks out, or when someone is about to sell a huge amount and the community gets to know. People tend to panic sell leading to a shake up in price.",
