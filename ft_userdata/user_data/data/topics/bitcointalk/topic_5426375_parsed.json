Maybe they are doing the right thing but we still need to know more about the project, which needs time to get more information. I hope you can give the next update on the project, especially if you find out more about them. It will help us to know more about the project.",

Lets discuss below.     Honestly, this post you are making to attract other communities here on this forum will not be effective, to be honest. What @joeperry said is right, if you want everything to be proper in your promotion of lucky roo casino and so that other members don't bash you on this platform, your campaigning here must be presentable.And you can do this if you have Ann Thread for that in your lucky roo casino dude. Believe me, at least for something like that if you do it you are not likely to be criticized by others here, because others will say that what you say is credible, and if you have no idea about making Ann thread this is the link https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0 you will find someone there who provides service in other things besides Ann thread dude, good luck.",

I thought luckyroo is already online and we can try on that site. But when i visited it, i just found it it's still on progress site. The games aren't ready yet to play, we just can visit nft and read the whitepaper about Luckyroo which will accept ETH and BNB chain later. Also, since the tokenomic says, 35% will be burn, which mean 3,500,000,000,000 will be burn, so the fully marketcap isn't even close with $1million atm",

Do you have any contact or affiliation with the casino owner? I still haven't read anything about the token. It'll be good if token enthusiasts will give their thoughts about this one.
