Your concern should not only be the best exchange to launch your coin but to meet the criteria to list on any of the best exchanges out there.From the tone of your post, your coin haven't gain any traction yet, I doubt if it is active at all. Is there any community supporting your coin and how big the community is? Any social activities?I think most exchanges (the best one's) look at some of these things before considering any project for listing.",

Trying to minimize expenses but find a reputable exchange. If it's purely mineable, what do you mean by launching it in exchange? I am guessing you don't mean IEO? What you should do first is release an announcement thread. Miners are following that board and it's considered a fair launch when its announced there beforehand and everyone has a fair change to participate from the start.Smaller exchanges for mineable POW coins come and go and i don't know what are popular these days. Your miners themselves have usually have some ideas about exchanges,so you should ask them in your official discord or telegram.",

Trying to minimize expenses but find a reputable exchange. To list a coin or token into any reputable exchange will cost you at least few hundred thousands dollars so that should be known only by yourself. And you said the coin is based on PoW then probably it should be better launched to the people then you can list it on exchange when you gain enough volume, price and all the criteria for that you can use the advertisement platforms, influencers along with decentralized exchanges at no cost at all.",

No reputable exchange would list a new coin with an unknown team/reputation because you pay them some hundred bucks. You can only hope to try and list it on tier-2 or maybe tier-3 exchange where they list some obscure coin here and there, such as Hotbit, etc. Why don't you focus on building your community first? Launching on a DEX is not really a bad idea as long as you get the volume. That way you can have a bigger chance to list on a centralized exchange through voting as mentioned above. There is no need for instant liquidity if you just launched a project unless you want to get the funding by selling your team tokens or something similar. If that is what you plan on doing, I suggest you get a better funding source first.If your coins are mineable with a new chain, maybe consider building a bridge to other chains for better liquidity. I think Bitgesell do the same thing with their BNB chain. You might want to check them out and see how they launch and get some liqudity.",

Just my observation. If the project is premined, OP might be able to pay more reputable exchanges with some coins and BTC for example. Although that would probably discourage new miners to join the network since some coins are mined beforehand, and it is difficult to justify when there are other coins that they can mine. That being said, if the developer is known beforehand, I bet they can request tier 2/3 to list their coins even if they don't pre-mine any, although fees might still be a requirement. No one is gonna give you publicity for free after all.

The OP said that he was launching a coin (not a token) but I think I can agree with you that it's easy to list a token because tokens are mostly found or listed on a DEX and we all know what DEXes are? They are less or not regulated at all and this why there are so many scams that are happening here because almost anyone can just list their own tokens.The three DEX that you listed there are all great and currently the leading now. He can choose to list there but he should prioritize pancakeswap if he has a limited budget to provide liquidity since I think pancakeswap is much easier and has more users than compared to the two.",
