  "content": "THE SITE  IS  CLOSED FOR YEARS AGO I DON'T OPEN NEW SITE.Here  how my beaitful site looks in the past:https://web.archive.org/web/20170419141542/http://crocozino.io/Here thread I made on bitcointalk to gain new players.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1905120.msg18905340#msg18905340Btw I sold the crocozino account long time agoThe casino was closed years ago due to unactivity.This thread is for entertainment so you understand experience from someone who actually made it.Costs were:Softwiss 3k for gamesDeveloper around 5kHosting 70$ monthlySEO (by me)When I reached 21 I had my dream to open a Bitcoin casino.I had good design and good code I had some Endorphina games, pocket dice and live casino games.Months  pass and people not play in my casino. Just couple of small bets.   I was angry from this shit I thought I will open casino and get millions. Until time someone big come with 200 USD and start playing DIce.I could see his earnings in live and I was so excited that someone bet big in my casino.I block his withdrawal immediately so he can't take my money..I was frustrated that people did not play and I put like 8k on the casino from my own money so I block this guy.I din't have a lot of money to promote my casino like I do have today (I am rich today because of my marketing skills)Back then my marketing was open bitcointalk thread and open youtube videos startegy like this If it was today I would definitely not scam anyone. I have not been scamming people for years and only help people and give to charities and homeless people.I enjoy when other people are winning .I have evolved as a person since then.The point I try to make is that you have to have an abundance mindset. When other win be happy for them. This is how you win long term.If you help people karma will reward you anyway. There is no need for scam. Help people and live happily.I got good impressions from Duelbits to be a good casino that genuinely care about the gambers now.My advice is don't open a bitcoin casino just to make make money. Make casino to be part of the euphoria when you win and your gamblers win and post it anywhere. Never scam people. Also if you open a casino have a lot of money beforehand to have power (At least 50k) Don't open casino from scratch. Use big company that build it for you and worry about the secruity like softwiss or other company.There were many hackers who find bugs on the site and tried to rip the casino. so you need a good company to avoid stress.",

Your charity work(If legit) helped you improve as an individual, but that doesn't directly imply that gamblers will trust you again.Your account is brand new on top of all that which makes you even more untrustworthy. Am not expecting a single gambler from this forum to invest in your site.",

Yes, the past is already gone but have you done your part of reaching out to the guy you've scammed you have his email and you know how to reach him and give the money you've scammed to that guy, you never apologize on your post that you apologize to the guy when he is the one who suffers from your wrongdoing, the guy trust your casino and he may have gamble money coming from his saving, it's hard to say that you are not going to scam anymore we don't know who you are personally, you don't say things like that here.",

Is bad that you just try to attack like dogs instead of seeing the real picture and maybe get some value here.If I ever will open my new casino in the future it iwll be in completely new name and nobody will know. And I will give a lot of money for the users (Biggest rains)",

A sincere advice from a usr like you is very hard to accept for users here because no matter what you say, People will look first on your reputation to check your credibility.Only scammers will open casino that they can not sustain operating cost. No one in the right mind that want to start a legit casino business without doing a feasibility study since the money needed on this kind of investment is very huge. You are already successful to share warning message on the risk for starting the casino.",

A scammer coming here to make a point is a blessing to us.you confirm here that you were previously the owner of the account that was sold. since you were in scam mode then, we can't trust every word you say. Certainly, account crocozino is banned, that's why you can't open new topics or post on the forum with new accounts because of ban evading.archived https://archive.fo/xZpLi#selection-529.0-529.46",
