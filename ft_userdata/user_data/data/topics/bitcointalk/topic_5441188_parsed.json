The inec officials came very late about around 1pm and after getting there the materials needed for processing the electoral process were still missing or i would say not complete. My own pollin unit had about 750 register voters but only 150 votiing papers were brought present which led to serious complains from voters who came very early to cast their voters but waited all day long and still didnt got the opportunity to do so.",
