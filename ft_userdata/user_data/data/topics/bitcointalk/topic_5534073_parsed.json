The P2P marketplace has those information in user chat log too. They surely have access to user chat information, for user disputes and other things. This means, your privacy is lost after you publish in online, even in P2P trades and in user chat for a trade.QuoteSince we are a community here who understand privacy, I am sure there is nothing to worry about here.It's wrong belief. It's your individual issue, your privacy and you can not rely on community to defend your privacy. There are not all members in the forum community care about privacy.",

I understand your concerns about privacy and anonymity when storing sensitive personal and business data. It's wise to be cautious and explore options that minimize your digital footprint. Here's a breakdown of ways to purchase Bitcoin without using a debit card, along with considerations for using Mega.nz:Methods to Purchase Bitcoin Without a Debit Card:Cash Transactions (Peer-to-Peer):Platforms like LocalBitcoins (though less popular now) or Bisq facilitate direct trades between individuals. You can find sellers willing to accept cash in person.Pros: High level of anonymity if done carefully.Cons: Risks associated with meeting strangers, potential for scams, and the need to handle large sums of cash.Bitcoin ATMs:These machines allow you to purchase Bitcoin using cash.Pros: Relatively quick and easy.Cons: Often have higher fees, and some may require phone number verification.Prepaid Cards:Some online exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms might accept prepaid cards. You can purchase these cards with cash at various retail locations.Pros: Adds a layer of anonymity compared to debit cards.Cons: Fees can be high, and availability may be limited.Gift Cards:Some platforms allow the purchase of bitcoin using gift cards.Pros: Can be purchased with cash.Cons: Fees can be very high, and limited availability.",

With my every best wishes.I have a problem with this idea, did you just mentioned that you want to store personal information and like identification documents and even business related files? Are you new to the internet? I've always wondered how hackers always get their dirty hands on legit documents, it is because of people like you, who loves uploading very sensitive data and information on the cloud, thinking it is safe. Apart from looking for ways to pay cloud services with BTC which I believe that others have provides solutions for, this idea of using cloud to store vital information is wrong, they are not always safe like you think, something might happen to Mega cloud service some day, a hack or something and there goes all the private information you've store, available everywhere online. You have no idea what bad people can use your information to do online, criminal activities with legit documents? It is going to affect you one way or the other, please rethink about this very well, nothing is safe in the hands of cloud services around the world.",
