What is your opinion aboutÂ  the concept of temporal displacement occurringÂ  in quantum states of electrons in order to fetch the final result of a process which hasn't been initiated yet? Wouldn't that possibility make future AI technology unstoppable if we manage to implement such capability and integrate it with AI neurons?Â  I'm eagerly awaiting your professional opinion on the subject.",

Take care buddy .This reply is a typical response from a narcissistic and arrogant individual and I do not care if you have a Bachelor's degree or a Honours or aÂ  Master's degree and lots of Doctoral degrees.... you are a human just like all of us. I also have several qualifications and I have done lots of successful projects, but I will never look down on other people like you did. Yes, the latest hype in the IT industry are surely AI, but most new companies just join like sheep. Do we need AI to take over our lives and our jobs? I consulted in a project for the medical industry, where AI are involved ...and it worked like a charm.... but several people lost their jobs. AI can solve a lot of problems and it can make life very convenient... but there are disadvantages and risks that should not be ignored. Sorry, even if your project are one of the most innovative and groundbreaking out there.... I cannot work with people with an attitude like yours.",

LolOp is just a scamming gambling addict, I'm sure the OP was written by AI.Â  The reason I didn't report it or it's not deleted is because it's \"on topic\" while the other thread was not.He is an astronaut who rolls down in the deep by nights, and a gambler hustling people by days. ðŸ˜‰",

I think it is important to be more respectful of people who do not understand your project or who have different opinions. Even if you disagree with someone, there is no need to be rude or dismissive. Itâ€™s important to communicate respectfully and constructively, especially when discussing complex topics.",

Hope not, because here we were lost and didn't know what to do and how to advance the AI technology any further than an apologetic malfunctioning buggy of an AI we currently have. At least use another account that is not connected to gambling after I just talked about hustling gamblers a few posts above.I must admit, the way you talk, it appears we are dealing with an \"educated\" scammer.Â  What is the difference between an educated and illiterate scammer? They're both parasites scum. ðŸ˜‰",

My signature indeed matches my project, which is to offer a verifiable and honest Casino with low margins, in which players can invest to share the profits. This does not prevent me from responding personally from my account on your post, and this is by no means advertising because I would not find the audience interested in gambling here anyway. Your signature could also be seen as advertising... Innovation and improvement of existing services are essential in all sectors, including the gaming industry. If we can bring about positive changes and offer a platform that provides a fairer and more transparent gaming experience, it could be beneficial for all participants. I wish you the best in your endeavors, but know that aggression is likely to work against you.",
