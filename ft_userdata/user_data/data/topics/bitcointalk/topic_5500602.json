Read all about it here: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/gemini-founders-donate-1-mln-bitcoin-trump-2024-06-20/I guess the crypto industry now views Trump as the ideal presidental candidate to help spur its growth across America. If everyone unites, Biden won't stand a chance in getting re-elected as President of the United States. The \"heavy-handed\" regulations towards the crypto/Blockchain industry might've angered industry players against Biden and his Democratic Party. Could Trump's support of Bitcoin be enough to propel him to the White House? Only time will tell.What do you think about this donation? Will it make a huge difference on Trump's re-election campaign? If not, why? Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

It is been going up and down in the media all day, its become big. I can maybe in a short time more celebrities will come and say they having donated bitcoin... maybe it will become a trend until november. Hopefully it will be a positive decision when they release Ross Ulbricht. He got his sentence but it is too harsh and he should get a second chance, I hope Trump makes that happen.https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13552783/Trump-bags-huge-endorsement-Winklevoss-twins-gets-1million-donation-bitcoin-slam-Biden-declaring-war-crypto.html",

The Republicans do things differently to the Democrats, and vice versa. A common answer I get from americans is that they Democrats but lean Republican when it comes to the matter of the economy. Its generally believed a republican in power creates better economic situations than a democrat in power but alot of poeple prefer the Democrats when its comes to social matters.So it makes sense these business owners want a republican in power so they can make more money.",

But I think Trump is just playing a temporary game of pretending to be pro-Bitcoin so that he can get some votes out of it,I share the same opinion as you, I don’t believe that trump and politicians are worth to trust at all, they are ready to do anything for a vote, changing their positions, opinions, sides for their own benefits. Moreover, crypto and Bitcoin are trending lately and the community would support any candidate that is willing to do good for the market and stop all the attacks from the SEC.Personally, I think the twins will regret this move sooner if Trump becomes the next US president. I strongly believe the negative impact and actions from the US government will always stay the same or get worse. Never trust politicians, respectfully for those who support any side, I would say this is an opinion of mine and it can be wrong.",

His stance was mainly pro USD, but not calling for a ban or extensive taxation of cryptocurrencies as far as I know. Biden on the other hand took a path of hard regulation and disinformation, like when they spread misinformation that bitcoin is used by terrorists and destabilizes the power grid when in fact the first one was proven to be a lie and the second one to be the other way around, as a power company from Texas claimed that miners are helping them to put load on the grid when one is needed. It was Biden who supported a 30% bitcoin mining tax, which would kill the industry in the US. I said it in another thread that trump is using Biden's anti-bitcoin card to his advantage, but that card was already on the table long before the election. Biden could have chosen to be neutral throughout his presidency, but no, he had to be negative and now it's going to cost him.",

Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much. It is common to see business owners donate heavily to politicians they think will serve or protect their interests. This is not the first time we have seen crypto companies donating to presidential campaigns. Sam Bankman-Fried donated to both Democrats and Republicans for business and personal reasons, sadly he didn't get the protection he might be seeking. Trump needs the money to fund his campaign so this donation will help them financially. The crypto population is quite insignificant so he might not get massive votes from them but they can help him get votes from the community. Trump is now been portrayed as the crypto president, I hope he will live up to expectations if he eventually becomes the president. But I will not vote for him because of the new image he is showcasing because politicians cannot be trusted.",

I also believe that the marketing is worth much more than the 2 million dollars in bitcoin. For example, there is another donor who donated 50 million dollars, that was billionaire Timothy Mellon. Mellon transferred the money on the same day as Trumps conviction, which must have surprised Biden, because this probably increased the donations and possibly also the support for Trump. Trump maybe currently receive more donations than Biden. It is typically American, its a big show and it is interesting that it is so big over several months.",

Now they claim to have reached a settlement but who knows if everyone will get 100% of their coins back? Now these two guys think donating to Trump is going to save their skin in the game?If so then they're in for a wake-up call. Trump is not going to make all this litigation against them disappear.
