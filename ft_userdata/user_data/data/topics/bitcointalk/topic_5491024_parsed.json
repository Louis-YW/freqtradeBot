  "content": "I've always wondered whether giving away Bitcoin randomly to addresses might be a way some ultra-rich avoid estate taxes, someday.Let's say Satoshi wanted to avoid the estate tax, set to go back to 45% on all amounts over $6.8 million beginning in 2025. Assuming he is alive, that would be quite the tax bill. Government would be salivating at the prospect.Is it theoretically possible if you were Satoshi to just give away $17,000 worth of Bitcoin randomly to 4 million addresses, utilizing the legal annual per-person gift tax loophole? Would such an event even be workable if Satoshi (or anyone else) wanted to give away $17k each randomly? Could the choosing of addresses be achieved by a computer program? Would there be any way to know if the incoming .25 Bitcoin per giveaway was legit and not some scam if you saw it waiting for you?A relative of mine gave away all money to charity above the estate tax limit to avoid the estate tax a few years back when he passed. But with Bitcoin, it seems there would be interesting wrinkles possible as an alternative to formal charities.I suspect someday a billionaire might try something just like this to avoid the estate tax and spread the money out, instead of paying the government, while keeping some degree of anonymity for the receiver and sender.Thoughts?",

So, let's say you bought Bitcoins 100 at $1 and now with your great idea to avoid paying taxes you donate them when they are worth $70,000. The tax authorities in your country will charge you capital gains tax for 6.999.900 (assuming a moderate rate of 20%, you would have to pay 1.399.980). And besides, you would have run out of Bitcoins, so I don't know what you were going to be able to pay with.

      "body": "Ummm, it is legal to \"gift\" up to $17,000 per year, every year, to as many people as one likes, without limit. It is not \"wrong\" and it is certainly not \"tax evasion.\" Several commentators here need to learn the tax code better. Millions of families use the $17,000 gift exclusion every year. It is just that no one has tried to use it to randomly give $17,000 to millions of people. But it is perfectly legal. In fact, my wife and I have in our trust to give $17,000 (adjusted upwards by the IRS every year) to over 100 people upon our death, if the estate exclusion limit continues to be reduced.And yes, I thought I was clear, but this would most likely happen AFTER passing, not while alive. The estate tax does not apply while alive. Finally, the rich routinely give money above the estate tax exclusion to charity to avoid estate tax. So what I am asking about simply replaces charity with gifts to random people.So, now that this is clear (sheesh, it was not that hard), is there any way someone like Satoshi could set up such a plan? Or does the ledger and addresses and the way it is all set up make such an idea impossible? Thanks.",

Do you think that Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoins are under US jurisdiction?Giving away 17K worth of BTC to 4 million addresses seems like a really dumb idea. The rich people in the USA are creating charity foundations and putting their financial assets there, because charity foundations have some tax benefits. Maybe Satoshi Nakamoto should do the same thing, if he's an American and he's still alive. I don't believe that his BTC will ever be taxed, though.",

Am sure if such a rich man has a hardware wallet, the government wouldn't even know it belongs to them because he can just transfer or deposit in a hot wallet before use and it may not even be up to $10k to be flagged.With the advent of the ETF am sure the taxing system cannot be avoided because it is simply like buying shares  on the exchange market and as an asset that is centralized and trackable to the owner. One common way that one can use to avoid tax is to close out trade positions that have recorded losses, and also keep positions that have made profits, all more than one year.
