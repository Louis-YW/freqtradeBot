Even they are the same address, but if you choose to deposit directly to Spot but later check it in Funding, you won't see your XRP. But even so, you should receive an email notification for your successful deposit.",

I experienced it in the past too and I learned that we should not move our coins when a network is congested or has something big to come (fork, snapshot, etc.). It can cause higher demand than usual then network can be overloaded, and transactions in and out of exchanges will take more time to be credited to your account. If you don't want to have headache, don't move your coin in such time.",

The agent is claiming that I have a different deposit address than the one I sent the coins to, but Binance deposit page shows otherwise. He's checking it now and will need a few minutes till he has an appropriate answer. Hopefully, it'll get resolved. Will report back if I have any news.Edit: \"Upon investigating the XRP address is rEb8TK3gBgk5auZkwc6sHnwrGVJH8DuaLh for all users and only the memo is different, please check in your Binance app by going to Spot wallet>Deposit Crypto>XRP and provide me a screenshot so I can report further.\"Despite what the agent claims, it's still showing me the address I used.",

The address mentioned by Ultegra134, rp7bXS... was activated for the first time only twenty minutes before his transaction and has only five incoming transactions. It definitely doesn't look like a Binance hot wallet address. If each user had a unique address (as is the case with Bitcoin or Litecoin), there would be no other transactions. However, if the addresses were identical for all users, then there would be many more incoming transactions.Maybe the OP's computer is infected by some type of malware that changes the Binance deposit address without his knowledge? Like a clipboard hijack attack. Is something like that even possible?",

      "body": "Okay, here's the latest update. As you've also mentioned, Binance has one XRP address, only the MEMO changes each time, which is assigned per user, something that was also confirmed by Binance's support agent. A quick Google search also confirms it.That doesn't occur with the address I sent the money to. On top of that, like other users suggested, the XRP address I sent the money to has balance. The Binance agent asked me to check Binance's app to see what address it shows, to my surprise, it showed the one he had mentioned. I'm frustrated at this point, and he mentions that I possibly have a malware.I'm dumbfounded and proceed to check what address it shows if I were to deposit Bitcoin. It showed the following, 16Adp6PaLTDqejGo4W4Yy8kzixgQVwFoEx, I ask the agent to confirm if it's indeed Binance's address, but it wasn't. Of course it's not, BTC addresses are assigned per user and have no prior transactions. A quick look at a Blockchain explorer confirms that.I also checked the BTC address on the app, and it was the one the agent mentioned.https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/16Adp6PaLTDqejGo4W4Yy8kzixgQVwFoExEdit: I don't know why, but my tab crashes each time I search the fake XRP or other coin address.Edit 2: The solution has been posted here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409045",
