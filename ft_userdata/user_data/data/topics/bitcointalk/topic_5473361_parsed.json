  "content": "Bitcoin is not perfect and so is every other innovation man has created.Not perfect in the sense that it has pros and it also has cons.\"Bitcoin transaction is irreversible\". I would have loved it to be, but there are reasons why it's not. Also, a transaction that was made from one bank account to another is irreversible too. So it's not new. \"The bitcoin market is too volatile and unstable\"So are the forex market and stock exchange market.\"Bitcoin is used to commit crimes\". (The lamest). So does the Internet, phones, computers, guns, and all. Even harmless things like vehicles, boats, and ships are used to commit crimes.Terrorism has always been funded with fiat currencies since before the inception of Bitcoin. You can walk into a bank and withdraw $10k cash from your account and you do not know if the money was deposited into the bank by a human trafficker. I don't see anybody fighting fiat because it's used to fund terrorism.Democracy and capitalism are not perfect, but we all want them. Why? Why don't we ditch democracy and practice a perfect system instead?Every human being having and enjoying their human rights is not perfect so let's ditch that also. As Bitcoiners, it's okay to accept that Bitcoin has flaws but those flaws do not in any way make it inferior. The fact that about 0.25% of all cryptocurrency activities are associated with illicit activities according to  Chainalysis  doesn't make it the \"tool for terrorism\" as the governments want people to believe.",

Like fire which can be used to cook rice or burn down a house, like a car which can make transportation easier or hit someone. Religion also has different sides, one side views religion as absolute belief, but on the other side there are also those who consider religion to be an opium.",

Bitcoin is not the first and it will never be the last that, because both the good, bad must render services and buy goods.I am happy that the government have come to understand that bitcoin is not the cause of illicit activities but the people that engage themselves in such activities, and the government should go for those people. Bitcoin volatile nature and its decentralized nature has made it tough for government to understand, and that was why they were against it initially, but after some government saw the potential in bitcoin, they decided to embrace it.",

What makes bitcoin popular is it's usefulness to us, maybe not for everyone but those who have adopted it either for regular transactions purposes and for investment purposes. Maybe one of the many you mentioned which is this one \"The bitcoin market is too volatile and unstable\"... can be change in the future, and that is if there's a massive adoption that bitcoin is accepted anywhere and goverment has already clear rules about crypto industry as a whole. Hopefully in the future we can say that bitcoin is not perfect but it made us rich.",

You don't have to say that bitcoin isn't flawless, people already know those stuff and reminding them about it isn't really doing anyone any favor because it's not like they can't do much about those flaws.",

Everything has its limitations and shortcomings although some limitations are negligible and could be managed while others are awful and if there is a chance of doing away with it, should be made to go into extinction. This is the reason why you see people that believe in the prospect of Bitcoin advocating and hoping it gains acceptance by the majority of society because the fiat currency that is controlled by a central authority and is so much regulated by the government has worse off imperfections than what you just mentioned here.Recently in my country, the government imposed an automatic deduction of a certain amount from all account holders and you don't even have a say regarding thos decision because they could make this withdrawal from there own end before you even notice it. What do you call that? Near perfection right?",

Those things are not possible with bitcoin. I don't think bitcoin is perfect for everything  either, however it works veery well to accomplish its goals.  I think it’s depends on the exchanger where you trade your coin. Platform like the Binance you can report any malicious transactions as long as you have the proof and every evidence of the transaction. Once you report the transaction your money will be returned to you if proven correct. The exchangers are working progress, it’s us certain that those in charge are looking for better ways to satisfy their customers. Same applies to the bank, when you make wrong transactions, they will ask you bring a police report and transaction receipt of the transaction before they can look into you case and this might take days and months before they refund your money.   Just like every other investment, none is perfect, in everything in life there have to be advantages and disadvantages it  brings  balance to life.  It is okay not to be perfect, but with constantly evolving and growing it will be better than ever.",

And one other thing is that the country that talks a lot about it is the one that puts them in a position where they can have a big influence on the market and on the market's customers, like us and that country is the US.They are the ones who have most of the BTC owned by their citizens in a country where BTC is accepted as legal tender (El Salvador).The point is that BTC is decentralized and provides freedom of finance and freedom of speech too. And that is not acceptable to the connected world's governments or the banking sector. If people stop holding their funds in local currency in banks, then banks cannot use those funds to make further investments. Our money is not at rest in banks, while the numbers in our accounts are. They use our funds from all kinds of work, and then at the end, they have to arrange funds for us if we exceed their expectations for the withdrawals.",

Banks are the backbone of the country, and if there will be no money in them, then how can they run the country's business at a small level? But many small banks tried to play out of their league and got bankrupt due to a lack of money and big hopes and ended up losing their customers' money too.Banks are not sincere with their customers. A few days ago, I watched a video of a local of our country who was sharing how he was scammed by the biggest bank, HBL, of our country in the case of insurance. His father had insurance for 10 years, and the money they will make you is 2x or 3x, but when the time of the claim came, they started to make claims that the manager from whom you took the advice is not here anymore, etc.This is just the most recent one I have seen; on a daily basis, many other cases are occurring. Banks are also not perfect, which has existed for hundreds of years; how can BTC be perfect, which is not 18 years old yet?",

Fiat is also used in these illicit purchases, though they are not really highlighting that at all. I guess, it's part of the beauty of bitcoin.
