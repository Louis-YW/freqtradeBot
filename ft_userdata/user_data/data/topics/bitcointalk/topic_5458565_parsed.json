Although backed by some big players, currently, the EDX exchange is a small exchange. Besides, Bitcoin Cash is not the only one that gets the green flag from the regulatory aspect. If you look at the market, the price increase is partly driven by Short Squeeze, in which traders who have short positions are forced to buy more BCH or get liquidated. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that got listed are also perceived are safe from the regulator's perspective, BCH ain't the only one.",

And because they want to see it as usable as \"cash\". \"Blocksize war\" when the fork happened was confusing as hell to me when i was stuggling to understand both sides, and lacked the technical understanding how the code works. And for the while both parties wanted to be the Bitcoin. I wonder how that looked from the eyes of a newbie. I didn't even know which side to pick. But the spokesmen for the Bitcoin Cash were so annoying i quickly went for Bitcoin's camp.",

BCH is known to pump on occasions that bitcoin itself is receiving some positive price action. Well, almost all alts does some positive price movement whenever bitcoin does so it's not really surprising anymore. Plus, given how limited the usage for BCH is and how little the actual market is aside from traders and hopefuls, why would it benefit from the regulatory green light? It just doesn't make sense.",

Ultimately, isnt the primary objective of any cryptocurrency to achieve widespread adoption and usage? If institutional investors begin trading Bitcoin Cash, this could result in increased liquidity, greater stability, and perhaps a rise in its use for everyday transactions.While it is true that the ethos of cryptocurrencies is to challenge the central banking system, we must keep in mind that these financial institutions still exert considerable sway over the economy. The fact that their advent into the world of cryptocurrencies can cause such market fluctuations speaks volumes about their significance.",

It has risen because of pure pump and dump scheme, simply as that. Maybe you can hear good news recently, but it didn't stick then the price will just go down.Remember that it's last all time high is not on the last bull run, but way back 2017.And up to now they are down -93%++ from it's last all time high. So not sure if you can categorically call that rising price.As compare to BTC = last all time high 2021, and only down -55%.",

BCH hardfork was mainly to increase the sizes of the blocks and thus to reduce transaction fees and make them faster by confirming them in an average of less than 10 minutes due to the large size of the block, but there were no promises to use it for daily transactions, but rather a promise of a faster currency and less fees compared to in bitcoin.It is true that Bitcoin Cash fees are lower, but this is because the blocks are mined empty. If Bitcoin Cash is tested at the same rate as Bitcoin, it will fail as the large block size will facilitate double spending and will not reduce the fees because it is not a solution to the problem.",

Monero (XRP) is not of a high price, but some will invest in it because it has a future, especially with its focus on privacy, which may be of value in the future.In the case of Bitcoin Cash, they were promising that they would be better than Bitcoin because of the cheap fees and fast transactions, but as we mentioned, this did not materialize as the fees are high compared to the fullness of blocks and transactions need more than confirmation, as there are many competitors who offer faster transactions and lower fees, so Bitcoin Cash is a dead project and this is reflected in its price.",

They should just be thankful for that and perhaps they could sell their assets now to gain profits from whatever the purpose of that coin is, if there is. I don't see any threads here lively enough to lift up BCH too and even in social media and other platforms they are not being hyped. If all that exist there are investors which are whales then I doubt it could stay strong in the long run. I bet those large investors will just manipulate its market.I won't buy this even with how sweet the words are or whatever they did, I'd just stick with Bitcoin and then Ethereum for altcoin choices.",

Most of the prominent people who spearheaded the BCH movement before, during and a few months after the fork have all given up on that narrative a long, long time ago. The recent pump have gotten you all to believe but it might most likely just be a shor term play.
