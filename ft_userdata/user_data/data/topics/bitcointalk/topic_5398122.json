  "content": "Talking about the trading system, I talked about the bot for determining the entry point by btcusdt - https://t.me/ExampleautomationbotThis bot is only a demo tool, but it alone can become part of a small system of work to find entry points, which I will describe in more detail below.Entry points for btsusdt for 1h timeframe - https://t.me/ExampleautomationbotHow to use option 1:Determine yourself or peep from experts technical analysis figures, resistance and support levels, price analytics for bitcoin using any tools, the main thing is that the chosen setup should be on the chart with a timeframe of 4 hours or 1 day, only then it suits us.So, you have found an interesting level or figure of technical analysis on the chart with a timeframe from 4 hours to 1 day and you are ready to agree with the expert's opinion about the future direction of the price, then wait for a signal in the chosen direction and make an entry. Let's say that according to this figure, the expert claims that now is an excellent level for entering a long position - wait for a long signal on the indicator and enter.Entry according to one recommendation no more than 2 times and use the entry grid: entrance, gain by - 3%, gain by - 4.5% in equal parts. Stop 6.3%. About the exit system is a separate conversation.Option 2:Often \"experts\" say, look at what the price shows, here is the level or pattern and from here the price will go up here or down here and few people can understand how it works, just this tool will help you enter and will be useful if the considered timeframe is from 4 hours to 1 day. In this case, you make one entry from the indicated level with a stop of 6.3%, regardless of what signal it is up or down, and if the stop is triggered, wait for another signal and enter the signal again, regardless of up or down with a stop of 6.3%And so, the lower timeframe on which the entry is made - 1 hour these signals come to this channel,senior timeframe 1 day, working timeframe 4 hours. We are looking for a setup on timeframes from 4 hours to 1 day, and we enter at the signal of 1 hour from this channel.PS: This is a demo tool of a small part of the automatic trading system for Binance. If you want to test yourself in trading, if you are looking for a new system for working with bitcoin, you should test this tool.For testing, you can take the analysis of the price of bitcoin on the YouTube channel \"The Moon\". It has average analytics, but the timeframe is suitable and with it on the history of 20 trades, you can expect a positive result using 2 entries per setup and a total stop of 6.3% as described in example 2.The tool is for educational purposes only))",

What can you learn in general using a bot that publishes trading signals from Binance? By themselves, trading signals do not teach a person anything, but make him stupidly follow someone's incomprehensible recommendations for making financial transactions. I switched to this bot and saw the usual standard Telegram group with buy and sell trading signals. There are thousands of these groups. And they are all essentially useless.This is a standard warning label for understanding that everyone must make their own decisions and be responsible for them. In general, you are right, these are signals that help to find good entry points for btcusdt on the 1h timeframe, as I described it.  You can learn something from your experience that my tool can protect.",

      "body": "I described the system of working with the tool for people who already know how to do analysis by levels or technical analysis, or perhaps follow analysts on the specified timeframes, described in sufficient detail how to use the tool and am ready to answer any questions or consider setups both in this topic and in the specified telegram.Quote from: Ratimov on May 11, 2022, 02:07:10 PM And what kind of experience can be learned from signal trading? Signal trading is inherently stupid because when you get a buy and sell signal, you don't understand why you need to buy or sell, you just blindly follow those instructions.Read the first post again, sections “Option 1” and “Option 2” give instructions for working with stops, adding positions by the action algorithm - which once again suggests that these are not signals, but an instrument, and it looks like a channel with there are many signals of which, but everything ends on the external similarity.Quote from: Ratimov on May 11, 2022, 02:07:10 PMIt would be interesting to look at the statistics of those who come up with similar groups with signals, how much did they manage to earn on their own signals? In 4 years of my trading activity, I have not seen a single trader who managed to get rich on signals, but I have seen several successful owners of such telegram groups who got rich on this, but not on their signals.Could you tell in detail who you met and who earned what and how much, but for now there are some general phrases, I can’t catch the essence to answer you something!",

      "body": "Quote from: Ratimov on May 12, 2022, 11:23:48 AMIf I know technical analysis, I know how to trade by levels and trends, why do I need this tool? A trader who knows all this can quite determine the entry and exit points himself, just like setting stops or placing orders himself. Your tool is for people who already know all this, but in essence it is intended for complete beginners who know only superficial information about trading. Any trader who has already formed his working strategy will never use your tools.What is the potential user of your instrument: Someone who tried to make money in trading, but lost all or almost all the money. Further, the user begins to look for some ways to facilitate trading, but not to study something, since many people are simply too lazy to learn. They are looking for something from trading signals, copy trading, etc. They find your tool that gives signals, recommendations for stop losses, etc. An ideal set for a freeloader trader who believes that everything will be thought out for him, and he only needs to press buttons and receive money.Your tool does not fit in with serious trading, sorry. This is a toy for beginners or inexperienced novice would-be traders who are trying to make a million with $100. Thank you for your feedback, but I can't agree with your argument. There are very hardworking people with experience and knowledge and a large deposit and they do everything right as it is written in books and it did not help them in trading. There are people who use mediocre tools and they manage to earn money.The truth is that neither I nor you nor anyone else can answer the question of what is suitable for this or that person or what is missing for someone to succeed, so the more tools a trader tries and the more effort he puts into systematizing his trading, the more likely to achieve the desired result in a shorter time.It is also true that you cannot judge the quality of an instrument without collecting statistics or comparing your entry points with the instrument. Moreover, you cannot decide what an “experienced trader” will or will not do.If you don't mind, describe what \"serious trading\" is, I can't understand it.Did I understand correctly that if a person has experienced some kind of negative experience, he does not have enough money at the moment, has made one or more mistakes due to which he lost money, then he is considered a novice and inexperienced trader in your opinion? (I was the only one who got the impression that you classify such people as losers who have no chance of success?)",

      "body": "Quote from: Ratimov on May 13, 2022, 01:24:57 PMAs for the definition of serious trading. Serious trading is a fully formed conscious trading strategy that was created by the trader himself based on his understanding of the market, his thinking, his psychology and his collected statistics for the many hours and days that he spent in the market.How can a tool fit into such a strategy that will prompt signals for entering / exiting transactions and recommendations for risk management? Signals from the Internet and a ready-made strategy are two extremes of the same essence. They cannot exist in one whole. Never. You are either an independent trader who knows what he is doing or a simple hamster driven by someone else's opinion. There is no third.You confess 3 extremes, not allowing any other options, this is your right, I have other principles.  At the same time, you contradict yourself by describing an experienced trader as a specialist who has collected a lot of statistics.. Right, I assume that the same trader collected statistics not only by looking at an empty chart, did he use some tools?  And rightly I can assume that this trader did not always know how certain instruments work at the level of creating these instruments on their own? You don't have to be an electrician to use electricity.Those people who plan to trade and who want to succeed will look at my idea and draw their own conclusions.  If someone wants to know how it works, he will ask a question and I will try to explain, that's fine! But you went into the bot for 15 minutes, made your extreme conclusions, this is your right, but I note that you contradict yourself by doing this))",

Support and Resistance alone has caused so many bad tradesI'm not sure I fully understand your question, but I'll try to answer.If you use candlestick analysis and waited for a signal candle for a 4 hour or 1 day timeframe, then a bot signal will be a good confirmation.If you use support and resistance blocks on timeframes of 4 hours or 1 day, then using candles you specify the range of the block itself and make an entry at the signal of the bot.Send your schedule in the comments in the bot and we will try to figure it out.",
