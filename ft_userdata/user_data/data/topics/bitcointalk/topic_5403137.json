First of all, I think it's never too late. Many of us joined much later than we should have. With regard to your question, I would recommend starting with the basics. You can find many online resources for learning the basics of bitcoin and blockchain. You can search Google for beginner-friendly ebooks. To begin, I think the most important thing is to learn how to store coins properly and how to make transactions. Make sure you know how to protect yourself against a variety of online threats and hackers, and never give out your private information to anyone. If you have any specific question, do not hesitate to ask.",
