All you need to do since you have already switched it to the open position without the button to close it. Just click on the position itself and see what happens, it might bring the closing button. If that did not work, you might just long press your mobile gadget if it would bring it.One or more of those approaches should work for any trading platform.",

You opened a marging trade and if you look at your PNL, you already had $3.756 lost which is equivalent to 1.12% of your asset which means the price has go below the amount you bought optimism(OP) because you borrow. It is simple to close, put the total amount of OP you have in your balance and sell/short OP and the USDT you borrowed will be automatically returned to kucoin and your balance will be returned in USDT.Next time, becareful about Margin trading because you can see that your Liquidation is around $0.925, if it was a highly volatile token, you can lose everything within a blink of an eye, you need to learn basic of trading before you even try Margin because of the risk involve.",

Simply click the repay button on your open position and pay the loan amount for your margin trade. Margin trade is a little bit complex compared to futures trading but it is less risky since the liquidation margin is much higher than futures trading.",

As far as I know, you won't get any benefit if you don have any deeper experience there.Margin tradings are high risky but cross collateral margin is more risky than isolated margin. With isolated margin, you will only lose your collateral in that isolated position but with cross collateral margin, you will lose more because your collateral is cross, not isolated.QuoteI've been here for a few years in crypto Trading I haven't tried margin trading yet because I know my capital will goes to nothing only, instead I do trade on spot most of the time.Many warnings but many people feel interested in margin tradings because some successful traders show their big profit with margin tradings. It cause newbies, amateur traders to jump into margin tradings as successful traders did not warn newbie traders about risk, forced liquidations.You made good decision by say no with margin tradings by the way.",

But yeah, Margin and derivatives trading need to be approached with extra caution and with only an amount you can afford to lose. Spot trading is sometimes very hard/boring if the market is going sideways or on a downtrend (It's only sweet during an uptrend)This is where some people start to get attached to trading derivatives.",

When they are in that state of hope, they will hold to it until they take more losses and can't hold to it any longer. That happens because they don't accept the risk in the first place. This means that whenever you take a trade, you have to consider it already as a loss. You detach yourself from the outcome of every single trade.",
