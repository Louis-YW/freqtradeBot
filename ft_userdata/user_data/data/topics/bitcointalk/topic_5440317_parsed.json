I mean, I don't disagree with you in anyway, after all, what is all work and no play, it makes Jack a dull boy. Dull all round both in mind, health and pocket.I have always been a fan of not over working myself, mostly when I weigh the output of the stress on my body. It isn't just worth it to work so much, while ignoring good diet, exercise, rest and then pay a visit to the Doctor to spend the money on health. Bitcoin is good investment but if anyone gets into it and sees he is loosing sleep over it or not taking care of themselves properly, it would not be a good idea to continue in that manner. Health is wealth. Enjoy your money and live a good life. It is just this one we got.",

I know someone who is just exactly like that here he doesn’t like buying clothes or things for himself he is not even bothered about what he is wearing and his children always complain of him not giving them money so i ask myself if you can’t spend on yourself and on your family then whats the use of the money.This is really not ideal your health should really come before anything else because health is wealth.",

Omoh chop the money. Don't be a workaholic without being chopaholic, enjoy your money while you're alive okYou don't necessarily need money to live a good and healthy life. That dude killed himself due to heavy smoking and lack of rest and not because he was not eating balanced diet. Our body don't need much food like people consume. Sometimes people feel that you need to consume plenty of fish, meat, milk and do onto be healthy. But they fail to understand that taking plenty of water, fruits and vegetables helps the body even more than heavy food.Constant medical checkup is very important but I have observed that some persons have phobia for hospitals. They don't just like visiting physicians. Those kind of people are usually forced to seek medical attention. We must ensure we seek medical help when necessary.For two weeks now I have not been feeling fine and I decided to see a doctor today. After much examination, he prescribed some drugs that I took home. I was too tired to check and take the drugs so undecided to take a nap. After about two hours sleep I discovered that all the symptoms I had have disappeared. I am now feeling very strong. It was then I realized that what I needed was rest and not drugs because I have not had a good sleep for the past two weeks because of work. Sometimes sicknesses don't need medicines, few minutes of rest can be just the solution one needs.",

And for him to have gotten to that stage without getting any advice or not having any relatives to look after him only tells me that either he wasn't close to his family members or they don't give a shit about him and if the latter is the case then the fact that he overworked himself his now understood.

He needs money to survive in any situation. If you look carefully, you will see that money is everything in people's daily activities. But why is this money needed? Money is needed only to keep the human body healthy and to function fully in life. If you only run after money and don't satisfy your physical needs then money has no value. Money with which you can keep your life healthy is basically your money. So use the money for your needs. A person's own life is the most important that one should learn to value.

If you save, and invest, it's because you believe in the future, it's because you think you're going to live long enough to enjoy those savings and investments in the future. On the other hand, if you believe that you will not last much longer, you would normally spend more. As you don't know when you're going to die, for me the ideal is to maintain a certain level of savings and spending, to enjoy your money, as well as making sure that if you die the people you love inherit what you've saved.

One thing to remember about bitcoin is, it probably will never increase in number of coins. Yet, there are always wallets that are lost, coins that are being burned, and other reasons why the number of bitcoins is or will be diminishing. So, save some, because they might become rare, and very valuable. But spend some to get something before you are too old to spend them.",
