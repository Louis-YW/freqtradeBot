It's a referral program and I don't think you would get a chance with any of their listed prizes. Usually they will give you the free spins, but it's almost a waste if your time since it has already been programmed to end at the [try again]  You can try it just for fun, but don't anticipate too much on any prize you won't win.",

      "body": "The exchange is called Kucoin, not Kukoin.If it has terms and conditions, I will advice you to read about the T&C.If you want to earn from referred program, the best is to refer and know the reward you will receive from each person that you refer and if you have many people to refer, you may earn more than the money for MacBook Pro which likely you may not even win at all in the spins. Would the 10 free spin be given for each person that you refer? That would be included in the T&C.All I can say is that you should try your luck and I do not think this kind of thread is needed to be created. It is just a spin that can increase your referral reward or reduce it to zero USDT just like gambling.",

      "body": "You are only going to waste your time to advertise their platform by telling friends to register. Your reward will not be useful because the free spin will not help you in anyway,since you wouldn't win anyone. Forget about all these bonuses and focus on improving yourself on the forum. And if you want to gamble then you can pay for it. You should also know that they are doing this to lure you into bringing more people into the exchange for them to be recognized.",

      "body": "And also add to what others have said, this is a gambling thread, and it would have been good you dropped it in the gambling section so that those who are using KuCoin will tell you exactly what you want. Then another thing I will like to know here is that, I thought KuCoin is an exchange so does it provide casino games too? I have not seen casino also provide spinning games which gamblers can have fun.I thought exchange platforms only provide discount for their customers or probably referral service to bring customers to the platform. Well everyone has their strategy to bring customers to their business.",

      "body": "KuCoin is using this strategy to get more users.They are into such promo stuff; sometimes they will ask for surveys from users, promising to pay them after the survey, but it always ends up in a few people’s hands, and I haven't heard that one person won any of this promo, which makes me feel like doing it now is a waste of time.Although if OP will be able to refer people after carefully going through the rules guiding the promo contest by making sure anyone that was being referred wasn’t using KuCoin before now and had deposited a minimum of $50, according to their new policy, the user must have passed KYC and then deposit the money before you will be provided with the five free spins.",
