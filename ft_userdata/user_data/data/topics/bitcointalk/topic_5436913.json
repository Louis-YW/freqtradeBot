  "content": "I have been in the forum for some time now and no doubt i have gathered so many knowledge about the crypto space especially on bitcoin and my view towards bitcoin has totally changed as i once like others saw bitcoin as a pornzi scheme that is meant to target the weak into depriving them in their little money they earn through ours of work stress. the forum is like a library filled with so many books to read and its some time as i have always wanted to learn about the whole ethics of bitcoin mining and how its works so I can be able to participate in some of the conversation here in the forum but haven't really gotten to the full understanding of it. So i want to know if there is any way i can learn a little bit faster as bitcoin mining always intrigues me and i just feel  maybe there are articles here i can read that can further broaden my knowledge on bitcoin mining and its importance to the crypto space.",

I was intrigued by how miners would have to compete to complete cryptographic task fast enough to be able to earn rewards in the form of transaction fees and BTC. I got a bit of an opener  here  but I believe there are more places to get more practical knowledge than theory.",

If I were you remove the anchor text a link that hiding from your post so that no one will click it here on the forum.@DaNNy001Actually, mining Bitcoin only needs ASIC units it is PlugNPlay the only problem is your electricity rate if you have a cheap power rate then go for mining but if your current electricity rate is expensive don't buy a unit.and I would like you to read this before you start buying units.

And if you like reading also add one link for you to know more on bitcoin mining. How to Mine Bitcoin: A Beginner's Guide to Mine BTC",

My bad. I didn't know it was a scam site and felt it was okay to share it on here since I got good info (in my mind). But thanks for the warning though. I'd quickly remove it since the last thing I want is to have a negative rep of promoting scam site",
