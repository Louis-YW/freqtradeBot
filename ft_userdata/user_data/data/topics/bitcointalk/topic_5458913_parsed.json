  "content": "Welcome To Eleneum BlockchainEleneum is a Metamask-compatible network that utilizes the popular RandomX mining algorithm. It has been solely developed by me, highlighting the uniqueness and dedication to the project. Built with Python and MongoDB, Eleneum leverages RandomX and Metamask, along with Ethereum libraries in Python, enabling faster development without the need to worry about wallet or miner programming and updates.The project stems from the developer's frustration with the time and money lost while working on other projects that vanished overnight.. Eleneum aims to provide a reliable and sustainable platform, addressing these concerns while fostering a vibrant community.In the future, Eleneum will expand its support to include EVM-compatible contracts, likely programmed in Python, although Solidity is not ruled out. The decision-making process and governance will be community-driven through a forum and a governance token starting from Q4 2023.The mainnet launch is scheduled for September 1st, while the testnet will be available for testing on July 14th, including the block explorer and mining pool. Miners who actively contribute to the development of the mining pool software will be rewarded with +1 ELENA for every 10 ELEN (the testnet token) mined, incentivizing mining participation.Furthermore, the Eleneum website features an airdrop section where users can receive 15 ELENA tokens just by registering their wallet. The maximum number of tokens available for the airdrop will be 100,000, although not all tokens need to be distributed. It's important to note that Eleneum has a premined supply that is double the total tokens distributed in the airdrop and the 10% of mined in testnet network until September 1st. Half of this premined supply will be distributed among users, while the other half will be allocated to the developer. The developer will have the flexibility to utilize their portion to add liquidity to decentralized pools, fostering further growth and utility within the Eleneum ecosystem.Coin SpecsTestnet launch: July 14th, 2023MAINNET LAUNCHED: July 29tht, 2023Core Server: Python and MongoDBWallet: MetamaskSymbol: ELENAType: Layer 1 blockchain, PoW/PoS coinAlgorithm: RandomXMax Supply: InfinitePre-mined: Variable.

RandomX is compatible with GPUs. It is a CPU-oriented algorithm designed to be resistant to ASIC mining and optimized for CPU mining. However, there are also implementations and optimizations available for GPU mining. So, RandomX can be used effectively on both CPUs and GPUs, providing miners with flexibility in choosing their preferred hardware for mining.",

Initially, the testnet will start with RandomX, but we will take into account the issue of botnets when considering the algorithm for the mainnet. It is worth mentioning that we have the foundation of the cryptocurrency programmed using multiple algorithms. In the event that we decide to start the mainnet with RandomX, we will open the decision to change it to the community. We appreciate your feedback and are committed to taking steps to address any security-related issues.",
