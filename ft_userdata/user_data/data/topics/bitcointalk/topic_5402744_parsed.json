Until we know the case model, we can't help.",

Mine is open and yet the temperature is that high, after searching the web I noticed many have the same result.I have the RTX 3080 Ti FE. I heard the Founder Edition version is worse than the AIB models for VRAM cooling. I am using a closed gaming PC case with 4 120mm fans. Of course, the GPU fans run at 100%.I learned my lesson. Never buy GDDR6X video cards. Even if VRAM cooling is good, they are too power hungry. The RTX 3060 Ti is better, or the RTX 3060 12GB if you want to dual mine.",

But I think it could be a promising alternative for large farms like Whinstone because I think a water cooling system would be cheaper and more effective than an oil cooling system. Water conducts heat 4x as well as mineral oil and can transfer 2.5x the heat energy.The only problem is purifying the water to make sure small metal particles don't get in, make it conductive and fry the equipment.",
