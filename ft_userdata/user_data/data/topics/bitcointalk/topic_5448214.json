The market is all good now. Today the Bitcoin price has surged to somewhere around $30,000. A lot more people will buy in as the market continues to stride. Good for us.",

But I think it's only because most of the investors today are focusing on investing in BTC. BTC is the most popular after all. But sooner when the sell orders on Doge are only a few, we will see the price goes up. It should be obvious by now that Doge is up there on the ranking.",

Am not sure because just this moment , Bitcoin had 30k and ethereum is almost 2k  , meaning the bull is just starting .and the hype is only traying to start up , maybe we will be seeing in the next couple of weeks there is a changes but then there are no assurance , because recovery and correction is always go together.",

      "body": "Nah, I think it's only how crypto works nowadays in the sideways season. Some peaking happened because of a couple of good news stories here and there. For example, this surge in the price of Bitcoin to $30K was because of some good news, like that China seems to be glancing back at bitcoin, as Douyin shows the bitcoin price live (source: https://twitter.com/CoinWOfficial/status/1645461730833858561?t=2-_iFGkxNgn1FwC6WjORIw&s=19), and bitcoin becomes the best investment in Q1 2023 (source: https://technext24.com/2023/04/04/bitcoin-shines-in-q1-2023-time-invest/) and more I believe the real bull run will still happen in 2024 or 2025 if we refer to history, when the bitcoin halving will be coming.",

Please feel free to contact me should you have any inquiry. Doge is well, Doge, I don't think we need to mind the pumps and dumps there. Bitcoin going up to 28 was probably just it correcting itself after some massive dumps last year, honestly should've been sooner but with back to back negatives about the crypto scene, well, this is what we get (and to note crypto just rose up to 30k recently). Eth and probably other crypto markets just followed BTC I reckon.As for the future ehh, a sideways movement leaning more on growing the price. It wouldn't show explosive changes but gradual instead imo (maybe except some booms here and there)",

Please feel free to contact me should you have any inquiry. I personally would still say, that the overall market conditions are still positive in the crypto space. I mean for example BTC was going up from around 17k $ per coin to now 30k$ within the last 4 months or so. So i would guess that everyone agrees, that this is a huge positive price movement. At the moment the 30k$ mark is tested, which is a pretty important symbolic barrier. Of course it is also just normal, that the price can not go up 5% every day. There need to be time spans between the pump where the price is going sideways or even going down a bit again, because people are taking profits and selling a bit of their holdings too.",

The hype is not over yet as there is a new price trend now that bitcoin have crossed $30,000 this will be another ground for so many altcoins to also pick in their market any moment from now since they always follow the bitcoin market trend each point, bitcoin has to open another round of price speculation in the last weekend when it made that significant move and I also see how other coins are already showing positive outlooks in their charts this morning. This year may be another bull year for Bitcoin, but I can't say that for sure for altcoins since the altcoin market is highly volatile and highly centralized which allows it to be easily manipulated at whatever time. Take a look at the altcoin market to see some insane price movements that are beyond market analysis, those are the pump we are talking about, the price can do 10x within a few hours it will take 20x shade off when the prices of the leading asset correct back, this is how bad altcoin pump is.",
