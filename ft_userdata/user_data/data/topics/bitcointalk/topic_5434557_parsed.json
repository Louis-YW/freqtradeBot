Yes of course. we are scammers too because we promote worthless shits and ,might be some of newbie investors get cough by those scammers who pretend as legit project owners. and the next reason about bounty campaign now days is just a waste of time. I was keep completing tasks for bounty campaign for few months and got only $30 for whole months. the problem is about airdrop campaigns. many of south Asian users  has created more than 10 accounts and they are vanishing whole things.",

Such thing is not new from faucet days up until the present. This is the downside of 'investmwnt free' projects wherein players will be given an opportunity to earn tokens from projects without requiring them to put money into it. Likewise with some signature campaigns. Frauds are just surfacing this industry because those who are fraudalent takes advantage of the anonymity being offered by this technology.",

Most projects back in the day would make some money, not a lot but at least some even if they are bad and they could make A LOT of money if they were any good. These days most of them suck and they do not make any money at all which means that they just give up, I have seen plenty of projects like that where the owners just give up, because their bounty didn't work and it resulted with them being terrible in the long run and they just do not want to give tokens to people because they stop the project. Same happened here, just doesn't make sense to me at all and would be smarter if it was not participated in at the first place.",

They don't get enough fundings that's why they decide to abandon the project they started.2. They don't have plan to pay and they only want to get the data's of the participant so that they can use it for other marketing purposes.3. They just trying to see if there are people will mistakenly put a seed phrase on their sign up link provided to scam people. So for this we need to be more careful checking what we put on the address since sometimes if we are careless instead put the altcoin address we mistakenly put the seed phrase and that is so expensive mistake that we need to avoid.",

They're airdrops and that means that they're just there to be given out for free or not at all since you spend no money at all. Those that don't distribute it very well have a problem in management so that means they're not even serious with the allocation for the airdrop participants.If you're mostly focused on airdrops, it's better for you to spend less time on it for you to realize that there's no certain by allotting most of your time to it. Airdrops and crypto projects themselves are uncertain. If it gets a value, you're lucky so, it's hit or miss.",

That is why stop believing and joining these airdrops because you are not just wasting your time but also weakening your trust towards crypto.

Even if you put money into investing in new projects, many projects will not distribute tokens to you, so with earn free money they don't pay you is understandable. I would say that is very normal for the crypto market. Working hard is not about doing all the projects you see or meeting their requirements, but first, you need to screen the projects to be involved in. That means not every project will pay you, you need to spend time researching and only participating in potential projects. But I think participating in airdrops nowadays is a waste of time because most of them are scams, as you see, or the rewards are too little compared to the effort we put in.",

Don't expect anything more from airdrops projects.Airdrops are an easy project to work on and you can earn Shitcoin tokens for free from working on them.However, almost 95% of the airdrop projects are scammers and there is very little chance of growth to be able to compete with other tokens on the market.If indeed there is a token from a good airdrop project that succeeds in developing it, it is difficult to work on and more complicated than other airdrop projects that have no value.So you shouldn't have to regret so much about what you've done in an airdrop project that still doesn't necessarily develop and give you an advantage.",
