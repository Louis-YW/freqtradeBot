Just wondering, did you just eye which shading/woodpiece to use next? - I was expecting you would have a print where you put each fitting piece on top of it, but there is nothing like this visible in the video.I think the result looks great.No space at all left here on my walls and I don't want a piece that will just be stored away, but good luck with your auction!",

These are all sorted and grouped before I begin assembly. Thanks for the kind words",
