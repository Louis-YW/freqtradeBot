Now if you're referring to other platforms, then it's probably better to stick to exchanges you already have an account with. You don't want to just submit your documents to every platform out there. Besides, any big project will more than likely end up in one of these exchanges. But if you're concerned about your identity (and you should be) then it's probably best to avoid KYC platforms alltogether..",

Anyhow, KYC (know your customer) verification means that the cryptocurrency exchange or platform may be exposed to your personal identification and transactions. If you are not watchful and careful, you may end up using a platform without adequate security measures, which leaves your personal information open to unauthorised access.My recommendation is that you should pick a trustworthy cryptocurrency exchange or platform that has robust security procedures and a reputation for protecting user data and, if practical, utilise additional security measures like two-factor authentication in order to reduce this risk.",

Personally I don't get problem with exchange market required for KYC and need to submit our ID but with new project and not popular yet I don't agree for submitting my document ID. Right now not only with participating in IDO required for KYC but also many kinds of airdrop project need to us to expose or submit ID document if want get airdrop reward, you will miss receive coins reward if not pass KYC. Can't denied with new rule for uploading document ID trough KYC because want to trade or withdraw fund in exchange market account required for KYC.",

This has happened several times in the US and I think in some other countries as well. It's not just all about the projects that we're complying for KYC but also in many exchanges where we're sending our IDs and as well as for the casinos that might ask for it. If you don't want to comply for it, much better to choose wisely the platforms that you're using.",

The issue of KYC leak is not something two-factor verification can solve but rather something it is scary in the sense that the platform could give them out base on government requests or the most common and scary one is when there is a data breach, the hackers get full access to your information and could use it to get to you not only on that platform but probably some where else. And this isn’t something that two factor authentication can solve, so ones you do a KYC just be hopeful and be extra cautious on some mails you receive",

People were neglecting IEO back then because of the KYC issues and then people came up with the idea of IDO, some investors that value privacy started having the advantage of getting earlier to this project public sale through a mechanism and policy but it strange that they now request for KYC, this is really bad or perhaps this is the reality of bear market to reduce participants.It is not a must that you will have to partake in IDO, if they insist, kindly allow them to do their things, it's even difficult to get high returns on the new project they sell, they don't have any returns, and the max you can get is 2x or you may get dump on if the project is not worth it.",
