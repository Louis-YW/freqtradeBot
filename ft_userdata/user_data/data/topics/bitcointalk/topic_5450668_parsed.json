The 1000+ views you mentioned aren't the total users looking at your post, but the 1000+ views are accumulated from the thread was created.What make it's funny you're asking for upfront payment, you should be happy if at least there's project interested with your offer.",

Combine that with the fact that you have no reputation or trust built in the community, i'd say you're a high risk to pay upfront.
