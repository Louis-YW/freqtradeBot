But when waking up on reality I say I don't have enough money to launch the whole operation sin e it cause a lot of money to make a casino successful. Since if we just create a casino without doing anything for sure those gamblers would provably go with other casino which can give them better offers and launch a lot of marketing.But this is really a nice idea and would love to read others opinion or story regarding on this topic since for sure majority of gamblers would love to have their own casino since its hard for them to get defeated always that's why they want to be their own house and earn a lot of money from the gamblers play and get entertained on their casino.But also I believe this topic belongs to gambling discussion section so maybe best to move there and talk about such topic that nice.to discuss.",

Many casinos also offered to invest in their bankroll and get a share from the profits. But owning a casino and organising it was really a tough task. Many didn’t know how to build a casino where in some casinos the bankroll wasn’t sufficient. So yes for these reasons many people along with me, stopped this idea of creating our own casino. Reading this post, made me feel nostalgic.",

You need to pay monthly fees to the providers and a revenue share with them. You need to pay big money to a celeb or some big streamers, and they only want to go with you - of you can pay them more than they already get. Thats kinda impossible. You need players from day 1 to survive in the competition or Else your bankroll will be eaten up by fees and monthly expenses. Today new casinos opens daily but there is always the doubled who stops operation. 1 opens, 2 closes. We are sadly 3-5 years to late. Unless you get an exeptional idea that can make your casino unique. I just brainstorm but an idea could be to invite one of the streamers to get a share of the company instead of just being an affiliate. That could maybe open some Doors to a big audience quite fast.",

Be the house and play the always-win game.Owning casino is profitable business and can make the casino owner successful entrepreneur if the casino can really develop to become large casino with very many customers.Regarding the desire to become casino owner, I am sure that almost everyone here wants to have casino business, it just that to be able to own one you need very large budget and also extensive experience in the gambling industry because the casino owner will also influence the development of the business.I think anyone who has casino business will definitely not be that interested in games or betting in it because they can make profits more easily from this business.If they want to win and have fun then gambling is no longer the right choice because they will look for other pleasures that can really give them more satisfaction.QuoteIn the past years it was different, people who could build a provably fair engine were able to have their own casino, but now we are playing with new rules, the casinos must have a license and games providers, and that's what people are looking for, and i don't say is something bad, the gambling experience on stake compared with the gambling experience on satoshi bones is enormous.That why I say that casino owners will influence the development of the casino itself because experience and networks in the gambling industry are very much needed.So far, lots of new casinos have emerged but they failed to survive and develop so in the end they just went bankrupt.",

We no longer have an option like that where everyone was using a community bankroll from investors so to speak. Now you have to put a decent chunk of money into having your own site in order to have the ability to attract medium/large gamblers. You can make a site and start with a micro bankroll but who wants to play where a max won is 100$ or something like that?",

I would rather be the one to learn how to gamble than my casino business, which will be built to ruin their lives because of gambling.We know that gambling, when it is not used correctly, drives a person to become addicted to gambling, which is not good for me. If it's okay with other casino owners, it's not okay with me. Even if we say that it's the gambler's choice, the casino still became an instrument, and that's why it happened.",

It is rather easy to set up a crypto casino afaik nowadays though since gaming licenses are rather easy to get and gaming providers are dime a dozen out there. I'm pretty confident as well with starting out the website by myself as well. The only problem left really is bankroll, which is really hard to set up and obtain in my case. Maybe a few years down the line if it's still relevant I might try and give it a go. Probably not worth the effort by then though tbf.",

But what would be the point of doing it, since any money you win is already your money as it comes from the casino and any money you lose will be yours again as it goes to the casino. You would also have to account for taxes which would make this a bad deal in the long run. However, doesn't this take out all the fun from gambling as there is no real upside and you could also be gambling with play money as it wouldn't affect your financial situation. Owning a casino sounds like a lot of fun, but there must be a lot of work behind it and with so many casinos around these days the success is not guaranteed. After watching all the Oceans movies with George Clooney as a kid I also dreamed of owning my own casino one day. It would be so cool to walk around the gambling for and engaging with all the high rollers while drinking champagne. Unfortunately, this seems much more glamourous in the movies than the job would be in real life.  Another issue is that you need a lot of money to run a casino, because there could always be a winning streak for a gambler that would lead to large outflows.",
