Would January 1, 2011 been the only day in which if one bought this much bitcoin, one would have maxed out for this given amount? What about in 2010?The question is how many U.S. citizens believe bitcoin or even know about bitcoin at that time, being able to answer that question will help us to figure out how the purchasing power and motivations of those around that time in bitcoin, besides not many believe bitcoin to become such a global payments system like bitcoin and so for that those around that time will definitely not have such high motivations to throw $1000 on bitcoin so for sure we may likely fine it hard to make such statistics of those who bought large quantities of bitcoin at that time.But regardless of the above posibilities we still have those that earn quntom of bitcoin through their activities in the bitcoin network and those rewards at that time may have low $$ value since the operation of exchange and other access point in buying bitcoin was very low to no existence at that time so this will be hard to stay.",

What about in 2010?why are you obsessed with asking many posts about january first 2011 and $1000bitcoin was $0.30 on that date, meaning 3333btchowever even if people put in $1000 at a different date, they could have still accumilated more than 3333 before nowEGimaging using $1000 in 2012 ($6/btc) meaning 166btcthey could have day traded agaisnt ltc and turned it into 500btc before the 2013 ATHsold 500btc at $1100 to get $550000used $550,000 to buy 1,375btc ($400/btc)sold 1375btc in 2017's ath at ~$19k to get $26,125,000used $26,125,000 to buy 13,062btc ($2000/btc)thus end up having 13k btc instead of 3333... and it didnt cost you any other real money out of pocket, just traded fiat-btc on exchanges",

What about in 2010?By this time only a few people would have known about Bitcoin. And there were also limited means of acquiring Bitcoin. If someone had offered me Bitcoin at that time, maybe I wouldn't have been interested since it was strange and looked like a joke. Only people who understood the viability of Bitcoin would have acquired it then.",

Would January 1, 2011 been the only day in which if one bought this much bitcoin, one would have maxed out for this given amount? What about in 2010?Firstly let's evaluate the effect of inflation generally. Comparing the level of inflation from around periods of 2010 to 2011 till now, 1000 USD was actually what more then than it is now I wouldn't blame people that didn't invest in Bitcoin buy then Simply because of the fact that it was still the very first cryptocurrency and crypto wasn't that much believed in at that time So it was more like carrying out a huge risk of rather taking on a huge risk of investing with such a huge amount.As at early periods of around 2009 to even 2012 when bitcoin was recently launched, literally many persons never thought of buying at that time infact majority of them that are whales today got their coins from either giveaways back then or mining during those first four years when mining was still very profitable and and hashing was easy with smaller hardwares.",

The first Bitcoin exchange was launched in December 2009, it is NewLibertyStandard exchange.People lacked of interests in Bitcoin in its early years and perhaps started to pay more attention on Bitcoin after its first halving and bull run as well as a famous trade pizza for bitcoins in 2010.We can not go backwards to 2009, 2010 or 2011 to buy cheap bitcoin, but we are luckily to know of Bitcoin, invested in Bitcoin earlier than many late comers, late participants in this market. The rest part for us to succeed is whether we can have strong belief then strong hands to hold our bitcoin.",

Bitcoin only became recognised by many after bitcoin proved itself to be the most volatile asset to ever existed. As at then people would not want to spend that amount of money to invest in bitcoin. Even Laszlo exchange 10000 bitcoin for two pizzas at around $41 meaning the rate of bitcoin by then $1000 would have have bought BTC300k+ worth of bitcoin meaning few investor would have bought all bitcoin together if they have known the future.
