Then I refilled my wallet again and placed my bet. As the game Kickstarted, I got chances to cash out while the value of my withdrawal fluctuates UPs and DOWNs and I had to place my withdrawal and made a cash out of $6  from a $5  bet.At this time of a test run and trust level is worthy, I think I can proceed and place a higher amount of betThis might been seem a drama to some of us here but the truth is that we really have to be careful on how and where we bets because lot of online (chance-based gambling) leaves you with a site of demo with its tools bars and graphics basis all to pin you down with most exciting offers that are not reality.",

I don’t know the type of ads you saw, but if it had anything to do with people flexing how much they made or showing you a live section or a prerecorded video of them playing and winning then you’re in for a deep shit because according to a celebrity confession he said that some casinos paid them to do that type of videos for them and during the process they asked him to use a specific account that will be provided for him and not to create an account himself because the account they’ll give him has more probability of winning, so if they should perform live section they’ll still be profiting which would make their audience want to use the site. So if this was the type of ads you saw that made you try out the site then you’re lucky you were able to get your money out of there.

It was a risky decision to fund a site that you just randomly came across online, assuming you weren’t allowed to withdraw your funds where would you have taken the scam accusation to? And when presenting it what would you add in your complaint? That you saw the site online and decided to give it a try when you have a place with good casinos and you’re even promoting one of them.",

Good sites too are marketing their services with ads, I can see many of local gambling sites on ads online. But you are also right, this is what some scammers will take advantage of and Google and some sites will also still help market them for some people to become their victims and be scammed.",

Maybe the little withdrawal you are able to do was them trying to gain your trust? After all the warnings and advice on this forum I am shocked that a ranked member like you can still do this stupid move. The confidence you have in trying out a casino from an ads is no match for mine lol, I can never do such thing, I would rather use this forum to find a brand new casino if that's what I need, if anyone haven't told you yet, what you did is very risky.You did no single research on the casino, maybe it already have some bad reviews you don't know, but you think deposition $5 is good enough to test the reputation of the casino, even if everything seem normal it doesn't mean the platform is safe. There is no one talking anything about the casino, maybe they will fold up with your money someday? My advice is avoid depositing a large amount of money on the casino, you never know whats going to happen soon, find a casino you can trust with your money.",

And I think that probably you are swayed to test it because there could be some picture of famous athletes and you might think that he is a official endorser of the site and it seems legit at the very first glance. It's good that you were able to cash out and not being scammed by them. But in worst case, if suddenly you try new crypto based or even fiat based that might look good in the beginning, cool UI and interface, they could still run and scam you and anyone here. So I wouldn't just try any new sites just because I see some ads on it on google or any other social media. The risk is too high that you might lose your money to them, either scam or the site is rigged and not provably fair.",

I also recommend checking to see of a gambling site has good reputation before engaging in them, this can be the best method to approach any gambling advert.Of course we can not overlook how scammers are also taking advantage of ads to pop up sites with the intention of stealing from unsuspecting victims.

There are several services that I got to know through ads and I’m still using them up till this day.We can take “1xbet (which is known for its scammy activities)” for example, if you’re surfing the internet to research there’s a 90% chance that you’ll be directed to that gambling site and most people that use service because of an ad without first carrying out thorough research on it could be tempted to try it out with little amount and when they eventually deposit larger amount they might start having difficulty getting it out of the site, and it could be as a result of the offer that was presented during the course of the ad…",
