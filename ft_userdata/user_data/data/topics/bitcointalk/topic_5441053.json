You're come from Nigeria, so I'm sure you're move into near of Nigeria, so I wouldn't surprised if many people want to accept Bitcoin payment because I've read so many thread where Nigerian citizens are tend to trade via direct P2P due to banking ban. I don't think you're not have any money when you're leaving your country, at least you still have mobile banking in your cellphone.",

Because there are so many people who withdraw money every day in our country, it can be difficult to get cash out of an ATM at times. Instead, you must wait in line. Because of this, I think Bitcoin has brought value to our economy and will continue to do so.",

We agree to just pay on Bitcoin and I teach her how to cash out his Bitcoin to fiat using Binance exchange. After a couple of tutorials on how to setup account. We finally made a deal and send my Bitcoin to his exchange wallet to make it easier for P2P transaction that needed to convert Bitcoin to his local currency. I was supposed to teach her to use electrum but she need the funds immediately so we have no choice than to transact directly on exchange.It’s still a good experience and I think she might explore it more since Bitcoin is good to received payment for his product.",

Because when the seller wants to accept payments via Bitcoin, he definitely knows about Bitcoin and has a wallet to accept it. And what can be concluded from your story is that you shouldn't be surprised when people in remote locations or far from cities know about Bitcoin. Because as long as the internet signal is good, everyone can learn many things, including learning about Bitcoin. So you don't need to be surprised by that because Bitcoin can be known by many people regardless of place or location as long as the place has a good internet network.",

Because the reason of, you can not use a bank to bank transfer it because of some issues about transferring maybe because of traffic cause we all know there are a lot of transaction if we say bank to bank transfer. And also you don't have a cash to pay with. So the last option is your bitcoin   and that's good to her that you have a good internet connection to transfer your btc to the seller.",

Even the P2P engagements all go through the banks because payments are made in fiat. All we do is skip the narration part. Putting crypto related tag in that column for narration was what implicated so many crypto traders' bank accounts when that ban happened as they got frozen. Again, concerning what OP mentioned about the ease of transacting in Bitcoin as against fiat; that's absolutely true. I've weighed all the fiat and Bitcoin transactions I've done and discovered that Bitcoin transactions were less stressful for me. Things like that will continue to make Bitcoin more relevant and in demand.",
