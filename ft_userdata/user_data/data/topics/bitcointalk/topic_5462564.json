      "body": "I don't know to which limit the AIs can go, but what I think is that they can only be able to trace funds that have been deposited at the hackers address and move them to another address if the scammers were stupid enough to leave some trace. IfÂ any trace is being left by the scammer, then there will be no need for the AI to identify and link to an address, as by just going through those transactions, you will be able to trace where it was sent to and where it was also coming from.But if the coins sent out have already been mixed using some mixing service, which I believe the scammer will definitely have means of laundering their funds even without using any popular mixing service, at this point it will only be by the grace of the scammer's mistake that they can be linked to any form of hack, unless they mix the coin and also withdraw the same amount to a different address, which can be suspicious and can easily draw the attention of others for further investigation.",

However, I guess it will largely depend on whether there are available traces or links. If there is none, as there are practices as well as technologies focused on wiping out traces, then there's nothing to be found. Either way, the responsibility to keep our Bitcoin safe falls entirely on us as we fully own and control them. When lost, investigators and other law enforcers can only do so much.",

Firstly, Generative Pre-trained Transformers are designed to analyze text data to come up with a model that provides the user with conversational responses. It is completely different from what we're doing with Machine Learning on datasets and it serves no benefits to us. LLM is different from other deep learning models, think of it as a subset. If we were to analyze links between addresses, we would be more interested in using an unsupervised learning algorithm.Anyhow, none of them are accurate to a 100%, that is practically impossible. Our ML models can never train to an accuracy of a 100%, you'll have a pre-defined loss function that only tries to minimize it but it'll never be zero. Hence, you'll be stealing from someone else if that is the case.",

I like the part where you said AI aren't designed for this and one actually does this better, I can't remember the name of the AI but I remember the project that this AI belongs to, the name is Delysium with ticket AGI, you can use coinmarketcap to go to the website and try the AI out, it's crazily capable.

It can read and summarize texts, it can brainstorm ideas on various topics, and it can help to find fitting interpretations. But it also loves hallucinating information to fill in the gaps. Some people also use it for coding, especially if they only have basic skills. In that case, ChatGPT can help write code, although it will make mistakes and will often not be able to reach the working solution alone. Perhaps it could help you write a transaction analysis program if you set your requirements specifically. Or, if you have resources, you could try to train a model for a specific task, as ImThour has mentioned.",

It is not about reversing the TXs, since fractions of that stolen BTC ended to all kinds of ends on blockchain, including honest and kyc known people.It is an idea, that the modified version of AI GPT, as an aid for entiteled investigation on stolen cryptos, based on several data layer input (cut size, ratios, timing, etc..), could much faster analyze, idenify, and with high probability link archive TX activity, to Â scammers \"in progress\" Â TXs activities, based on a patterns of previous ones. If they are stil on line, doing same or similar activities with TXs to compare with.... The cipher trace is 100% accurate, the pattern of TXs also for AI GPT, in addition also (any additional key search layer, based from investigation case) to pump from, from Â which i believe AI GPT could recognize patterns and connect nowdays scammers active TXs and wallets to an archive ones. Â Justice and courts could than be within time and efficiency much faster, easier and promising with the outcome for all sides involved. Scammers caught, victims payed out.Probably in next years, or perhaps not. I wish the first happens. Well in that time to come, i wish i could've had kept at that time just the third of the coin. To slowly trade with, and to regain my losses..or to come through the month. I believe that sincerety and honesty do exist in this universe, as beeing exposed for all the individuals, and in this short time here, all gets payed in theirs own name, one way or another, after good or after mean, as chosen.
