I encourage you to make more noise on their social media channels until they respond to your issue.However, be ready to wait for some lengthy time.Next time when using such services, it's very important to carry to through due diligence to avoid such inconveniences",

As soon as it updates, the order status will change alsoSo far this is good they have a valid reason I think that the holiday was Chung Yeung Festival 4 October Tuesday but until you receive the stuff you ordered you should still follow it up and monitor it.They have bad reviews about their delivery so do not rely on their promise until you receive it and update us on the delivery if you receive it, that's the time you can mark this thread resolved and you can then lock it.",

Have you umm... read the thread? It's 8 posts long excluding your post, so I can understand if it's a difficult feat. OP's latest update here, two posts above yours, gave a possibility that it's just a delayed AWB number.",
