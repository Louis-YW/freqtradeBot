It's not a logo-dedicated platform it's an article-based platform this is their homepage https://coinpaper.com/ They just added it as an additional resource to make their site a good resource but I just wonder why OP did not create a menu for visibility how would first-time visitors know that they have a page dedicated for Crypto logos when that page is not in their menu.",

The OP must be new to this and has simply written here to get feedback from others on it. Or he undertakes separate work from the remaining team members which makes him not to connect the main website to the one dedicated to logos exclusively. If he does not explicitly explain the website and other services they offer at the same time, he may simply be a passerby who feels compelled to post here. He's only searching for criticism, but he should have done better than this one post only.",
