      "body": "Why not buy from another exchange instead and transfer it to your metamask account?Can you tell us where you buy BNB that rejects your card? is it a credit card? if yes some banks do not allow buying Crypto so possible this is the reason. I suggest buy Bitcoin through ATM maybe there is Bitcoin ATM near in your area then use Bitcoin to exchange it to BNB.Use this https://coinatmradar.com/ to find them. Have you tried the P2P on Binance they do support multiple payment method but it depends on where you live.",

I don't think you should use $10 this way. Reserve it for transaction fee later.You can buy BNB on Binance exchange if you have USDT or BUSD or you can buy it with fiat currency with Binance P2P too.If you use Metamask, and want to make on-chain transactions on Binance Smart Chain, you must have BNB in that wallet for transaction fee. Same requirement to have BNB for transaction when you want to buy, sell, swap Volt Inu to other cryptocurrency.[BIG LIST] Buy/Sell Crypto (OTC, P2P, DEXs, CEXs, NO-KYC, ATMs, etc.)",

      "body": "All centralized exchanges where they got listed are not really the best when it comes to liquidity and security. It is probably as risky as using an instant swap marketplace where you can swap some altcoin to BNB. While the amount you seek is not that big, some platforms might flag you with KYC. I'd argue that you should put them as your last option if you can't find any other choices.If you still want to go with P2P, I suggest posting on the currency exchange board[1] with the necessary details such as what payment you want to go, etc (if you don't have BTC and don't want to use BTC, then post it on Marketplace in the altcoins section). I don't think a credit/debit card is preferred since you can use a chargeback which is risky for sellers[2], CMIIW.

Other exchanges are Kucoin and OKX exchanges. About Paypal never heard that there is an exchange that supports this payment method.

I think you need to recheck the payment issue for the metamask. You can go with any centralized exchange for buying BNB or any other coin supported by that exchange using your local currency. P2P is a better option rather than asking for help here in the trading section.",

Most of the time sellers are the ones who need more trade history to add more reliability. Personally, I don't mind trading with a newbie if I'm a seller, and I'm sure this is not exclusive to P2P trade on this forum. Of course, things can be different depending on how the deal was done, not to mention using a trusted escrow is also an option to secure the deal.Quote from: UserU on February 10, 2023, 06:37:59 AMWhich method would you be using for payment?He seems to offer Bitcoin if you don't like Paypal[1]. He posted it on the wrong board though. OP, you should move that thread to Bitcoin marketplace, unless you also have other altcoins available to trade.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5439265.msg61737120#msg61737120",

Can you list me a few exchanges?If you are a citizen of the United States, you can buy Binance coins with Paypal through the eToro platform, as it is a reliable platform and among the good platforms that support Paypal. All you have to do is create an account and link the Paypal account to the eToro platform, and then deposit money through Paypal ( The minimum deposit is $ 10) and it is good that the eToro platform does not charge fees for depositing and withdrawing for PayPal, after that you will succeed in purchasing BNB, If you are not a citizen of the United States, you can simply go to the exchange platforms that listed the currency you want to buy, and then buy any of the currency pairs using the P2P or credit card, and you will succeed in buying the currency that you want to invest through the platform markets.[1] https://www.etoro.com/en-us/customer-service/help/1898292012/can-i-use-paypal-to-deposit-and-withdraw/",
