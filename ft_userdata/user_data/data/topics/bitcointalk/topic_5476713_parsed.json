  "content": "No need to read, it's gibberish. Just have a look, which one looks better? Which one you feel like reading? When you don't press enter:Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls deified among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little apprentice boy on deck. Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds.When you press enter:Fog everywhere.

It's instant put-off.QuoteThe first one is wall of text, JayJuanGee used to post like this. 'Used to' is keyword here  I checked his profile, he writes pretty lengthy replies. If he were to write same as in first example, imo, it wouldn't look as good. QuoteWhile the second one is usually written by most users. While philipma1957 is frequently use enter every each sentence.philipma's are neat to read, but I prefer second.

      "body": "The first one being wall of text is not that easy to read. I generally don't read post when it is written in the first format. I prefer the second one as it is the correct way to post. It is also easier to read when you are on a mobile device. As we all know the forum software doesn't support mobile device. We need to zoom in and zoom out to read. Wall of text makes it much harder to read on a mobile device.",

Here's an example where too many enter is being used, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5440208.msg61778062#msg61778062. Although IMO the main problem here is total of words/character in a line. If you use screen with big resolution without zoom in, you could see >300 character in a line.",

      "body": "Well there’s a reason why the enter key is there. Both versions have their merits, but the one with the \"press enter\" breaks the text into more digestible chunks, making it visually appealing and easier to read. It creates a sense of pacing and allows readers to absorb the atmospheric details more comfortably.It is required in technical papers and this is taught in school. Personally, i got used to it. But i dont think it is necessary in this forum. As long as the other readers understand what you are trying to say, it’s fine!",

      "body": "I like more when there are spaces when I read because when text's are near to each other, I hardly read them and I need to zoom out. While if there's a space, I don't understand why I feel like it's easier to read. But this is just a preference and the content and what we reply is what matter most. There are so long replies that are just like circling all over the same thoughts but no point taken. There are few liners that has the exact thought so, that's what matters if we're into discussions. I understand the point of this, it's about preference of what's easier to read.",
