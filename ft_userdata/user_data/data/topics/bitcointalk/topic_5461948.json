Like first you have yo buy gift cards using BTC and then using those gift cards you could buy food. You could buy Food at Starbucks and Whole Foods Market -->SourceYou could buy groceries directly from these stores -->SourceMy suggestion for you is: Buy all the groceries at once like in bulk this will save your transactions fee of BTC and also a good gesture towards savings. You should use BTC wisely as i also know food is necassary too but spending of BTC should be strategic. Only thing came to my mind in terms of food is gift cards are best way.",

I never thought of buying products that have cheap prices with bitcoins. Transaction fees will look very expensive for transactions under $200. Especially if every time you pay you have to wait for the transaction to be confirmed by the network, it takes a long time. Even though I love bitcoin, in some cases, using bitcoin is not a solution but a new problem.But I'm not against your wish to find a restaurant that can pay with bitcoins. In my country bitcoin is banned as a means of payment and can only be owned as an asset so I can't recommend anything to you. But if I may ask, wouldn't you find it expensive to buy a cheap product with a transaction fee of around $0.5? In my opinion using fiat is cheaper and free of transaction fees if you use the same bank network",

If @Faisal2202 managed to find the answer to your question, I doubt that you couldn't do the same, it's about the basics of using a search engine.I will not repeat what is already on the links in the previous posts, but as far as the EU is concerned, the Dutch city of Arnhem is known as Bitcoin City and they say that you can buy almost anything for BTC there, including food.Quote from: https://www.cryptolists.com/surviving-on-only-btc-in-arnhem-bitcoin-city-yes-you-can/Inhabitants of Arnhem Bitcoin City use bitcoin to pay for everything while shopping. Visitors of the Bitcoin town must understand the requirements when transacting in the city. Bitcoin is the city’s primary payment source. Restaurants, bars, hotels, and supermarkets allow customers to pay with Bitcoin. One can buy cakes, pastries such as doughnuts, food, flowers, interior design, and even frozen yogurt. A popular wood engraver, Tim also accepts Bitcoin as payment for his services. He has even put up a customized wooden sign printed in support of advertising that he accepts bitcoins. Most people get motivated to use bitcoin to pay for their beers with crypto.The Bitcoin city advertises over 100 venues that accept bitcoin payments, and it is an impressive density of bitcoin-accepting merchants. The popularity of bitcoin lets one purchase organic food, car parts, sweets, and escape games. One can also travel between Arnhem and the airport to rent a car or hire a taxi.On the other side of the world, there is the island of Boracay (Philippines) where Bitcoin has become a common means of payment, so you can also buy food for BTC there.Quote from: komisariatku on August 03, 2023, 12:52:06 PMI never thought of buying products that have cheap prices with bitcoins. Transaction fees will look very expensive for transactions under $200. ~snip~The value of the transaction has nothing to do with fees, but depends on some other factors such as the number of inputs/outputs (the size of the transaction) and the current state of the mempool. This means that if you were to buy food for $200 now (paid in BTC) and it was a standard-sized transaction, you would pay about $0.70 for a priority transaction.",

Maybe someone who has lived in a country where bitcoin is legal as a means of payment can share their experience with bitcoin. I have a thought that bitcoins are not effective for everyday purchases due to high transaction fees and busy network so they often get delayed but that is just my opinion, I have never had any real experience using bitcoins for daily transactions.For transactions in large numbers, let alone across countries, we seem to agree that the use of bitcoin is very effective and transaction costs look very cheap compared to the fiat system.",

I heard that Rotan Island in Caribbean accepts bitcoin widely and bitcoin can be used to pay for whatever thing you want to buy in Rotan. They have a large bitcoin community on the Island so using bitcoin in their restaurant is accepted. In my country bitcoin is illegal and I have never thought of using bitcoin for buying foodstuff because you can only use it in some businesses that accept bitcoin secretly. I don't think that we can deal without using fiat in this world because bitcoin and fiat goes hand in hand.",

Also most of these businesses will surely have the lightening network integrated which is key to saving one from paying too much and also makes transactions faster. But aside that it is not ok to pay using bitcoin for frivolous things. I even advice it usage only on cross border transactions or when fiat payment will be a stress",

This story serves as a vivid reflection of how Bitcoin has become a fully embraced currency in the country, without any restrictions whatsoever.https://youtube.com/shorts/fa9xB69jZk0?feature=shareRegarding the progress of other nations, like the US or any other country you mentioned, it's crucial to note that the decision to adopt Bitcoin as a payment alternative has no bearing on a country's level of advancement. Each nation holds the prerogative to decide whether Bitcoin deserves to be considered as an alternative payment method. Such determinations are entirely subjective and rest on the shoulders of the respective leaders of the concerned nation.",
