  "content": "I understand little about Ethereum but it has one of the worst PoW algorithms in the market. Currently it consumes almost as much power as Bitcoin but only delivers 800 TH/s. Which means it could be broken with a few million current graphics cards. Imagine a network of angry gamers for example. With the switch to PoS of the main project I think Classic will be broken sooner or later. It also continues to waste resources. Is that really necessary? Couldn't Classic be switched to Merged Mining with Bitcoin (if Classic were to be switched to SHA-256)? EDIT: Ethereum Classic seems to already exist. I did not know that. This is about ETH after the PoS split. This is about the old ETH chain after PoS split.",

Imagine a network of angry gamers for example.You can't quite compare both of the cryptocurrencies since it has a different POW algorithm. So, it doesn't work that way.Quote from: OhShei8e on August 20, 2022, 07:46:19 PMWith the switch to PoS of the main project I think Classic will be broken sooner or later. It also continues to waste resources. Is that really necessary? ETC was created in the spirit of running an unmolested blockchain. I also heard that currently, there is also fork ideation of ETH that will keep running on PoW. And here's the catch, mining does not waste resources.Do note that, the power expenditure in which generated on other cryptocurrencies is surely a different thing in terms of security for each of them.",

It has already experienced a 51% attack when the hash power was at it's lowest. I think they rewrote something like 100 new blocks.

I don't think Ethereum Classic is as centralized as ETH, but not sure. DOGE is merge mined with LTC because Jackson Palmer was the creator and only dev of the project. He wanted to quit and not compete. Cool to get both if you mine, but I don't think the community would move together. People are paying $1000 for miners that make $5 per day; they will want their ETCHASH investment back.",

Many of these miners end up simply using graphics cards. What little specialized hardware there is will disappear from the market as soon as the main project goes PoS.",

      "body": "yes its like the other said that etc and bitcoin have different algorithm so you can mine both unless you have software to do so. but bitcoin difficulty is crazy only efficient ASIC can tackle up the difficulty right now. eth in the other hand now also has ASIC but the will turn on into PoS this September. ETH Miner maybe will mine ETC after ETH turn into PoSbut for now i think is impossible to merge bitcoin and ETC at same time. both have different Algo and if you have software to mine both it still very hard since ASIC only mine 1 coin and GPu cant be efficient as ASIC",
