  "content": "It is glaring that Bitcoin is now in its winter season because of the sharp drop in price. But, just recently I observed that regardless of the fall in price of Bitcoin, an exchange company just put up a giant billboard in my area advertising Bitcoin. The Message is \"Leave Talk, Buy Bitcoin\". Which means \" Stop Talking, Just Buy Bitcoin\"The price of putting up such advert is very expensive. We all know that people and businesses are into Bitcoin for personal gains but the truth is that regardless of the challenges Bitcoin is facing, there are some die-hard supporters that believe in the goals and visions of Bitcoin. This individuals and businesses are willing to take the risk and damn the consequences of their continuous unwavering support for Bitcoin. These are my set of Bitcoin heroes that deserves commended. Some of them are highlighted below;Nations Adopting Bitcoin as Legal Tender: Presidents Nayib Bukele and Faustin-Archange Touadera deserve commendation. I might not be able to justify the reason and the implementation process of the adoption of Bitcoin by El Salvador or Central African Republic. Politicians cannot be trusted because most of their economic decisions always have political undertone. Also the implementation process of this adoption might be faulty, but the truth is that these Presidents have made Bitcoin a national legal tender. While other countries are busy banning or restricting Bitcoin transactions, these men gave Bitcoin the status of a national currency. They damned that threats and the doomsday predictions of the powerful IMF, World Bank, BEAC and bravely did the perceived undoable.  El Salvador and CAR are the first, of potentially many, examples of how a population will choose to implement bitcoin into their daily lives as a national currency.Individual Bitcoin Hodlders: Hodling Bitcoin presently takes a lot of patience, bravery and determination. It might be very easy for experienced Bitcoiner to hold but newbies can develop health issues holding Bitcoin because of the fear of losing funds.  But Hodlers are the reason why the market has not been flooded with Bitcoin. The fall in price notwithstanding, they are holding because they believe strongly that Bitcoin would certainly recover. Bitcoin has lost almost 55.44% of its value and there are still predictions that it would lose more yet some brave holders are still buying more Bitcoin at the time others are selling.Hodling Bitcoin Miners: Bitcoin miners are taking their foot off the pedal and scaling down production as cryptocurrency prices hit fresh lows and the skyrocketing price of energy continues to eat into profits. Some miners might be quitting the Bitcoin minting business because of the enormous energy costs for the comparatively small reward. Crypto market analyst have warned that If the current situation continues, miners will likely sell their  Bitcoins  when the price rebounds, which will slow down the pace of price recovery and could put Bitcoin in a range-bound move for a while. According to F2Pool’s June 2022 BTC mining results,majority of Bitcoin mining companies like Core Scientific have opted to sell their self-mined Bitcoin recently. Bitfarms, a major Canadian BTC mining firm, sold 3,000 Bitcoin, or almost 50% of its entire BTC stake for $62 million. The proceeds from the sales are mostly used to fund operating expenses and to grow capital, as well as to reduce obligations under equipment and facility loan agreements.But some brave and committed publicly traded industrial miners have insisted that they would stick with their long-standing HODL strategy. Regardless of the risk, firms like  Marathon , Hut 8 and Hive Blockchain Technologies are hodling. They have decided not to flood the market to enable Bitcoin recover. Believing Exchange and Trading platform:  Over the past month, prominent crypto companies have laid off thousands of employees as they prepare for a long crypto winter. But when other exchange and trading platforms such as Coinbase,  Gemini, Crypto.com are slashing its workforce and cutting down other expenses that would promote Bitcoin, Binance is planning to expand its workforce.  It is important to state that massive retrenchment of workers would let to investors lack of confidence and trust in the sector. Firms lose valuable knowledge when employees leave, and remaining staff often have difficulty managing new workloads.  Motivation  and engagement are oftentimes also affected as trust in management dwindles. It’s important to keep in mind that there are not only direct costs such as severance and accrued benefits, but there are also indirect costs such as reputational damage. Despite layoff announcements across the industry, many believing Bitcoin companies are still hiring. Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto research company   Messari , announced on Twitter that the company will be hiring more than 20 new employees. Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitget has plans to double its workforce to reach 1,000 people by the end of the year, and Ukrainian based decentralized staking provider Everstake recruited 30 new employees since the beginning of the war with no plans to lay off any staff. Binance currently has more than 2,000 roles open from engineers, product, marketing to business development. Believing Lending Companies: Despite the bearish trend of Bitcoin there are some crypto platforms that are taking necessary steps to build back client’s confidence on the sector.  FTX  is leading the drive to ensure that Crypto lending platform bolster their balance sheet and platform strength. FTX recently gave BlockFi a $250 million revolving credit facility which would help the crypto lending firm to deepen its financial relationship with its clients and attain stronger balance sheets. The proceeds will be used to fulfill client balances across all accounts. Last month, crypto broker Voyager Digital (VOYG) secured a revolving line of credit with Bankman-Fried-founded quant trading shop Alameda Research. The loan of $200 million cash/USDC-backed credit facility and 15,000 BTC is to safeguard its customers’ assets from current bear market conditions. Some other crypto firms have been forced to liquidate a large client that “failed to meet its obligations on an overcollateralized loan. While others are cutting workforce just to ensure that they cut expenses and stabilize the company’s financial conditions. Believing Companies: While Telsa has sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings this quarter, MicroStrategy Inc. bought 480 coins worth roughly $10 million at the height of the crypto market’s collapse.  As of June 28, the company has approximately 129,699 bitcoins purchased at approximately $3.98 billion, or $30,664 per coin  MicroStrategy . The company is converted nearly all of its cash reserves into Bitcoin.  Michael Saylor the CEO of MicroStrategy is prepared to go down with the ship of Bitcoin even if prices collapse to zero.Bitcointalk Community: The drop in price of Bitcoin has not stopped the constant flow of knowledge in this forum. Members have not stopped researching, teaching and learning about Bitcoin. This forum has helped newbie in the Bitcoin space to use, invest and hodl this priceless currency.

We as diehard fans will survive the crypto winter and we will wait for the next bullish season, when many opportunists with join the crypto world again and pump the crypto prices.Companies like Tesla are the opportunists, while companies like Microstrategy and Binance are the diehard supporters.The problem is that the number of supporters isn't increasing as fast as we want and many institutional investors would restrain from buying Bitcoins. In times of crisis, the investors are running away from the high risk assets and searching for a safe heaven.Anyway,I don't get the point of wasting money to buy an advertisement about buying Bitcoins. Many Bitcoin supporters are simply insane.",

Right inner my college, during examinations the Bitcoin logo was advertised tagged \" BTC says no to Examination Malpractice \" I'm too lazy to go taking pictures of it , but I'll give it a trial I have also seen alongside the road stating \"BTC is freedom for ever \".As per The Salvadorian President, he has been a great influence for the utilization of Bitcoin BTC within the Nation. Still amazed that some firm's and the average investor's do not use Bitcoin for them business as said by  Aljazeraa. Should Bitcoin really be boring before it gets the full awareness it deserves ? Still patiently waiting to see he's prediction come to reality ( Bitcoin reaching 100k this Year ).https://twitter.com/obi/status/1483136159601635335?t=F0yuF4TyJCCuMTOHhtF9hw&s=19.    The aspect of using Bitcoin, out fiat don't really like posses all of those skills.

      "body": "Smart people know that the time to invest is when the market is in the red, although many are still quite cautious due to speculation that Bitcoin may not have bottomed out. The current situation is a possible indication that something positive may be happening, although it remains to be seen whether it is a recovery or a bull trap.As for the billboard, it is still a very popular way of advertising, especially in areas where people still do not have access to the Internet to the extent that it is the case in developed countries. Although the idea itself is understandable from the perspective of the advertiser, I hope that they understand how important it is to educate people who buy Bitcoin, if possible before they buy it. If you are not educated and do not understand what you have bought, such an investment can easily turn into a very expensive loss.And as for the rest, I would like to comment on the lending companies, which have proven to be a serious problem, and I see no reason for them to exist at all, and if they have already begun to fail, they should have been allowed to fail until the end. It's just an encouragement for some new companies that will start doing the same business, and in the long term everything will collapse because it's a bad way and a big risk for all those who think they should treat their Bitcoin like fiat.",

Yup, no self interest from their side, pure altruistic approach. Great to see ads like that. We all know people who never buy. It's like they want to relate to you somehow, knowing you're into crypto, so they say things like \"I'm planning to bbuy just waiting for the right moment for it to hit real lows like 10k again\". It's like when you come visit your friends on a motorcycle and they're like \"nice bike, I've always wanted that, maybe next year I'll finally buy one\" and they never do.",

Other than that when we talk about exchanges it's not just the new ones entering the market everyday but it's also a matter of right advertising, understanding the risks as well. I do think that it is good that they are advertising but at the same time we need to talk about right advertising and catching the right audience, not everyone would be willing to buy Bitcoins, but right now people just have this notion of ' Buying Bitcoins ' not just going to a particular exchange so it's actually a good idea 💡",

As for El Salvador and CAR, the former has been continuously committed to promoting Bitcoin, but the latter probably have just done it as a PR stunt, as the country has an incredibly low (4% of the population) Internet penetration rate, which means there's only a handful of people who would realistically even be able to consider using Bitcoin.",
