Liquidity having coins dump first and others later. No wonder, this is a bearish era, isn't this? I think about it because all coins are exactly dropped, following the journey of Bitcoin that is also crashed so much. This may not be the end of this crash price because some continuous drops may still be ongoing. However, who knows the market exactly? Who knows that several months later the market will immediately pump? Or vice versa?That is why for whatever altcoins that I am holding right now, I have no choice but to hold them. Whether they can survive or not, this becomes my own risk because I have bought them, and too late to stop loss",

The newer ones that would attract typical retail participants are the ones that will go high, mostly not the old ones.",

It is possible that altcoin traded in highly liquid markets will not gain influence quickly during fast markets. It really depends on how the traders react during a fast market and usually no matter how good the liquidity is, there is always a chance that the holders or whales will make a massive sell off which will affect the market price.Quote from: Wapfika on June 20, 2022, 01:23:50 PMProbably his altcoins doesn't have much volume or it is just relatively new which might have hype factor to withstand the bear market.Sure, but it's only temporary as the hype will soon dissipate once most people are will sell and secure profits.

Crypto is synching with the market and stuff is getting real bad ass now. Except the stable coins, there is no other alt which has not dumped a lot. In fact many of them are doomed by 80% plus deduction in the prices and market depth is crazy low. With this, they are now on the verge of closing the projects also.
