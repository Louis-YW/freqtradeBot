  "content": "Pandemic is still here, natural calamities are unpredictable and being a country prone to typhoon many Filipinos still needs our help and the previous Charity was a great success despite of what happened. Maybe this is the best time to move on and start over again?Do you agree on reviving the Charity program but with a great system and a foreign escrow? What will you suggest para mas maging effective ang Charity program this time? Sa tingin nyo mayroon pang magtitiwala na magdonate dito sa Program na ito? This is open for feedback and suggestion, especially kung sino ang magmamanage ng Charity Program this time.I think we can still trust the previous organizer as long as may system na sila especially on recording transactions and distribution of goods.",

      "body": "Supporting this one. Maganda ang purpose ng Charity and yes kailangan lang magkaroon ng magandang sistema kase eto lang naman ang naging issue before and wala namang issue about misuse of funds though two of the organizer didnâ€™t try to defend themselves anymore but at least, crwth made a clear statement that the money was all meant for the Charity works.Sa tingin ko naman ay marame paren ang magdodonate for this charity. Many Filipinos really needs our help and kung pwede nga lang every places magkaroon ng representative eh para mas mapabilis pa ang pagabot ng tulong sa ating mga kapwa.",

      "body": "To become more effective, better to be more transparent this time and if ever na magkaroon ulit mas ok kung bibigyan naten ng chance yung iba to do the charity work kase before organizer lang ang mga nagchacharity so very limited lang yung mga places and if ever na may interesado talaga at least give them a fund to do that charity.Ang tanong, sino ang maghahandle nito ngayon and if kung may interesado paba dito? With or without donator kase most probably may trust issue pa and need muna ibuild ito ulit. Matrabaho ito pero super worth it ang pagtulong.",

      "body": "Support den ako dito kase maraming natutulungan ito and I agree na prone tayo for the calamities though hinde lang dito since marami ren ang mga bahay ampunan na kung saan ay nangangailangan den ng tulong. Need lang maging maayos this time, at most probably magtulungan especially sa mga events kase kahit hinde tayo magkakakilala dito ay panigurado, willing naman yung iba to support. The question lang dito talaga, sino ba ang willing mag organize ulit?",
