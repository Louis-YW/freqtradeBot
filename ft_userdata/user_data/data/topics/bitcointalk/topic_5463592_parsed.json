What he is saying is that is bitcoin different from bitcoin spot ETF just as bitcoin cash is different from bitcoin. The answer is no, although bitcoin spot ETF is different from the real bitcoin, but it should not be compared with how bitcoin cash is entirely different from bitcoin.

It's not quite as simple as you described, because that would mean that some company like BlackRock or Fidelity agreed with the US government to provide a service to their clients that would be based on a complete lie. In other words, the SEC will approve company A to launch a spot BTC ETF, that company has already agreed in advance with another company that will do the custody of the purchased BTC, and then company A will actually issue fake shares in the fund and pretend that it bought BTC on the market.To me personally, it does not look even remotely realistic in a country like the USA, because business there is still something very serious, and companies worth trillions of $ would not even exist if they cheated their clients in the way you describe.Fortunately, Bitcoin cannot be faked regardless of what anyone thinks on the subject, but it can be manipulated to some extent by those who have enough power to do so. Let's remember the guys from the BTCtrash fork and their attempt to take the throne and where they are today.",

You can own shares in an ETF just like any company. The value of the ETF and its shares are determined only by the value of the stuff that it owns because it doesn't do anything else. If the value of the stuff goes up, the values of the ETF and its shares go up. If the value of the stuff goes down, the values of the ETF and its shares go down.In this case, a Bitcoin ETF owns bitcoins. Suppose the ETF owns 1000 BTC and the ETF issued 1 million shares. If the price of 1 BTC is $30,000, then the value of the ETF is 1000 x $30,000, or $30,000,000. Each share is worth 1/1,000,000 of that, or $30. If the price of a bitcoin drops to $25,000, then the value of the ETF drops to 1000 x $25,000, or $25,000,000. Each share is now worth 1/1,000,000 of that, or $25.There is actually more going in an ETF, but those are the basics.It is called a \"spot\" ETF because the ETF's value tracks Bitcoin's \"spot\" price. Some may also call it a \"physical\" ETF because it owns the actual bitcoins instead of contracts, but that is a little weird because bitcoins are not physical. There are also Bitcoin \"futures\" ETFs and these own futures contracts.",

I think you can read the reference from the link sent by @ _act_. Now, for one more thing, the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin-cash, if seen from the name alone, is different, meaning don't OP get confused in interpreting it. well, this is the difference, let me try to explain.The First, when BTC was released, it was in 2009 and BCH was in 2017, and when viewed from the transaction speed, BCH is superior where is the Bitcoin Cash Network. Whyl ike that? because Bitcoin Cash can handle more transactions per second than the Bitcoin network, because transactions tend to be more lower than BTC and and Bitcoin Cash is considered a Bitcoin 'Fork'. and what is unique here is that for BTC there is no such thing as printing new coins while BCH is still possible.",

All the government ever wanted to do was to control the masses and this is not feasible with bitcoin because it's a privacy coin. Bitcoin spot ETF is just a fake version of bitcoin that goes against everything that Bitcoin stands for. Sometime ago I came across an article that's obviously been sponsored by one of the Bitcoin ETF companies because it gave some lame reasons why people should choose Bitcoin spot ETF over Bitcoin. One of the reasons is that owners of Bitcoin Spot ETF don't need to be wary of getting a wallet or their funds been stolen by hackers because the company is responsible for holding it.",
