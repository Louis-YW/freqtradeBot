Each time I run out of emoji's that's available on the forum, I usually make use of my phone to make my typing and conversation enjoyable for me, as it also allows me to use the ones that's on my mobile keyboard. I'm far from my PC now, but I will really try this out when I get home and see what it looks like, so that I can at least save myself the stress of switching from desktop to mobile just so I can be able to add emoji. I will edit this comment if I eventually enable this extension and see how it works.",

However, when the post is published, the emojis are clearly visible in the post, as you can see. It is possible that some settings in your browser block the display of emojis, as is the case if, for example, you use the Tor settings for security level Safest.🎃🎊🎉🎭",

Maybe some emoji didn't work in preview option or after posting that's why they made the complaints. I had seen this shortcut before and forgot about it. Thanks for reminding me SMF provides some smileys that can be shaped into images using certain codes. And I got these five emojis on same type but it doesn't show in the forum when we do posting. So I tried to do just a little scripting using those codes, to add those on the Smileys line.And also Did a little testing myself.  Quote from: PX-Z on October 19, 2023, 11:31:47 PMYou can use this text codes, i don't know what they called though, without installing any extension or what on your browser.Code:>:D ^-^ O0 C:-) 0:)      Or just use your built-in emoji keyboards for android and ios, it probably will work.

However, since I don't want to do that now, I created this script. If you take a closer look at the codes of my script, you will see that these same codes have been used there. And their names are probably evil , afro , police , azn , angel  .",
