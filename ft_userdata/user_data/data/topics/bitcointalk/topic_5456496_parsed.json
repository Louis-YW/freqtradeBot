I'm not sure if I get you correctly, but it seems like you want to place a limit order instead. If you want to learn more you can read it at their help page[1]. I also suggest you continue asking on your previous threads since this is related, and make a new one if you want to ask a completely different question/topic.[1] https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/advanced-trade/order-types",

I don't want to get out of the trade because I believe the price will keep going up and up.Is this possible when I buy Bitcoin in Coinbase?because it is crypto trading and not stocks/derivatives trading. When you open a futures contract, you must close it before withdrawing funds. So the position is open until closed. If you buy bitcoin on coinbase, you don't have an open position with exposure to bitcoin, you just own bitcoin with which you can do what you want. You can withdraw to another exchange, or to a private wallet or, you can buy altcoins with it or a washing machine in store ... whatever you want. That's why it doesn't show up as an open position in your account because you don't have a bitcoin position, you own a bitcoin now. The same with selling bitcoin. If you want to close your position just do an oposite trade.",

Limit orders also feature enhanced order options like expiration and execution instructions. For a buy limit order, your maximum price—also known as the limit price—is what you’ll pay to purchase an asset. For a sell limit order, your order will execute at your limit price or higher.With only $20, you should not trade because trading fee costs you a lot.

Use the sell option with a price limit and wait for the order to be executed by waiting until The average price on the platform is equal to the price at which you sell.I suggest that you start with a demo account so as not to lose your money. In that account, you can trade with zero virtual money for the purpose of learning.",

To prevent this, avoid using \"Market Order\" because it will automatically fill your orders based on the current market price. Instead, use \"Limit Order\" to set your order to the price you want to sell or purchase at, and if the market price matches your order, it will be completed promptly. When I trade, I never use market orders since the market is so volatile that if you buy, it will always choose the highest price. Instead, I always use limit orders.",

You are buying the real tokens and you can withdraw outside the exchange while Forex is just buying of contracts of the pair you are trading which means it's not the real asset. This is why your position on Forex will just remain active when you purchased since its a contract unlike spot that is an actual tokens.You should learn the technicalities and definition of both type of trading before you enter on the actual trading. You are referencing the price that’s why it's hard for you to understand how it works.",

You'll only make money when the price of BTC goes further down and you will see the %age of profits that you made. You'll only secure the profit if you close the order when the price is below the shorting price where you opened a short position. I think you aren't familiar with crypto trading that's why you are asking such questions. I recommend you to learn about crypto trading first before putting your money on trading because if you continue doing this type of trading you will definitely lose a lot of money.",

Each order is executed as a buy or sell order according to certain conditions. And if you do not want to go into the details, there is something called the converter, where you can easily convert between your cryptocurrencies without tracking the market situation.With this command, you can easily convert between your cryptocurrency pairs without even researching the market details.However, learning all commands enables you to automate trading instead of sitting in front of the screen and waiting for the specified price.",

When you buy a coin at a certain price, you can always place a sell order above the market price if you want to sell it at a certain price, if the price goes up and hits that target, your coins will be sold. You can do the same for buying as well.If you buy a coin at $10, and then it's price increases to $10.5, you will have to manually place a sell order to sell it and you can't just do it with your previous buy order because that is not how spot market works, you will set your target price and sell it at that price manually.",
