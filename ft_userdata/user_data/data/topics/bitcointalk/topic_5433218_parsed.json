Also there is no firewall running on the server, so I really don't see how Bitnodes cannot connect. Unless it's because I already maxed out my incoming peers.If that's the case, then I will echo the comment you linked to: Is there a way to always connect to certain IP addresses regardless of the inbound connection limit?EDIT: Bisq can also connect to my node, though I suspect it's using the local RPC port and not the P2P port that is the question here.",

As soon as I finish exchanging funds and whatever on Bisq, I'm going to remove those entries and restart my node, and see if that helps.",

With a /128 subnet? Not that it was banned in the first place though, but I never pinged Bitnodes' test with my node's IPV6 address so maybe that's how it avoided a ban.",

      "body": "/128 is the 1 IP so it should do the trick. But unless the way it works has changed it's not proactive. So if you unban it now it can still get banned later since it has not been banned yet.Guessing, since you did not restart the node you have not done testing with the Sparrow configuration changes yet.-Dave",
