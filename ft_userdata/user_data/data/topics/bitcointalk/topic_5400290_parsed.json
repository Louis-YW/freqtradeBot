      "body": "I agree, Bridges linking 2 Blockchains are still very unsafe and can hardly be considered as decentralized because obviously no verified approach was invented. At least for now. Sending our coins over a Bridge can result in a loss of coins because it's just not a proven strategy. Each Blockchain is using a different tech for native coins and Bridges are just a merely centralized service offered for conversion. Some Bridges can also be target of hackers and scammers stealing our coins. Hacks have already happened: https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-network-bridge-hacks/It's extremely risky. Your advice is very real because we should keep our coins safe and don't engage in unproven transfers over different unproven Bridges.",

Bridges are inherently centralized because Bridges are currently still managed by (trusted) centralized actors. When we need interference between two Blockchains, a centralized entitiy is still involved, unfortunately. We need real decentralized bridges!",

      "body": "Indeed, we cannot deny the fact that there are several ways tyat hackers can take advantage of when it comes to block-chain bridges but it isn't that easy since people are being more aware and are being more cautious comoared to the past years. Not to mention the fact that most platforms or apps that acts as bridges are improving their security as time passes and even more so with every exploits found or experienced by other bridges. The potential of being hacked is reduced drastically depending on knowledge and cautiousness of the user. It may even not happen unless the hacking is executed on the platform itself that acts as a bridge.                Regardless of the risks, the truth remains; investors and traders in this industry will not cease to use these bridges or invest in them simply because we need them. A certain amount of risk is tolerable as long as there are better benefits or profits involved. Although I cannot say the same for everyone, it is the truth for me and for the people I know who are using these type of services.",

      "body": "I recently came to know about bridges and while I agree and understand the risks mentioned in OP and in general, I feel like bridges solve a really solid problem as we save all the transaction fees and stuff required for first selling and then buying again on the desired blockchain.I've been investing in many projects like Radar have their own bridge as well. I hate LUNA but there exists a bridge for that too and it worked out pretty well I used it last time.If you don't know how bridges work though, don't touch them .",
