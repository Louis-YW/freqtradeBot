Even they don't believe a trusted member of the forum. So what about you? Do you need upfront payment even for forum trusted users? Usually, I escrow funds for tasks like trending services. If work is done then I will release payment. Basically, I am looking for dextools trending or Pinksale trending service. But I can't pay upfront due to the high risk with the newbie's account. DM me on Telegram if you are a legit service provider.",

Let's point you something. 1. You didn't read my first reply, I asked him a few questions, and the OP hasn't given a proper answer. 2. You know very well trending isn't possible without KYC but still, you paid him, it's quite ridiculous, to be honest. 3. You haven't used any escrow service from the forum. This is funny for me, I am a Pinksale verified marketing partner and I am in the owner group as well. I know very well it's impossible to trend presale without KYC. Wondering how had you believed them? Anyway, I tagged the OP, because he is a scammer. Everyone knows it's not a possible trend without KYC hence he took the payment and refused to refund.",
