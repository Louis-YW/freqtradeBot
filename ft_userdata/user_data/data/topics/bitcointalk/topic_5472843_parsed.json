      "body": "After bitcoin has been existing, there has been so many altcoins. As at today, there are over 27000 altcoins, but bitcoin has over 50% of the market dominance. Most of the altcoins are tokens on a centralized blockchain and most of the remaining are also centralized. Bitcoin remain to be like a true decentralized digital currency which is far more decentralized. I am surprised that as of today, with over 27000 cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is still at the top with none of the other coins that show any sign of overtaking its market capitalization. Although, yet not a surprise because of how the altcoins are.",

In the early years of crypto, it was easier to create a natural coin distribution via mining but now it is impossible because everybody knows about crypto. Big miners will capitalize the new projects leave nothing to the average people. Bitcoin is unique that way because when bitcoin came to surface, most people couldn't understand what it is about. Some people sold their stash as soon as they they doubled their money.  No other coin will have the same natural history like bitcoin. Also remember, bitcoin is a software. It gets updates every once in a while so when a new idea appears, btc will use it as well. No need to worry about it.",

What if the second Satoshi appears?Well I noticed this same thing and that is why I decided not to continue with writing on the discussion and instead make a correction. The fact that you also said something about it means most people saw it and ignored and continued with the discussion either to complete their post count or something else. But @OP don't you think it does make sense to repeat what you have said ? I also observed something but I don't how clear it is to others but for me it's certainly not understandable if you have read the first post then you have to notice it too or maybe I'm the person that is not understanding the statement but let's get it clear. Or may if am wrong i should be corrected by the @OPQuote from: puradak on November 04, 2023, 05:08:32 PMSatoshi gave us a gift called Bitcoin without any greed and went somewhere.  And you said this below in the other thread leaving me with confusion. The greed here is my problem, are you saying below that Satoshi created Bitcoin with greed or you are saying he didn't create Bitcoin with greed? This two sentences are very confusing to me. Because it breaks the rule of concord in English, and smell this to be a result of paraphrasing tools or AI. Quote from: puradak on November 04, 2023, 03:25:56 PMBut what happens if someone creates a blockchain that is faster and better than Bitcoin and puts it out into the world without any greed, as Satoshi did?",

What if someone with as much genius and passion as Satoshi is creating a system better than Bitcoin?I think the only constant thing in life is changes. As time passes by, so new technology always comes up. Other technology advancement might come up but I think It would not be in form of crypto currency or blockchain technology. Even if it's crypto currency it would only be and update of blockchain technology to secure it harder to  prevent hackers to penitrate our wallets. If Satoshi nakamoto brings a new thing I don't think it would be Bitcoin again. Looking from what he did after Bitcoin, he created Bitcoin forum to make people interact vividly on bitcoin and it's inportant and how long it will exist. If he would have created another thing that would be more than bitcoin I think he wouldn't have created this forum.Taking about cars that wear created in 2009, if you check they are still car I don't think if there names change from car to another thing. Rather there version changed. Blockchain technology is an invention which Bitcoin has gained popularity so far and people has been grinded much on it. So I think there is nothing that shake people.",

A good question indeed about if another crytocurrency were to take over from bitcoin as the undisputed leading cryptocurrency, maybe bitcoin can still have it's relevance or it'd be relegated to being called \"shitcoin\". I sincerely hope that will not happen, because bitcoin has my respect, as the first and most outstanding crypto that has changed the narrative of transactions from banks to DEX. Another reason why i won't like another crypto to take the lead or be in pair with bitcoin in the crypto space is because, crypto in general might start to loose value just as other lesser coins are not worth much.We live in a competitive internet age, where almost anything is possible, technological innovations are happening everyday. Individuals and firms are outdoing each other to give better versions of their innovations, so we'll just wait and see whether any any cryptocoin can take over from bitcoin, although I won't worry myself about that now.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is the mother of cryptocurrency, so any other coins, even those advanced from Bitcoin, will still be an altcoin. I am talking about those creating virtual currency using cryptography. So technically, any cryptographic altcoin won't surpass or destroy Bitcoin due to the nature of cryptographic blockchain technology. But I admit there would be a new virtual currency with some other latest technologies instead of cryptography and blockchain. It doesn't mean a new virtual currency would replace Bitcoin. Both would exist on their own platforms. Both would be welcomed by digital currency users. For example, you are using Bitcoin, but you can't ignore PayPal or other digital fiat currencies. All of them exist on their own platform, which we continue to use. MFS (Mobile Financial Services) is performing well when the traditional banking system still exists.",
