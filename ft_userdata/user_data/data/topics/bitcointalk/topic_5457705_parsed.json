  "content": "Today I read about which exchanges provide proof of reserves and which don't. If some of them provide proof of reserves, how do they do it? More importantly, how transparent is that? Some exchanges transfer their funds to somewhere else after the audit ends and take snapshots of their reserves. Here is the case from Crypto.comQuote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/proof-of-reserves-can-reserve-audits-avoid-another-ftx-like-momentWhile the practice of PoR is becoming accepted by centralized exchanges with many starting to release PoR audit data, there is still the issue of crypto platforms moving their funds right after the snapshot for the audit was taken. Crypto.com recently transferred 280,000 Ether To Gate.io address after it released its PoR audit, fueling rumors about crypto exchanges potentially faking their reserve audits. Many in the crypto community claimed exchanges were borrowing assets to show a healthy financial book, only to return them back right after the snapshot.Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek came out to clarify that the $400 million ETH transfer was a mistake and was meant to be sent to another cold wallet, raising even more suspicion.And, while some exchanges give detailed breakdowns of their reserves during a PoR, other firms simply provide quick responses claiming they are in the black. Nexo has simply come up with a one-page snapshot that says they have more assets than customer deposits of around $3.2 billion.Even after the audit, you cannot trust an exchange that they won't transfer its funds to somewhere else, just like Crypto.com did. What is the solution?Don't trust, Verify!Only use exchanges that provide proof of reserves with complete transparency. Some exchanges share the wallet address of their reserves, and you can always check those wallets on the blockchain.Here are the top 10 exchanges and their stats  SL Exchange Name Provide PoR? Reserve Data Link 1 Binance Yes https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/#reserve 2 Coinbase Exchange No No data 3 Kraken No No data 5 Kucoin Yes https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/#reserve 5 ByBit Yes https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bybit/#reserve 6 OKX Yes https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okx/#reserve 7 Bitstamp No No data 8 Bitfinex Yes https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitfinex/#reserve 9 Gate.io Yes https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/#reserve 10 Gemini Yes https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gemini/#reserveYou can verify those exchanges' Proof of reserves from the internet. You should avoid exchanges that don't provide Proof of reserves or even if they claim that they provide, but it's not transparent.",

If they are traders, they should trade and after the trade, they should move their coins out of the exchange. If they want to invest, they should use a noncustodial wallet instead.",

No one should use an exchange account to hold their funds in it. Either use a hardware wallet or software wallet like Electrum. I guess you will agree with me regarding choosing the exchange platform. I do not suggest anyone use exchange unless it's necessary to use. But, if someone wants to use an exchange, they should avoid exchanges that do not give their proof of reserves. The purpose of this thread is to let forum people know which exchanges don't provide proof of reserves. Also, it's possible to verify the proof of reserves these days.",

If exchanges reveal their reserves wallet data, there is nothing that can be more transparent than this. We don't have to believe auditors as well. Some exchanges already shared their wallet address, and you can verify it from blockchain data. For example, Check Kucoin reserves data from coinmarketcap. https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/ Visit this link and scroll down to the financial reserves section to check their reserves. The wallet address, chain and balance info are already shared on Coinmarketcap. I am pretty sure most of the people didn't know about this. Edit: OP updated with the reserve data link",

Kraken and Bitstamp too are not small exchanges and they do not have it yet.Probably because proof of reserve isn't the primary consideration when users choose which centralized exchange to trust. And rightly in a way, because these proofs, popularized by Binance if I'm not mistaken, don't really prove much. Kraken, for example, didn't submit theirs because they see no point in this financial reserves thing shown in Coinmarketcap.If I were an exchange and I provide an address that has $1 billion in Bitcoin in it, what does it actually say? It can be verified by anybody, yes, so what? Does everybody know as well that my liabilities actually total $2 billion? But supposing I'm also providing a breakdown of my liabilities and it totals $800 million, would that be enough? Still not. How would you know that I included all the deposits? Even supposing I included everything, how can you be sure that such an amount is really owned by me, or that it's not offered as a collateral or something like that, or, in short, that it isn't encumbered in one way or another? All I'm saying is that this proof of reserve thing is not really the \"Don't trust, Verify!\" kind of thing.",

Proof of Reserves is an indication of the expected growth of this platform compared to the deposits and accounts created. If the platform was sharing its reserves and 60% or more of these reserves were in the form of stablecoin/exchnage tokens/bitcoin, this might be a sign that if a problem occurred with those currencies, it is an early warning to stop using the platform.This is a simple practical application for my speechExchange Name: MEXC assets link https://defillama.com/cex/mexcTotal Assets is $1.06b and Assets by chain is Ethereum $895.83m Bitcoin $73.68mIf the price of Ethereum changes sharply, this platform may not be able to fulfill customer withdrawal requests in exchange for changes in the price of Bitcoin.If this platform keeps more than 50% of its deposits in the form of BSC, which is currently equal to $33.1m, then if BSC halt that means the liquidity of this platform is exposed.Deposit growth is another indicator.",

Centralized exchanges engage in fractional reserve scam and so many of them are into shady businesses even if they try so hard to cover it. Do not also believe in their proof of reserves, because you cannot know if an exchange is solvent when you don't know exactly what their liabilities sum up to, and they can easily manipulate all of this, so to believe anything they say, you have to 'trust' the exchange, which is something that isn't recommended to do.For 'reliable' p2p exchanges look here: https://kycnot.me/?type=exchange",

As far as I can tell proof of reserve doesn't include any ownership information, at least not in detail. You can start a new topic if you want to discuss who owns what exchange or which exchange is related to another exchange/business.You're probably better off looking at the registration information, although it doesn't guarantee that they will publish their company structure in detail. Even if they did, there is still no way to make sure nobody is playing a money laundering game. Most of them is probably done behind the scene and no exchange would publicly tell you that.",
