But the fact is that the more you accumulate the more the chance of losing the bet, that is just it. Also there are sometimes that only two games will cut your bet, sometimes it can be three if the bet slip is very long. The one I couldn't forget was many years ago when I had over 10 odds, the last matches which was 1.05 odds and it was the lowest among them which was over 0.5 goals in first half, it made me to lose the bet, it was even a no goal match to full time. I wished I have not taken Sao Paulo that time and they had the history of no to little goal scored that season, but it was an experience for me though.",

Don't you think this could cause it??",

You can check to all your betslip that has this kind of result on the similarities of the odds for those games. Maybe you are putting an uncomfortable bet on your parlay just to complete your bet which might be the reason you are keep losing on that part. Why not limit the number of game which you always win base on your previous parlay. There is nothing wrong to decrease your odds if the result will be converted to profit.",

You can also set a limit to yourself but that would measure self discipline. The best thing to do is diversion. If you have other things to do you'd be forced to stop playing whether you lose or win. Regarding limiting onself perhaps this one:, You've won $1k, then your drive is still there, secure $600 then bet your $400 until either you're tired or you lost this amount. To some this would be difficult because of frustrations and other contributing factors. But if you really want something, you have to do something.",

Your instincts will basically react to this, like you are doubting to add one more because it feels like it will be the game that will drag down the profits if you are expecting to cash out. Parlay rules are different, maybe that's why you feel like the cashout amount was too low while there's one game left in your long list. You can notice it, that the multiplied amount is getting higher and higher while adding another and so the cashout rule is just following it with some cuts because you are not to continue the risk.",

Then cut of for you is the 14th game, isn't it?I never had such feeling, its just random for me even though not really into the sport betting much often. For the title the answer is simple when you won enough or lost more than you expected then it should be the last game.",

Apart from the cash-out option which most betting companies has introduced lately another option you can nicely use to avoid a total loss in your bets due to the last games cutting your game is flex your bet options. How does flex your bet work? Since it is the last game that always spoils the bet of the op flexing your bet with one game can help to reduce the lost because in this option, if the bet is spoilt by one game the op will still be given a complete money though not the initial total outcome of the bet but the total amount accumulated after using the flex your bet option.",

If your parlay is on a long-win streak already, for let's say 8 out 10, it just makes sense that on the 9th game, the cashout will not be available. But I'm amazed that you are hitting all that parlay legs at 80% to 90%. Even with all Favorites, that was hard to do. If you are playing with low odds, you really need to include many parlay legs to feel the profit. If you are playing with high odds or maybe around 2.0 - 2.3, a maximum of 5 is enough although the chance of hitting that should I say is below 50%.I think you are good at parlay so I will suggest just continuing and I believe you will hit those soon.",

If you wait for the last game just before it start you can cash out if you don't have strong faith for winning.However, I notice that gamblers will always complain of what cut their game from winning or bet slip. Most times the last game have cut the game the list times but because you are so conscious at the last game to collect your winning that is why it is usually noticed. Not necessarily that the last game cut our games just we focus on it. Sometimes the beginning or middle games do that alsoQuote from: MainIbem on November 17, 2022, 12:52:01 PMCould you explain this please if there's any way we can do away with it lets begin the adjustments.There are some options like cutting 2 or 3 that you can play. Although this has reduced profit but it is a solution",

I think this last game cutting off winning games happen more often because Soccer games are so unpredictable, the reason we will see a game that should have been an easy win for big clubs end in a draw or loss. To do away with last games cutting off winning games is to cash-out the win that has been recorded and do away with the last game. It will be better to to have something than to lose everything",

But in this case, it's lucky if your multibet is destroyed on the last game, because before this game takes place you can make a hedging bet and thus fix the plus that you have already earned. But in fact I think that losses in multibets happen randomly and sometimes it's the first event, sometimes the last, etc. There is no pattern here.",

They won't give you the cashout option every time. Maybe if you are satisfied already with the profit once the cashout option becomes available, don't think twice about claiming that win already.I understand that it's only a few bets needed to claim the whole prize that's why the decision is really critical.
