  "content": "After winning the Finney bitcoin prizes representing His work on bitcoin, Greg's achievements and contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem surfaced on Pete_rizzo_ page on X regarding Why \"Greg Maxwell Is a Bitcoin Legend\". First on the long thread (which I'd share a few of it for discussion purposes) before he joined Bitcoin he built protocols like the Opus Codec adopted by streaming platforms like YouTube and Spotify. I went further to check more details on this and found a pdf and article of his where he confirmed building Opus CodecSecond, Greg was a developer but weren't building on the Blockchain until 2011 when he discovered Bitcoin, and didn't consider decentralized consensus on a P2P network realistic. But later began to code and was noticed, in 2012, by a Bitcoin lead developer and promoted to be among the five core developers. Third, Greg found privacy to be an essential property of every monetary and payment system, hence he encouraged other developers to hold tight of privacy. Hence, to strengthen the network's privacy without any modifications Greg, 2013, built a scheme called counjoins to make transactions more difficult to trace. Alongside other beneficial contributions he's made in the Bitcoin network, in 2015,Â  was handed a role of BIP editor, and his respect attracted the interest of other developers and they too ideas to Greg first. He always played the role of a teacher, and a lot of us here have read and learnt from his contributions in matters regarding the forum. Last on this thread (mine) in same year Greg and Adam Back, found a company called blockstream that focus on developing Bitcoin and hiring core developers. All other details regarding why Greg is a btc legend is in the link below. It'll be great to recall that we'll not only participate in Bitcoin by investing money, they're other ways of adding value to the ecosystem just like Greg did when he found Bitcoin. Even non programmers through research and writing can as well pinpoint a means of doing a memorable contribution to Bitcoin. https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/status/1878079505052413965",

      "body": "fun facts..gavin gave greg some github responsibility.. greg then took over and co-founded blockstream with a guy that never coded for bitcoin, and then headed up and invented the core brand, pretending the guy that never coded for bitcoin co-invented bitcoin, to take over the main reference client of bitcoin code, then kicked gavin out calling gavin a threat to bitcoinfun facts..greg took control of bips and the moderation of forum discussion of technical aspects and then only promoted the core roadmap idea's that had sponsored deals to take bitcoin down one direction that follows the blockstream agenda(sponsored by corporate/institutional agenda's)fun facts..greg pretends to want self control of funds, privacy, etc.. but then wants people to merge their funds into a group, which requires organising, thus requiring to trust other peopleusing a new script that doesnt reveal who or how many sign over the funds. opening up a risk of loss of funds if you dont trust the organiser. and yes these new scripts are not indistinguishable from normal transactions, but instead obvious and transparent to be these special transactions, thus highlighting them and announcing them to blockchain analysis observers in short if you use a coinjoin or other privacy promoting scripts, you are added to a watchlist and followed more closely and scrutinised more than if you didnt use itafter getting his big reward for pushing certain sponsored alterations through, he was later kicked out of his own organisations he founded because his diminishing and falling reputation was causing issues for the business. his new goal of 'new technology/networking expert' is to talk remotely via old fashioned ham radio, to strangers he doesnt know in different countrieshe is now trying to repair his reputation, but the damage is doneim not defending gavins history, but im also not going to ass-kiss gregs.. its just best to not have a bias one sided view of certain people that had great power over bitcoins evolution and instead show both sides, to be more informed and not just hero worship these people that play god with bitcoins code",

      "body": "One of the reason why Bitcoin is as successful as it is today is because of a somewhat immaculate stewardship of the Bitcoin Core repository. It would have been so easy to fumble by letting less-than-stellar changes be made to the software. I'm not saying that everything has been perfect, but the fact the Bitcoin remains the #1 coin by market cap & trading volume - by far and away - means that obviously they've been doing something right for a long while now. Having Greg Maxwell on board was definitely one of those somethings. Cheers Greg ðŸ¥‚",

      "body": "saying the market price is due to core code evolution is not a good correlationthe market and financial value of bitcoin is based on the PoW mining minimum costs increasing over time which sets the bottom benchmark of support for the market to then speculate from.. the PoW function is not due to core but code the existed before core was even a thing.. and infact core have at times tried to suppress and cause issues for the mining community including greg trying to mess with asics ability to efficiently mine (the asicboost era)as for you pretending that its merely stewardship, when infact they have full discretion and control of protocol planning and changing, they are more akin to governance not stewardship(or their title of janitor they pretend to hide under), government not stewardstry not to overdo the god like worship, bitcoin needs to actually become more decentralised, less governed, less hero worshipped.. as that was the point of it originally, so lets not celebrate its central governance. people need to be made aware of the negatives so they are fully informed of issues and they can help towards not pushing bitcoin further down a bad direction (by repeating past instances that made certain aspects more centralised), and instead learn from past mistakes and not repeat themEG having the same guy (greg back then) as both chief tech officer, bip controller and technical discussion moderator is 3 pillars too many for one entity.. and now we have achow as CTO, BIP, mod we still have the same centralised problem, infact achow is also the github manager who also decides on the priorities of what gets delegated as the next phases of their roadmap. so 4 pillars in one entities hands.. so not a good thing to just let continue and celebrate and god worship and positively spin into loving stories of perfection and preference",
