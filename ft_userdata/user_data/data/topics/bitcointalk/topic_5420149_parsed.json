I know societies in North Africa that use the word million to express a thousand.When we were kids, we didn't have big or many requests. Any small amount would be a fortune to us and able to make us happy. At that age, we did not think that we should pay the rent and equipment and spend the money on medicines.",

If a business guru is with some millions it is nothing to him but if a poor man or an average man is with a million it might be a huge sum.In my country where inflation has devalued our currency a million is nothing big only a poor man will see it big. As we grow up fiat currency depreciates, imagine that we are talking about one million Bitcoin... Damn too much funds.I remember then we are kids when we hear million its so big that we think you can get whatever you want with it or we just call you a rich man.",

It's enough to get any education you want including pilot courses and such. 100k allows you to do what you want, with some limits, but we all have our small goals like we want to own a car, or a motorcycle, or a motor boat, or our own place, maybe have our own gym or a fitness studio, a workshop, have enough money to raise a child or travel around the world. Just 100k EUR allows you to do it. 1m is even better if you have that much, I don't think I'll ever have a million EUR at hand, especially not with what's going on with cryptocurrencies today.",

And yes the value depreciated a lot due to the inflation over years that is why we are here to see the revolution in the future monetary system which purely depends on demand and supply.",

Change of expectations as we grow a side, to be honest $1m in the 90s or early 2000s was way more valuable than the current $1m, and It was also way too hard to acquire. I think you will agree with me on that.What we are seeing in real time is the effect of inflation, where money loses the buying power over time.",

Money depreciation is a constant and will continue indefinitely. To some extent, your level of wealth determines how valuable a specific quantity of money appears to you and how well it meets your needs. A thousand dollars seems different to a rich man than it does to a poor man. The value of money in your eyes is usually determined by one's level of wealth.",

It is not because you looked at the amount with the eye of a kid. Things are now very bad with inflation making our local currency almost useless. Cost of living is very high that there is not much 1million can even buy in my country today. But elsewhere, maybe in the USA, Canada, England that 1million is a huge amount of money.",

A million Naira in Nigerian currency then isn't easy to find but the case is not the same now because the currency has been devalued. Inflation has dealt with many economics not only Nigeria but some parts of the world has been down with high cost of living and the currency value is becoming lesser by the day.  In the case of Nigeria, the redesigning of the currency is what the government is trying to portray like it will help to put back the strength of the naira but how realistic is this is what we are still asking.",
