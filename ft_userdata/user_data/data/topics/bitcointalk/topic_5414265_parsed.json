  "content": "Recently i had a class with some group of friends where I taught them how to archive crypto success and how to utilize the bitcointalk forum. While I took them through the class, I had some few tips which I enlightened them on being a crypto millionaire and those tips were the major reason I created this thread to also share my thoughts with some beginner on how to archive success in crypto investment. Note: This thread is not created as a form of investment advice or any advice that may concern financial investment/services. It's just more like a general information. Cryptocurrency investment is not a get rich quick scheme but it is a part of investment that could get you rich early or later depending on the market situation, pumps, limited supply and high demand. Crypto market/price prediction has never been 100% accurate, lots of people thinks they can just invest today and take a huge returns in a month. Having a good profit from crypto in a month or two is very possible but crypto investment has one logic which is \"the higher the risk, the higher the return\" some risk may cost investors all their funds. Which is why any one that wants to go into crypto investment must chose on good coins to invest and must trade with caution having understanding about the risk attached.Crypto investment: it is a way of investing real fiat money into digital assets like Bitcoin or other coins/Altcoins. Before carrying out cryptocurrency investment, it's good to note the risk attached. Reasons not to depend only on crypto investment: the crypto market is not always stable, at which profit doesn't come always. Most times losses may be encountered due to bear market and at that point, selling will not be an option. Price surge doesn't happen always as the crypto market is usually volatile. As a crypto newbie you may be vulnerable to security risk.Follow up news on the crypto assest invested on: recently Ethereum switched from POW to POS and their merge completed recently most investors just throw their money into crypto currency and forget about it, which is not a wise thing. There might be some updates from project which may be of importance to investors but in a situation were an investor is not open to  news update they might be left out. Tips that can help crypto Newbies Many people have become crypto millionaires because they’ve well bought low and sold high. But there are also various kinds of crypto millionaires, the crypto entrepreneurs who have the necessary business acumen to create world-changing solutions.Not everyone who gets into crypto will become a millionaire, however, the industry that creates the most millionaires is the cryptocurrency industry. According to a CNBC Millionaire Survey, nearly half of millennial millionaires have at least 25% of their wealth in cryptocurrency. These findings demonstrate a generational divide in wealth creation from crypto. With millennials making money from investments in cryptocurrencies as opposed to more traditional, older investment choices.The list below is the few 3 tips of who wants to be a crypto millionaire.1: As a newbie in crypto investment, it is good to buy cryptocurrency on a DCA (Dollar cost averaging) basis. For example, if you have $10,000 to invest into crypto, buy your crypto asset in smaller bits (Chunk/chunk) gradually over a period of time, rather than all of the $10k at once. The main advantage is to reduce your risk and you also gain valuable trading experience on the process.2: spread your digital asset portfolio over several digital assets such as BTC, ETH and other Altcoins.3: focus on one key objective that you are trying to archive and identify the different ways to archive it. once you have identified the different ways to archive it, conduct analysis to understand the optimal way to archive the objective. Now focus on the relevant key steps and mile stone to archive the objective, then work methodically to archive each key step and mile stone.There’s no denying that some cryptocurrency traders have become millionaires, thanks to their successful investments. What’s not as often discussed is the great number of people who have lost significant sums trying to become rich by investing in crypto.Unless you have an enormous risk tolerance, investing in cryptocurrency may not be a good choice for you. However, if you’re the type of investor who is willing to shoulder enormous risk in the hope of becoming rich, you should at least consider employing some strategies to minimize risk while still offering significant upside.

The aim should be to have a good living from crypto and  not to become millionaire. I can say that it is difficult to become a millionaire in crypto now if you are not rich already.  This is not the early stage and for one to find a good altcoin that can make ×100 and above, you must have been a victim of numerous scams.So, if you are not an early adopter and if you don't have much to invest now, bitcoin may never be able to make you super rich.",

Crypto investment has possibilities of making people rich but lately it's becoming over hyped that many now come into crypto with a Ponzi like mentality and the very reason scammers keep increasing their bags. I will rather introduce Bitcoin not even crypto as a whole, but bitcoin as a subset of crypto to newbies and educate them how this can make them their own bank.When it comes to crypto investment it has to deal with so much technicalities which involves using both fundamental and technical analysis and using one day or even a week to teach all this won't be enough and as such instead of risking people who know little or nothing about how the market works its best to make them play safe till they learn",

A newbie cannot spot obvious scams, and in order to have a chance in \"crypto\", one will need much more than that.

Diversifying your portfolio but only in crypto will never guarantee secure profits in the end. It’s better if you can maximize investing in bitcoin since it’s the best asset that will always give huge profits as long as the market is also stable. Furthermore, investing outside the crypto world will also help you gain additional source of profits. Invest in gold, stocks or bonds, or in real estate, that way you will always receive guaranteed profits from your multi sources of investments.",

No need for altcoins, Bitcoin can make you a millionaire in the future if you hold it long enough, and do DCA on a weekly or can spread DCA on a monthly. There have been many crypto millionaires but most of those people were early bitcoin investments, instead of investing in altcoins. But if you still want to invest in altcoins to get rich faster, you can still invest, but be aware that the risk it brings to you is not small.

I even evny some of my friends who even bought $20 and sold at a huge value, but that would be a very rare event to occur if you are a kind of person who uses fundamentals. But I like the suggestion of spreading it through btc and others this is the safest way to increase value of ones portfolio. Or studied thw fundamentals and focus on such parameters like marketcap and use case of such projects. If the right time come then it will explode to roof. Thats how you earn massive gains.",

So no, average investor shouldn't compare themselves with VCs. And if we learned anything in the last few months, its that even big names can make stupid mistakes and go bankrupt, so investing in bitcoin still remain the safest thing to do, no matter how deep your pockets are.",

Metaverse is the hype in today's era. Investing in the metaverse as an early adopter some time ago was able to provide big profits for investors, traders and community holders. But, if I personally were given a choice (this is not financial advice), then I would go all-in in BTC rather than venture into the metaverse. Because, I have to do further research to find out the potential viability of the project. Meanwhile, BTC has more potential in any way. IMO / NFA",

But it seems that the objectives of the class is inconsistent with the lessons you taught. Although the forum is a goldmine of diverse information on Bitcoin investment but I have never come across any thread that talks about making members crypto millionaires. It seems to me that you have introduced the forum to them as a millionaires club where people can come and get information to become rich. I have read through your post and I never saw a place where you highlighted or discussed the educational and mentorship benefit of this forum with your friends.    You also did well to inform them about the risk involved in investing in cryptocurrencies. Informing them that it is not a get-rich-quick scheme and discussing the volatility of the market with them is also wonderful. But each time I see words like Tips to become a CRYPTO MILLIONAIRE, I feel very uncomfortable. There are no guaranteed pathways or tips to becoming a millionaire in any form of investment. And the world have been brainwashed that only millionaires are successful. People are making a few hundreds and thousands from the crypto industry and they are also cool and content. Informing them that you have the tips to make them crypto millionaires might mean that you are introducing the industry as a get-rich-quick scheme. And you have to be very careful because people in your area might start seeing you as a crypto millionaire. Since you can teach how to be rich in the crypto space, then you are already a millionaire. You might be attracting criminals because they might want to get some of your millions.",
