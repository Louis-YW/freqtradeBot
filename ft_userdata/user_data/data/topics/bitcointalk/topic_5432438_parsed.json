How the Poll is to be RunPoll will run until January 6th 2023 at 11:59pm EST.  1 vote per user (you are NOT allowed to use your alt account to vote twice). You can change your vote, of course only up until the contest ends.  IMPORTANT: This will be an OPEN voting system. Pick your top three entrants for each contest and post it. You will be required to post only once in this thread your votes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd places in each contest. You cannot duplicate a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place for a user unless it is in the other contest. Here is an example of a user’s votes:Code:Contest 11st place - tom2nd place - dick3rd place - harryContest 21st place - Joe2nd place - Larry3rd place - IkaikaIMPORTANT NOTES:Once the 7 days is up, the voting will end. I will tally all of the votes and announce the winners. NO NEW ACCOUNTS CAN VOTE. Your bitcointalk.org account has to be at least 2 months old in order to vote and had been active (your last post prior to voting post) in the last 3 months to count as a vote.In the unlikely case of a tie, we'll run another poll which will be set to run for 3 days.Quote from: MoparMiningLLC on December 31, 2022, 01:09:01 AMI am confused - are we voting for who actually gets first place? or just our top 3 favorites? curious because what if a contestant gets 5 votes for 1st, 5 votes for 2nd and 5 votes for 3rd - with only 5 votes in each of placement, they obviously lose if the voting is by placement instead of total overall votes, in which case they would have 15 votes.Winners will be selected by total points accrued by all votes cast as follows:1st place vote = 3 points2nd place vote = 2 points3rd place vote = 1 pointEach place carries a weight in points. Most points wins 1st place, second most wins 2nd place etc..No manipulation of any kind allowed. If I see you trying to manipulate the votes in any way, I reserve the right to disqualify you. Please no alt-accounts, no begging for votes etc.  If there any typos in links I will correct them as I find them. If there is anything I forgot it will be posted here asap.Mahalo for all the entries. This truly was a great first year for the xmas decoration contest.",
