If you want to convince @riceberryrice, you need to bring better argument.I don't understand why we are still talking about this - the tool, even if it's not malicious and works as expected - does not actually do anything because there's no attack surface. The whole thing is very obviously an FUD fueled idea of hoping to sell software that does not work.",
