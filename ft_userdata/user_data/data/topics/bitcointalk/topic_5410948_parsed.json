  "content": "The whole panorama that Oasis is visioning is critical yet the steady phase path is on its pace. Cipher and Sapphire have proven remarkable results. Cipher being the ParaTime implantation of TEEs assuring the confidential smart contracts being private, turning the whole blockchain more secure and private.On the other hand, Sapphire is more like an IDE for solidity developers with built-in Confidential EVM ParaTime.
