  "content": "Hi, we are looking for help double serving on a few crypto related e-commerce campaigns. You don't need to know anything about Google Ads, although it wouldn't hurt having a little experience. Yes, it's against Google TOS to run multiple campaigns for the same product but if we do it this way, there's little risk to either of our ad accounts.Requirements:- PC with stable internet connection for campaign setup.- Credit or debit card to pay Google.- Bitcoin wallet or PayPal to receive our payments.You will host an ad campaign that we manage/configure for a client, in return for $20 daily just for letting us use your account. This campaign will spend a predefined amount so your first payment will consist of this + the $20 paid before the ad starts running. You won't be asked for any of your information as I will leave that up to you to setup with Google.If you have any questions, feel free to leave them below.",

I have a bad feeling about this..Hi, thanks for your interest.So we aren't looking for accounts with attached cards. We can and do create multiple accounts with our own cards however this only works for 1 campaign per product. If we setup multiple accounts under our own cards to advertise the same product, they won't run for longer than a week before Google realizes we're gaining an \"unfair competitive advantage\".Second, again we aren't looking for direct account access, the account would remain under you and you'd forward us the requested metrics and make a few changes once a week.There are 4 steps to creating an ad account. The first three are to setup the campaign and we'll do that together. Last step is payments and that's when you're on your own.Let me know if you have any further questions, thanks!",

Focussing on improving your site's conversion rate.Case B: Creating new websites for each new account, managing those websites, and managing those accounts just to compete with your ad to drive the CPC even higher + making each ad account go through the learning phase(it takes time for any ad to reach an optimal level, since google AdWords takes time to learn about your ad's behavior) which won't give you the same conversion in the beginning and you will probably lose money in the beginning   or, as I said earlier,  Case C: They are definitely running blackhat ads.",

I just think its a too good to be true daily offer for a one time task.That's correct, we don't require anyone to use their own ad account currently running ads. You'd create a new one for this task and if you're currently running ads then we could create an MCC account and this would ensure that if the time came that Google noticed the ads and banned the account, it wouldn't affect the other accounts. Google won't ban an agency for running ads for a client that's doubleserving. The agency would have no way to know this.Quote from: edgycorner on July 11, 2022, 08:05:00 PMQuote from: PX-Z on July 11, 2022, 07:52:25 PMQuote from: edgycorner on July 11, 2022, 06:59:05 PMQuote from: definevalue on July 08, 2022, 09:48:53 PMI just made a new LLC so i'll gladly do it for ya send me a DM looking forward transacting!Please be wary.They will definitely run blackhat ads, which will land you in legal trouble.And you will probably be suspended from using google ads ever again for life.It's not worth risking your rep with google(since google adwords can be an invaluable tool if you ever start your own business) and credit for  20 dollars.I dont know how it was categorized a blackhat ads by you, but if anyone who wants to work with OP can use a dummy google account to make google ad campaign offered by the OP, then it easy to say that it's a risk-free.

We're outsourcing because if we setup an ad account under our MCC to run ads for the same product on the same keywords then yes we risk our MCC getting banned because it's clear to Google what we're doing.If anyone running ads with us has a problem with BTC payments, we offer PayPal as well. We only offered BTC because of where we are currently.As far as keywords go, we setup the account together so they see exactly what keywords are being added. And as mentioned previously, the account stays under their Google, we won't have any access as that defeats the whole purpose of this exercise.That's an interesting read but I highly doubt they were paying $20/day to run ads when they can create the ads themselves.Quote from: edgycorner on July 11, 2022, 09:10:50 PMQuote from: PX-Z on July 11, 2022, 08:24:12 PMAppreciate the warning, but there are lots of ways to avoid that (wont mention any of those).

Initially this is what I thought as well. Just raise the budget and drown out the competitors (5-10% is nothing though) but this doesn't work the way you think. Google has a way of diminishing returns as you raise your budget. This is because they artifically raise the CPC because of the other ads using auto bidding.Case B is exactly what we're doing and I'll let you in on a secret. Google prioritizes results for smaller ads because naturally they need the smaller advertisers to have good results in an effort to get them to spend more. By creating multiple ads, we're driving the CPC up yes but not nearly as much as we would by raising the budget drastically on a single ad. In addition to cheaper clicks, think about the competition when you have multiple ads spending $100/day. Their impression share will drop by around 20% for every ad that goes up and the only way to compete is to raise their CPC to a level that isn't sustainable because the niche we're in (e-commerce), there's only so much room for marketing.To me, it sounds like you've been banned in the past and dealt with having multiple accounts banned. Next time you're having this trouble, I would say to try setting up a campaign in a completely different niche and watch as it starts running. Google can't differentiate from regular advertisers and agencies and those in between (Fiverr/Upwork freelancers). Sure, they won't let you create new accounts for your business but other business in different niches they will let run no problem.I only mention this because worst case, our ads get detected as double serving and they ban the account. If you wanted to use Google Ads in the future, you can! Unless you're trying to run a campaign similiar to ours.",

I can't say this is too common the way we do it but there is always the risk. Even if you're running a fully legitimate campaign on Google nowadays, you've still got a high chance of random AI misfire suspension...Our business or the website being advertised does NOT violate Google TOS. However, running multiple ads for one product falls under gaining an \"unfair competitive advantage\" and this is against Google TOS.$20/daily for someone who will never use Google Ads is pretty good. Anymore than this and we won't be profitable.

I was young during that time and haven't realized that my identities were being used for the campaign of that company. I think you're misunderstanding something. We don't need a credit/debit card. You just need to have a payment method to setup inside Google Ads. This is done on your own computer. We're not asking for your credit card details.... Quote from: yahoo62278 on July 12, 2022, 11:31:39 PMWhat if the candidate you choose has to pay taxes on the money they earned? You going to pay the taxes for them as well? Just curious since everything is pretty much kyc these days.Glad you asked. So our taxes are a little more complicated. You'd be working as an independent contractor meaning we don't need to request any personal information and you'd be responsible for filing your own taxes. Since you won't be receiving the profit from the shop, you'll just be taxed on the $20/day and you file this like you would normally.",

Ever since June, even our standard one campaign lead-gen/e-commerce campaigns are being suspended. Of course they come back on appeal when someone actually reviews the campaign.What's interesting to me is the fact you continue to respond here. Sure, anyone on a forum should be weary of anyone promising money and you made that clear. So why are you still here... That's the only reason I bring up your lack of success.I'm not going to keep entertaining these posts, however to anyone interested who currently runs ads. Read the posts further up, you can still run ads assuming you're not running my exact campaigns with my specific keywords. I'd love for someone with a better understanding of adwords than this guy to chime in here.",

And now the same person is looking for new accounts while being anonymous too. And whoever applies to your scheme, will get their accounts banned too(which you fail to mention in your OP).I am not the one enticing people and use their accounts to abuse google ads (There's still a chance that they may end up in legal trouble since we don't know what your product or keyword is).This isn't called being successful kiddo. It's called being a conman, Know your words.",

I am concerned about users who might end up in your scheme and face consequences because they weren't aware of the risks beforehand. I have talked to definevalue(check my first post on this thread) on telegram in the past when they were looking to start their own business. They are a good person(and I hope they think the same about me). My posts are meant as a warning for them and other users like him. These are the problems with your offer:You fail to mention your product or keyword until now. Someone with a legit business would have done so in their original post. You are looking for an advertisement right? Why be so private then?If there's no predetermined business or keyword, then you can abuse their accounts and probably run ads on any keywords at any time. Possibly landing them in legal trouble too.Until now you have written 1000+ words with zero mentions about what your business is about   This fact alone cements my belief about your business being a blackhat and probably very illegal.",
