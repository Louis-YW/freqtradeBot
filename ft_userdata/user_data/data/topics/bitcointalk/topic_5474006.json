Start at your own level and at times goes on, you will be able to expand your business. I can see that you are in a signature campaign and you can use part of it to start a small scale businesses like selling of recharge card, data subscription and cable subscription. These businesses don't require much capital to start and you don't need much tools other than your phone.If you can dedicate a little time from your schedule to learn a skill like barbing and shoe making, it'll also go a long way to help get some little money to start saving for a bigger business. Acquiring capital to start a business is actually not easy but you don't have to use that as an excuse and sit down watching. I would have said taking a loan but banks and other lenders are often reluctant to lend money to new businesses since they're considered a higher risk and by the way, you don't even have the personal savings or assets to put up as collateral for a loan. So it can never be an option here.Quote from: Zanab247 on November 14, 2023, 05:11:46 AMI was in their shoes before when I was in school some years ago before I became a graduate, and anytime I made demand of anything from my elder brother and sister they must respond to me well by sending the money and food stuff when I was in school, and the day they refuse to respond to me, I will be seriously angry with them not to pick their calls or reply their chat at the moment until they look for way to solve my problem. But is this not entitlement mentality? They are your siblings but feeling entitled to their resources is absolutely wrong. If it is easy to get money, I believe you would also have yours. If you try this with someone, you'll end up begging and never repeat such.",

This is the part of this life, many people especially from middle class countries feed from hand and to mouth and this has stopped them from owning their businesses, you can’t be focused on building a business and neglecting your duties.  One of the easiest but most the riskier ways of getting capital to start up a business is to seek for loan either from bank or individuals who believe in your idea and would like to invest in you. It is risky because once your business runs into problem you still have to pay back the loan. The safest option would be to a save up and invest but most at times you can’t afford to save as a middle class person due to responsibilities which I feel is paramount than actually growing a business that those responsibilities could actually come to crumble if not taken care of first. Other options are government grants which are rare in middle income countries",

This is one of the beauties of Bitcoin: the fact that no matter how much money you have, you can buy it. Even if it is only worth 10 dollars in other top cryptocurrencies, you can do it too.  If you are based on a traditional business, you will really need an amount for the business you will enter; that depends on the category you choose, of course.

Maybe because those loan services are working on the same hour as the working common man is a proof that it's difficult to get a loan and most of these loan services have the same days that they're closed when most people also have a day off and another reason is probably because most people don't have the time anyway.",

This is a scenario used by many small and medium businesses and even activities that require huge capital such as real estate.

I question my superbeing (God) that if he can't give me capital then he should give me ideas but realized I was very wrong. Discipline is the key, if you discipline yourself to save up for a business there is nothing that can stop you even your family responsibility can't stop you. I discovered that I have to build myself first before building a business. If you're build up for business then your business is built already. Someone told me that I am the cause to everything I face, and yeah she was correct. We take responsibility when we are not supposed to take it yet. If you are not your parents why try to act like them. You play a role of a father when your supposed to be a child that's where you begin to get it all wrong because your savings will end up being spent and guess what? the same people you spent on with that money will still question you that what did you do with your money, when you fail. So don't responsibility for your siblings when you're not there parents. I read a book titled\" that which you are afraid of is where your success is\" if you understand this title only I guess you will start being successful immediately. Just like you have business idea that you're afraid that it will fail or what will people say, that's what this book talks about just don't think of it just do it and you will find out that you're hitting what you want. For me my biggest fear is how to make post to rank up but after reading this book I just make post I do think of anything else.

But I came to realized that life isn't the way we looked over it because what you planned isn't what God plans for you for it is another different version of stories. About your siblings calling you regularly for their school needs Yes it's alway good to attends to them, but if I may get you correctly it seems you people are above 5 in the family and secondly you aren't the first child (first born of your parent) right? Good!What you would do is that if you must saved money for business look for a way to join to monthly contribution group where if you receive salaries you send part of your salaries over there or possibly create a bank account you have no access whereby immediately you receive salary the bank will automatically deducts a specific amount from your main balance to your non reachable account then the little balance can be reserved for your expenses and charity to anyone who asked you.What I noticed most at times is that we don't always plan well with our salaries or weekly/monthly income and immediately we received it we start distribution without at least removing savings from the income, and whatever that makes you start altering that money you ended up not having any single savings so, if you followed this methods you will end up having savings. Lemme give you one parable from Africa \" Persin wey dem carry for back no dey carry anoda persin for back\". Meaning; you that is trying to stand won't put all your siblings load on your head, there are some that are mostly needed maybe the urgents ones you can see to it but when every little problem you send money to them take or leave it you can't make any savings by doing this. That is the only way you can be able to save for your business or whatever you want to investment on, like me not every request my family  need I easily release money to, why because there are alternatives and we can actually managed what we have. Have this at back of your mind that family requests doesn't always end so the more you keep settling the family problems the more they keeps arising causing you not to have any savings for your life. And the most painful thing is that same family would still come abuse you that when you were making money what have you been able to established with your money, bro it's very painful to have this at your later ends so it's better you plan to have saving than overseeing every little problems of your family.",

Can you share your experience on how you get your capital.The budget you have will definitely clash between your needs and business capital. This often happens when the income is less than ideal to support our own needs, provide a certain amount of funds for the sake of our loved ones, but on the other hand we also need guarantees, whether it's health or retirement funds in the future, namely by investing, doing business, etc. This article will involve the context of financial management aspects. If your income is stable then this is not a problem because it has a main basis. On the other hand, if you feel that your income is not yet completely stable and that sometimes your own needs conflict with the needs of your loved ones, then accumulating capital to achieve your goals will definitely take longer.The question is, is what you have produced so far managed well?Meanwhile, what I do now is keep setting aside 10-20% for long-term needs (business capital, investment, etc.). That's all I can do because it is adjusted to what is produced. Furthermore, gifts to loved ones, especially parents, are arranged every 1 month or 2 months depending on the schedule that I have prepared from the start, and even then after basic personal needs have been met.",
