I knew a Thomas here some years ago who also worked in community management, and I wonder if it is you from a brand new account, although it seems improbable.BTW, I have checked your website and there is no mention to the means of payment. If I'm not wrong, you are accepting Bitcoin, aren't you?Either way, good luck with your project.",

But the fact that I met him in this forum and he worked as a community manager increased the probabilities of a coincidence.As long as you accept Bitcoin, you are in the right board. Again, best luck with your project.",
