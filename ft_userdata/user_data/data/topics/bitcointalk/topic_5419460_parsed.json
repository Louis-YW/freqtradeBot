  "content": "Richie Sunak is the newest UK PM. Owner of enormous wealth, his father-in-law is the founder and owner of Infosys, one of the Satellite companies of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Sunak is also known to be a crypto believer, however, the WEF's influence over its actions makes me believe he will be the first country leader to implement a CBDC. Call me mad, but I do have strong suspicions this will happen. Russel Brand, today posted a video about this; so you should give it a look and then comment with your thoughts.",

      "body": "Central Bank Digital Currencies feel like a conspiracy theory to me, which is why it's crazy they're so close to being rolled out.  When I talk to average everyday people about CBDCs having the power to put expiration dates on your savings, or cut off your spending if you eat too much meat or buy too many toys...  It's stuff out of a horror film.  When I see what's happening in China right now though, I have no doubt that government is going to take as much control as they're able to and CBDC is the way they're going to do it.  Terrifying, but thankfully we have Bitcoin and with a little luck, that will be enough to live a good and free life.",
