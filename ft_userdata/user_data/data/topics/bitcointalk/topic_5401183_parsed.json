Did you just encounter it like that or did you intentionally redact it?How did you find out that it has 2.9 BTC in it without knowing the address?",

I am not sure , I literally copied everything and pasted it changing some characters.",

I am not sure , I literally copied everything and pasted it changing some characters.If the private key has 51 characters, it should be a valid private key. It is uncompressed as it starts from 5, compressed private key will start from K or L and have 52 characters. Mini private key have shorter characters.That is uncompressed private key, it should have 51 characters.",

Even if this corresponds to a P2SH-P2WPKH script it still could be a non-standard uncompressed key.",
