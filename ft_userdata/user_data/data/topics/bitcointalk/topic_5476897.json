You come here just to create fud? you should read all reply from Theymos and then make a thread. All your questions already answered so no need to repeat again. Kindly read thisQuote from: theymos on December 01, 2023, 02:01:03 PMWe've received no warnings or requests to change policy from law enforcement regarding mixers. Quote from: Shenanigan on December 07, 2023, 11:45:41 AM2) theymos, are you currently cooperating with the authorities?3) theymos, do you have any unspoken agreements with the authorities?  answer is already givenQuote from: theymos on December 01, 2023, 02:01:03 PMMaybe Bitcoin will be banned in the US someday, and then I'll have to either shut down bitcointalk.org or find a way of moving it to some remaining territory of freedom in the world. That's the problem with centralized forums. I wish that more work was being done on creating decentralized, uncensorable, but also usable forums. I would love nothing more than to be able to shut down bitcointalk.org due to some decentralized solution making it obsolete. Find me a 501(c)(3) nonprofit working on this, and I'll donate to it.",

If that was my aim, I'd probably continue to allow mixers. My goal is to put in place as few restrictions as possible while keeping risks (for bitcointalk.org and its users) at reasonable levels. Centralized mixers have qualities which make them especially risky in ways which other things do not.",

If he doesn’t want to answer these questions, then that’s his choice. If admin's trust option is not blocked from distrusting or redtagging, it means he doesn’t mind being discussed. If admin was against being diststusted and redtagged, he would have blocked all these buttons on his profile. This means he doesn’t mind being discussed equally with everyone else.",

No one could have predicted the events that have happened in the last couple of months. To be clear, signature campaigns can be banned altogether, that includes casinos, and other platforms advertising here. The forum doesn’t have control over what happens outside the bitcointalk community, if certain services are banned here, they can run their business and promotions elsewhere.",
