Why is it tyranny?Tyranny is what China does in the name of \"COVID safety,\" ie taking Shanghai residents and forcibly confining residents to their apartment buildings and even in some cases, euthanizing their pets.https://www.businessinsider.com/china-langfang-district-says-kill-covid-patients-pets-2022-3I believe they canceled the kill order, but nonetheless not before some pets were murdered.China is the outlier, we already know the CCP was horribly tyrannical.Perhaps developed countries would fare a bit better: Forced vaccinations, vaccine passports, and removal of private enterprise under the guise of \"lockdown regulations,\" driven by unscientific and unsubstantiated claims about COVID spread. Read here, a literature review and metanalysis of COVID-19 lockdown strategy: https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2022/01/A-Literature-Review-and-Meta-Analysis-of-the-Effects-of-Lockdowns-on-COVID-19-Mortality.pdfThere were no statistically significant differences between free populations and populations under lockdown measures. The politicians knew this from the start, but they let their own personal fears and emotions dictate COVID policy.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on July 09, 2022, 08:39:11 PMAnd even if it is, how's supposed a society cope with a virus?Protect those who are vulnerable.

Yeah, DerGigi is from Germany and his hot takes are extremely embarassing for the German Bitcoin community in my opinion.  He's talking like he's knowing everything about virology, medical research and so on but what's his profession exactly, virologist?  Of course he's not a virologist but he's acting like he's one and that's the problem in my opinion. There are so many pseudo experts making a fortune by spreading their unfounded Corona sceptical analysis, it's quite strange. In Germany, we have a whole bunch of them, squeezing shitloads of money out of their braindead followers. Bhakdi, a German Corona sceptic, recently launched a book and is advertising it everywhere. Schiffmann, another German Corona sceptic, collected tons of money from his Corona sceptic fans and now, he's travelling around Africa from his money. Another one, Ballweg, collected \"donations\" for his \"Anti Corona-Dictatorship Movement\" but he was caught using these funds to enrich himself and his friends.  As a Bitcoiner I'm sceptical, I'm doing my own research but of course, I'm not anti science and I'm not thinking that I'm more knowledgeable about the state of intensive care units than the chief of medicine staff there.  Being a Corona conspiracy theorist reminds me a little bit of Craig Wright (Faketoshi) or some Shitcoin scammers: they have no clue, unproven theories, the experts are against them but the Shitcoin scammers are making a fortune by scamming their bagholders with lies.  Corona sceptics are such a joke. I'm not saying, that everything went well because in Germany, the government party also made some shady mask deals, where some local politicians were involved, but I'm glad, that I'm vaccinated because I don't want to gamble with a Covid infection and I'm glad, that some common sense politicians and experts are in the government currently instead of these Corona sceptic maniacs which have no clue at all.  There's even a German vegan cook now doing virology analysis and calling for a coup against the government but he was busted by AnonLeaks Germany several times.  Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on July 09, 2022, 08:39:11 PMWhat I don't understand, and I'm all ears, is the arguments. Why is it tyranny? And even if it is, how's supposed a society cope with a virus? Even if we assume it comes from a lab, isn't deadly, enriches vaccine companies and the like. It concerns me, because rational people whom I've learnt a lot from don't go quite well with this.I agree to what Gyfts already said here. What's happening in China currently is not reasonable at all. When there's a small number of infections, the whole city is locked down in China.  That's not helpful at all. But it's also looking like their vaccine (SinoVac) is not as good as our western vaccine. Right now, almost all Covid preventions are gone in Germany, still some people claim that there's a \"Corona-Dictatorship / Tyranny\". I don't know how they are getting to that conclusion. There was even a vaccine mandate discussed in our parliament but the parliament rejected that idea. Honestly, I'm a bit tired of talking to such people claiming that there's some sort of \"Corona Tyranny\" ongoing. It's like there would be people claiming there's a \"Seatbelt-Tyranny\" ongoing, a \"Traffic light-Tyranny\" or something similar. Covid19 is much more dangerous than a flu, that's what all the medical staff in every local hospital has confirmed here in Germany and why should these tens of thousands medical staff people lying about that?  Makes no sense to me at all.",

      "body": "alot of the tin foil hat idiots shouting tyranny have never personally experienced war, nor seen death up close or personally seen real slavery. they have NO CLUE what real tyranny is. its not about a government \"asking people\". its about a CRUEL and harmful governmentwearing a mask is not tyranny. much like societies request to wear underwear. its just a social respect for others that dont want to be impacted by idiots. perves and sickosidiots dont learn what tyranny really is because they only experience the sanitised version. the cleaned up version. where its swayed by racial bias and then promoted on things like Fox news, with a smile. \"america great.. other country bad\"take the whole concept of thinking china are tyrants.they have a 1.4bill population and a 1m 'detainee' camp..(0.07% per populus)yet ratio/percentage.. america has more detainee's vs its population.yet you dont hear about the numbers of american detainee's or the conditions they are put in. funnily enough america think locking up a mexican is ok,splitting up meican familes is good. .. but locking up anyone fox news doesnt want locked up is bad. (if it suits the headline clickbait they want to bait people into)idiots need to put things into prospective and truly look behind the headlines. fox news presents china as tyrants by pretending the only currency in china is locked to a government surveillance system. yet it only takes going to a travel agent and asking to swap dollar for chinese currency and get handed paper bank notes. you soon realise no one is demanding birth certificates and a photo just to use chinese currencyreal tyranny is not being asked to wear face masks. real tyranny is being a actual slave being actually beaten and whipped physically with blood and scars. beaten into submission. or killed (or at minimum threatened with it) if you dont obey.. where by you cannot change your slave master. there is no escape from their land. (at a local scale or a national scale (slave master or countries leader))people can leave china. they have planes.. they can apply for citizenship elsewhere. no one is threatening them with death. ...saying that masks are a tyrannical act is ignoring the actual things that threaten life, cause actual injury and death and restrict peoples lives completely for no reason but greed and power.the masks and respect of personal space, is to reduce a virus that does kill from harming others that dont want to die due to disrespectful people that dont care about the other peoples healthamerica is just about as much a prison as china. the funny part is america doesnt want people leaving america or coming into america. their \"patriotic\" mantra is their prison. yes america have planes too. but thats why if you take away the fox new racism of hating asia/middle east. you start to see the similarities of nations. media want to make americans scared of leaving america. (unless its to a vacation resort owned by capitalist americans)its things like making free healthcare sound like a negative.. because the prison wardens(capitalist politicians) dont want americans to want the same free choices and things as other countries. here in the UK. we can change our GP(family doctor) we can go to any hospital. we do not need to check if certain hospital or doctor is on a certain health plan. we dont have to worry if certain procedures are covered by certain plans. we dont even have to worry about if an ambulance is going to charge us. there are silly things americans are ignorant of. like wanting citizens to be able to wave a gun, but also wanting an american police officer to kill anyone waving a gun. i do laugh when there are articles headline said china killed pets.. but the article then below the clickbait topic. then announces the state didnt implement the supposed rule and admitted they have no evidence of pets being killed.if there was a true mandate. it takes days/weeks to then employ people and supply tranquilzers and to organise actual raids on pets. thus it was a non event because a news story is not the same as the 'boots on the ground' requirements of fulfilling anything. idiots just dont think beyond the clickbait topic title. they just get emotional and believe the topic title of some random article, and then try to tag it as tyranny, even when nothing actually happenedas for the fools that want their freedom to catch the virus if they chose or want to lick anyones face without permission.. well they need to learn respect for others and personal space.do whatever you want in your own private life just dont go impacting others with your stupidity.",

I personally did not get vaccinated and got over the virus without any consequences, but I was never against people getting vaccinated if they wanted to - but I am absolutely against forcing people to get vaccinated so that they can enter a public institution or come to their working place.People have different theories about the vaccine, but the fact is that it is still experimental and its long-term consequences are unknown, and that Covid-19 is a disease with a very low mortality rate compared to other diseases that take tens of millions of lives every year.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on July 09, 2022, 08:39:11 PMWhat I don't understand, and I'm all ears, is the arguments.

In addition, now that it's summer, there are no measures, as the virus continues to spread and mutate, and at the end of the summer, new measures and restrictions will begin. It is completely wrong to fight the virus only during autumn and winter, because the virus is there all the time.What I want to say is that moderate measures should be in force all year round, instead of having lockdowns, forced vaccinations and dividing people into those who can live normally and those who become enemies of society during autumn and winter.",

No one disputes that the disease exists, but compared to cancer, heart attack and stroke, it has an almost harmless mortality rate, especially for the younger population.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/",

This applies equally to all walks of life. For example, anyone who believes that the Earth is flat in the face of the unequivocal evidence to the contrary is a moron. Anyone who rejects hard evidence without anything to support their opinion other than \"This is what I think\" is a moron.Which brings us back to the original point of this thread.

These situations have occurred in waves; however, they are yet to be resolved despite the measures implemented to routinely screen patients admitted for surgery for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies.QuoteCOVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-022-01831-0https://notaakhirzaman.com/10607/I thought the critically ill patients were the ones supposed to be getting it?

No one disputes that the disease exists, but compared to cancer, heart attack and stroke, it has an almost harmless mortality rate, especially for the younger population.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/As I see it, there is more than enough demonstrable and documented fraud to account for ALL of the (pre-injection) effects blamed on 'SARS-cov-2' and then some.After the de-pop shot went into the arms the 'side' effects are just called 'covid' or 'long covid'.  Exactly as I predicted.  Now they are calling it 'SADS' and blaming 'climate change' and such because the peeps are simple enough to believe it.That said, I believe it most likely that there is a coronavirus which expresses a somewhat carefully engineered so-called 'spike protein'.  Most likely the spike protein has been under development for quite a while.  Gluing it on to a coronavirus was mostly just a means of circulating it around to give some excuse for the genetic modifications to humans which cause their cells to produce said spike protein.  The so-called 'covid-19' that it probably did/does cause what was/is in some people a mild ailment that was not a threat to almost anyone, and especially those with a little bit of insider info...a somewhat connected friend of mine mentioned hydroxychloroquine (and a few other drugs) well before the '2-weeks to flatten the curve' when it was still available over-the-counter for malaria where I live, but I didn't get around to getting any at that time.  No mention of Ivermectin, and I wonder if that substance actually managed to catch the designers of the operation by surprise.The ACE-2 receptor has been of interest to biological agents developers for some time because there is a wide variance in the prevalence of the receptor between races and ethnic groups.  Some nations have had a particular interest due to the presence of undesirable individuals on 'their' lands of interest.  Apartheid South Africa and Israel in particular, and the latter is not a signatory to the biological weapons convention treaty.  One of a tiny handful of states who are not in fact.  Anyway, the features engineered into the spike protein interact with ACE-2 receptors lending even more support to the supposition that it originated from biological weapons research.The act of injecting people with the 'hurried new technology' which ends up making it impossible for the injected to develop immunity means that herd immunity will never be reached and the 'waves' will go on indefinitely.  The 'vaxxed' will be chronically re-infected with 'SARS-cov-2', and with a lot of other stuff which a properly functioning immune system would handle rather easily.  Herd immunity can only return when these damaged people die off.  The 'boosters' will help that process along.",

To clarify, I'm not against vaccinations. I'm against mandatory vaccinations. I've taken 2 doses and had no problem. During the second quarantine (mid-2021), I observed some unconstitutional attitude from the government; the elders were forced to do the vaccine, otherwise they had to pay some hundreds of euros every month, which is when I started getting concerned. Which brings me to this:Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on July 11, 2022, 11:11:58 AMAnyone who believes some barely literate anti-vax conspiracy nut with absolutely no supporting evidence, data, studies, trials, meta-analyses, over the mountain of scientific evidence, hundreds of thousands of trials, and billions of data points, proving vaccines are safe and effective, is a moron.I don't care if some people believe masks/vaccines don't do good, blaming Bill Gates, 5G companies etc., but I can't ignore the fact that governments do have found their way to impose themselves with divide and conquer. In my country, there are now more those who've \"given up\" with this, and those who take the vaccine, wear a mask everywhere (inside & outside) and, more importantly, ignore any person who might question their actions. Before the Ukrainian war, TV news, internet articles, radio, newspapers etc., had scared the shit out of all citizens. Don't you believe there was fearmongering? And how can a person who isn't a doctor verify all this scientific evidence?",

The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals.Here is the study he is referring to:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-67362200089-7/fulltextIt also says no such thing. If you look at Table 2, you will see a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection across all vaccines and across all time periods when compared to unvaccinated individuals in a statistically significant manner.Quote from: tvbcof on July 11, 2022, 11:25:55 AM-snip-This post reads like a bingo card of all the stupidest things anti-vaxxers believe. The only thing you missed out is that the vaccines are actually 5G nanochips.",
