My issue with this option is that there are people already using their cafe for computer training in the area where I intend to start this business so my fear is how best I can manage the competition although I have a unique idea that is different from what those existing cafes are doing.Your little advice will go a long way!",

      "body": "Our advice will have less impact on this issue. You know the condition of yourself and will probably know which one that will work well for you. I will assume myself to be in your shoes and the option that will work well for me here is the first one. I'm currently a teacher in a private school to be precise and in fact, I'm typing while sitting in a class room like this.Teaching will not in anyway affect your activities online. It depends on how you plan your schedule and follow it. I understand the stress associated with teaching profession but no school will allow you to work for 24hrs in a week be it public or private school. If you are concern about your Forum activity, then I will tell you that it's not a problem at all. As a teacher, you and reading, research and practical will become friends and you can still continue your learning in the forum.In my school here, activities starts by 7:30am. I wake up everyday except weekend as early as 5am and observe my morning prayers which after I will come online to engage myself on the forum and other social media platforms. I'm living in school staff quarters, so I report my name on time book by that 7:30am. I still come online to check on Forum and other medias when I don't have class. By 2pm, the school is closed and I continue with my normal life. Teaching is not as stress as many people assume, you can do well enough if you know how to plan yourself.My advice for you, if you are comfortable with the pay that school wants to offer you then you should go for the first option and plan yourself rightly. The second option is also good but it will depend on the environment and the kind of people living in there. Fortunate enough, you already spot the challenges associated with the second option and I guess it will not be the best for you.",

However, a teacher is remembered and appreciated by many people around him. It's nonsense if you are a permanent teacher but don't have free time to do other activities besides teaching, but in my opinion even permanent teachers definitely have free time to do other activities besides teaching, because the salary from the profession of being a teacher is not much and not will be sufficient for ourselves, not to mention if we have our own family to support.If you have skills in the field of graphics, it's good if you can operate and utilize them well. Nowadays, technology is given priority, especially in large companies that are looking for people who are experts in the field of graphics, because as far as I know, graphic art has a high price, this is why an opportunity for you to utilize your graphic skills. There is no need to be afraid to open a business, if you think like this at first then you will give up before fighting. Nowadays, there are many coffeeshops everywhere, but there are several different groups of people who go to these coffeeshops, the first group of people enter luxury coffeeshops just to fulfill their style even though the menu provided is not delicious, but they sell the concept of a luxurious coffeeshop, even though what they do just order randomly without knowing anything, the second group of people who enter coffee shops are to enjoy coffee who really understand coffee without caring about the place or concept of the coffee shop, but usually people like this prefer simple coffee shops with notes of the coffee they enjoy. Very understandable for coffee connoisseurs",

I think the first thing you should consider is your current responsibility, do other people like your parent/brother/other family rely on you to make money? If yes then the first option would be ideal, because if you teach professionally, at least you will get stable income immediately, and as you said you will still got spare time to get side income either from Crypto trading, or you can make video content on social media, or you could join some courses to learn new skills that will get you better salary. The 2nd option would be ideal if you don't have any responsibility, you just life for yourself. Because starting business is not easy, there is no guarantee when you will actually earn money, you will need to struggle.",

      "body": "You can do both. You can teach as a teacher from morning to afternoon and in the evening you can give private lessons for those who want to have knowledge of technology and things that you are good at. So both can run at once and you can make more money.There is nothing wrong with becoming a teacher and giving private lessons. You can also focus on investing in crypto because you have two sources of income to start investing in crypto. And both are good choices for you because you can also teach about crypto to your students. That means you open the minds of young people who become their students about the presence of crypto and they will also know about investing in Bitcoin.Most people always think about the size of their salary when they want to start. That is normal because with that salary we will meet our daily needs. But we have to remember that it's not always about salary but there are other things that you can feel. But it all comes back to you because you are the one who will live it.",

So he doesn't really explain it as it's a personal free time issue, and to op it definitely can be about making money, as to most of us it is exaclly that.",

However, he realized the same situation as you that the salary being a teacher is not enough to provide his needs and his family. He found another source of income as a virtual assistant, of course he get paid higher than being a teacher that's why he focus on that. What I can only say to you is, you should choose between long term career as a teacher till you retire or use your other experience with possible higher pay as it is about tech. Or maybe it would be better if you can do both until you realize what you want to focus between the two. It will be tiring of course but at least you can learn what you want.",

Always choose things that you like which in case teaching. There’s a lot of way to earn more by staying on your career such as pursue higher degree of your profession to get higher salary grade when you apply on high paying  schools in your country or have a side hustle that still related to teaching such as online learning which very popular and in demand especially for people on China, Korea and other country that doesn’t prioritize english while their citizen seek to learn it for global communication.Last choice is to teach overseas that offers higher salary. There’s a lot to do on your profession to earn more. Don’t sacrifice your fashion to other jobs that doesn’t give you certainty to have decent profit. At least on your profession you are still happy while earning even if it’s a little bit small.",

It is not a bad idea to start as a teacher in the mornings and then try little by little to set up a business in the afternoons, not only about crypto as you say, but the second option you suggest, you can start taking steps towards it in your free time in the afternoons, on weekends and school vacations.

Indeed, being a teacher is a form of service to the country and a love of science, but still, to be able to fulfill one's needs, one has to use money, not leaves.And I think this business is suitable for you, because your basis is education, you can start a business by opening computer classes or private lessons. Why do I suggest this.First, your basic knowledge and abilities are education, so opening a computer class or private tutoring is very suitable for you.Second, in my opinion, to be able to open private lessons, you don't have to have quite a lot of capital and you don't have to have a special room because the system is done from house to house. Unless you also want to open a computer class, to be able to open this business you must have a special room and must provide computers and other supporting facilities.Third, talking about time efficiency, you can easily manage your own time and it won't interfere with your online activities because you yourself make the tutoring schedule.Fourthly, talking about profits, of course holding private lessons is very profitable because for one meeting it can reach 10 - 15 USD/person and the more clients you have, the more your income will be.",

Yes, in my country. The second lowest number is like disrespecting teachers. So this is the fate of the nation's children who do not give birth to intelligent people. The government should set teacher salaries because one of the reasons why great people are born is also because there are teachers who educate and teach.

Well its going to be hard, and its going to take a long long time, and it may not even work, maybe you would fail and there is no shame in that at all, many people fail at doing online business, but at least you could give it a try. This is the idea, you like to teach people some basic stuff right? How about using something like Udemy, or a similar place, or even youtube for that matter which would mean its free but you would become youtube, to give these lessons? You could put up some amazing animations, and learn how to do graphics along the way, since you already know to a level, you would be able to do even better stuff, and that way you would teach kids whatever you want them to learn. It could be graphics, it could be math, it could be anything you want to teach them. You could do weekly videos, like one math per week and one graphics per week, so 2 videos a week, and considering how much topic there are on these subjects, you could literally make videos until you die, and there would be hundreds of videos on your channel, people could search thow to learn something and your videos may pop up. So I think online teaching would be much better path for you. Meanwhile, if you ever make money with it, then you could spend your free time trading, since all of this would be done at home, you could stay at home and during your free time keep trading as well.",

The only thing that may be a problem is your approach, since you don't have any experience yet try to take courses first and study how they approach their audiences and listeners. Also make a good connection wth your audiences, make it fun and interesting. You can also use your graphic skills here so you can make attractive visuals and designs for your courses.
