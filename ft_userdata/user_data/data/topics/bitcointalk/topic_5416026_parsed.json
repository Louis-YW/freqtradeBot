  "content": "Its no secret, 2022 has been harsh for Crypto holders and crypto projects alike. With that, there have been many failed en-devours across the space and likely more to come. So how can we find the real projects in all this mess of failed startups that seem to present themselves in a bear market?A project worth investing in is a project with a proven community, a real purpose and the resilience to withstand the current market conditions. Investing in a new small cap project can be very risky, traders and initial launch hype can bring a project soaring within hours of release before plummeting to its floor after aggressive trading takes place. The best way to invest is to do so with existing, undiscovered small cap projects with proven values, new content being created and utility being developed regardless of the market. GemCave Token is a perfect example of a project that pushes forward despite the market conditions, having been around for over 6 months now and with new development around every corner — GemCave Token has never been a better time to invest. Traders from the initial months have left and now a solid community that holds the floor with the game changing gemcave technology and its utilities that surround it.With the global uncertainties on several fronts at the moment with war, recession and inflation — Many major smart money is still out of crypto, once the money goes back in, the boat will be gone for lots of these small cap coins as they will have grown to their true potential. This is not financial advise, DYOR — For more information on GemCave token, simply google GemCave.",
