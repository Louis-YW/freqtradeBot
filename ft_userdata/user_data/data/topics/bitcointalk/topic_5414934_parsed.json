  "content": "Some background story...As the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology develop, investment opportunities grow. A16z expects web3 to reach 1 billion users by 2031, but the high barrier and risk in crypto will hinder growth. 41% of 18-24-year-olds in the US learn about investing from social media influencers, according to a 2021 Fidelity Funds survey. We think this percentage is higher in cryptocurrency. We want to create a social investment platform for the crypto market that connects investors from different backgrounds to collaborate and replicate each other's portfolios and trading activities.In the web3 world, users need to find like-minded people to discuss the crypto market or crypto projects, not just migrate their web2 social networks to web3. Web3's social needs must be native. Web3 users' identities are wallet addresses, but only assets are exchanged between wallets and dApps. Users with a unified crypto asset consensus need a platform to connect.Web3 lacks a social platform for crypto asset investment where users can discuss and learn from each other. Crypto novices fear the market's high risk and need a risk-neutral platform to invest. Replicate and learn from established crypto investors' trading strategies to get started. Crypto novices need a platform to learn from established crypto investors about web3 and trading crypto assets. We saw this problem and we have started this project, CryptoLink. CryptoLink is a web3 one-stop social investment platform. and we aims to make the crypto asset market accessible to everyone in a simple and transparent way. CryptoLink enables beginners to view, track and replicate the portfolios of established investors, facilitating information sharing between different investors and smoothing the learning curve for beginners, while also bringing additional commission and reputation to established investors.But come back to the question, what are the socialfi that web3 users deserved? I would love to hear your sharing!",
