It seems like many of us have lost significant amounts of money due to their questionable practices, lack of transparency, or outright negligence.\n\nI’m exploring the possibility of organizing a collective lawsuit against Wirex to hold them accountable and recover our funds. If you’ve been affected, I’d love to hear your story and see if we can work together to take legal action.\n\nHere’s what you can do:\n\n1. Comment below or DM me with your experience (e.g., how much you lost, what happened, and any evidence you have).\n2. Upvote/share this post to help it reach more people who might be in the same situation.\n3. Let’s discuss if a class-action lawsuit or group legal action is feasible.\n\nThe more people we have, the stronger our case will be. Let’s not let Wirex get away with this. Together, we can fight for justice and hopefully recover what’s rightfully ours.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you all. Let’s make this happen!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u89gpj8pahqe1.png?width=3512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab480cef6512c61431dcd7b6908de91d011eba62\n\n  \n",

I went one step further and instead of creating a random mapping from BIP39 to BIP39, I created a mapping from BIP39 to integer numbers. After encoding, the seed phrase does not look like a seed phrase anymore so it is just a bunch of random numbers that could mean anything. This provides enhanced security against a random human (a \"friend\", the plumber, etc) finding your stone-carved recovery words. \n\nIf you are interested in encoding your BIP39 words, in [this repo](https://codeberg.org/uqnvi828vwy/BIP39_encoding) you can find \n1. 999 encodings ready to be used,\n2. the source code to generate new encodings, different from those 999 pre-generated ones, and \n3. a more detailed explanation on the advantages and disadvantages of encoding.\n\nAs a proof that this indeed increases the security, I encoded a seed phrase: `22, 1856, 840, 600, 1298, 663, 696, 1588, 1520, 271, 1039, 371`. I will treansfer 10000 sats to the first one writing what the seed words are in a comment. You have my word that I will do it. I give you some help: The first word is `dignity`. I know 10000 sats is not much today, but it will be a lot in some years!",

It's about how Bitcoin was created and how it evolved over time.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was created, no one was interested in \"blockchain,\" no one was interested in \"hashrate,\" or which coin would \"moon\".\n\nBitcoin was adopted by people who genuinely liked the idea of a digital currency, not by people who were planning on getting rich the quickest way possible (at least not through Bitcoin). So, Bitcoin had a truly organic distribution and growth, making it truly decentralized.\n\nAfter the success of Bitcoin, those conditions are impossible to replicate. Because even if you copy and paste the code of Bitcoin or made an altcoin that worked better than Bitcoin in terms of superior technology, you would still have lots of investors trying to jump in before the project launches, or you would have people looking at it and trying to manipulate the market with pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nThat, on its own, leads to centralization, and that also interfere in the price action of the coin, and makes it's price action in most cases fully artificial. Only Bitcoin has an organic beginning and evolution over time in terms of adoption and price (yes we do have some whales trying to shake the market, but it is not even close on how violent it happens to altcoins). No other coin has that.\n\nAlso, the best part: No one knows for sure who Satoshi is, or if he is even alive. Not having a CEO prevents Bitcoin from suffering influence from its creator through public opinions, or from having its image compromised by some potential scandal its CEO could end up involved with.\n\nAnd that's what makes Bitcoin a totally different thing from the rest of the crypto market. Some people (including me) even consider all the altcoins just shitcoins, because they will never have the same characteristics as Bitcoin, nor its qualities and properties. They will always fail to replicate what Bitcoin has achieved because you will never be able to recreate the conditions that made Bitcoin possible to become what it is today.\n\nHope I made it clear.\n\nTL;DR: Stack till you're dead, Bitcoin is the best, Altcoins are all Shitcoins.\n",

I know there is something that I am thinking wrong here, but please help me assuage my fears. \n\n\n\nIn the age of mobile phones, one carries a lot of information on his phone, and the rest he likely has on his head. \n\n\n\nTherefore, if criminals want money from a rich Mr Lebowsky (or, by mistake, from another Mr Lebowsky, who could be me!) they could kidnap him, get his phone, use his finger or facial recognition to get in the phone, use the facial recognition to get into his brokerage account, and get the guy to transfer a lot of money to another location; from which, in just a few days, the money would be irretrievably gone. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Lebowsky spends his time in a basement, Breaking Bad style, and fears a lot for his fingers, his toes, or both. \n\n\n\nA similar scenario can be thought of at home. In case of home invasion, the phone is in the same place as the occupant, likely easy to locate. 2-step verification becomes very easy, and the criminals would immediately access the bank account, the brokerage account, and see what crypto apps are installed in the phone. This is a clue as to which wallets, and likely which cold wallets, Mr Lebowsky has. Logging in to Trezor would immediately show them that Mr Leboswky has at least 1 password protected wallet, and then all bets are off, or all fingers are at risk. You get the drift. \n\n\n\nNow the fact is: nothing of this actually seems to happen. My AI engine says that not one single case of the sort was ever reported in the UK. There are a lot of very rich Lebowskys in the UK, living on their own without security, etc. But I do not have a criminal mind, if I think of this stuff I am sure countless criminals have done this, too.\n\n \n\nWhat gives?  \n\n  \n\n\n  ",

There’s nothing wrong with it. I just prefer seed words. \n\nAqua Wallet is more expensive due to how it “swaps” in/out of layer 2.

It clearly indicates money printing in early terms and late money reaction in other countries overlapping.\n\n**Green chart - M2 Global Liquidity Index**\n\nThe amount of money being traded between market, banks and customers.\n\n**Orange chart - BTC/USD price**\n\nThe pattern:\n\n1. money printing shown by GLI Index by FED and banks\n\n2. reaction of BTC price. money invested into assets (btc, stocks, etfs) before the market of M2 reacts. Its been multiplied since ETFs\n\n3. reaction of M2 market liquidity, trading between countries, contracts, companies, customers\n\nThis pattern applies to all the years and to the last year. Its even brave to say, that a lot of printed money will go less in the M2 market liquidity, because it will be invested into BTC private wallets before and therefore it will be off the market. \n\n[2024 till now](https://preview.redd.it/tiswx5tpa9qe1.jpg?width=1799&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=799edcc58436c86408c950b669147875c69d400f)\n\nSource: [https://de.tradingview.com/chart/H8xmCgT6/](https://de.tradingview.com/chart/H8xmCgT6/)\n\nHappy to hear your discussions about that.

This means each BTC is about $23.8 million (500T/21M).\n\n1 BTC = ~$23.8 million.\n(That’s how much each coin would be worth if Bitcoin absorbed all global wealth.)\n\nSo if we work this out proportionally to the total global money supply, you get this:\n\nPercentile - Threshold - BTC Equivalent\n———————————————————————\nTop 0.01% - $25,000,000 - 1.05 BTC\nTop 0.1% - $5,100,000 - 0.214 BTC\nTop 1% - $1,200,000 - 0.05 BTC\nTop 10% - $100,000 - 0.0042 BTC\nTop 50% - $10,000 - 0.00042 BTC\nBottom 50% - $1,000 - 0.000042 BTC\n\nSo what does that mean?\n- To be in the global top 1%, you’d only need 0.05 BTC\n- To hit the top 0.1%, you’d need 0.21 BTC\n- The top 0.01%? Just 1.05 BTC\n\nMeanwhile, the bottom 50% of humanity would each hold just 0.000042 BTC. Barely a crumb.\n\nIt makes you realize just how unbelievably scarce Bitcoin is when you scale it against the sheer size of the world’s wealth. There are over 8 billion people on Earth… and only 21 million Bitcoin, and that’s before factoring in the 3 to 4 million coins lost forever.\n\nMost people are chasing 1 full BTC like it’s some kind of digital trophy, that’s really good, but they don’t fully grasp what it represents. When (not if) Bitcoin becomes the dominant global financial “store of value”, the Digital Gold of the modern age, 1 BTC doesn’t just make you “well off”…\n\nIt makes you part of a global elite.\n\nNot the 1%.\nThe 0.01%.\nMaybe even rarer.\n\nBitcoin is already well on its way there,some argue it’s inevitable. Major institutions, governments, the US government, billionaires, companies even - they’re already moving in. And when the world wakes up and tries to divide $500 trillion of global value across just 21 million units…\n\nThe game will already be over.\n\nSo the real flex won’t be Lambos and yachts.\nIt’ll be owning just one Bitcoin.\n\nAnd get this… even 0.1 BTC would be multi-millionaire territory.\n\nScarcity isn’t just hype, it’s math.\n\nSo the next time someone laughs at you for stacking sats at 100k… just remember: Even 50 millisats could make you a top dog.\n\nIn fact, $100k bitcoin is still *too* early\n\nStack sats like your future depends on it. Because it just might.\n",

Also, would it be safe to after an X amount of blocks it automatically delets part of it's history, so it only has a recent record of the chain situation? That could prevent a ton of small blocks making a huge amount of storage over time.\n\nI'm ignorant to the implications of this idea, but the way I see this is: You could make quick small transactions on it since blocks would be confirmed quickly, and you wouldn't need a full record of it like on the main chain of BTC, because your bigger stack is at the layer 1, so you don't have to worry about the record of a L2 Blockchain where some small amounts of sats are spent on a coffee.\n\nIs this even possible?

Is there enough for a system to be put in place where everyone must use this one accepted currency?\n\n3. With the missing coins, what stops a so called Bitcoin reset? Maybe a new Bitcoin, same idea and everything, but a fresh start. People are behind the ideology but now a fresh 21 million to make up for the lost currency?\n\n4. With Botcoin being decentralized, no government had power. I think this is disinterest governments because they lack control of it. However, you can avoid sanctions and such because of this, which could be a pro. Is being decentralized more of a pro or con do you think?\n\n5. Could Bitcoin become backed by gold and/or silver if a government declared so? Would this make the price explode to the heavens above?\n\n6. What do you think will make Satoshis wallet awaken? I thought maybe it's a reserve? Like if governments bought everything, he would release them to give a chance to the common man or something? What do you think the purpose of his fat stack is?\n\nHappy discussion! ",

We started talking over Old Fashioneds and ended up laughing like we’d known each other in another life. He leaned in to show me something on his phone, and for a moment I wasn’t sure what had me lightheaded—the Bitcoin chart on the screen or the way his cologne strangled me under the neon glow.\n\nWe talked for hours. Music got louder, lights got dimmer, and somewhere between our third or forth drink and his hand brushing mine, I stopped caring what time it was. He said something about fiat slavery and freedom money, but I was too busy watching his mouth move to fully track the topic.\n\nAll I’m trying to say in a longwinded breath is we’re still so early. Most people don’t even realize what Bitcoin is let alone crypto. \n\nWe closed the place down. I told him I don’t usually give out my number. He smiled, said “Neither do I,” and typed his in with a kind of confidence that stuck with me all night.\n\nWoke up still tasting the orange pill and wondering if I caught feelings—or if it’s just the bull market talking.\n\nKeep stacking! 🧡",

    "selftext": "Since people liked my reply, I decided to make it a post to reach even more people. Hope it helps someone out there looking at things from a different perspective.\n\nShould you diversify into something other than Bitcoin?\nThe quick answer is: There's no reason to \"Diversify\".\n\nDiversifying was invented in the Fiat system to compensate for government incompetence.\nThe idea was: Since money doesn't have any value anymore because of unlimited money printing, we need to desperately find a way to make some gains through investments, so let's use everything on the market to make more money. Oh and let's diversify our investments, that way, if a bank, a company at the stock market, or something similar shuts down because of the economy being a mess, we'll not lose our entire money.\n\nThe problem is: No investment in the world pays you more than the % amount of money governments around the world print every year (aka true inflation).\n\nThe only thing that beats it, is Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is not a investment, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, since it's not possible to print more Bitcoin like you can do with fiat. You don't need to invest it, just accumulate, it will preserve and increase its value over time.\n\nJust like you don't need to invest your gold into something you just need to buy more gold, it's the same principle with Bitcoin. Just buy more Bitcoin and wait.\n\nBefore the end of gold standard that served as a limit to money printing, investments were not so popular, people just worked and accumulated their money, because since the amount of dollars on a bill was equal to the same amount of gold in banks and government reserves, money had real value and was basically a Gold cupom that represented that value. So you could just accumulate money without investing, because you knew that your money would keep or even increase its value over time (which is not the case anymore).\n\nThe only diversifying you should do is your exposure to Bitcoin. You should have self custodial Bitcoin, ETF Bitcoin, Stocks that have their price directly linked to Bitcoin. Some banks offer you to buy custodial Bitcoin.\n\nWhy does this kind of diversification make sense? Because if you have all your Bitcoin in self custodial wallets, you could get your wallets stolen and lose all your money and you're basically dead. If the same happens in a custodial plataform you have someone to blame and pay the price for you.\n\nSo by having multiple ways of exposing yourself to BTC you can prevent losing all your BTC at once. That's the only way you should diversify, just like people back then doesn't had the need to use investments to keep their money value, you don't need to do that with Bitcoin. You're using gold without needing a paper cupom to represent it.",

You can’t sell outright without shaking market confidence.  \nBut you can do something smarter:  \n**open a mirrored short position using your BTC holdings as collateral.**\n\nWhat happens?  \n– You don’t sell any BTC  \n– You don’t need new liquidity  \n– **You reduce net leverage without triggering panic**  \n– If the market dips, **you profit from the short and buy more BTC at a discount**\n\nIn other words:  \n**You accumulate more Bitcoin by draining liquidity from overexposed or overleveraged players.**  \nTechnically, you’re still bullish. Publicly, nothing changes. Behind the scenes, you’ve just executed a perfect hedge fund move.\n\nHere’s where it gets spicy:  \n**In this setup, leverage stops being a risk—it becomes a weapon.**  \nIf you’re long in leverage, and open a mirrored short, you’re not betting on direction anymore.  \n**You’re betting on volatility.**\n\n– Price goes up? Your long gains.  \n– Price goes down? Your short covers you—or even earns more.\n\n**Leverage is no longer your weakness. It’s your control panel.**  \nThis is how hedge funds operate: **they use leverage to dominate, not to pray.**\n\nBitcoin doesn’t need blind loyalty.  \n**It needs vision. Strategy. Protection.**  \nAnd those who truly want to accumulate more BTC… know that some moves aren’t announced. They’re executed.",

Having 24 words is like having a 24 inch steel vault-door protecting your private key while the the vault walls are actually 12 inch thick.\n\nI see a lot of advantages with SLIP39 and using Samir's Secret Sharing Scheme in the future.

    "selftext": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/s/2TPBODXWQw\n\n\"So my grandpa died a week ago and my sis and I are helping my mom move his stuff into boxes and throw away some stuff, I came across his suitcase and there were many picture books and stuff and one of them has a bunch of codes that look like the wallet crypto codes when I Google them, how do I get into them? \n\nMy grandpa was never rich so I don't expect much, but I am curious, hoping to get an answer soon because my mom still haven't emptied out the trash bin outside, so if I have to look for something else that is needed to access these codes, now is the time, trash gets emptied 22 March \n\nUpdate 1:\nMy sister and I gathered the electronics. We also searched every book and suitcase for any other important looking things, all we found were family pictures. \n\nWe put everything in a box and it's in our closet for now, we haven't told our mom yet because we aren't sure if it has anything, besides she is the type to give the money away to help people and the rest of the family, even though they are mean to us because of the breakup, so if it has anything inside my sis and I will keep it a secret until we are older. \n\nRight now we have to go to school, we read all the comments, so thanks for the advice and suggestions, will be doing them when back home. \n\nBtw the electronics don't seem to work, not sure if I should throw them out\"\n\n\nAlright so I've updated twice on the original post but I'm not sure people are getting notified, so I'm making a separate post for the update 2. Also the posts were deleted because of Altcoins??\n\nUpdate 2:\nMy sis and I ended up using the usb on the pc and found a few pdf with words which we typed into a wallet\nWe also learned that the codes we initially found are private keys, but we have no idea how to log into them. \n\nWe logged into the words which has some money inside: 5.5382483886 Bitcoin. \n\nDue to the post being deleted due to a moderator saying something about altcoins, I won't be able to write down the other coins that were in the wallet, but from what I searched on Google, the total is 1mil euros ~\n\nWe still have to check the rest of the words, but this is what we found so far.\n\nAbout our mom, I saw a comment mentioning that we are stealing her inheritance, please keep in mind that we are trying to keep it a secret because she will give most of the money away, when she is the one that needs it the most, we aren't homeless, but most days we have to eat spaghetti and I know maybe it's not that bad, but compared to the meals she used to cook and the empty fridge, I am going to assume she's broke because our dad and mom are divorcing and he isn't giving money I think, but if I tell my mom she will just tell everyone and the family doesn't like her, I hear them arguing all the time and I know when money gets involved people will make problems and my mom will be too weak to say no , idk what to do but wait it out\n\n\n\n\nLast Update: \nFollowing the advice of nice people, I  will be deleting my comments and account. \n\nF*ck the government, they ain't touching my mom's money, I'll launder if I have to 👿\n\nGoodbye, ganna drink a glass of cold choco milk now",

That's because it basically supports our society at this point. But when it very first was invented, people had a hard time conceptualizing how it would help them personally.\n\nNow it's very apparent. It enhances our lives in many ways and will continue to.\n\nBitcoin is no different. The less you understand the many, many problems that Bitcoin fixes, the less you will see the \"value\" in what Bitcoin is doing, and will continue to do for decades to come.\n\nUnlike the internet though, once you understand why Bitcoin will thrive for decades to come, you can actually own it while it grows. Bitcoin's network is currently valued in the market at around $86k a coin.\n\nWe could make another 100 Bitcoin networks if we wanted to. All 100 would fail just like if you made another 100 internets right now.\n\nSo, the next time someone says \"Bitcoin has no value\", tell them that technically they used to be right. That assertion is no more than *denial* today, though, as far as the market is concerned.\n\nSome good reading that will help depict why the Bitcoin network will be worth many many trillions of dollars in the future if it stays decentralized and secure:\n\nPrice of Tomorrow\n\nPrinciples of Economics\n\nBroken Money\n\nThe Creature on Jekyll Island\n\nMastering Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Standard\n\nThe Big Print (new one and GREAT read)\n\nMoney You Can't Fuck With",

I thought entering Bitcoin in 2024 meant I was too late.\n\nBut I’ve come to realize that I’m not—and neither are you. Over the past few months, I’ve tried (unsuccessfully) to convince close friends and family about Bitcoin’s significance. What really surprised me, though, is that even highly tech-savvy people don’t get it. I have friends who are engineers at major U.S. tech companies; CEOs of AI startups , high-level directors in FinTech in the Middle East, and even professors studying the history of science and technology in major US universities. Yet, almost none of them truly understand Bitcoin. To them, it’s just another cryptocurrency, and they don’t see the massive historical shift happening right now.\n\nSo, if you ever feel like you’re late—don’t. We’re still early.

Some quit after a few losses, some blow their accounts chasing unrealistic gains, and others just get stuck in an endless cycle of strategy-hopping.\n\nIf you’ve been trading for a while but still feel **stuck, frustrated, or inconsistent**, here’s why:\n\n# 1. You’re Searching for the “Perfect” Strategy (It Doesn’t Exist)\n\nBe honest—how many times have you switched strategies after a few losing trades? Most traders keep looking for a holy grail setup, when in reality, **even the best strategies have losses.** The difference between a profitable trader and a losing one isn’t the strategy—it’s the **discipline to stick with it long enough to let probability play out.**\n\n# 2. You’re Risking Too Much and Panicking\n\nA single trade should never make or break your account. But too many traders go all-in, hoping for a big win, only to freeze when the market moves against them. **Proper risk management is the difference between surviving and blowing up.**\n\n# 3. You’re Letting Emotions Control Your Trades\n\nEver revenge-traded after a loss? Closed early because you were scared? Moved a stop loss hoping the trade would turn? **That’s emotional trading, and it’s killing your account.** The market doesn’t care about your feelings—it rewards those who execute with precision.\n\n# So, How Do You Fix It?\n\n✅ Stick to one strategy and **master it** instead of jumping around.  \n✅ Risk small per trade—**think long-term, not trade-by-trade.**  \n✅ Remove emotions by following a structured, rule-based approach.\n\nMost traders don’t fail because they lack skill. They fail because they **never fix these bad habits.**\n\nWhat’s been the hardest lesson for you in trading? Let’s talk 👇",

    "is_self": true,
    "selftext": "Bitcoin won't win everyone over. But it will win.\n\nToday, the dollar is the currency of international trade. Even if you're Spain and trading with Saudi Arabia, you're using dollars. In the past, gold was the currency of international trade: the dollar co-opted gold's goodwill by being backed by gold, but pulling the rug on everyone in 1971.\n\nInternational trade converges on one main currency because it's more efficient to use whatever the most people are using, and so naturally, one currency snowballs into the predominant one.\n\nAt some point, the dollar will cease to be the currency of international trade. I don't know when, and I don't know why, but history shows that it will happen. I think that a US debt crisis leading to massive devaluation is a possibility which may facilitate that, but I don't know for sure.\n\nAll I know is that when it does happen, a vacuum will form.\n\nEurope will try to convince everyone else that the euro ought to be the new currency of international trade. And everyone else will say \"No, why should everyone trust you? You have constant debt crises in your member states, your GDP is stagnant, and you will likely extract seigniorage from us to fund your ever-increasing social programs.\"\n\nRussia will try to convince everyone else that the ruble ought to be the new currency of international trade. And everyone else will say \"No, why should everyone trust you? You are invading your neighbors, you are actively printing more rubles to fund your wars, and your economy is tiny.\"\n\nChina will try to convince everyone else that the yuan ought to be the new currency. And everyone will say \"No China, you're a communist dictatorship with crushing capital controls and a digital currency that you can restrict and program at will.\"\n\nAnd so on, with other countries all trying to get everyone else to use their currency in international trade, but a consensus on any one national currency will be impossible. This is because none of the nations can put forward a *neutral* currency. There's baggage that comes along with bestowing any one country this privilege: the entire world is saddled with the results of their monetary policy, which can change on a whim, and for political reasons. You can bet that they will act in self-interest.\n\nIn the chaos, Bitcoin will emerge as a \"temporary\" workaround. Alright, fine, you won't use our ruble and we won't use your yen, but we need to trade, so let's just temporarily use Bitcoin. After all, it's already internationally valuable, it's quick to send, settlement is final, the liquidity is deeper than any other neutral digital asset...\n\nSome countries are already settling some trades in Bitcoin today (Russia and China.)\n\nBitcoin isn't going to win because everybody will decide to use Bitcoin at the same time. No, Bitcoin will win by process of elimination. It will be the last man standing: the only currency that is credibly neutral. It will be used because getting consensus on any other currency is even more difficult. It will be used begrudgingly even by the haters, because even the haters cannot force all other nations to accept their money in international trade.\n\nThen, it will be used more and more. And more. Soon it will become entrenched. After some time, it will be clear that it is not temporary, and it will emerge as the dominant currency for international trade. Soon after that, it will emerge as the dominant currency for domestic trade, in every country, following a similar path to victory.\n\nBefore we know it, everyone will be on a Bitcoin standard. We'll look back scratching our heads wondering how it unfolded so quickly. Once the process begins, it could be over within a geopolitical blink-of-an-eye (a few years.)",

I prefer Bitcoin over stocks because unlike MSTR (I have nothing against MSTR or any other stocks, by all means get those fiat gains) I can’t have a friend send me some MSTR through Cash app to Strike so I can give him a ride home. The Bitcoin rabbit hole is very deep and it is bright orange along with dark and scary.\nSometimes I think people forget why Bitcoin was created, when it was created, and the message that was left on the Genesis block. I don’t want their money. I want our money. 🧡",

Plus I’m not big on the whole QR method, I think it’s overhyped and has it’s negatives.\n\nThat being said I’ve landed on BitBox and Trezor. I obviously need a third and the only other decent one I saw was a Jade. That was until I saw the whole “no secure element” and relying on a “blind oracle sever”.\n\nWhat are your guys opinions on this? Is it not risky relying on this server to ultimately help sign transactions? Isn’t there a risk relying on an outside entity? \n\nAre you like me also sceptical/concerned? Or are my worries misplaced? If so why is the no secure element/blind oracle feature so great?\n\nAppreciate the help in advance. ",

    "selftext": "# Technical Explanation of Bitcoin Mining and Network Difficulty\n\n# 💡 1. Overview of Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which new blocks are added to the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners use computational power to solve a **cryptographic puzzle** by finding a valid hash for the next block.\n\nKey steps in the mining process:\n\n1. **Assembling a Block:** Miners gather **pending transactions** from the mempool and create a candidate block.\n2. **Hashing the Block:** Miners repeatedly hash the block header with different **nonce values**.\n3. **Checking the Hash:** They compare the hash against the **current network difficulty target**.\n   * If the hash is **smaller** than the target, the block is successfully mined.\n   * If not, they try again with a new nonce or modify other parameters.\n4. **Broadcasting the Block:** The winning miner broadcasts the valid block to the network, and the block is added to the blockchain.\n\n# 🔢 2. Block Hash and Difficulty Target\n\nEach block header includes:\n\n* **Previous Block Hash:** A 256-bit hash of the preceding block.\n* **Merkle Root:** A hash of all the transactions in the block.\n* **Timestamp:** When the block was created.\n* **Nonce:** A 32-bit arbitrary number that miners increment during mining.\n* **Difficulty Target:** A 256-bit value that defines how small the block hash must be to be considered valid.\n\n✅ **Mining goal:**  \nTo successfully mine a block, the miner must find a hash that is **numerically smaller** than the current **difficulty target**.\n\n**Mathematically:**\n\nHash(block) ≤ Target\n\n# ⚙️ 3. The Network Difficulty Adjustment\n\nThe **difficulty target** dynamically adjusts every **2,016 blocks** (roughly every **2 weeks**), ensuring that new blocks are mined approximately **every 10 minutes**.\n\n* If blocks are being mined **faster** than 10 minutes on average → difficulty **increases**.\n* If blocks are mined **slower** → difficulty **decreases**.\n\n✅ **Difficulty formula:**\n\nNew Difficulty=Old Difficulty× (Actual Time / Expected Time)​\n\n* **Actual Time**: Time taken to mine the last 2,016 blocks.\n* **Expected Time**: 2 weeks (2,016 blocks × 10 minutes).\n\n# 🔨 4. How Small Must the Hash Be?\n\nBitcoin uses the **SHA-256** hashing algorithm, which generates a **256-bit hash**. The miner’s goal is to find a hash smaller than the difficulty target.\n\n✅ **Difficulty Target Representation:**  \nThe target is a **256-bit number** stored in **Compact Form** in the block header:\n\n* It consists of a **3-byte coefficient** and a **1-byte exponent**.\n* The target formula:\n\nTarget=coefficient×2 \\^ (8×(exponent−3))\n\n✅ **Example of difficulty representation:**  \nIf the difficulty target is:\n\n0x0000000000000000000abcdef1234567890000000000000000000000000000000\n\nAny hash with a **higher value** than this target is invalid.  \nMiners must generate hashes **smaller than this value** to successfully mine the block.\n\n# 🔑 5. Hashing Process and Nonce Iteration\n\nMiners construct the block header and repeatedly hash it while varying the **nonce** and other parameters.\n\n**Hashing process:**\n\n1. Miner sets the nonce to **0** and hashes the block header.\n2. If the resulting hash is **greater** than the difficulty target:\n   * Increment the nonce.\n   * Hash the block header again.\n3. Repeat until:\n   * A valid hash is found (smaller than the target).\n   * If the nonce overflows (2³² possibilities), modify the **extraNonce** in the coinbase transaction or change the timestamp slightly to continue.\n\n# ⚡ 6. Why 10 Minutes?\n\nThe 10-minute block time is achieved by adjusting the **difficulty**:\n\n* When miners generate hashes faster → difficulty increases.\n* When they mine slowly → difficulty decreases.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol ensures that, on average, it takes **10 minutes** to find a block by fine-tuning the difficulty every **2,016 blocks**.\n\n# 📊 7. Network Difficulty and Hash Rate\n\n* **Difficulty** is directly related to the network's **total hash rate**.\n* As more miners join the network → hash rate increases → difficulty increases.\n* If miners leave → hash rate drops → difficulty decreases.\n\n✅ **Current difficulty formula:**\n\nDifficulty=Maximum Target / Current Target​\n\nWhere:\n\n* **Maximum Target**: The highest possible target, defined as:\n\n0x00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\n* **Current Target**: The current network difficulty target.\n\n# 🔍 8. Probability of Mining a Block\n\nThe mining process is probabilistic:\n\n* The lower the **difficulty target**, the less probable it is to find a valid hash.\n* With increasing hash power, the chance of finding a valid hash within **10 minutes** increases.\n\n✅ **Probability formula:**\n\nProbability=Target / 2\\^ 256\n\nFor example:\n\n* If the target is:\n\n0x0000000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\n* The probability of finding a valid hash is:\n\n0x0000000000000000000F / 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\n# 🛠️ 9. Conclusion\n\n* **Mining goal:** Find a valid hash smaller than the **difficulty target**.\n* **Difficulty adjusts** every **2,016 blocks** (\\~2 weeks) to maintain a **10-minute block time**.\n* Miners continuously hash the block header, modifying the **nonce** and other parameters until a valid hash is found.\n* **Higher difficulty** makes finding valid hashes harder, requiring more computational power.\n\n✅ This dynamic difficulty adjustment ensures that the Bitcoin network maintains a **consistent block time** despite changes in global mining power.",

    "selftext": "TLDR:  never gave a f-ck about finances, got fired 2 years ago, was broke for the first time of my life, got a job again in early 2024, friend orange-pilled me, started doing my research, \"wait.. fiat is actually horsecr*p?\" phase, started to dca as late as 2024 (yet still at a profit lmao), now orange-pilled asf and trying to convince the intelligent people around me that fiat means theft by money-printing, loving life knowing I'll hodl even through the worst possible dip.\n\nLong story: I (now 30) never took care of my personal finances before. Had a decent job for 7 years after college. No gf, no children, no mouths to feed, just me enjoying my salary to party, travel and buy the clothes I loved. No money aside. I had heard of Bitcoin but hadn't done my own research at all, just listened to the mainstream opinion around me (\"Bitcoin is a videogame money ponzi fraud!!!\") and didn't question it.\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2023, got fired abruptly (and for no valid reason), and for the first time in my life I realized that money was an issue. No money aside, no investments, no capital of any sort whatsoever, no one to help me. And I was starting to realize this inflation was unsustainable for my lifestyle.\n\nFortunately enough I found a job in early 2024 and committed to finally keeping a share of my income to invest. I coincidentally created an account on Reddit not long after and found out all about personal finances on multiple great subs. Then, I happened to talk finances with a friend of mine in the summer who told me \"You don't invest in BTC? You should look into it dude\".\n\nSooo... I did. I started with this sub and found out all about what money really is, what the problem of Fiat is and how it affects my day-to-day life (and robs me of my hard-earned work), what BTC offers, how it works, why it is so valuable and why there is no second best. And then I was eager to know more so I started reading about BTC EVERYWHERE (Social media, Youtube channels etc..)\n\nIt was like a revelation to me. Everything was adding up, and as I continued researching I started my DCA around July 2024 with small monthly sums. I purchased my cold wallet in december of 2024. I don't own much but even by getting in so late I'm at an overall ~20% profit (but that doesn't mean sh-t to me because BTC is valuable way beyond a shitty Fiat price lens).\n\nAnd now I'm reasearching about BTC and reading news about adoption SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. And I'll hold on to my (small) stack through thick and thin and a massive bear market could be on the way that I'd be happy because it'll mean \"cheaper sats\" to me.\n\nThat's my BTC story, what's yours?",

All that to say, I’m pretty disappointed with a lot of these.\n\nDon’t get me wrong they are definitely sleeker and easier to use, the bitkey especially is sexy af. However between the blind sign of Tangem with the card or ring (which straight up doesn’t work on the new iPhones cause the NFC times out before the ring can even connect so that’s straight to the trash for me personally) that you don’t actually know the seed words to or bitkeys server based 2/3. Why can’t I just use these devices as signers for my own setup? Why am I forced to use their wallet and/or 3rd key? And why do have to expose my entire stack to recovery risk with bitkey? Defeats the entire purpose of multisig if someone can recover my wallet with one key. So someone could kidnap me, steal my shit and then make the request and then let me go after day 7 of the recovery hold period are over like wtf? What’s was the point?\n\nMaybe I’m missing something here but while these devices are sleek they feel like a downgrade in terms of what they’re actually supposed to do which is secure my wealth. Idk maybe I’m just an idiot or I’m over thinking it. I guess I just feel like a lot of these new wallets are shined gimmick spend wallets but I’d never actually trust them with my families wealth. A lot of these would only really work with strong legal precedent against companies that manage keys for people. It’s gotta be something almost like a Swiss bank to actually be useful (and right back where we started). Where I have to show up in person and prove I am how I am otherwise it’s all just security for show.",

The Rolex Index is staying stable, meaning there’s no frenzy yet.

Bitcoin uses the internet as a superhighway to transfer value between differnet bitcoin users, what if the internet is compromised by a major global network \"glitch\" and we all have bitcoins but are unable to access them or transfer them between each other since we all can bot access the internet. Some people talked about having their own internet networks, like in Angela Merkel's 2013 speech, where in the wake of major security breaches and spying on German companies by foreign agencies, she spoke of the time for Europe to have its own internet, an internet 2.0 if you wish. Would bitcoin be transferable to that archetechture, or would some one have to code a new botcoin 2.0 for the new network. I hope I make enough sense about this idea to illicit a resonable response.

    "selftext": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** is often portrayed as a sophisticated economic tool, but when you break it down, it's really just legalized counterfeiting. Both involve creating money out of thin air and injecting it into the economy. The only real difference? One is **illegal**, and the other is **sanctioned** by central banks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o8kan19npnpe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5586982eb7063d9ea1b11f3768d995afd6d45c\n\nA counterfeiter prints fake money and spends it, diluting the value of real money. **QE does the same thing**—central banks create new digital money and use it to buy assets like government bonds. This artificially inflates the money supply without increasing goods or services, which inevitably pushes up prices and reduces the purchasing power of existing money.\n\n**Just like counterfeiters** benefit by spending fake money before inflation catches up, the biggest winners of QE are banks and corporations. They get first access to newly created money, allowing them to invest in stocks and real estate before prices rise. Meanwhile, **ordinary people are left dealing with higher costs and stagnant wages.**\n\nOn top of that, **QE distorts the economy** by fueling market bubbles. Stocks, housing, and other assets skyrocket in price, not because of real economic growth, but **because of artificially cheap money.** Eventually, the bubble bursts, leaving regular people to deal with the fallout.\n\n**The only real difference between QE and counterfeiting is that one is legal. But legality doesn’t change reality—whether it's a criminal printing fake bills or a central bank injecting trillions into the economy, the result is the same: devalued money, rising prices, and an economy built on illusion.**",

So we never sold anything. It's not easy to get customers from organic search without pouring a lot of time into marketing and SEO and we don't have time to do that. We mainly wanted to prove a point that it's easy and free to sell something for bitcoin online. All we paid was the domain which was like a couple dollars (even that you could get free from Google or Github). Free hosting, free wordpress, free woocommerce plugin, free dropshipping (printful) and free payment plugin (paywithflash). Well it's not free there is a fee but no upfront payment needed and no need to enter a credit card. Over time we added more products whenever there was a cool idea. And today, we finally sold a first item.

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI decided to post this here as I think this is too technical for \"Bitcoin Beginners\", happy to move or repost if requested. \n\nI am now in the process of setting up my cold wallet, just for the fun of it and because I want to learn this \"sovereignty\" part of my BTC. For now I have set up various accounts with Coinbase/Coinbase Wallet, Muun and Kraken Pro, putting some money on each just to see how it works.\n\nAll the coins were originally bought on Coinbase Exchange, so I bought on Coinbase; from there I transferred a part to Muun, and from there I will move some to Kraken. I have also moved some money to Electrum but I did not terribly like the experience/interface.\n\nI have already received my Trezor 5 plus and Xseed steel plates, and I will make the setup during the weekend.\n\nNow: I understand zippo of technology, but I have seen videos on Youtube (Bitcoin University, excellent site) which, if I understand it correctly, state that Coinbase will be able and willing to \"chase\" the money I have bought on Coinbase Exchange, hoping to get as much information on me as possible. So they (again, if I understood this correctly!) will be able to \"track\" my purchase from Coinbase to Muun and from Muun to what they will understand is my cold wallet.\n\nIt is also my understanding that is not a strictly KYC/legal requirement stuff, it is \\*Coinbase snooping on me\\*. Of course I understand if the police suspects me of a crime they will be able to subpoena the data from Coinbase or track me on their own. But what Matthew Kratter says is that Coinbase goes the extra mile.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Is this true? Did I understand it correctly? Will Coinbase be able to trace the crypto all the way to their final destination?\n2. If this is true, is there any difference with Kraken Pro, that is: will I avoid the problem if I buy straight on Kraken Pro and transfer on my cold wallet from there?\n\nAgain the issue here is not what is legally allowed to the police. Is what these companies themselves are willing to do.\n\nMany thanks in advance.",

In 2021, the total cryptocurrency market cap peaked at $3 trillion. This cycle, we've already reached a high of $3.71 trillion. Does it make sense for this to be the top when the U.S. prints $3-4 trillion every year?\n\nLiquidity is one of the main drivers of market growth, and with continuous money printing, the value of assets like crypto naturally appreciates. Compared to previous cycles, adoption is higher, institutional interest is growing, and macroeconomic conditions still favor risk-on assets.\n\nThe U.S. is still injecting trillions into the system every year. Even though the Fed isn’t officially doing QE, deficit spending + Treasury buybacks + repo operations all add up to more liquidity in the markets. Historically, more liquidity = more demand for risk assets like crypto, stocks, and tech equities.\n\nInflation remains sticky, which means cash is losing value. Investors seek hard assets (crypto, gold, real estate, stocks, etc.) to hedge against devaluation.\n\nThe Fed may start cutting rates this year. Lower interest rates typically push capital into higher-yielding risk assets (crypto, growth stocks, etc.).\n\nThe S&P 500 & Nasdaq are still in a strong uptrend. Historically, crypto follows equities in bullish environments. If markets remain risk-on, crypto should benefit from the same momentum.\n\nWhile short-term corrections are normal, the overall trend remains bullish. If history repeats itself, the market is likely to continue its upward trajectory, setting new all-time highs beyond what we’ve seen so far.",

Here’s the outline of my strategy:\n\n1. **Move Crypto to Trezor**: Transfer my bitcoin from Coinbase to a Trezor hardware wallet for added security.\n2. **Convert Fiat to USDC**: Move money from my bank to Coinbase, convert it to USDC, and then transfer the USDC to my Trezor.\n3. **Get a** [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) **Card**: Apply for a [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card to use for daily spending.\n4. **Load the Card with USDC**: Pre-load the [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card with USDC from my Trezor (in set increments) for daily expenses.\n5. **Spend USDC**: Use the card for purchases, where USDC is converted to USD at the point of sale. Since USDC is pegged to the USD, I avoid volatility risks as much as possible.\n6. **Earn Cashback**: Take advantage of the [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card’s cashback rewards, which I see as a way to earn a small return on my money, similar to what I might get from a traditional bank (though admittedly not as much).\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n* I plan to keep around $5-10K in my traditional bank for emergencies and liquidity.\n* I’ll still have credit cards but plan to use them only in case of emergencies.\n\n**My Goals:**\n\n* Increase control and ownership over my assets.\n* Reduce reliance on banks and credit card companies.\n* Earn cashback rewards to offset the opportunity cost of not earning interest in a traditional bank.\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. Is this plan realistic and safe? Are there any risks I’m overlooking?\n2. Are there better alternatives to achieve similar goals?\n3. Has anyone else tried this approach? If so, what has your experience been?\n4. What tax implications I should be aware of when converting fiat to USDC and spending it via the [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card?\n5. Any tips for minimizing fees or optimizing this strategy?\n\nThanks in advance for your insights!",

I’ve decided to go with Independent Reserve as I am from Australia. \nHowever, their withdrawal fee is 0.0002 BTC which is currently about 26$. I can’t find any better options than this which to me is a problem as I don’t want to keep more than $1000 in the exchange but if I withdraw it to my cold wallet they are taking 2.6% every time. I feel like this is a lot. \nSo my questions are:\n1. Is it okay to leave $5000+ on an exchange (in particular independent reserve) in order to lower the withdrawal fee?\n2. Is 0.0002 BTC an okay withdrawal fee (I haven’t seen anything better in Australia and even if there is better ones like maybe Strike then I get fucked with conversions from AUD to USD)\n",

Just a reinvention of gold with an amazing, short monetization period where the early participants made a fortune.\n\nThe difference is gold doesn't unravel if no one uses it as a MoE, it has been a decent store of value for basically ever thanks to the laws of physics maintaining themselves without us needing to do anything.\n\nBitcoin doesn't magically remain scarce. It remains scarce as a by product of it being a payment technology.\n\nYou cannot have one without the other. The permissionless-payments-only big blockers finally gave up and forked away 8 years ago.\n\nThey were more misguided than the people who only understand Bitcoin as savings today, but their blindness will result in the same thing - the softening of what we've gotten used to being the hardest money know to man.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been thinking a lot about Bitcoin’s future and I keep running into this concept of the \"death spiral\" after the last Bitcoin is mined in 2140. I know there are a lot of people who are super optimistic about Bitcoin, but I wanted to ask the community – could this \"death spiral\" actually become a real problem for Bitcoin?\n\nHere’s my thinking:\n\nBitcoin mining is currently incentivized by two things: block rewards (which decrease over time due to halvings) and transaction fees. But what happens when the last Bitcoin is mined? With block rewards being non-existent, the system will be relying solely on transaction fees to pay miners. That’s fine for now while Bitcoin’s price is high, but what if the price stagnates or even falls?\n\nIf transaction fees become too high, it could discourage regular users from making transactions, which would reduce the overall usage and value of Bitcoin. Miners may then find it less profitable to continue mining, and we could see fewer miners in the network. This could lead to a death spiral where the network becomes less secure and the value drops, causing even more miners to leave, and so on.\n\nIt’s also worth considering that Bitcoin’s energy consumption and mining difficulty are going to keep increasing, which makes it harder for new or smaller miners to stay in the game. As we get closer to the end, won’t only a few big miners be left? Could that lead to further centralization and make Bitcoin more vulnerable?\n\nI get that the idea of Bitcoin failing seems far-fetched to a lot of people, especially when you’re hearing from maxis all the time about how Bitcoin is \"digital gold\" and its scarcity will drive value. But isn’t it possible that the system might break down if things don’t play out as expected, especially as we near 2140? Could the current design be a flaw waiting to happen?\n\nJust wanted to get some thoughts from the community. Are we really overlooking a potential issue here with Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability, or am I just being too skeptical?",

Why should we expect bitcoin to beat the stock market?\n\nWanted to make an edit because I’m getting downvoted. I do think bitcoin is a great asset as it’s scarce and provides a store of value against inflationary currencies with transactional value as well. The thought experiment is comparing the returns of bitcoin against other financial assets long-term.\n\nFor example when I buy a share of Amazon I am buying a share of the future cash flows in the company. Sure those future cash flows are denominated in USD now but they are currently yielding 3% with double digit earnings growth YoY and have historically far exceeded inflation. Additionally, maybe someday those future cash flows will be denominated in bitcoin growing at a rapid rate. ",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin and gold are similar in that they have value because people agree they do. However, gold also surves a structural purpose in that people can park wealth in gold when other asset types are in a downturn, say, like in the 2008 crash. So gold serves as a safe haven with the promise of being able to change it back to other assets in the future.\n\nBitcoins could serve the same function, but instead Bitcoins seem to track stock prices rather than be a safe haven in a market crash.\n\nIs Bitcoins always going to be a rally asset, or will it change to behave more like gold in the future?\n\n**Why I care**: If a structural benefit of Bitcoins can be determined, you can begin to speculate on what its proper total market cap should be. Right now gold is about 3% of the total, while Bitcoin is about 0.4%. But if Bitcoin becomes an essential structural asset, you might predict that its relative market cap should increase before it stabilizes.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoins remain a rally yolo asset, it is hard to see its structural value. That's why I am interested in whether it might gravitate towards being a safe haven or diversifying asset instead.",

Start the bot with 50 and tell it to buy an adition 10 4times whenever it drops by another 5%. Let it run for max 2 days.\nIf it buys all the possible 4 dips i lowered my average price.\nIt it did not dip i invested just the initial 50.\nTell the bot not to take any provits as i want a long term investment.\n\nThis should optimize a classic dca approach.

People NEED to be spending money for the economy to even function, let alone thrive. \n\nSo how will the world work if most people holding Bitcoin never want to actually spend it? Bitcoin is a store of value after all. \n\nWhat’s your thoughts on this and is it really going to be a problem or am I worrying about nothing here? ",

People were bound to get burned chasing easy riches.\n\nI was already annoyed in 2017 when the shitcoin wave took off. Not just because of what it meant for Bitcoin in the short term, distracting from its actual purpose, but because I knew millions of people were about to financially ruin themselves gambling on hype. The worst part is that many believed Bitcoin at one thousand dollars was too expensive and chose random scams instead.\n\nAnd here we are, years later, with endless posts of people losing everything on meme coins and garbage projects that were always doomed to fail. I hate seeing it happen. If only people did not fall for these scams, everyone would win in the long run.\n\nThankfully, the trend is slowly shifting. Bitcoin dominance hit its lowest in 2017 and has not dropped that low since. The shitcoin casino is still open, but the house of cards is gradually collapsing.\n\nStill, it is painful to watch this cycle repeat.",

    "selftext": "There is a book called the 4th turning published in 1997. \n\nIt discusses first, second, third and fourth turnings in American history. \n\nThe Crisis (Fourth Turning) is a period of upheaval, where institutions collapse, and society undergoes major transformation, often triggered by wars, economic collapse, or revolutions. This is where the authors argue America is now (starting in 2008 with the financial crisis). It’s a time of struggle that eventually leads to the rebuilding of institutions and a new High.\n\nWhere Are We Now?\n\nIf the theory holds, we are currently in the middle of the Fourth Turning, which is expected to last until the early 2030s. According to Strauss and Howe, this phase typically brings major conflicts (economic, political, or military), followed by the emergence of a new social order.\n\nThe book is often cited in discussions about current events, including economic instability, political division, and global tensions, suggesting that we are in the midst of a defining moment in American history.\n\nIn past Fourth Turnings, financial systems have been restructured like the gold standard changes in the 1930s and 1970s. Bitcoin could be a part of the next monetary reset.\n\nBitcoins role\n\nBitcoin aligns with the historical patterns of the Fourth Turning challenging the old system, thriving during economic chaos, and potentially becoming part of the new order. Whether it emerges as the “\nnew gold or something bigger depends on how this Turning plays out.\n\nDo you see Bitcoin as a hedge for personal wealth during this crisis, or as something even bigger—like a foundation for a new financial system?",

Unsurprisingly, the Coinbase Wallet now says that I have CBCBT.\n\nI imagine that this is to do with custody: Coinbase does not physically move the satoshis in the passage between Coinbase Exchange and Coinbase Wallet, so they need to legally account for this.\n\nHowever, I wonder what will happen next week, when I setup my Coldcard Q and want to transfer the money from Coinbase Wallet to the Coldcard wallet. Surely, I will not be allowed to transfer tokens?\n\nWill Coinbase automatically credit the proper BTC to my Coldcard Q account and cancel the tokens, or will I have to re-transfer the money to Coinbase Exchange before allowing the money to exit the Coinbase ecosystem? If the latter is the case, I would say this makes the Coinbase Wallet pretty useless at least for me, and I struggle to see a use case?\n\nThanks to all in advance",

How should I store the 24-word seed phrase? Should I write it on a piece of paper and split it into multiple parts stored in different locations? Or should I store it in multiple cloud services?\n4. I use Bitstack to buy BTC, which I find convenient as a beginner. Would there be a better and easier solution?\n5. Do you use Trezor or Ledger Suite to buy BTC, or do you use an exchange and then transfer it to your wallet (e.g., small amounts like €XX)? With Bitstack, it seems like there are no fees to transfer to a wallet.\n\nMany Thanks",

Ex: say you first bought BTC back when it was 20k and then DCA'd all the way until now. It's now hovering at 80k, and you make a small sale worth $200. Well then instead of being a tiny gain/loss, if you use fifo, that means the sale uses a cost basis of 20k... meaning that after maths, that translates into a capital *gain* close to the *full* $200!! Now repeat for every small sale and well...damn.\n\nHowever, if we're now doing wallet based accounting, once you move the money to a new wallet, the cost basis resets so if you had done the same from a new wallet, the gain/loss on that sale would have been small.\n\nSo... what this tells me is that if you plan on doing something like options trading (where you frequently buy/sell) or use a DEX to fund other wallets, then do it from a wallet that has a very small (or zero) crypto balance.\n\nSo... wallet based cost basis may actually be a good thing, since with FIFO, the original cost basis doesn't follow you around. \n\nUnless i'm misunderstanding how this wallet based cost basis works.\n\n",

Bitcoin crashed down to as low as the 3,000's (USD), prices of goods soared such as eggs and toilet paper, supply and demand was absolutely wild in those times. Housing prices have essentially doubled since then.\n\nHow do you expect bitcoin to keep up with that long-term? Eggs are $8 a dozen now. My house that I bought in 2019 for $160k is now worth over $300. But the sad thing about bitcoin is that every 4 years, it is destined to crash back down again. It crashed from 19k in 2017, it crashed from 69k in 2021, and 2025 is the fourth year of the so-called \"cycle\" so guess what it's going to do again this year?\n\nHow many more cycles until it crashes from 7 figures? Are any of you even paying attention? And what about the suckers who bought bitcoin BEFORE it crashed? Those greater fools stuck holding the bag from weeks before COVID hit probably bought in around $10k, maybe even higher than that, if we're being honest. How do you expect bitcoin to hedge against inflation when it's only between 700% to 2,000% higher than it was 5 years ago either right before or right after the market was pulverized by COVID?\n\nInflation is supposed to be around 2% PER YEAR! That compounds over the years, you know. So just you wait and see. You'll find out the hard way that in just TEN YEARS that 2% inflation will amount to nearly 22% inflation. Try looking me in the eyes with a straight face a decade from now and tell me that bitcoin won't crash from the high 6, or even 7 figures. We'll see how smug you all are then, eh? Good riddance.",

It could be utilized to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) through executive action, without the need for congressional approval\n\n- ⁠Seizing (stealing) more bitcoin including those holdings from people trying to use it to evade taxes\n\n- ⁠Accepting government payments/fines/taxes in Bitcoin\n\n- “Printing” money to buy Bitcoin would presumably not cost the tax payer (well directly anyway!) \n\n- ⁠Mining bitcoin with excess unutilised energy sources like Bhutan have been doing\n\n- ⁠Selling other confiscated assets from crime (crypto and non crypto) for bitcoin\n\n- ⁠Revaluing or swapping the existing gold stockpile for some digital gold\n\n\nI’m sure there might be other ways for them to get more BTC without directly buying with tax payers funds… the fact they have actively pledged to do this and seem to have the personnel in charge who are motivated and from a crypto perspective pretty competent, qualified and experienced to do so is really bullish for the longer term bigger macro picture. \n\nWhat other methods could they use for tax payer neutral bitcoin acquisition ….",

I’ve been in crypto since last bull run and have been aware of auto buys but it just never really occurred to me to do it myself. I guess I just thought I wouldn’t auto buy enough for it to make a difference. But I figure now that something is better than nothing. I plan to continue to let it buy for the foreseeable future (next couple years). Only thing that bothers me is that CB charges a dollar every purchase so my $8 turns into $7 and I pay Coinbase $365 per year to do this. CB advertises Coinbase One and says I can avoid fees by signing up, however, it’s $30/month which is the same as I’m paying anyway without the subscription. I guess I’m just trying to find a better way to purchase daily. I like using CB because it takes it directly from my bank and I don’t have to fund the account. I want to make it as easy and mindless for myself as possible, which is also why I’m doing small daily buys rather than larger weekly or monthly buys. I won’t miss the $8 everyday but it will bother me to see $56/week or $240/month to come out. I’m also curious what your guys’ thoughts are on such small purchases, is it even worth it? I mean, at this rate it would take me decades to reach a whole coin, granted the price never went up. I’m involved in crypto in a lot of other ways and have a substantial portfolio relative to my income, just no btc at the moment. Hoping you guys can suggest better ways I can do what I’m doing and just hype me up on the whole plan in general. Thanks in advance!",

While I could create up to 9999 different Seeds all derived from my Master Seed, wouldn’t I just need one? I suppose I could have a different Seed Phrase for each wallet app (Green, Blue, AQUA, Nunchuck, etc.), but in reality it’s probably more efficient to just have the same single Hot Wallet Seed Phrase on all of them. Is there a greater use case to making tons of “child” Seed Phrases?\n\nEdit: And if I were to use the same Seed Phrase on multiple Wallet apps, it’s probably best to just delete the apps I’m not using and just keep it on the one I like best.",

It’s been a journey, and this Saturday, we’ll be celebrating 44 women graduating from our [Bitcoin for Beginners](https://bitfiasi.org/bitcoin-for-beginners/) program, a big leap from the 16 in our first cohort! \n\nThe response has been incredible. More people are already reaching out to be part of the next cohort, and it’s clear that the interest in Bitcoin among women in Ghana is growing fast.\n\nBeyond the classes, I’ve also managed to take Bitcoin education to 4 senior high schools, running workshops to introduce students (especially young women) to Bitcoin, financial sovereignty, and digital assets. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and it’s exciting to see more women eager to explore Bitcoin for savings, business, and long-term financial security.\n\n[This Saturday’s event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bitcoin-the-future-of-money-what-you-need-to-know-tickets-1271382020849) will have over 100 people attending, and it’s already creating a buzz among those looking to start their Bitcoin journey.\n\nI’d love to hear from this community, how do you think I can make this even better and also get support to reach a wider audience? Any ideas on improving outreach, structuring classes, or engaging more women in Bitcoin?\n\nWould appreciate any advice, and happy to share more about what’s working so far!\n\n",

    "selftext": "A wallet provider, Braavos, has introduced a new feature designed to simplify cryptocurrency payments by allowing users to make instant transactions using STRK (with other tokens to come, like stablecoins) at any vendor that accepts Lightning Network payments. This feature integrates directly into the Braavos app, enabling users to scan a QR code and complete payments within seconds, without the need for additional setup or separate accounts.\n\n# The Significance of Lightning Network Payments\n\nBitcoin was originally envisioned as a decentralized digital currency for everyday transactions. However, due to network congestion and transaction fees, Bitcoin has primarily been used for long-term holding rather than daily spending. The Lightning Network was developed as a second-layer solution to address these issues by enabling fast and cost-effective transactions. However, traditional Lightning Network usage often requires users to set up accounts, manage liquidity, and navigate technical challenges.\n\nBraavos aims to remove these barriers by offering a seamless payment experience, and bring in a new existing user base to the Bitcoin ecosystem. With its new feature, users can make Lightning Network transactions with the ease of a conventional payment app.\n\n# How Braavos’ Lightning Network Feature Works\n\nThe feature utilizes the Atomiq bridge, a non-custodial solution that facilitates Starknet-to-Lightning conversions. The payment process consists of four simple steps:\n\n1. **Scan the QR Code** – Users scan the Lightning Network QR code at checkout using the Braavos wallet.\n2. **Choose Your Token** – Payments can be made with STRK, eliminating the need to hold Bitcoin.\n3. **Instant Conversion** – The Atomiq bridge automatically converts STRK to Bitcoin and processes the transaction.\n4. **Transaction Completion** – The vendor receives the payment instantly, similar to any other Lightning transaction.\n\n# Key Differences from Other Lightning Payment Solutions\n\nWhile Lightning Network payments have existed for some time, Braavos offers a more integrated and user-friendly approach. Key advantages include:\n\n* **No Lightning Wallet Setup** – Unlike many Lightning payment solutions that require separate Lightning wallets, Braavos handles this process automatically.\n* **No Need for Liquidity Management** – Users do not need to pre-fund or manage channels, as liquidity is available on demand.\n* **Support for Multiple Assets** – Unlike traditional Lightning wallets that require Bitcoin, Braavos enables payments using STRK, with other tokens to follow.\n* **Low Fees & Fast Transactions** – Transactions are completed in seconds with minimal fees, facilitated by the Atomiq bridge.\n\n# Transaction Fees\n\nA small fee is included with each transaction to cover the costs associated with:\n\n* Asset conversion via the Atomiq bridge.\n* Ongoing maintenance and support to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\nDespite these fees, Braavos’ solution remains a cost-effective option for Lightning Network payments.\n\n# Availability\n\nThe [Braavos](https://braavos.app/introducing-lightning-network-payments-via-braavos-fast-easy-and-cost-effective/) Lightning Network payment feature is available now. Users can utilize it for various transactions, including retail purchases, service payments, and online shopping, wherever Lightning Network payments are accepted.",

Yes I know, \"Keep stacking, keep doing what you can.\" \n\nPeople are asking this question, at least in my opinion, because they want to dream that they are just in time for complete financial freedom. \n\nOf course BTC will, if all trajectories are true it will definitely make life a little easier. Despite all the scarcity and inflation protection, I think people get caught up with multipliers. I'm guilty of it. The 4k Bitcoin days are long gone, but it gave those who invested a 25x gain, from 4k to 100K. If someone does own 0.1 BTC now that same multiplier would (assuming BTC had a current value of 100K) turn ~10K to 250K. \n\nThis is if Bitcoin is at 2.5mil per coin. For anyone dreaming of complete financial freedom, say randomly a 5mil goal, the price of 1 BTC would need to go up 500x to 50mil. \n\nSo my question again, those who own ~0.1 BTC, are they actually early enough for financial freedom?

Those were the days!\n\nTime to create another separate self-custody wallet! Probably a 3/5 multisig. This is certainly KYC coins now. 😐\n\nAnyone else have to go to Bitstamp?",

    "selftext": "# Celebrating the Evolution of Bitcoin: From an Idea to a Global Financial Force\n\nBitcoin has come a long way since its inception in 2009. What started as an experimental digital currency, outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper, has evolved into a revolutionary financial asset that challenges traditional banking, reshapes global economies, and empowers individuals with financial sovereignty.\n\nIn its early days, Bitcoin was misunderstood, dismissed, and often linked to niche internet communities. Its first real-world transaction—10,000 BTC for two pizzas in 2010—seemed insignificant at the time but now stands as a historic milestone. Bitcoin’s value has since skyrocketed, proving that decentralized finance is not only viable but essential in an era of economic uncertainty.\n\nOver time, Bitcoin has weathered volatility, regulatory challenges, and skepticism from the financial elite. It has transformed from a peer-to-peer digital cash system into a store of value, often referred to as \"digital gold.\" Major corporations, institutional investors, and even governments now recognize Bitcoin’s potential, integrating it into portfolios and national economies.\n\nBitcoin’s impact extends beyond wealth accumulation. It provides financial inclusion to millions in countries with unstable currencies. It enables borderless transactions, fights inflation, and ensures transparency in a system controlled by code rather than central authorities. The Lightning Network has further expanded Bitcoin’s usability, making instant transactions possible while reducing costs.",

Their website claims that if you do random + 50 dice rolls , it is a low risk method of generating your seed and the way it is suppose to work is that the dice rolls are suppose to remove every mistake made by the random number generator. I unfortunately saw my hard work money being swept and after reporting it to Coldcard, they blocked me like they have been doing to the other users.\n\nThe funds after an hour went into external wallets: Hacker wallet bc1qa4hrzegkrrq5fmyelma2y3lcs2papk5ee7suns received 3.731 BTC. A similar experience has been encountered by someone who used their mk3 wallets and the drain has happened 6 months after making a deposit. I hired a blockchain expert to analyze my transaction and it appears it has been stolen and after that coinjoins have happened.\n\nColdcard Seed Generation Process I followed \n\na. Select the 12 word option with no dice rolls \n\nb. -Select 4 to mix in rolls into what is randomly generated \n\nc. - Add 50 dice roll values .

Cold wallets, however, are not connected to the internet, offering enhanced security for storing cryptocurrency over long periods.\n\n# Security and Risks\n\nHot wallets are more susceptible to online attacks due to their internet connection, while cold wallets are safer because their private keys are kept offline, reducing the risk of remote hacking. However, cold wallets can be lost, stolen, or damaged, which could lead to loss of funds if not properly backed up.\n\n# Usage and Convenience\n\nHot wallets are ideal for day-to-day transactions and trading, offering quick access. Cold wallets are better suited for holding large amounts of cryptocurrency for extended periods but require additional steps, like connecting a hardware device, to use.\n\n# Unexpected Detail\n\nAn interesting aspect is that some cold wallets, like hardware wallets with Bluetooth, might have connectivity options, potentially reducing their security when in use, though they remain offline when not connected.\n\n# [Detailed Analysis of Cryptocurrency Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets](https://cryptoaskzone.com/how-are-cryptocurrency-hot-wallets-different-from-cold-wallets/)",

But the problem is I don’t have access to the old wallets to prove the source of funds for the majority of it as it was bought a while ago. How would I convert the BTC into cash or money that can be put in the bank when the kyc or source of funds will more then likely be an issue? \n\n\nI live in Canada by the way.

So I’m trying my luck here:\n\nPlease help educate me as I'm interested in MSTR but I have questions that I haven't been able to find answers to.\n\n1. One of the main selling point for Bitcoin versus the dollar is that Bitcoin has a fixed amount and the dollar can be printed out of thin air forever.  Wouldn't this also apply to MSTR shares.  With the recent share count approval, MSTR shares can be printed out of thin air.  And is there a fix cap on these shares because it possible for it to grow again in the future.  If I want to invest in Bitcoin, wouldn't it be better to just buy Bitcoin or the Bitcoin ETF if I don't want to deal with cold storage?\n\n2. Where is the moat? I understand that MSTR provides leveraged exposure to Bitcoin vs a pure Bitcoin ETF but nothing is stopping the next company from copying MSTR.  In fact, Saylor is always working to convince other company to copy MSTR.\n\nThanks in advance for reading.  Looking forward to learning.",

This experience reassured me that CoinDCX is one of the safest platforms for crypto investments in India—they make sure no funds are lost.  \n\nI’m still in the process of recovering the remaining amount, and the team has assured me that it will be sorted out soon.

    "selftext": "Hi all, very newbie question here. \n\nI am slowly trying to overcome my deep fear of putting money in a cold wallet and losing all because of various events. So I am thinking of just starting to play with small amounts, considering the cost of hard wallet etc the cost of, basically, toys I am learning to play with, so that if I get more confident and want to put real money in my cold wallet one day I am already past the learning curve. This means I might, if I do it, spend £400 in cold wallet and seed metal plates and only have £600 in BTC, but I wouldn't care because it's just a kind of toy. \n\nThe way I understand it, the way one proceeds is that one opens an account with a bitcoin exchange (to me it's like a brokerage; say, Fidelity), buys a certain amount in BTC with it, and then transfers this amount (or part of this amount) to his brand new cold wallet. \n\nSo I started to look at Coinbase, and discovered that they require (as would be the case in a brokerage account) my ID to open the account. \n\nI thought the entire point was anonymity? The ID allows the British Government to know when I have opened an account, and what I have bought and transferred (because they have access to all accounts). So they would \\*know\\* that I have XYZ Bitcoin investment, or have bought such and such on this and that day. They might contact me and say, just as an example, \"give a full account of what you have done with your BTC, because we are confiscating BTC/have declared it illegal\". \n\nHow is this different from buying the BTC directly through a broker or through an ETF? Isn't the \"anonymity\" part heavily compromised? \n\nI know I must be missing something here, I just don't know what I don't know... \n\nThanks in advance     \n\n",

I can't seem to find out if the ETF providers' selling is also done OTC. The reason I want to know is because it seems that ETF inflows don't really push the price up, yet it seems when ETFs have a red day - lots of those lately! - it does create downward pressure on BTC price. Surely the ETF providers don't buy OTC, but sell to the market? That would produce only selling pressure until supply shock comes, if it ever does?",

Is it really that widespread?\n\nMy take here is if you reveal your holdings to someone you know (friend, coworker, family member), this might become a much bigger threat than what you do online. It seems commenters tend to exaggerate and fear monger cause if you use cold storage and know well not to click on suspicious links or reply to DMs, you aren’t that vulnerable (the scammer only knows your reddit username or email, maybe I’m missing smth here).\nWhat can they possibly get from you?\n\nBut again, I might not know how sophisticated scammers can be.\nPersonally I’ve never revealed what I own online but I don’t have a problem other people flexing.\nThoughts?",

The data thereby supports the notion that ^XAUUSD can serve as a risk mitigator when $SPX declines sharply, as evidenced by its positive performance during these stress periods.”\n\n“For the five-year period that encompassed the 2008 financial crisis, gold very nearly doubled in value, rallying from just above $825 to north of $1650 per ounce.”\n\nI’ve also heard that bitcoin has a very high correlation with the s&p500, and that bitcoin will not perform well when the overall macro economy is performing poorly.\n\nHowever given that gold has historically done well in recessions and we believe btc to be superior to analogue gold, Im here to ask you all if you are bullish or not on bitcoin even if knowing 100% we were to go into a prolonged recession or depression? It seems we are in uncharted water for btc right now",

Here are some things that no one tells you about Bitcoin. \n\nRegardless, of age, background, career, ethnicity, education, these are all things that no one tells you about Bitcoin as a beginner. \n\n1. Bitcoin is ran by software, and not humans. \n2. Since Bitcoin trades 24/7 it’s actually been running longer than the stock market has. \n3. Bitcoin has never been hacked.\n4. One day, you will have “made” more in a day from Bitcoin than your actual job. \n5. One day, you will have “made” 3x in one day from Bitcoin than working one whole month. \n6. You are fully responsible for your bitcoin, and no one can take it from you without your permission. \n7. You may experience sleepless nights. \n8. You will start connecting dots, and answering your own questions. \n9. You think you know until you don’t. \n10. Don’t time the market. \n11. DCA is your friend. \n12. 1 year in bitcoin feels like 5 years of the stock market. \n13. Bitcoin is not crypto. \n14. You can see, and verify every single transaction on Bitcoin. \n15. Only mention Bitcoin to your family. \n16. Don’t take advice from people not in the spot you want to be in. \n17. Don’t compare yourself to others. \n18. Your time horizon should expand. \n19. Don’t get greedy, it’s not a get rich quick. \n20. Understand what you hold, and keep stacking what you can. \n21. *Save in Bitcoin, speculate with investments.* ",

I just dont see an incentive for people to switch when they could just get 2% cash back and convert the rest to bitcoin for the long term. Its still nice to have the option if two people want to use it (fleeing dictatorships, fighting censorship etc) but again, as the dominate currency, I just do not see a future where bitcoin succeeds and to me thats fine from an investment and philosophical mindset.\n\nIs this also the common sentiment among others?",

How could a free money like bitcoin and its idea of liberalism and therefore free markets take sustainability and fairer distribution of wealth on a global scale into account?\n\nBecause i dont think the best money created will solve our problems if we continue to go on economically like we did in the past centuries.\n\nAre you aware of any books that further elaborate on this topic or do you have a personal opinion on it?

This experience reassured me that CoinDCX is one of the safest platforms for crypto investments in India—they make sure no funds are lost.\n\nI’m still in the process of recovering the remaining amount, and the team has assured me that it will be sorted out soon. I’ll update this post once that happens. But for now, I can confidently say their after-service and customer support are top-notch—10/10!\n\nIf you're looking for a secure and reliable crypto investment platform, I highly recommend CoinDCX.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEarlier post :- \n\nI have been investing in CoinDCX for over a year now and had a significant amount of BTC in my CoinDCX Web3 wallet. Today, when I woke up, I found my wallet completely empty.

How do you deal with the risk? \n\nI can’t wrap my head around living the rest of my life knowing that my XYZ btc - which will be worth way more as the years go by - have been taken away. There’s a guy here in the UK whose girlfriend threw away a removable hard drive, there were like 600 Bitcoin in it. It was little then, he is getting mad now and wants the council to scour the rubbish dump. Just one story. \n\nAs it stands now, I have decided that sufficient security for me to sleep at night would be memorisation of private key in my head and very hard copy on a steel plate in a bank safe. Not cheap, and I would have to anonymise the bank safe address, or have an access that is not a key (the key can be lost or stolen). \n\nCurious to know what your thoughts are, and thanks in advance.

Every 2 weeks I get paid and put half my check into crypto.\n\nHe who shall not be named got elected and while I felt bad that my country would burn and ww3 might vaporize my family, I felt good about my crypto investment.

I am not taken seriously.\n\nMy wife questions my leadership and my performance in bed has suffered.

Many people are hesitant to buy bitcoin and store it themselves for the same reason they dont want to store all their money in a safe inside their house. \n\n  \nTheres also the topic of bitcoin becoming a transact-able currency as opposed to what it is now, a reserve of value. People want a simple way of transacting without risking the balance in their accounts. Its a reason why people like to use credit cards as opposed to debit cards, they know that their bank balance is safe from attacks/scams to their credit card. Even the reserve in the bank accounts has insurance. \n\n  \nI think we are moving in this direction, the release of the bitcoin ETFs has made a safer option of having exposure to bitcoin without the high risk of the custodian rug pulling the client. These institutional companies are more regulated and have a larger client base they need to keep happy, such as union pension funds. \n\n  \nCurrently we have some bitcoin loan services but I think moving forward we may see some mainsteam fintech services, even banks offering bitcoin backed spending accounts.

Essentially making a block **always** approximately 10 minutes away. 5 minutes worth of Bitcoin mining on block #982357 does not make a miner any closer to mining that block, as it's not a progress bar of completion.\n\nOrphaned blocks will be pretty important in this post, these are blocks that the Bitcoin network rejects for a number of reasons, namely submitting the block too late, when the network has already found another solution and moved on.\n\nAlright now we can take the mental leap into this thought experiment.\n\nIf you are several light-minutes away, any block (*or information for that matter*) will take several minutes to arrive back at Earth, as nothing can exceed the speed of light. This means that there is a higher chance of any block you find being orphaned, as it is likely that an Earth-based miner would have announced their correct solution before your solution has a chance to arrive, thus the network has moved on.\n\nThis reduces your **effective hashrate** because only some of your blocks will be accepted. In this post we will calculate effective hashrate as a function of distance.\n\nAt any distance within Earth's bounds, your effective hashrate is essentially equal to real hashrate. But Let's go beyond.\n\nThe probability of mining a successful block is **e****^(-(1/600(d/c)****))**, a negative exponential distribution, where **d** is the distance from the compute network you are, and **c** is the speed of light. This makes the probability of mining an orphaned block the complement of this, or,  **P = 1 - (e****^(-(1/600(d/c)****)))**\n\nPlugging in the Hashrate variables gives us a final equation of:\n\n**Effective Hashrate = Raw Hashrate \\* (e****^(-(1/600(d/c)****)))**\n\nLet's plug in some relatively close (in galactic terms) distances and see how the math works out.\n\n|Distance|Light-Distance|Effective Hashrate|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Earth (0km)|0 seconds|100%|\n|Moon (384,400km)|1.28 seconds|99.8%|\n|Closest Mars (56,000,000km)|186 seconds|69%|\n|Farthest Mars (400,000,000km)|1,320 seconds|3%|\n\nAlright so lets make some sense of these numbers. How can someone be 1,320 light seconds away and still have some effective hashrate, when blocktimes are 10 minutes?\n\nWell I'm sure we've all experienced an unfortunate transaction when the next block takes 30+ minutes to be found. These would essentially be the only blocks that a miner on Mars would be able to contribute to when Mars' is farthest away from Earth in its orbit. Graphed out, looks a little like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sf82e2n5ewne1.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c2ae424a255514fe936b79703ceb279998061a\n\nThis essentially means that you would need **3,333 TH/s** on mars (far) to have the same effective hashrate as someone with just **100 TH/s** on Earth. This decreases throughout the Martian-Earth orbit cycle until they are at their closest, where only **145 TH/s** on mars is necessary to be equivalent to **100 TH/s.** A Martian miner would see their effective hashrate revolve overtime like so:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgfu1zawzwne1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=78814c982f1a179f1b9627c718118eb9995b13d8\n\nNow all of this is a long, long ways off. But it's still interesting to make note of as I always see people talking about Bitcoin as an asset that will last deep into such futures.  A fun little thought experiment.",

We understand that decentralized money/finance is more trustworthy than big bank/big government. And yet, we have to ride these dips on bad macro days. Some days Bitcoin HODLing isn't fun but remember fam, it's the future and at least part of it is OURS!Keep you head up and your stacks offline.\n\n#YOU'RE NOT BULLISH ENOUGH",

    "selftext": "**All hashrate is not equal**. \n\nBold claim, *I know* \\- Yes, we can all talk about how 1 BTC = 1 BTC, but in quite a few scenarios, 1 Terahash does not 1 Terahash. *nominally*, yes, *but in compute power to the network*, no. Lets talk about three situations in which this is the case, each a little more convoluted than the last.\n\n# 1. Hashrate is inflationary.\n\n>Time Value of Hashrate\n\nWhile 1 BTC will always be 1/21,000,000th of the supply, the value of a hash drastically diminishes over time. 1 Terahash ten years ago, would be orders of magnitude more valuable than 1 Terahash today. This makes sense because of how much more abundant hashrate is in 2025. **Just like how one 2010 dollar is worth more than one 2025 dollar, one 2010 hash is worth more than one 2025 hash.**\n\nThis is not a problem at all though, as we all exist in the same moment in time in this god forsaken corporeal realm. As long as we are all on the same level playing field, and 1 hash/second for me is equal to 1 hash/second for you, there's no problem.\n\n# 2. Hashrate is punctual.\n\n>Speed Value of Hashrate\n\nSending your hashes back to your mining pool too late can result in an invalid hash. This is why having a good internet connection can help you get the full potential of your ASIC miners. If you have a spotty internet connection or high ping to your pool, your 100TH antminer could be less productive than someone else's 100TH antminer.\n\n# 3. Hashrate is... here.\n\n>Spatial Value of Hashrate\n\nAbsolutely crazy Kardashev-scale jump, but here is an unfortunate reality. Bitcoin's network hashrate is here, on Earth.\n\n**The value/power of your hashrate,** ***even with zero latency*****, diminishes approximately linearly by 1%**^(☆) **for every 900,000  kilometers** (\\~560,000 miles) away from the the majority of compute power. This is absolutely not an issue for us on earth, which is a fraction of this size. However, far into the future, 900,000 kilometers will be basically nothing for a space-faring civilization. \n\nHow? The speed of light. Consider an ASIC miner 45 million kilometers away from Earth. At this distance, light takes 2.5 minutes to make a oneway trip. This means it would take the miner 2.5 minutes to get the previous block information, and another 2.5 minutes for them to send back valid hashes for the next block. (they would only be able to mine solo, as no pool would accept them probably) With only 10 minutes between blocks, this gives them only 5 minutes to work on the same problem than people on earth have 10 minutes to accomplish. **This effectively puts a valuation of 1 Earth Terahash for every 2 space-man Terahashes**. Even though they both have the same computational power, Mr. Spaceman is at a big disadvantage. At 90 million km away? A round trip is 10 light-minutes long, making all hashrate essentially worthless.\n\nIt's not that far in the grand scheme of things. The average distance to Mars exceeds this figure, and a future civilization there will be out of luck for Bitcoin mining - let alone an eventual civilization beyond the solar system.\n\n  \n^(☆ Not accounting for the realistic standard distribution of block-times, and instead based on a static 10-minute block time.)

    "selftext": "TLDR: Do not invest in alt coins if you are an average investor, you will lose everything or most of it, there is no chance to do it right and avoid millions of tricks, traps and scam that are plaguing the crypto. Do not think that you can be smart about it. Alts is just another tool for whales to siphon assets from average Joes.\n\nI was warned myself by bitcoiners back when I decided to invest in alt coins. I disregarded the warning, I thought those were coming from ignorance. I was wrong.  \nMaybe someone here reads my post, contributing to saving his money, who knows.\n\nI sold everything I had back 2023 and started to gradually buy BTC, average price around 30k. I was fascinated by the technology and, of course, I couldn't avoid exposure to alt coins, as they looked faster, more efficient with greater opportunities and applications. POS vs POW issue was becoming less and less relevant to me. Long story short, I find myself balls deep in altcoins - multiple wallets, airdrop farming, DeFi, and all kinds of crypto channel subscriptions. First few months felt fantastic, anything I bought was in the green. Then came the highs of March-April 2024. And instead of exiting the market with about 40% in profit, I made a dreaded mistake of investing even more. But how would I know, EVERY single crypto channel was buzzing about how this is only the beginning and the trip to the moon has only started. Up to the end of the year my portfolio was in the red. And then came December - the last opportunity to exit the market, not in profit, but at least with moderate losses. And of course I missed it as well. I just couldn't admit the defeat. Because I'm an average noob. And because crypto influencers are not living off the market, they live off you, they live off clicks, adds, payed access, courses and referrals - they are shepherds taking livestock to the slaughterhouse.  \nMost I lost because of poor investment choices, a lot I lost to straight scams (rug pulls, honey pots, etc.), some I lost to liquidations in DeFi protocols. I still have a little saved in BTC, but largely I am broke and have to go back to the soul crushing 9-5 grind for food and shelter. Back to being a poor dumbass.",

Things like family, death of consumption culture, energy abundance... There is a lot of talk about what a Bitcoin world would look like.\n\nOne topic that is surprisingly absent from these discussions is the topic of liberal arts. My guess is that the current meaning of the phrase has been so corrupted by the Fiat system that it has kind of become a symbol for \"the other side\". You hear liberal arts today and you think of a misguided youth who got into debt for a useless college degree and now is angry at capitalism for not giving them the job they feel they deserve...\n\nBut a century ago the phrase had a different meaning. A \"Liberal education\" was an education that one sought not because it was needed for a profession, but simply sought for the persuit of knowledge. It is called \"liberal\" not because the political meaning of the word, but rather because it is \"free\" and not done for any other reason than self betterment.\n\nHistorically, a lot of great artists, poets, writers, philosophers, and so on where able to create their great works because they where not burdened by the same financial pressures we have today. Some where aristocrats themselves and others had wealthy patrons.\n\nWith this in mind. Liberal arts and liberal educations become a lot more interesting from a bitcoiners point of view. In a world where one is no longer a Fiat wage/tax slave, would one be more inclined to create things simply because one wants to add beauty to the world rather than for it to be sold as a commercial product?\n\nCommunists and Marxists often talk about these things but fail to recognize the fact that they would surrender their freedom of creation to a central planner instead of being free to express themselves in a permissionless way.\n\n...

    "selftext": "The first time I heard about Bitcoin was back in high school, around 2010. It was mostly in the context of the Silk Road and other obscure corners of the internet. I remember stumbling across websites that would reward you with fractions of Bitcoin just for watching ads—worth mere pennies at the time, but today, those tiny fractions would be worth hundreds of dollars.  \n\nMy first Bitcoin purchase was just for fun on Mt. Gox. I threw in maybe $20 or $50—definitely less than $100 per BTC. That purchase sparked my curiosity, and I started binge-reading everything I could find about blockchain technology. It fascinated me, especially since I leaned libertarian and supported small government. But back then, Bitcoin was confusing, impractical, and barely accepted anywhere. It felt more like a speculative gamble than anything revolutionary.  \n\nAn older sibling of mine had some BTC at the time but lost the password to their exchange wallet. (Probably just leftover funds from Silk Road purchases #420)  \n\nCollege Years: The First Bitcoin Boom  \n\nFast forward to 2011, and I started hearing more about Bitcoin as the price fluctuated. But it was mostly background noise while I focused on college. When I visited home, friends would talk about how they \"missed the boat\" when BTC hit $600. I felt the same way.  \n\nThen in 2014, Mt. Gox collapsed. I had completely forgotten about the small fraction of BTC I had sitting on the exchange. When it went bankrupt, I lost faith in Bitcoin. If the only way to buy and store BTC was on shady exchanges that could get hacked or mismanage funds, what was the point? At the time, I didn’t know about cold storage, and hardware wallets weren’t even widely available yet.  \n\nLooking back, my understanding was still shallow. It was hard to find clear, digestible explanations of Bitcoin, and information was scattered across niche forums and technical whitepapers.  \n\n2017: The Bull Market That Hooked Me  \n\nAfter graduating college, I got my first job in 2017. That’s when I started hearing about Bitcoin again—this time from my colleagues. The 2017 bull run was all over the news as BTC broke $10,000 for the first time.  \n\nThis time, I took Bitcoin seriously. I spent over 100-200 hours deep-diving into the technology, and by the time I was done, I was hooked. Learning about Bitcoin in 2017 was infinitely easier than in 2010 or 2011—there were explainers, debates, YouTube channels, and books.  \n\nWith all the hype, I made my first significant investment—just a few thousand dollars, but enough to matter to me. You probably know what happened next: the market corrected, Bitcoin entered a multi-year bear market, and I eventually sold at a loss after two years.  \n\n2020: The Next Bull Run and My Second Deep-Dive  \n\nI forgot about Bitcoin again until late 2020 when another bull market kicked off. Suddenly, BTC was hitting new all-time highs, and I was drawn back in.  \n\nBy this point, I had already spent over 100 hours learning about Bitcoin in the past, so I wasn’t starting from scratch. But this time, I went even deeper—probably dedicating another 300–400 hours. I was in a new job, had just moved states, and was completely obsessed. I binged every Bitcoin-related video, debate, and explainer I could find. My wife was sick of hearing me talk about it.  \n\nDetermined not to repeat my 2017 mistake, I started dollar-cost averaging—$100 per week, every week. It was going great until I started listening to the wrong people. Specifically, a YouTuber named Gareth Soloway. He convinced me that Bitcoin was going to crash to $20K, so I held off. When it dropped to $28K, he said it was going lower—maybe $14K. I waited. It never happened. BTC rebounded to $60K, then corrected to $43K, then $30K. I was still trying to time the market instead of just stacking and holding.  \n\n2024: The Turning Point  \n\nBear markets have this weird way of making me forget about Bitcoin. After the 2022 crash, I tuned out again—until March 2024, when BTC hit a new all-time high above $70K.  \n\nYou probably see the pattern by now: every time Bitcoin pumps, I go deep into research. But this time, I took it further. I spent the most time out of any deep-dive: at least 500–600 hours studying Bitcoin, reading books like *The Bitcoin Standard* and *Thank God for Bitcoin*, and listening to the entire Michael Saylor series with Robert Breedlove.  At this point I believe I passed the 1000 hour threshold of learning about BTC.\n\nI realized I never wanted to let another \"expert\" like Gareth Soloway shake my conviction again. So, I made the biggest move of my life—I bought my first whole Bitcoin at a $50K cost basis and moved it straight to cold storage. I made a promise: I will not even *think* about selling for at least 20 years. (2045)\n\nThen, as Bitcoin climbed to $90K, I bought my second BTC. When the price dipped after that, I didn’t panic. I had seen this too many times before.  \n\nReflections\n\nI get frustrated when friends dismiss Bitcoin with the same misconceptions I once had. They’ll say things like:  \n\n- “It has an infinite supply, just like fiat.” (Not realizing Bitcoin is hard-capped at 21 million.)  \n- “I don’t trust it—it gets hacked all the time.” (Confusing Bitcoin’s network security with centralized exchanges getting hacked.)  \n- “Only major corporations and whales own it.” (When in reality, everyday retail investors hold the majority of Bitcoin.)  \n\nThe ironic part? --They’re me, 5 or 10 years ago. I used to think Bitcoin was just internet magic money, a passing trend, or worse—a scam. Now, after years of learning, I see the fundamental shift it represents. I try to explain it to them, but I know that real conviction only comes from personal discovery.  \n\nThat’s what makes Bitcoin different. It forces you to challenge your assumptions, do your own research, and develop true conviction.\n\nLessons Learned  \n\n**Knowledge brings conviction. Experience brings fortitude.**  \n\nI’ve been in and out of Bitcoin for over a decade. I’ve watched it crash, rally, and crash again. I’ve made mistakes—selling too early, listening to the wrong voices, trying to time the market. But each cycle, I learned.  \n\nNow, I don’t chase price action. I don’t try to time the dips. I just buy, hold, and secure my Bitcoin for the long haul.  \n\nBecause in the end, Bitcoin isn’t just an investment. It’s a revolution. \n\n",

However, I’m struggling to understand the hype around “generational wealth” that people often mention here. Is that really achievable for average folks who can only stack smaller amounts, especially now that Bitcoin’s price is already high?\n\nIf someone owns about 0.1 BTC today, even if Bitcoin hits $1 million per coin in 10-15 years (which would already be an incredible scenario), they’d still only end up with around $100,000. Don’t get me wrong, $100,000 is a lot of money, particularly for someone in a developing country. But realistically, that isn’t the life changing, early retirement amount that I keep hearing about.\n\nIf a regular person stacks roughly $100 to $300 each month, how far could Bitcoin realistically take them over the next 10 or 20 years? Is it more practical to think of Bitcoin as just a good way to protect against inflation rather than expecting it to provide life changing wealth?\n\nI’m curious to hear realistic experiences and opinions from people who’ve stacked consistently over the years, especially those who started small. Has your perspective changed about what’s possible with Bitcoin? What’s a realistic long term goal for regular stackers today?\n\nThanks!",

Right before the market crashed (i was not aware at all that anything was happening with crypto this big) i got $2000 payment in BTC when it was 95k. I was of course asleep when i got the BTC. Woke up and my shi was now 1900 or 1850 because the price dropped to sub 90k. I panicked and started joining crypto subs to try and understand what should i do. \n\n\nBTC then went to 92k but i got greedy and wanted to go out without a loss. That was a mistake and now Btc is reaching sub 80k. Obviously i know BTC long-term is gonna be waaay higher. But right now i can't afford time.\n\nI honestly have one idea that will probably not work but here it goes. \n\nIf there are crypto bros out there that 0.02 BTC is pocket change for you, please help a guy out and buy me out for my original worth 😭.\n\n\nLong shot obviously so I'd also appreciate anyone with better understanding in the market than me to tell me if there's any logical way for me to get out of this situation without loosing money (my loss is worth a months salary in my country🤣)",

Medical emergencies, job losses, and unexpected expenses can hit anytime.\n\nStay calm, breathe, and live your life—especially if this is your first cycle. Take the time to truly understand Bitcoin. Bear markets will test both your conviction and your knowledge. Good luck, everyone!",

    "selftext": "\nWall Street plays with something called futures, which are bets on what Bitcoin’s price will be later—like in two weeks. \n\nWith futures, you don’t need to own Bitcoin; you just promise to sell it at today’s price ($82,000 right now) and hope it drops so you can buy it back cheaper and pocket the difference.\n\nHere’s how it goes: Hedge funds make a big futures bet, “selling” thousands of Bitcoin at $82,000 on paper. \n\nThen, they push the real price down by selling some Bitcoin fast on exchanges or spreading rumors (like “ETFs are slowing!”). This panics smaller traders who borrowed money to bet on Bitcoin going up. \n\nWhen the price falls to $80,000 or $79,000, those traders get forced to sell, and it crashes harder—say, down to $77,000.\n\nWhile the price is low, the funds quietly buy real Bitcoin through private deals (not on public exchanges) at $77,000. Then, they close their futures bet by “buying” back the Bitcoin they promised to sell, but at $77,000. \n\nThey make a profit ($5,000 per Bitcoin) and keep the Bitcoin they snagged cheap.\n\nSo, they use futures to tank the price, scare everyone out, and grab Bitcoin at a discount—all while making money on the drop. That’s how the price can fall even when they’re secretly loading up for the long run.\n\nIf we want the big boys to buy we need to play big boy games. \n\nMoral. Keep some powder dry for opportunities like this and remember they aren’t trying to crash it to zero. They’re trying to buy the bags from paper handed pussies.  \n\n",
